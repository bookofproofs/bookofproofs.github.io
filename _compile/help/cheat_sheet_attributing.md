# Attributing

All contents hosted at https://bookofproofs.github.io/ are licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0. This also applies 
to all its markdown source files located in the `_sources` folder of this repository.

Whenever you create a new or change an existing page somewhere in `_sources`, you have to attribute these contents: 

## Attributing to Yourself

Add the username of your Github profile to the front matter at the property 

    contributors: <your-github-user-name>

If there are already other contributors listed in the file, put your name _to the end_ of this list.

It is recommended to use your Github username, since this will place your avatar in the published list of contributors of the 
corresponding pages located at https://bookofproofs.github.io/.

## Attributing to Other Authors

If you are deriving your content from other sources licenced under CC-BY-SA-4.0, you have to attribute them also. 
In general, such authors will not have a Github user name. In this case, by convention, put an `@` at the front of the 
name of such author. All attributed authors have to be separated by a comma.

    contributors: <your-github-user-name>, @OtherAuthor
