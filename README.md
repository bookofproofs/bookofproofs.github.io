# How is this repository structured?

The public website https://bookofproofs.github.io/ is deployed using [Github Pages][gp] from this repository's `doc` subfolder.
All other folders are auxiliary:
* In the `_sources` folder, you will find the sources of the webpages in a markdown format.  
* In the `_compile` folder, you will find Python scripts needed to compile the markdown format to HTML and write it into the `doc` subfolder. Before submitting a pull request, you will need these scripts to test your contributions locally.
