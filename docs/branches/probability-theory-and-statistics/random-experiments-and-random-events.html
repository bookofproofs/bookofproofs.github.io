<h1>Definition: Random Experiments and Random Events</h1>
<p>A <strong>random experiment</strong> is an experiment with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is known, which outcomes it has, before it takes place, but </li>
<li>is is generally unknown, which outcome it will have, until the experiment took place, and</li>
<li>it is possible to find out, which outcome the experiment had after it took place.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/set-set-element-empty-set-cantor.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Set, Set Element, Empty Set">set</a> of all outcomes is called <strong>probability space</strong> and denoted by \(\Omega\).</p>
<p>Any <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/subset-superset.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Subset and Superset">subset</a> \(F\subseteq \Omega\) of outcomes is called a <strong>random event</strong> or just <strong>event</strong>. We denote events, using Latin capital letters \(A,B,C,\ldots\).</p>
