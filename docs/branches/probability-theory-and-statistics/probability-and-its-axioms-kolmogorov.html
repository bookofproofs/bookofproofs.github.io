<h1>Definition: Probability and its Axioms</h1>
<p>A <strong>probability</strong> is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/partial-total-maps.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Partial and Total Maps (Functions)">function</a> of the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/probability-theory-and-statistics/random-experiments-and-random-events.html" title="Probability Theory And Statistics / Definition: Random Experiments and Random Events">probability space</a> to <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/definition-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Definition of Real Numbers">real numbers</a> (i.e. \(p:\Omega\mapsto \mathbb R\)), fulfilling the following axioms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1)  For all \(A\subseteq \Omega\), the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/probability-theory-and-statistics/probability-as-a-non-negative-number-kolmogorov-1933.html" title="Probability Theory And Statistics / Axiom: Probability as a Non-Negative Number">probability of any event is a non-negative real number</a>: 
\[p(A)\ge 0.\] </p>
<p>(2)  The <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/probability-theory-and-statistics/probability-of-the-certain-event-kolmogorov-1933.html" title="Probability Theory And Statistics / Axiom: Probability of the Certain Event">probability of the certain event</a> (i.e. the event that any event from the considered probability space occurs) equals \(1\).
\[p(\Omega)=1\]</p>
<p>(3)  The probability of the union event (i.e. the event that any individual event occurs) of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/countable-set-uncountable-set.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Countable Set, Uncountable Set">countably many</a> events \(A_1,A_2,\ldots\in\Omega \), which are <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/probability-theory-and-statistics/mutually-exclusive-and-collectively-exhaustive-events.html" title="Probability Theory And Statistics / Definition: Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive Events">mutually exclusive</a>, equals <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/probability-theory-and-statistics/addition-of-the-probability-of-mutually-exclusive-events-kolmogorov-1933.html" title="Probability Theory And Statistics / Axiom: Addition of the Probability of Mutually Exclusive Events">the sum of their individual probabilities</a>: \[p(A_1\cup \ldots\cup A_n\cup\ldots)=p(A_1)+\ldots +p(A_n)+\ldots\].</p>
