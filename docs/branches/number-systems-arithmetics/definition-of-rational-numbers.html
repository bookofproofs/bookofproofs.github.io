<hr>

<h1>Proposition: Definition of Rational Numbers</h1>
<p>Let \((a,b),(c,d)\) be <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/ordered-pair-n-tuple.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Ordered Pair, n-Tuple">ordered pairs</a> of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/definition-of-integers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Definition of Integers">integers</a>, such that \(b\) and \(d\) do not equal the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/existence-of-integer-zero-neutral-element-of-addition-of-integers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Existence of Integer Zero (Neutral Element of Addition of Integers)">integer number zero</a> \(0\).  We consider the pairs \((a,b),(c,d)\) equivalent, if the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/multiplication-of-integers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Multiplication of Integers">integer products</a> \(a\cdot d\) and \(b\cdot c\) are equal, formally</p>
<p>\[(a,b)\sim (c,d)\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad a\cdot d = b\cdot c.\]</p>
<p>The relation "\(\sim\)" defined above is an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/equivalence-relation.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Equivalence Relation">equivalence relation</a>, i.e. for a given ordered pair \((a,b)\in\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z\setminus\{0\}\), we can consider a whole set of ordered pairs \((c,d)\in\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z\setminus\{0\}\) equivalent to \((a,b)\):</p>
<p>\[x:=\{(c,d)\in\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z\setminus\{0\}:\quad( c, d )\sim ( a, b )\}\quad\quad ( * )\]</p>
<p>The set<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> \(x\) is called a <strong>rational number</strong>. We say that the ordered pair \((a,b)\in\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z\setminus\{0\}\) is <strong>representing</strong> the rational number \(x\). It is called a <strong>fraction</strong> or a <strong>ratio</strong>. Usually, we denote the fraction \((a,b)\) by \(\frac ab\). The integer \(a\) is called the <strong>nominator</strong> and the integer \(b\) is called the <strong>denominator</strong> of the fraction \(\frac ab\). The set of all rational numbers is denoted by \(\mathbb Q\).</p>
<p>A more common notation for the ordered pairs in \( ( * ) \) using ratios is</p>
<p>\[x:=\left\{\frac cd: \quad \frac cd\sim \frac ab,~b,d\neq 0\right\}.\]</p>

<p>Please note that rational numbers are in fact sets. The set \(\mathbb Q\) is the set of "all fractions": the same rational number can be represented by different fractions, especially if we multiply the nominators and denominators by a non-zero integer, e.g. \(\frac 12=\frac 24=\frac 5{10}=\ldots\). Since all these different fractions are equal, they represent the same rational number.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
