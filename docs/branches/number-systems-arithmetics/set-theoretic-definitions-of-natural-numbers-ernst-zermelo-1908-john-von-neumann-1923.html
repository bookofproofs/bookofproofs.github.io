<hr>

<h1>Definition: Set-theoretic Definitions of Natural Numbers</h1>
<p>The set of <strong>natural numbers</strong> \(\mathbb N\) is defined using the concept <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/ordinal-number.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Ordinal Number">ordinals</a>, as follows:</p>
<h3>Definition due to von Neumann (1923)</h3>
<p>(1) The empty set (as the first ordinal)<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> represents the first natural number:</p>
<p>\[0:=\{\emptyset\}.\]</p>
<p><img alt="axiom2" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/axiom2.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p>(2) Once we have the ordinal \(n=\alpha\), we can construct a bigger ordinal<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> using recursively the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/successor-of-ordinal.html" title="Set Theory / Lemma: Successor of Ordinal">formula for constructing successors of ordinals</a>, denoting the successor \(n^+\) of the natural number \(n\):
\[n^+:=s(\alpha):=\alpha\cup\{\alpha\}=n\cup \{n\}.\]
Applying the set axioms and this construction systematically, it gives us a chain of ordered ordinals </p>
<p>\[\begin{array}{rcl}0&amp;:=&amp;\emptyset,\\1&amp;:=&amp;0\cup\{0\}=\emptyset\cup\{\emptyset\}=\{\emptyset\},\\2&amp;:=&amp;1\cup\{1\}=\{\emptyset\}\cup\{\{\emptyset\}\}=\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\},\\3&amp;:=&amp;2\cup\{2\}=\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}\cup\{\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}\}=\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}\},\\&amp;\vdots&amp;\\n^+&amp;:=&amp;n\cup\{n\},\\&amp;\vdots&amp;\end{array}\]</p>
<p>which can be visualized in the following figure</p>
<p><img alt="axiom8" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/axiom8.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p>and for which we introduce the notation \(0,1,2,3,\ldots\):</p>
<p>\[0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3 &lt; \ldots\]</p>
<p>Due to the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/axiom-of-infinity.html" title="Set Theory / Axiom: Axiom of Infinity">axiom of infinity</a> we can postulate the existence of an infinite set, which is "contains" all such sets.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> </p>
<p>\[\mathbb N:=\bigcup n=\{0,1,2,3,\ldots.\}\]</p>
<h3>Definition due to Ernst Zermelo (1908)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/set-set-element-empty-set-cantor.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Set, Set Element, Empty Set">set</a> \(\mathbb N\) of natural numbers is defined recursively by: \[\begin{array}{rcl}0&amp;:=&amp;\emptyset,\\1&amp;:=&amp;\{0\}=\{\emptyset\},\\2&amp;:=&amp;\{1\}=\{\{\emptyset\}\},\\3&amp;:=&amp;\{2\}=\{\{\{\emptyset\}\}\},\\&amp;\vdots&amp;\\n^+&amp;:=&amp;\{n\}=\underbrace{\{\ldots\{ }_{n+1\text{ times}}\emptyset\underbrace{\}\ldots\} }_{n+1\text{ times}},\\&amp;\vdots&amp;\\\end{array}\]</p>
<p>This definition can be visualized as follows:</p>

\[\alpha &lt; \beta:\Leftrightarrow \alpha\in\beta.\]
For any two ordinals, and in particular for natural numbers, we can therefore always decide which one is "bigger", "smaller", or whether they are equal to each other.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

However, we have not built by the above construction formula, i.e. it is not a successor of any "previous" ordinal.
