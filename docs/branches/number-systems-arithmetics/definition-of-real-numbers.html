<hr>

<h1>Proposition: Definition of Real Numbers</h1>
<p>Let \((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\), \((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\) be <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/rational-cauchy-sequence.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Rational Cauchy Sequence">rational Cauchy sequences</a>. We call them equivalent, if their difference is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/convergent-rational-sequence.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Convergent Rational Sequence">convergent</a> to \(0\), formally</p>
<p>\[(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\sim(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad \lim_{n\to\infty } (y_n-x_n) =0\]</p>
<p>The relation "\(\sim\)" defined above is an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/equivalence-relation.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Equivalence Relation">equivalence relation</a>, i.e. for a given rational Cauchy sequence \((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\) we can consider a whole set of rational Cauchy sequences \((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\) equivalent to \((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\):</p>
<p>\[x:=\{(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\text{ is a rational Cauchy sequence},~ (y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\sim (x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\}\quad\quad ( * )\]</p>
<p>The set<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> \(x\) is called a <strong>real number</strong>, and the rational Cauchy sequence \((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\) is called a <em>representation<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> of the real number</em>. The set of all real numbers is denoted by \(\mathbb R\).</p>
<p>For practical purposes, \( ( * ) \) it equivalent with the notation</p>
<p>\[x:=(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I, \]
where \(I\) is the set of all rational sequences convergent to \(0\).</p>
