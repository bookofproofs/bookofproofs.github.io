<h1>Part: Real Numbers</h1>
<h3>Motivation for the set of real numbers \(\mathbb R\)</h3>
<p>In the set of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/rational-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Part: Rational Numbers">rational numbers</a> \(\mathbb Q=\left\{q:=\frac xy, x\in \mathbb Z, y\in \mathbb Z\setminus\{0\}\right\}\) it is possible to solve any linear equation of the form</p>
<p>\[ax + b = c,\quad\quad a,b,c\in\mathbb Q,~a\neq 0.\]</p>
<p>The major motivation for further extending the realm of numbers is the solvability of the equation
\[x^2=a,~~~~~~~(a\in \mathbb Q, a &gt; 0)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~( * )\]
which cannot be always solved by a rational number. For instance, while \(x^2=\frac {25}{16}\) has the two rational solutions \(x_1=\frac 54,~x_2=-\frac 54\), there is no rational solution of the equation \(x^2=2\), which was <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/discovery-of-irrational-numbers-hippasus-of-metapontum-5th-century-bc.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Discovery of Irrational Numbers">discovered in 5th century BC in Ancient Greece</a>.
The main reason for the generally missing solution of the equation \(( * )\) is the topological structure of rational numbers \((\mathbb Q, + ,\cdot)\). On the one hand, rational numbers are a <strong>dense set</strong>, that is for any rational number \(q\in\mathbb Q\) and for any rational \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) (no matter how small), there exists at least another rational number \(p\) such that the distance between \(p\) and \(q\) is smaller then \(\epsilon\), formally \(|q - p| &lt; \epsilon\). On the other hand, there are surprisingly many "gaps between" rational numbers. One such gap is the solution of  \(( * )\) and there 
are infinitely many others, called <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/irrational-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Part: Irrational Numbers">irrational numbers</a>. What is even more surprising from the topological point of view, the cardinality of the rational numbers is, (in some strict sense called <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/what-does-countability-mean.html" title="Set Theory / Proof: What does countability mean? (related to Proposition: Real Numbers are Uncountable)">countability</a>), smaller then the cardinality of the irrational numbers. The rational numbers, together with the irrational numbers, constitute the set of real numbers.</p>
<p>If \(a &gt; 0\) is any real number, then the equation  \(( * )\) has always two real numbers as solutions. This is why: Consider the sequence \((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\) of real numbers  </p>
<p>\[\begin{array}{ll}
x_0 &gt; 0 \in\mathbb Q\quad\text{(arbitrarily chosen)}\\
x_{n+1}:=\frac 12\left(x_n +  \frac a{x_n}\right)
\end{array}\]</p>
<p>It can be easily shown that this sequence is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/monotonic-sequences.html" title="Analysis / Definition: Monotonic Sequences">monotonically decreasing</a> and <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/bounded-real-sequences-upper-and-lower-bounds-for-a-real-sequence.html" title="Analysis / Definition: Bounded Real Sequences, Upper and Lower Bounds for a Real Sequence">bounded</a> and as such, it is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/every-bounded-monotonic-sequence-is-convergent.html" title="Analysis / Theorem: Every Bounded Monotonic Sequence Is Convergent">convergent in the set of real numbers</a>. The limit is called the <strong>square root</strong> of the number \(a\) and denoted by \(\sqrt a\). Because \((-\sqrt a)^2=(\sqrt a)^2\), also \(-\sqrt a\) is a solution of \( ( * ) \). Thus, the equation \( ( * ) \) is always solvable and has at two real solutions: \(x_1=\sqrt a,~x_2=-\sqrt a\).</p>
