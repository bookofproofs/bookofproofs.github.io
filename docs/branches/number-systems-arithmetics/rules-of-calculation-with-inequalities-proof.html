<h1>Proof</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/rules-of-calculations-with-inequalities.html'>Corollary: Rules of Calculations with Inequalities</a>)</p>
<p><em>Proof of Rule 1)</em> For any \(x\neq 0\) it is \(x \cdot x &gt;0\).
This is a consequence from the rules of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/multiplying-negative-and-positive-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Multiplying Negative and Positive Real Numbers">multiplying positive and negative real numbers</a>.
<em>Proof of Rule 2)</em> \(1 &gt; 0 \).
From the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/uniqueness-of-real-one.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Uniqueness of Real One">uniqueness of 1</a> and the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/uniqueness-of-real-zero.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Uniqueness of Real Zero">uniqueness of 0</a>, it follows that \(1 \neq 0\). Therefore, according to the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/order-relation-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Order Relation of Real Numbers">definition of order relation</a>, it must be either \(1 &gt; 0\) or \(-1 &gt; 0\). Since \(1\cdot 1 =1\) , it must be \(1 &gt; 0 \), according to the rule Rule 1). </p>
<p><em>Proof of Rule 3)</em>  From \(x &gt; y\) it follows that \(x+a &gt; y+a\) for any \(a\in\mathbb R\). 
(The rule is analogously valid and proven for any inequalities with "\( &lt; \)" in between).
\(x &gt; y\) means, by definition, that \(x - y &gt; 0\). Therefore, it is \(x - y + a - a &gt; 0\), and so it follows that \(x + a  - (y + a) &gt; 0\), and finally that \(x + a &gt; y + a \).  </p>
<p><em>Proof of Rule 4)</em>  If \(x &gt; y\) and \(a &gt; b\), then it follows that \(x+a &gt; y+b\).
(The rule is analogously valid and proven for any inequalities with "\( &lt; \)" in between).
By definition, it is \( x - y &gt; 0 \) and \( a - b &gt; 0 \). From the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/order-relation-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Order Relation of Real Numbers">definition of order relation</a>, it follows that \( (x - y) + (a -b) &gt; 0\), which by definition results in \(x + a &gt; y + b\).</p>
<p><em>Proof of Rule 5)</em> Transitivity of the "\( &lt; \)" (analogously the "\( &gt; \)" relation)
If \(x &lt; y\) and \(y &lt; z\), then by definition it is \(0 &lt; y - x\) and \(0 &lt; z - y\). From the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/order-relation-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Order Relation of Real Numbers">definition of order relation</a>, it follows that \( 0 &lt; y - x + z - y= z - x\), which by definition results in \(x &lt; z\).</p>
<p><em>Proof of Rule 6)</em> The inequality \(x &gt; y\) does not change, if it is multiplied by any number \(a &gt; 0\), i.e. it is \(ax &gt; ay\). 
(The rule is analogously valid and proven for an inequalities with "\( &lt; \)" in between). 
By definition, it is \(x -y  &gt; 0\). From the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/order-relation-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Order Relation of Real Numbers">definition of order relation</a>, it follows that \( a(x-y)  = ax - ay &gt; 0\), which, by definition, results in \(ax &gt; ay\).</p>
<p><em>Proof of Rule 7)</em> The inequality \(x &gt; y\) changes, if it is multiplied by any number \(a &lt; 0\), i.e. it is \(ax &lt; ay\). (The rule is analogously valid and proven for an inequality with "\( &lt; \)" in between, which then changes into "\( &gt; \)"). By definition, it is \(x - y  &gt; 0\) and \(-a &gt; 0\). From the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/order-relation-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Order Relation of Real Numbers">definition of order relation</a>, it follows that \( (-a)(x-y)  = -ax + ay &gt; 0\), which, by definition, results in \(ay &gt; ax\), and finally in \(ax &lt; ay\).</p>
<p><em>Proof of Rule 8)</em>  If \(x &gt; 0\), then \(x^{-1} &gt; 0\).
It is \(x^{-1}=x^{-1}\cdot 1=x^{-1}\cdot(x^{-1}\cdot x) =(x^{-1}\cdot x^{-1})\cdot x\), which is greater then \(0\), following the precondition, the Rule 1) and the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/order-relation-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Order Relation of Real Numbers">definition of order relation</a>.</p>
<p><em>Proof of Rule 9)</em>  If \(x &lt; 0\), then \(x^{-1} &lt; 0\).
It is \(x^{-1}=x^{-1}\cdot 1=x^{-1}\cdot(x^{-1}\cdot x) =(x^{-1}\cdot x^{-1})\cdot x\), which is smaller then \(0\), following the precondition, the Rule 1) and the Rule 7).</p>
<p><em>Proof of Rule 10)</em> If \(y &gt; x &gt; 0\), then \(x^{-1} &gt; y^{-1} \).
(The rule is analogously valid and proven for the inequality \(0 &lt; x &lt; y\), resulting in \(y^{-1} &lt; x^{-1}\)).
According to the precondition \(x\) and \(y\) are both positive. Therefore, it follows from the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/order-relation-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Order Relation of Real Numbers">definition of order relation</a> that \(xy &gt; 0\), and according to Rule 8) \((xy)^{-1} &gt; 0\). Multiplying the inequality \(y &gt; x\) by the number \((xy)^{-1}\) does not change the inequality by Rule 6), therefore \(y(xy)^{-1} &gt; x (xy)^{-1}\). This is equivalent to \(x^{-1} &gt; y^{-1}\).</p>
<p><em>Proof of Rule 11)</em> If \(0 \le x &lt; y\) and \(0 \le a &lt; b\)  then \(ax &lt; by\).
(The rule is analogously valid and proven for \(by &gt; ax\), following from \(y &gt; x \ge 0\) and \(b &gt; a \ge 0\)).
The argument is valid, if \(x=0\) or \(a=0\), since then \(0 &lt; by\) follows from the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/order-relation-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Order Relation of Real Numbers">definition of order relation</a>. So assume \(0 &lt; x &lt; y\) and \(0 &lt; a &lt; b\). In this case we have \(ax &lt; ay\) and \(ay &lt; by\), following in both cases from the Rule 6. The argument follows now from the transitivity (Rule 5)).<div class='qed'>&#8718;</div></p>
