<h1>Chapter: Real Numbers As Limits Of Rational Numbers</h1>
<p>Instead of defining real numbers out of the blue simply postulating their existence and accepting their properties as axioms, like it is often done in literature, we prefer to construct them from <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/rational-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Part: Rational Numbers">rational numbers</a>, which we have introduced in the previous part. In this chapter, we will prepare some technical prerequisites in order to do that. In particular, we want to show that <em>real numbers</em> can be defined as <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/sequences-and-limits.html" title="Topology / Chapter: Sequences and Limits">limits</a> of certain <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/sequence.html" title="Topology / Definition: Sequence">sequences</a> of rational numbers, and that these limits not only exist but also are unique, even though the rational sequence tending to this sequence is replaced by another one. </p>
<p>With this respect, we will find that <em>real numbers</em> can be defined as <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/equivalence-class.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Equivalence Class">equivalence classes</a> of sequences of rational numbers tending to the same limit. The technical prerequisites required for this interpretation of <em>real numbers</em> are <em>rational Cauchy sequences</em>, which we will introduce shortly. First, we start with explaining what <em>rational sequences</em> are, then what <em>rational Cauchy sequences</em> are and how we can add and multiply them with each other, in particular, that they form a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/ring.html" title="Algebra / Definition: (Unit) Ring">ring</a>. Finally, we will show that <em>rational Cauchy sequences</em> tending to $0$ are an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/ideals.html" title="Algebra / Section: Ideals">ideal</a> of this ring. This ideal will finally enable us to define <em>real numbers</em>.</p>
