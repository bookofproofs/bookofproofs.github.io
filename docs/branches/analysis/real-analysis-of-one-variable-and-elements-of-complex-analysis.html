<hr>

<h1>Part: Real Analysis of One Variable and Elements of Complex Analysis</h1>
<p>This part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong> deals with the analysis of real-valued (and whenever applicable also complex-valued) functions with one variable, i.e. the functions of the form $f:\mathbb R\mapsto \mathbb R$ or $f:\mathbb C\mapsto \mathbb C,$ $x\mapsto f(x)$. 
Using the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/introduction.html" title="Branches / Branch: Introduction to the Axiomatic Method">axiomatic method</a>, it systematically derives some basic concepts like <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/sequences-and-limits.html" title="Topology / Chapter: Sequences and Limits">sequences and limits</a>, <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/infinite-series-overview.html" title="Analysis / Chapter: Infinite Series - Overview">infinite series</a>, and basic properties of functions. </p>
<p>Although there is another part dedicated solely to complex analysis, in which you can find deeper results applicable for complex numbers only, there are lots of concepts that are applicable for both, <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/definition-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Definition of Real Numbers">real</a> ($\mathbb R$) and <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/definition-of-complex-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Definition of Complex Numbers">complex</a> ($\mathbb C$) numbers, or even <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/definition-of-rational-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Definition of Rational Numbers">rational numbers</a> ($\mathbb Q$), <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/definition-of-integers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Definition of Integers">integers</a> ($\mathbb Z$) or <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/set-theoretic-definitions-of-natural-numbers-ernst-zermelo-1908-john-von-neumann-1923.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Set-theoretic Definitions of Natural Numbers">natural numbers</a> ($\mathbb N$). In order to avoid unnecessary repetition of basic concepts, we will introduce them only once in this part. Whenever a theorem or definition can be used in the domain of the respective number system, we will use a marker </p>
<blockquote>
<p>applicability: $\mathbb {N, Z, Q, R , C}$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>listing all number system, it s applicable to.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Theoretical minimum (in a nutshell)</h3>
<p>Ideally, you should be already acquainted with the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two basic operations defined for the real numbers $\mathbb R$, i.e. the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/addition-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Addition of Real Numbers">addition</a> "$+$" and the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/multiplication-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Multiplication of Real Numbers">multiplication</a> "$\cdot$". </li>
<li>Together with these two operations, the real numbers form an algebraic structure $(\mathbb R, +,\cdot)$, called the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/algebraic-structure-of-real-numbers-together-with-addition-and-multiplication.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Algebraic Structure of Real Numbers Together with Addition and Multiplication">field of real numbers</a>. In a nutshell, this means that all calculations involving real numbers, let's call them $x,y,z\in\mathbb R$, obey the following rules:<ul>
<li>The addition is <em>associative</em> $(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)$ and <em>commutative</em> $x+y=y+x$.</li>
<li>The multiplication is <em>associative</em> $(x\cdot y)\cdot z=x\cdot (y\cdot z)$ and <em>commutative</em> $x\cdot y=y\cdot x$.</li>
<li>There is a unique real number, called <em>zero</em> and denoted by $0$, which is neutral with respect to addition: $x+0=0+x=x$ for all $x\in\mathbb R$. </li>
<li>There is a unique real number, called <em>one</em> and denoted by $1$, which is neutral with respect to multiplication: $x\cdot 1=1\cdot x=x$ for all $x\in\mathbb R$.</li>
<li>Each real number $x$ has a unique <em>additive inverse</em> $-x$, also called its <em>negative</em>, for which we have that $x-x:=x+(-x)=0$. In fact, this is how the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/subtraction-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Subtraction of Real Numbers">subtraction of real numbers</a> "$-$" is defined.</li>
<li>Each real number $x\neq 0$ has a unique <em>multiplicative inverse</em> $x^{-1}=\frac 1x$, also called its <em>reciprocal</em>, for which we have that $x\div x:=x\cdot \frac 1x=1$. In fact, this is how the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/division-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Division of Real Numbers">division of real numbers</a> "$\div `$"is defined.</li>
<li>When calculations involve both, the multiplication and addition, then the <em>distributivity laws</em> hold: $x(y+z)=xy+xz$ and $(x+y)z=xz+yz.$<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You should know some basic results following from the field properties of real numbers, including:<ul>
<li>$-0=0$ (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/minus-zero-equals-zero-proof.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proof: (related to Corollary: `\(-0=0\)`)">proof</a>).</li>
<li>$-(-x)=x$ for all $x\in\mathbb R$ (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/minus-minus-equals-plus-proof.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proof: (related to Corollary: `\(-(-x)=x\)`)">proof</a>), and other <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/multiplying-negative-and-positive-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Multiplying Negative and Positive Real Numbers">rules for the multiplication of positive and negative numbers</a>.</li>
<li>$x\cdot 0=0\cdot x=0$ for all  $x\in\mathbb R$ (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/zero-times-x-equals-zero-proof.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proof: (related to Corollary: `\(0x=0\)`)">proof</a>).</li>
<li>$xy=0$ holds if and only if $x=0$ or $y=0$ (or both, <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/a-product-of-two-real-numbers-is-zero-if-and-only-if-at-least-one-of-these-numbers-is-zero-proof.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proof: (related to Corollary: A product of two real numbers is zero if and only if at least one of these numbers is zero.)">proof</a>).</li>
<li>$-(x+y)=-x-y$ (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/distributivity-of-minus-before-brackets-proof.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proof: (related to Proposition: `\(-(x+y)=-x-y\)`)">proof</a>).</li>
<li>The equality $a+x = b$ with the variable $x$ has exatly one solution: $b-a$ (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/unique-solvability-of-a-plus-x-equals-b-proof.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proof: (related to Proposition: Unique Solvability of `\(a+x=b\)`)">proof</a>).</li>
<li>The equality $ax = b$ with the variable $x$ and $a\neq 0$ has exatly one solution: $\frac ba$ (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/unique-solvability-of-a-times-x-equals-b-proof.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proof: (related to Proposition: Unique Solvability of `$ax=b$`)">proof</a>).</li>
<li>$\frac 1{xy}=\frac 1x\cdot \frac 1y$ for all  $x,y\in\mathbb R$ (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/reciprocal-of-product-equals-product-of-reciprocals-proof.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proof: (related to Proposition: `\((xy)^{-1}=x^{-1}y^{-1}\)`)">proof</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basically, the same rules apply for <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/complex-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Part: Complex Numbers">complex numbers</a> $\mathbb C$ with the operations <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/addition-of-complex-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Addition of Complex Numbers">addition</a> "$+$" and the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/multiplication-of-complex-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Multiplication of Complex Numbers">multiplication</a> "$\cdot$". </li>
<li>Any two real numbers $x,y\in\mathbb R$ can be ordered using the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/order-relation-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Order Relation of Real Numbers">order relation</a> "$\le$" . This relation is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/order-relation-for-real-numbers-is-strict-and-total.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Order Relation for Real Numbers is Strict and Total">strict and total</a>, i.e. only one of the following situations can be true (this is known as the <em>trichotomy property</em>): Either $x &lt; y$, or $x=y$, or $x &gt; y$. </li>
<li>The above order relation is transitive, i.e. if $x \le y$ and $y \le z$, then $x \le z$.</li>
<li>You should know some basic results for the "calculation of inequalities":<a href="https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/rules-of-calculation-with-inequalities/">https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/rules-of-calculation-with-inequalities/</a>.</li>
<li>You should know that complex numbers cannot be ordered. </li>
</ul>

<p>Here, we have used a short notation for multiplication, omitting the dot "$\cdot$". Note that the distributity laws cover subtraction as a special case of addition: $x(y-z)=xy-xz$ and $(x-y)z=xz-yz$. However, they only sometimes cover division as a special case of multiplication: Although we have $(x+y)\div z=x\div z+y\div z$, for $z\neq 0$, in general we have  $x\div (y+z)\neq x\div y+x\div z$ for $(y+z)\neq 0$. This is because the multiplicative inverse element of $(y+z)$ equals $\frac 1{y+z}$, and does not equal $\frac 1 y+\frac 1z$ (which is $\frac{z+y}{yz}$ rather than $\frac 1{y+z}$).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
