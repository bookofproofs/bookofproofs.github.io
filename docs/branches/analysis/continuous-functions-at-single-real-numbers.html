<h1>Definition: Continuous Functions at Single Real Numbers</h1>
<p>Let \(D\) be a subset of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/definition-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Definition of Real Numbers">real numbers</a> \(\mathbb R\), \(a\in D\), and let \(f:D\to\mathbb R\) be a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/partial-total-maps.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Partial and Total Maps (Functions)">function</a> \(f\) is <strong>continuous</strong> at the real number \(a\in\mathbb R\), if the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/limits-of-real-functions.html" title="Analysis / Definition: Limits of Real Functions">limit</a> $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=f(a)$ exists and is unique. This means that for every <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/real-sequence.html" title="Analysis / Definition: Real Sequence">real sequence</a> $(\xi_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ with $\xi_n\in D$ for all $n\in\mathbb N$, which <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/convergent-real-sequence.html" title="Analysis / Definition: Convergent Real Sequence">convergent</a> to $a$ we have that $\lim_{n\to\infty}f(\xi_n)=a$. </p>
<h3>Special Case in Metric Spaces</h3>
<p>This definition is a special case of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/continuous-functions-in-metric-spaces.html" title="Topology / Definition: Continuous Functions in Metric Spaces">continuous functions in metric spaces</a>, because for any two real numbers $x,y$, the distance $|x-y|$ makes <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/the-distance-of-real-numbers-makes-real-numbers-a-metric-space.html" title="Analysis / Proposition: The distance of real numbers makes real numbers a metric space.">the real numbers a metric space</a>.</p>
<h3>Equivalent Definition</h3>
<p>Continuous functions can also be defined using the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/epsilon-delta-definition-of-continuity.html" title="Topology / Proposition: \(\epsilon\)-\(\delta\) Definition of Continuity">\(\epsilon\)-\(\delta\) definition of continuity</a>, which is proven to be <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/continuous-functions-in-metric-spaces.html" title="Topology / Definition: Continuous Functions in Metric Spaces">equivalent to the definition of continuous functions in metric spaces</a>. According to the  \(\epsilon\)-\(\delta\) definition, \(f\) is <strong>continuous</strong> at the point \(a\), if and only if for every \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) there is a \(\delta &gt; 0\) such that
\[|f(x)-f(a)| &lt; \epsilon\]
for all \(x\in D\) with 
\[|x-a| &lt; \delta.\]</p>
<p>In the above definition, the general distance for metric spaces between the points $x$ and $a$ or $f(x)$ and $f(a)$ has been replaced by the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/absolute-value-of-real-numbers-modulus.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Absolute Value of Real Numbers (Modulus)">absolute value</a> of the differences $|x-a|$ and $|f(x)-f(a)|.$</p>
