<h1>Problem: Central Solitaire</h1>
<p>This ancient puzzle was a great favorite with our grandmothers, and most of us, I imagine, have on occasions come across a "Solitaire" board â€” a round, polished board with holes cut in it in a geometrical pattern, and a glass marble in every hole. Sometimes I have noticed one on a side table in a suburban front parlor, or found one on a shelf in a country cottage, or had one brought under my notice at a wayside inn. Sometimes they are of the form shown above, but it is equally common for the board to have four more holes, at the points indicated by dots. I select the simpler form.</p>
<p><img alt="q227" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/dudeney/q227.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p>Though "Solitaire" boards are still sold at the toy shops, it will be sufficient if the reader will make an enlarged copy of the above on a sheet of cardboard or paper, number the "holes," and provide himself with 33 counters, buttons, or beans. Now place a counter in every hole except the central one, No. 17, and the puzzle is to take off all the counters in a series of jumps, except the last counter, which must be left in that central hole. You are allowed to jump one counter over the next one to a vacant hole beyond, just as in the game of draughts, and the counter jumped over is immediately taken off the board. Only remember every move must be a jump; consequently, you will take off a counter at each move, and thirty-one single jumps will, of course, remove all the thirty-one counters. But compound moves are allowed (as in draughts, again), for so long as one counter continues to jump, the jumps all count as one move.</p>
<p>Here is the beginning of an imaginary solution which will serve to make the manner of moving perfectly plain, and show how the solver should write out his attempts: $5-17,$ $12-10,$ $26-12,$ $24-26$ (1$3-11,$ $11-25$), $9-11$ ($26-24,$ $24-10,$ $10-12$), etc., etc. The jumps contained within brackets count as one move because they are made with the same counter. Find the fewest possible moves. Of course, no diagonal jumps are permitted; you can only jump in the direction of the lines.</p>
