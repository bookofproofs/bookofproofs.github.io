<h1>Problem: The Ruby Brooch</h1>
<p>The annals of Scotland Yard contain some remarkable cases of jewel robberies, but one of the most perplexing was the theft of Lady Littlewood's rubies. There have, of course, been many greater robberies in point of value, but few so artfully conceived. Lady Littlewood, of Romley Manor, had a beautiful but rather eccentric heirloom in the form of a ruby brooch. While staying at her townhouse early in the eighties she took the jewel to a shop in Brompton for some slight repairs.</p>
<p>"A fine collection of rubies, madam," said the shopkeeper, to whom her ladyship was a stranger.</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied; "but curiously enough I have never actually counted them. My mother once pointed out to me that if you start from the center and count up one line, along with the outside and down the next line, there are always eight rubies. So I should always know if a stone were missing."</p>
<p><img alt="q423" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/dudeney/q423.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p>Six months later a brother of Lady Littlewood's, who had returned from his regiment in India, noticed that his sister was wearing the ruby brooch one night at a county ball, and on their return home asked to look at it more closely. He immediately detected the fact that four of the stones were gone.</p>
<p>"How can that possibly be?" said Lady Littlewood. "If you count up one line from the center, along with the edge, and down the next line, in any direction, there are always eight stones. This was always so and is so now. How, therefore, would it be possible to remove a stone without my detecting it?"</p>
<p>"Nothing could be simpler," replied the brother. "I know the brooch well. It originally contained forty-five stones, and there are now only forty-one. Somebody has stolen four rubies, and then reset as small a number of the others as possible in such a way that there shall always be eight in any of the directions you have mentioned."</p>
<p>There was not the slightest doubt that the Brompton jeweler was the thief, and the matter was placed in the hands of the police. But the man was wanted for other robberies and had left the neighborhood some time before. To this day he has never been found.</p>
<p>The interesting little point that at first baffled the police, and which forms the subject of our puzzle, is this: How were the forty-five rubies originally arranged on the brooch? The illustration shows exactly how the forty-one were arranged after it came back from the jeweler; but although they count eight correctly in any of the directions mentioned, there are four stones missing.</p>
