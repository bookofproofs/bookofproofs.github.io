<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/fun/dudeney/geometrical-problems/various-dissection-puzzles/the-square-of-veneer.html'>Problem: The Square of Veneer</a>)</p>
<p>Any square number may be expressed as the sum of two squares in an infinite number of different ways. The solution of the present puzzle forms a simple demonstration of this rule. It is a condition that we give actual dimensions.</p>
<p>In this puzzle, I ignore the known dimensions of our square and work on the assumption that it is $13n$ by $13n.$ The value of n we can afterwards determine. Divide the square as shown (where the dotted lines indicate the original markings) into $169$ squares. As $169$ is the sum of the two squares $144$ and $25,$ we will proceed to divide the veneer into two squares, measuring respectively $12\times12$ and $5\times5;$ and as we know that two squares may be formed from one square by dissection in four pieces, we seek a solution in this number. The dark lines in the diagram show where the cuts are to be made. The square $5\times5$ is cut out whole, and the larger square is formed from the remaining three pieces, $B, C,$ and $D,$ which the reader can easily fit together.</p>
<p><img alt="a159" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/dudeney/a159.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p>Now, $n$ is clearly $\frac{5}{13}$ of an inch. Consequently, our larger square must be $\frac{60}{13} \times \frac{60}{13}$ in., and our smaller square $\frac{25}{13} \times \frac{25}{13}$ in. The square of $\frac{60}{13}$ added to the square of $\frac{25}{13}$ is 25. The square is thus divided into as few as four pieces that form two squares of known dimensions, and all the sixteen nails are avoided.</p>
<p>Here is a general formula for finding two squares whose sum shall equal a given square, say $a^2.$ In the case of the solution of our puzzle $p = 3,$ $q = 2,$ and $a = 5$:</p>
<p>$$\frac{2pqa}{p^2+q^2}=x,\quad\quad\frac{\sqrt{a^2( p^2 + q^2)^2 - (2pqa)^2}}{p^2 + q^2} =y.$$</p>
<p>Here $x^2 + y^2 = a^2.$</p>
