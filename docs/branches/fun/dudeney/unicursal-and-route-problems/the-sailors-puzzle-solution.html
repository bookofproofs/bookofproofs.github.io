<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/fun/dudeney/unicursal-and-route-problems/the-sailors-puzzle.html'>Problem: The Sailor&#x27;s Puzzle</a>)</p>
<p><img alt="a249" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/dudeney/a249.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p>There are only four different routes (or eight, if we count the reverse ways) by which the sailor can start at the island marked $A,$ visit all the islands once, and once only, and return again to $A.$ Here they are:â€”</p>
<p>$$\begin{array}{c}
A I P T L O E H R Q D C F U G N\\
S K M B A A I P T S N G L O E U\\
F C D K M B Q R H A A B M K S N\\
 G L T P I O E U F C D Q R H A A I\\
 P T L O E U G N S K M B Q D C F\\ R H A\end{array}$$</p>
<p>Now, if the sailor takes the first route he will make $C$ his 12th island (counting $A$ as $1$); by the second route he will make $C$ his 13th island; by the third route, his 16th island; and by the fourth route, his 17th island. If he goes the reverse way, $C$ will be respectively his 10th, 9th, 6th, and 5th island. As these are the only possible routes, it is evident that if the sailor puts off his visit to $C$ as long as possible, he must take the last route reading from left to right. This route I show by the dark lines in the diagram, and it is the correct answer to the puzzle.</p>
<p>The map may be greatly simplified by the "buttons and string" method, explained in the solution to <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/fun/dudeney/chessboard-problems/dynamical-chess-puzzles/the-four-frogs.html" title="Fun / Dudeney / Chessboard Problems / Dynamical Chess Puzzles / Problem: The Four Frogs">The Four Frogs</a></p>
