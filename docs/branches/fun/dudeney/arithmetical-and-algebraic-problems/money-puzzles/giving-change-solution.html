<p>The way to help the American tradesman out of his dilemma is this. Describing the coins by the number of cents that they represent, the tradesman puts on the counter $50$ and $25;$ the buyer puts down $100, 3,$ and $2;$ the stranger adds his $10, 10, 5, 2,$ and $1.$ Now, considering that the cost of the purchase amounted to $34$ cents, it is clear that out of this pooled money the tradesman has to receive $109,$ the buyer $71,$ and the stranger his $28$ cents. Therefore it is obvious at a glance that the $100$-piece must go to the tradesman, and it then follows that the $50$-piece must go to the buyer, and then the $25$-piece can only go to the stranger. Another glance will now make it clear that the two $10$-cent pieces must go to the buyer because the tradesman now only wants $9$ and the stranger $3.$ Then it becomes obvious that the buyer must take the $1$ cent, that the stranger must take the $3$ cents, and the tradesman the $5, 2,$ and $2.$ To sum up, the tradesman takes $100, 5, 2,$ and $2;$ the buyer, $50, 10, 10,$ and $1;$ the stranger, $25$ and $3.$ It will be seen that not one of the three persons retains any one of his own coins.</p>
