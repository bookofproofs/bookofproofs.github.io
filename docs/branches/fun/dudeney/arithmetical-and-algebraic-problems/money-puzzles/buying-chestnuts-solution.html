<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/fun/dudeney/arithmetical-and-algebraic-problems/money-puzzles/buying-chestnuts.html'>Problem: Buying Chestnuts</a>)</p>
<p>In solving this little puzzle we are concerned with the exact interpretation of the words used by the buyer and seller. I will give the question again, this time adding a few words to make the matter more clear. The added words are printed in italics.</p>
<p>"A man went into a shop to buy chestnuts. He said he wanted a pennyworth, and was given five chestnuts. 'It is not enough; I ought to have a sixth of a <strong>chestnut more</strong>,' he remarked. 'But if I give you one chestnut more,' the shopman replied, 'you will have <strong>five-sixths</strong> too many.' Now, strange to say, they were both right. How many chestnuts should the buyer receive for half a crown?"</p>
<p>The answer is that the price was $155$ chestnuts for half a crown. Divide this number by $30,$ and we find that the buyer was entitled to $5\frac{1}{6}$ chestnuts in exchange for his penny. He was, therefore, right when he said, after receiving five only, that he still wanted a sixth. And the salesman was also correct in saying that if he gave one chestnut more (that is, six chestnuts in all) he would be giving five-sixths of a chestnut in excess.</p>
