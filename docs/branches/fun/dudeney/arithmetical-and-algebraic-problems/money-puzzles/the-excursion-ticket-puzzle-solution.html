<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/fun/dudeney/arithmetical-and-algebraic-problems/money-puzzles/the-excursion-ticket-puzzle.html'>Problem: The Excursion Ticket Puzzle</a>)</p>
<p>Nineteen shillings and ninepence may be paid in $458,908,622$ different ways.</p>
<p>I do not propose to give my method of solution. Any such explanation would occupy an amount of space out of proportion to its interest or value. If I could give within reasonable limits a general solution for all money payments, I would strain a point to find room; but such a solution would be extremely complex and cumbersome, and I do not consider it worth the labor of working out.</p>
<p>Just to give an idea of what such a solution would involve, I will merely say that I find that dealing only with those sums of money that are multiples of threepence, if we only use bronze coins any sum can be paid in $(n+1)^2$ ways where n always represents the number of pence. If threepenny-pieces are admitted, there are
$$\frac{2n^3+15n^2+33n}{18}   + 1$$</p>
<p>ways. If sixpences are also used there are
$$\frac{n^4+22n^3+159n^2+414n+216}{216}$$</p>
<p>ways, when the sum is a multiple of sixpence, and the constant, 216, changes to 324 when the money is not such a multiple. And so the formulas increase in complexity in an accelerating ratio as we go on to the other coins.</p>
<p>I will, however, add an interesting little table of the possible ways of changing our current coins which I believe has never been given in a book before. Change may be given for a
* Farthing in $0$ way.
* Halfpenny in $1$ way.
* Penny in $3$ ways.
* Threepenny-piece in $16$ ways.
* Sixpence in $66$ ways.
* Shilling in $402$ ways.
* Florin in $3,818$ ways.
* Half-crown in $8,709$ ways.
* Double florin in $60,239$ ways.
* Crown in $166,651$ ways.
* Half-sovereign in $6,261,622$ ways.
* Sovereign in $500,291,833$ ways.</p>
<p>It is a little surprising to find that a sovereign may be changed in over five hundred million different ways. But I have no doubt as to the correctness of my figures.</p>
