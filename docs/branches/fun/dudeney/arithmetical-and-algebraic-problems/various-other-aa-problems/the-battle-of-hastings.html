<h1>Problem: The Battle of Hastings</h1>
<p>All historians know that there is a great deal of mystery and uncertainty concerning the details of the ever-memorable battle on that fatal day, October 14, 1066. My puzzle deals with a curious passage in an ancient monkish chronicle that may never receive the attention that it deserves, and if I am unable to vouch for the authenticity of the document it will none the less serve to furnish us with a problem that can hardly fail to interest those of my readers who have arithmetical predilections. Here is the passage in question.</p>
<p>"The men of Harold stood well together, as their wont was, and formed sixty and one squares, with a like number of men in every square thereof, and woe to the hardy Norman who ventured to enter their redoubts; for a single blow of a Saxon war-hatchet would break his lance and cut through his coat of mail.... When Harold threw himself into the fray the Saxons were one mighty square of men, shouting the battle-cries, 'Ut!' 'Olicrosse!' 'Godemit√®!'"</p>
<p>Now, I find that all the contemporary authorities agree that the Saxons did actually fight in this solid order. For example, in the "Carmen de Bello Hastingensi," a poem attributed to Guy, Bishop of Amiens, living at the time of the battle, we are told that "the Saxons stood fixed in a dense mass," and Henry of Huntingdon records that "they were like unto a castle, impenetrable to the Normans;" while Robert Wace, a century after, tells us the same thing. So in this respect, my newly-discovered chronicle may not be greatly in error. But I have reason to believe that there is something wrong with the actual figures. Let the reader see what he can make of them.</p>
<p>The number of men would be sixty-one times a square number, but when Harold himself joined the fray they were then able to form one large square. What is the smallest possible number of men there could have been?</p>
<p>In order to make clear to the reader the simplicity of the question, I will give the lowest solutions in the case of $60$ and $62,$ the numbers immediately preceding and following $61$. They are $$60 \times 42 + 1 = 312,$$ and $$62 \times 82 + 1 = 632.$$ That is, $60$ squares of $16$ men each would be $960$ men, and when Harold joined them they would be $961$ in number, and so form a square with $31$ men on every side. Similarly, in the case of the figures, I have given for $62.$ Now, find the lowest answer for $61.$</p>
