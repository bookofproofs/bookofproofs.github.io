<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/fun/dudeney/arithmetical-and-algebraic-problems/various-other-aa-problems/the-torn-number.html'>Problem: The Torn Number</a>)</p>
<p>The other number that answers all the requirements of the puzzle is $9,801.$ If we divide this in the middle into two numbers and add them together we get $99,$ which, multiplied by itself, produces $9,801.$ It is true that $2,025$ may be treated in the same way, only this number is excluded by the condition which requires that no two figures should be alike.</p>
<p>The general solution is curious. Call the number of figures in each half of the torn label $n.$ Then, if we add $1$ to each of the exponents of the prime factors (other than $3$) of $10^n - 1$ ($1$ being regarded as a factor with the constant exponent, $1$), their product will be the number of solutions. Thus, for a label of six figures, $n = 3.$ The factors of $10^n - 1$ are $11 \times 371$ (not considering the $33$), and the product of $2 \times 2= 4,$ the number of solutions. This always includes the special cases $98 - 01,$ $00 - 01,$ $998 - 01,$ $000 - 001,$ etc. The solutions are obtained as follows:â€” 
1. Factorize $103$ - $1$ in all possible ways, always keeping the powers of $3$ together, thus, $37 \times 27,$ $999 \times 1.$ 
1. Then solve the equation $37x = 27y + 1.$ Here $x = 19$ and $y = 26.$ </p>
<p>Therefore, $19 \times 37 = 703,$ the square of which gives one label, $494,209.$ A complementary solution (through $27y = 37x + 1$) can at once be found by $10^n - 703 = 297,$ the square of which gives $088,209$ for second label. (These non-significant noughts to the left must be included, though they lead to peculiar cases like $00238 - 04641 = 4879^2,$ where $0238 - 4641$ would not work.) The special case $999 \times 1$ we can write at once $998,001,$ according to the law shown above, by adding nines on one half and noughts on the other, and its complementary will be $1$ preceded by five noughts, or $000001.$ Thus we get the squares of $999$ and $1.$ These are the four solutions.</p>
