<h1>Definition: Topological Space, Topology</h1>
<p>A <strong>topological space</strong> is an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/ordered-pair-n-tuple.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Ordered Pair, n-Tuple">ordered pair</a> $(X,\mathcal O)$ of a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/set-set-element-empty-set-cantor.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Set, Set Element, Empty Set">set</a> $X$ together with a set of its <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/subset-superset.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Subset and Superset">subsets</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/subset-superset.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Subset and Superset">subset</a> $\mathcal {O}$ (called its <strong>topology</strong>), which obeys the following axioms:</p>
<ol>
<li>The empty set \(\emptyset\) and the whole set \(X\) are elements of the topology (i.e. \({\emptyset\in\mathcal {O}}\) and \({X\in\mathcal {O}}\) ).</li>
<li>The <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/set-intersection.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Set Intersection">intersection</a> of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/finite-set-infinite-set.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Finite Set, Infinite Set">finitely many</a> elements of the topology $\mathcal O$ is an element of the topology, i.e. if \(U_{1},\ldots ,U_{n}\in {\mathcal {O}}\), then also \(U_{1}\cap \ldots \cap U_{n}\in {\mathcal {O}}\).</li>
<li>Every <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/set-union.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Set Union">union</a> of elements of the topology is again an element of it, i.e. with \(U_{i}\in {\mathcal {O}}\) for each \(i\in I\) (for an arbitrary <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/index-set-and-set-family.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Index Set and Set Family">index set</a> \(I\)) we have also \(\bigcup _{i\in I}U_{i}\in {\mathcal {O}}\).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>A topological space is defined simply by a postulating that subsets of an arbitrary <em>carrier set</em> $X$ fulfill the above properties. </li>
<li>Because the axioms $1$ to $3$ do not uniquely define a topological space, it is possible to define many different topologies $\mathcal O$ on a set $X.$ </li>
<li>Even a set $X=\{a,b\}$ with only two elements has different topologies (resulting in different topological spaces). How many? The reader might use this example as an exercise. (Hint: Consider all non-empty subsets of the power set $\mathcal P(\{a,b\})$).</li>
</ul>
