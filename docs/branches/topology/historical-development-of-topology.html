<h1>Part: Historical Development of Topology</h1>
<p><em>Topology</em> is a relatively young discipline of mathematics. Its roots reach back to the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/history/19th-century/19th-century.html" title="19Th Century / Epoch: 19th Century">19th century</a> in which geometry underwent some major transformations. The classical interpretation of geometry at the beginning of the 19th century was that it described the real world. At the end of this century, however, other geometries were discovered (see <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/historical-development-of-geometry.html" title="Geometry / Part: Historical Development of Geometry">historical development of geometry</a>). Also, another important prerequisite for the development of modern topology was the progress made in set theory (see <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/historical-development-of-set-theory.html" title="Set Theory / Part: Historical Development of Set Theory">historical development of set theory</a>). In particular, <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor/">Georg Cantor</a> (1845 - 1918), when studying <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/ordinal-number.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Ordinal Number">ordinal numbers</a> in the context of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/fourier-series.html" title="Analysis / Chapter: Fourier Series">Fourier series</a>, he discovered that some properties of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/subset-superset.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Subset and Superset">subsets</a> of $\mathbb R^n$ depended only on the underlying <em>point sets</em>. 
Later, <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Ascoli/">Guido Ascoli</a> (1887 - 1957), <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Volterra/">Vito Volterra</a> (1860 - 1940) 
and <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Arzela/">Cesare Arzelà</a> (1847–1912) replaced Cantor's <em>point sets</em> by <em>function sets</em>. They defined what we would today call a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/metric-distance.html" title="Topology / Definition: Metric (Distance)">metric</a>.
The first attempts to define and use modern topological terms were done by <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Frechet/">René Maurice Fréchet</a> (1878 - 1973) in the year 1906 in his thesis "Sur quelques points du calcul functionnel", in which he introduced the term <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/metric-space.html" title="Topology / Definition: Metric Space">metric space</a>. He also attempts to create the term of a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/topological-space-topology.html" title="Topology / Definition: Topological Space, Topology">topological space</a>, when trying to axiomatize convergent sequences of functions. While up to his time, different special cases of metric spaces were investigated, Fréchet realized that it can be very economical to use this abstract concept instead and get general and deeper results. For instance, instead of defining a <em>convergent sequence</em> $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ "as usual", i.e. by saying that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... a sequence $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ is <strong>convergent</strong> against $x$ if for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$ there is a number $N\in\mathbb N$ such that $|x-x_n|&lt;\epsilon$ for all n&gt;N,$ </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fréchet replaced the claim that the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/absolute-value-of-real-numbers-modulus.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Absolute Value of Real Numbers (Modulus)">absolute value</a> $|x-x_n|$ has to be less than a given $\epsilon &gt; 0$ by the claim that in a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/metric-space.html" title="Topology / Definition: Metric Space">metric space</a> an abstractly defined <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/metric-distance.html" title="Topology / Definition: Metric (Distance)">distance</a> has to fulfill this property.</p>
<p>Most of the concepts of the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/basics-of-set-theoretic-topology.html" title="Topology / Part: The Basics Set-theoretic Topology">set-theoretic topology</a> were first described in modern form in <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hausdorff/">Felix Hausdorff</a>'s (1868 - 1942) book "Grundzüge der Mengenlehre" in its seventh chapter "Punktmengen in allgemeinen Räumen" ("Basics of the Set Theory", "Sets of Points in General Spaces"), published 1914 in Leipzig, but also again later by Fréchet, and by 
<a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Riesz/">Frigyes Riesz</a> (1880 - 1956). They all realized that not only the convergence of a sequence but also many other <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/analysis.html" title="Analysis / Branch: Analysis">analytical</a> concepts can be defined solely based on a single term of a <em>neighborhood</em>. In particular,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... a sequence $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ is <strong>convergent</strong> against $x$ if for every neighborhood $U$ there is a number $N\in\mathbb N$ such that $x_n\in U$ for all n&gt;N.$ </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/neighborhood.html" title="Topology / Definition: Neighborhood">neighborhood itself was defined</a> to fulfill certain properties and the subsets of the underlying sets were defined to be themselves neighborhoods. This was where birth of the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/topological-space-topology.html" title="Topology / Definition: Topological Space, Topology">topological space</a> (1914). At one go it was possible to simplify the whole theory of convergence and to significantly extend its applicability.</p>
<p>Convergence was even more deeply understood after the concept of <em>filters</em> was later developed between 1935 and 1939. However, some analytical concepts, e.g. the concept of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/uniformly-continuous-functions-real-case.html" title="Analysis / Definition: Uniformly Continuous Functions (Real Case)">uniform continuity</a> could not be covered by the new terminology. Only some decades later one succeeded to generalize these concepts too (<em>uniform spaces</em>).</p>
<p>The later development of topology was very rapid and was boosted by the magazine "Fundamenta Mathematicae" published first 1920 in Warsaw, in which, among others, 
<a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Sierpinski/">Wacław Sierpiński</a> (1882 - 1969) and <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Kuratowski/">Kazimierz Kuratowski</a> (1896 - 1980) published some of their works. The 1920s developed also what was called <em>combinatoric topology</em>,  or <em>analysis situs</em>, today better known as algebraic topology. </p>
<p>The so-called <em>metrization problem</em>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which are the purely topological properties a topological space must have to also have a metric?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was addressed by <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Urysohn/">Pavel Urysohn</a> (1898 - 1924) and Pavel Alexandrov (1896 - 1982), but solved only in 1951 by <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bing/">R. H. Bing</a> (1914 - 1986), Juri Michailowitsch Smirnow (1921 - 2007) and Jun-iti Nagata (1925 - 2007).</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bourbaki/">undertaking Bourbaki</a>, the view on topology as an underlying mathematical discipline was formulated. At the latest since then, topology has a set position among other mathematical disciplines.</p>
