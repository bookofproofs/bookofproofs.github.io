<h1>Definition: Open, Closed, Clopen</h1>
<p>Let $(X,\mathcal{O})$ be a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/topological-space-topology.html" title="Topology / Definition: Topological Space, Topology">topological space</a>. Every element of the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/topology/topological-space-topology.html" title="Topology / Definition: Topological Space, Topology">topology</a> $\mathcal O$ is called <strong>open</strong>. A <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/subset-superset.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Subset and Superset">subset</a> $U\subseteq X$ is called <strong>closed</strong>, if its <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/set-complement.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Set Complement">set complement</a> $U^C$ is open, i.e. an element of the topology $\mathcal O.$</p>
<p>A subset of $X$, which is both, open and closed, is called <strong>clopen</strong>.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>By definition of topology, it is clear that clopen sets exist. Depending on the specific collection of subsets of $X$ in the topology $\mathcal O$, there might be subsets of $X$ that are both, closed (since their complement is open) and open (since they are themselves elements of $\mathcal O$).</li>
<li>Moreover, there might be subsets of $X$ which are neither open (since they are not elements of the topology $\mathcal O$), nor closed (since their complement is neither an element of this topology).</li>
</ul>
