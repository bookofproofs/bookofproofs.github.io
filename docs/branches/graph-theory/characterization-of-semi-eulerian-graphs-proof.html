<h1>Proof</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/characterization-of-semi-eulerian-graphs.html'>Theorem: Characterization of Semi-Eulerian Graphs</a>)</p>
<h3>"\(\Rightarrow\)"</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assume, a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">simple graph</a> \(G(V,E)\) is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/semi-eulerian-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Semi-Eulerian Graph">semi-Eulerian</a>.</li>
<li>Then there is an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/semi-eulerian-tour-open-trail.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Semi-Eulerian Tour, Open Trail">semi-Eulerian tour</a> between a starting and finishing vertices \(v\) and \(w\).</li>
<li>Adding an edge \(e\) between \(v\) and \(w\) creates an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/eulerian-tour.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Eulerian Tour">Eulerian tour</a>, and thus an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/eulerian-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Eulerian Graph">Eulerian graph</a> \(G'(V,E')\) with \(E':=E\cup\{e\}\).</li>
<li>By the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/characterization-of-eulerian-graphs.html" title="Graph Theory / Theorem: Characterization of Eulerian Graphs">characterization of Eulerian graphs</a>, \(G'\) is  <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">connected</a>, and each of its vertices has an  <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-theory/even-and-odd-numbers.html" title="Number Theory / Definition: Even and Odd Numbers">even</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/vertex-degrees-for-undirected-graphs.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Vertex Degrees for Undirected Graphs">degree</a>.</li>
<li>Whenever this trail passes through a vertex, there is a contribution of \(2\) to the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/vertex-degrees-for-undirected-graphs.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Vertex Degrees for Undirected Graphs">degree</a> of that vertex. </li>
<li>By removing the edge \(e\) again, we see that \(v\) and \(w\) are exactly the two vertices with an odd degree.</li>
<li>Removing the edge \(e\) does not disconnect the graph \(G'\), because there is still an open trail between \(v\) and \(w\).</li>
<li>Thus, also \(G\) is connected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>"\(\Leftarrow\)"</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assume, \(G\) is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">connected</a> graph with exactly two vertices with an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-theory/even-and-odd-numbers.html" title="Number Theory / Definition: Even and Odd Numbers">odd</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/vertex-degrees-for-undirected-graphs.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Vertex Degrees for Undirected Graphs">degree</a>, \(v\) and \(w\).</li>
<li>Add an edge \(e\) between \(v\) and \(w\) to create an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/eulerian-tour.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Eulerian Tour">Eulerian tour</a>, and thus an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/eulerian-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Eulerian Graph">Eulerian graph</a> \(G'(V,E')\) with \(E':=E\cup\{e\}\).</li>
<li>By the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/characterization-of-eulerian-graphs.html" title="Graph Theory / Theorem: Characterization of Eulerian Graphs">characterization of Eulerian graphs</a>, \(G'\) is  <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">connected</a>, and each of its vertices has an  <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-theory/even-and-odd-numbers.html" title="Number Theory / Definition: Even and Odd Numbers">even</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/vertex-degrees-for-undirected-graphs.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Vertex Degrees for Undirected Graphs">degree</a>.</li>
<li>Removal of the edge \(e\) from this trail produces an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/semi-eulerian-tour-open-trail.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Semi-Eulerian Tour, Open Trail">open trail</a>, i.e. a trail that includes every edge of \(G\) but is not a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/closed-walks-closed-trails-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Closed Walks, Closed Trails, and Cycles">closed trail</a>.</li>
<li>So, \(G\) is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/semi-eulerian-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Semi-Eulerian Graph">semi-Eulerian</a>.<div class='qed'>&#8718;</div></li>
