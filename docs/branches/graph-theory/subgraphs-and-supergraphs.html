<h1>Definition: Subgraphs and Supergraphs; Induced Subgraph</h1>
<p>Let \(G(V,E,\gamma)\) be an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">undirected graph</a>. A graph \(S(V',E',\gamma')\) is called a <strong>subgraph</strong> of \(G\), written as \(S\subseteq G\), if it fulfills the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>\(V'\) consists only of vertices from \(V\), formally \(V'\subseteq V\). </li>
<li>\(E'\) consists only of edges from \(E\), formally \(E'\subseteq E\). </li>
<li>\(\gamma'\) is the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/restriction.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Restriction">restriction</a> of \(\gamma\) on \(E'\), i.e. \(\gamma':={\gamma|}_{E'}E\mapsto V\).  (Note: This property is not necessary for a simple undirected graph \(G(V,E)\)).</li>
</ol>
<p>If \(S\) is a subgraph of \(G\), then \(G\) is called the <strong>supergraph</strong> of \(S\).</p>
<p>If \(S\) contains all the edges \(e\) with \(\gamma(e)\in V'\), then \(S\) is an <strong>induced subgraph</strong> of \(G\); we say that the vertices \(V'\) <strong>induce</strong> or <strong>span</strong> \(S\) in \(G\) and write \(S:=G[V']\). Thus, if \(V'\subseteq V\) is any set of vertices, \(V'=\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n\}\), then the induced subgraph \(G[V']=G[v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n]\) denotes the graph whose edges are precisely the edges of \(G\) with ends in \(V'\).</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><img alt="inducedgraph" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/inducedgraph.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p>In the above figure, the graphs \(G_2, G_3\) and \(G_4\) are all subgraphs of the graph \(G_1\). However, only \(G_2\) and \(G_3\) are induced subgraphs of \(G_1\), since</p>
<p>\[G_2=G_1[a,c,d],\quad G_3=G_1[a,b,c],\]</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>\[G_4\neq G_1[a,b,c,d].\]</p>
