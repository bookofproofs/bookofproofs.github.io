<h1>Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph</h1>
<p>An <strong>undirected graph</strong> or <strong>graph</strong> \(G\) is a triple \(G:=(V,E,\gamma)\) with the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>\(V\) is a non-empty <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/set-set-element-empty-set-cantor.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Set, Set Element, Empty Set">set</a> of elements called <strong>vertices</strong> or <strong>nodes</strong>.</li>
<li>\(E\) is a set (non-empty or empty) of elements, called <strong>edges</strong>.</li>
<li>Vertices and edges are not the same objects, formally \(V\cap E=\emptyset\). </li>
<li>The <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/partial-total-maps.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Partial and Total Maps (Functions)">map</a> \(\gamma: E\mapsto \{X:~X\subseteq V,~1\le|X|\le 2\}\), assigns to every edge \(e\) its <strong>ends</strong>, denoted by \(\gamma(e)\). </li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that the ends of an edge \(e\) can be two different vertices (this is the case if \(|\gamma(e)|=2\)) or one an the same vertex (this is the case if \(|\gamma(e)|=1\)).</p>
<p>If \(|\gamma(e)|=1\), i.e. if the ends of \(e\) are the same vertex, the edge \(e\) is called a <strong>loop</strong>. </p>
<p>Two edges \(e\) and \(e'\) are called <strong>parallel</strong> or <strong>multiple edges</strong> if \(\gamma(e)=\gamma(e')\), (thus they have the same ends). If additionally \(|\gamma(e)|=1\), they are called <strong>multiple loops</strong>.</p>
<p>We call \(G\) a <strong>simple undirected graph</strong> (or <strong>simple graph</strong>), if it has no loops and no parallel edges. A simple graph is written \(G(V,E)\). An edge of simple graph \(e:=(x,y)\) is written as \(xy\) (or \(yx\)).</p>
