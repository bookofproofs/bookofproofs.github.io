<h1>Definition: Closed Walks, Closed Trails, and Cycles</h1>
<p>Let \(G(V,E,\gamma)\) be a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">simple graph</a>.
* A <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/walks-trails-paths-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Walks, Trails, and Paths">walk (or trail) </a> \(W^k=v_0e_0v_1e_1v_2e_2\ldots e_{k-1}x_{k}\) in \(G\) is called a <strong>closed walk</strong> (or a closed trail) if \(x_k=x_0\).
* A <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/walks-trails-paths-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Walks, Trails, and Paths">path</a> \(C^k:=x_0x_1\ldots x_{k-1}x_k\) with \(x_0=x_k\), but \(x_0\neq x_i\) for \(i=1,\ldots,k-1\) is called a <strong>cycle</strong>. Note that from this definition it allows any cycle in a simple graph contains at least three different vertices.
* An edge which joins two vertices of a cycle but is not itself an edge of the cycle is a <strong>chord</strong> of that cycle.</p>
<h4>Examples:</h4>
<p><img alt="graphs1" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/graphs1.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p>In the figure above: </p>
<ul>
<li>\(abcgfcdefcdefgha\) is a closed walk, but not a closed trail because the e.g. the edges \(gf\), \(cd\), etc. are passed more then once.</li>
<li>\(abcdefcgha\) is a closed trail, but not a cycle because the vertex \(c\) is passed more then once.</li>
<li>\(abcdefgha\) is a cycle (every edge and every vertex is passed exactly once); the edges \(cg\) and \(cf\) are the chords of that cycle.</li>
<li>\(abcgha\) is a cycle without any chords.</li>
</ul>
