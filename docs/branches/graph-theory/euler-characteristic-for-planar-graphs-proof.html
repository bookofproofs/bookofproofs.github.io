<h1>Proof</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/euler-characteristic-for-planar-graphs.html'>Theorem: Euler Characteristic for Planar Graphs</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>By hypothesis, $G$ is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">connected</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/planar-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Planar Graph">planar graph</a> with a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/planar-drawing-embedding.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Planar Drawing (Embedding)">planar drawing</a> consisting of \(v\) <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">vertices</a>, \(e\) <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">edges</a> and \(f\) <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/face-infinite-face.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Face, Infinite Face">faces</a>.</li>
<li>We may assume that $v\ge 1,$ since a connected graph requires at least one vertex.</li>
<li>First, we observe: If the formula $v-e+f=2$ holds for a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">multigraph</a> (i.e. an undirected graph with some <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">loops</a> and/or <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">multiple edges</a>), then it also holds for a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">simple graph</a> obtained from this multigraph by removing all loops and replacing all multiple edges by simple edges.<ul>
<li>For if we remove a loop or remove in a given multiple edge one of the edges, the numbers $e$,$f$ and $v$ change as follows:<ul>
<li>$e\to e-1$</li>
<li>$f\to f-1$</li>
<li>$v\to v$</li>
<li>an the formula remains unchanged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, we can assume that we have a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">connected</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">simple graph</a>, for which we have to check the formula $v-e+f=2.$ </li>
<li>Case $v=1$:<ul>
<li>We have $e=0$ and $f=1$ (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/face-infinite-face.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Face, Infinite Face">infinite face</a>) and the formula is correct.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Case $v=2$:<ul>
<li>We have $e=1$ and $f=1$ (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/face-infinite-face.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Face, Infinite Face">infinite face</a>) and the formula is again correct.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Case $v &gt; 2.$<ul>
<li>Since the graph is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">connected</a>, we can remove edges one by one to get the case $v=2.$ When removing the edges, we have again two sub-cases:<ul>
<li>Case a) The to-be-removed edge has one vertex with <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/vertex-degrees-for-undirected-graphs.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Vertex Degrees for Undirected Graphs">degree</a> $=1$ and the other with degree $ &gt; 1$.<ul>
<li>In this case, removing the edge would disconnect the graph unless we also remove the vertex with degree $=1$. Thus, </li>
<li>$e\to e-1$ (the removed edge)</li>
<li>$f\to f$ (the surrounding face of the removed edge does not change).</li>
<li>$v\to v-1$ (the removed vertex with degree $=1$)</li>
<li>Thus, the formula $v-e+f=2$, if correct, does not change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Case b) Both vertices incident to the to-be-removed edge have a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/vertex-degrees-for-undirected-graphs.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Vertex Degrees for Undirected Graphs">degree</a> $ &gt; 1$.<ul>
<li>In this case, removing the edge will not disconnect the graph and we do not have to remove any vertices. Thus, </li>
<li>$e\to e-1$ (the removed edge),</li>
<li>$f\to f-1$ (two faces incident to the removed edge are melted together to one face),</li>
<li>$v\to v$ (no removed vertices).</li>
<li>Thus, the formula $v-e+f=2$, if correct, does not change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Altogether, we have shown for the case $v &gt; 2$ that we can transform the graph to the case $v=2,$ for which we have already proven the formula \[v-e+f=2.\]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It follows that the formula holds for all connected <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/planar-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Planar Graph">planar graphs</a> with a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/planar-drawing-embedding.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Planar Drawing (Embedding)">planar drawing</a>.<div class='qed'>&#8718;</div></li>
