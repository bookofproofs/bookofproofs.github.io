<h1>Proof</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/when-is-it-possible-to-find-a-separating-cycle-in-a-biconnected-graph-given-a-non-separating-cycle.html'>Lemma: When is it possible to find a separating cycle in a biconnected graph, given a non-separating cycle?</a>)</p>
<p>Let \(G(V,E,\gamma)\) be a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/biconnected-graphs-k-connected-graphs.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Biconnected Graphs, `\(k\)`-Connected Graphs">biconnected graph</a> and let \(C(V_c,E_c)\) be a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/separating-and-non-separating-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Separating and Non-Separating Cycles">non-separating cycle</a> with the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/pieces-of-a-graph-with-respect-to-a-cycle.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Pieces of a Graph With Respect to A Cycle">piece</a> \(P(V_p,E_p)\), which is, by hypothesis, not a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/walks-trails-paths-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Walks, Trails, and Paths">path</a>. Let \(u\) and \(v\) be two <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/pieces-of-a-graph-with-respect-to-a-cycle.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Pieces of a Graph With Respect to A Cycle">attachments</a> of \(P\) that are consecutive in the circular order of \(C\), i.e. if \(C:=x_0x_1\ldots x_{k-1}x_k\) with \(x_k=x_0\), then \(u=x_i\) and \(v=x_j\) for some \( i &lt; j\) and there is no other attachment of \(P\) among the vertices \(u=x_i,x_{i+1},\ldots,x_{j-1},x_j=v\), besides \(u\) and \(v\). </p>
<p>In the example below, the edges of the cycle \(C\) are colored blue and the vertices of the piece \(P\) are colored orange. Moreover, \(u\) and \(v\) are two attachments of \(P\) that are consecutive in the circular order of \(C\):</p>
<p><img alt="pieces3" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/pieces3.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p>We want to show that, provided \(P\) is not a path (which is the case in our example), it is possible to construct a separating cycle \(S(V_s,E_s)\), which consists of a subpath of \(C\) plus a path of \(P\) between the attachments \(u\) and \(v\) of \(P\). </p>
<p>We observe that, by construction, \(E=x_ix_{i+1}\ldots x_{j-1}x_j\) is a subpath of \(C\) from \(u\) to \(v\) that does not contain any attachment of \(P\). Moreover, by <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/pieces-of-a-graph-with-respect-to-a-cycle.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Pieces of a Graph With Respect to A Cycle">definition of a piece</a>, \(P(V_p,E_p)\) is connected. Thus, there is also another path \(F\) from \(u\) to \(v\) in \(P\). </p>
<p>In our example, both paths \(E\) (dashed red) and \(F\) (dashed blue) are shown in the following figure: </p>
<p><img alt="pieces4" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/pieces4.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p>Let \(S\) be a cycle obtained from \(C\) by replacing \(E\) with \(F\) (see next figure):</p>
<p><img alt="pieces2" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/pieces2.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p>It remains to be shown that \(S\) is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/separating-and-non-separating-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Separating and Non-Separating Cycles">separating cycle</a> cycle. First of all, we have by construction that \(E\) is a piece of \(G\) with respect to \(S\). By hypothesis, \(P\) is not a path. Therefore, there exists an edge \(e\) of \(P\) which is not an edge of \(F\). Therefore, there must exist  another piece of \(G\) with respect to \(S\), which is distinct to \(E\) (see next figure):</p>
<p><img alt="pieces5" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/pieces5.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p>Since there are more than one pieces of \(G\) with respect to \(S\), \(S\) is a separating cycle.<div class='qed'>&#8718;</div></p>
