<h1>Definition: Digraph, Initial and Terminal Vertices, Loops, Parallel and Inverse Edges, Simple Digraph</h1>
<p>A <strong>digraph</strong> or <strong>directed graph</strong> \(D\) is a quadruple \(D:=(V,E,\alpha,\omega)\) with the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>\(V\) is a non-empty <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/set-set-element-empty-set-cantor.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Set, Set Element, Empty Set">set</a> of elements called <strong>vertices</strong> or <strong>nodes</strong>.</li>
<li>\(E\) is a set (non-empty or empty) of elements, called <strong>edges</strong> or <strong>arcs</strong>.</li>
<li>Vertices and edges are not the same objects, formally \(V\cap E=\emptyset\). </li>
<li>The <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/partial-total-maps.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Partial and Total Maps (Functions)">map</a> \(\alpha: E\mapsto V\), assigns to every edge \(e\) its <strong>initial vertex</strong>, denoted by \(\alpha(e)\). </li>
<li>The map \(\omega: E\mapsto V\) assigns to every edge \(e\) its <strong>terminal vertex</strong>, denoted by \(\omega(e)\).</li>
</ol>
<p>If \(\alpha(e)=\omega(e)\), the edge \(e\) is called a <strong>loop</strong>. </p>
<p>Two edges \(e\) and \(e'\) are called <strong>parallel</strong> or <strong>multiple edges</strong> if \(\alpha(e)=\alpha(e')\) and \(\omega(e)=\omega(e')\), (thus they have the same initial and terminal vertices).</p>
<p>Two edges \(e\) and \(e'\) are called <strong>inverse</strong> if \(\alpha(e)=\omega(e')\) and \(\omega(e)=\alpha(e')\), (thus the intial vertex of the first edge is the terminal vertex of the second edge and vice versa). </p>
<p>We call \(D\) a <strong>simple digraph</strong> if it has no loops and no parallel edges.</p>
