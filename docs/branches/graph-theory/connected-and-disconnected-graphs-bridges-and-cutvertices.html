<h1>Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices</h1>
<p>Let \(G(V,E,\gamma)\) be a non-empty undirected <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">graph</a>.
* \(G\) is called <strong>connected</strong>, if there is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/walks-trails-paths-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Walks, Trails, and Paths">path</a> \(P=w-u\) between any two of its vertices \(w\) and \(u\). Equivalently, a connected graph has exactly one component, i.e. the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/get-all-components-of-a-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Algorithm: Get All Components of a Graph">output of the algorithm</a> <code>get_components(G)</code> is a set \(C\) of subgraphs with \(|C|=1\).
* \(G\) is called <strong>disconnected</strong>, if it has more than one component, i.e. if it is not connected. 
* An edge in a connected graph is a <strong>bridge</strong>, if its removal leaves a disconnected graph.
* A vertex of a connected graph is a <strong>cutvertex</strong> or <strong>articulation point</strong>, if its removal leaves a disconnected graph.</p>
<h4>Examples:</h4>
<p><img alt="graphs2" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/graphs2.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p>The above graph \(G\), consisting of \(14\) vertices is disconnected. However, It has the following conntected components:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(G[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\)</li>
<li>\(G[9,10]\)</li>
<li>\(G[11,12,13]\)</li>
<li>\(G[ 14 ]\)</li>
</ul>
<p>The edge \((3,6)\) is a bridge of the component \(G[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\) and the edge \((9,11)\) is a bridge of the component \(G[9,10]\).</p>
<p>The vertices \(3\) and \(4\) are articulation points of the component  \(G[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\).</p>
