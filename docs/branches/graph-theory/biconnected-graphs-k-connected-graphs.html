<h1>Definition: Biconnected Graphs, \(k\)-Connected Graphs</h1>
<p>Let \(G(V,E,\gamma)\) be a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">connected graph</a> and \(k &gt; 0\) be a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/set-theoretic-definitions-of-natural-numbers-ernst-zermelo-1908-john-von-neumann-1923.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Set-theoretic Definitions of Natural Numbers">natural number</a>. If after the removal of any subset of vertices \(X\subset V\) with \(|X| &lt; k\) the graph \(G\) remains connected, then \(G\) is called <em>\(k\)-connected</em>.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If \(G\) is \(1\)-connected, then it is connected.</p>
<p>If \(G\) is \(2\)-connected, it has no <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">cutvertices</a>. A \(2\)-connected graph is also called <strong>biconnected</strong>.</p>
