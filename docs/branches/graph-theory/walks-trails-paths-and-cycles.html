<h1>Definition: Walks, Trails, and Paths</h1>
<p>A <strong>walk</strong> in a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/digraph-initial-and-terminal-vertices-loops-parallel-and-inverse-edges-simple-digraph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Digraph, Initial and Terminal Vertices, Loops, Parallel and Inverse Edges, Simple Digraph">digraph</a> \(D(V,E,\alpha,\omega)\) or an  <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">undirected graph</a> \(G(V,E,\gamma)\) is a non-empty, alternating succession of vertices \(v_i\in V\) and edges \(e_i\in E\) 
\[W^k:=v_0e_0v_1e_1v_2e_2\ldots e_{k-1}x_{k},\]
such that \(e_i=v_iv_{i+1}\) for all \(i &lt; k\). </p>
<p>A <strong>trail</strong> is a walk, in which all the edges, but not necessarily all the vertices all distinct. </p>
<p>A <strong>path</strong> is a walk, in which all the edges and all the vertices are distinct. We denote the path by  \(P^k:=x_0x_1\ldots x_{k-1}x_k\). </p>
<p>The number \(k\) of the edges in the walk (or the trail, or the path) is called its <strong>length</strong>. </p>
<p>Please note that for walks, (or trails or paths), \(k\) is allowed to be zero; thus e.g. a walk with \(k\) vertices \(W_k\) has a length of \(k-1\) edges; a path \(P^0\) consists of just one vertex (and does not contain any edges).</p>
<h4>Examples:</h4>
<p><img alt="graphs1" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/graphs1.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p>In the undirected graph above: </p>
<ul>
<li>\(abcgfcdefghabcde\) is a walk, but not a trail because the e.g. the edges \(gf\), \(ab\), etc. are passed more then once.</li>
<li>\(abcdefcg\) is a trail, but not a path because the vertex \(c\) is passed more then once.</li>
<li>\(abcdef\) is a path (every edge and every vertex is passed exactly once).</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="graphs5" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/graphs5.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p>In the digraph above: </p>
<ul>
<li>there is no path from \(e\) to \(a\), however, \(ade\) is a path from \(a\) to \(e\)</li>
<li>\(acbacbdeee\) is a walk</li>
</ul>
