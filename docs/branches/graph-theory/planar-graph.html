<h1>Definition: Planar Graph</h1>
<p>Let \(G(V,E,\gamma)\) be an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">undirected graph</a> \(G\) is called <strong>planar</strong>, if there exists a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/planar-drawing-embedding.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Planar Drawing (Embedding)">planar drawing</a> for this graph.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please note that planarity and not a property dependent on whether the graph has loops or multiedges. </li>
<li>Also, it does not matter if the edges are directed or undirected.</li>
<li>Thus, for convenience reasons, we may restrict our attention to simple undirected graphs only, when we study planar graphs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>A planar graph (left) with its planar embedding (right):</p>
<p><img alt="planar3" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/planar3.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p>A graph, which is not planar:</p>
