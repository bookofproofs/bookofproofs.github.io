<h1>Proof: By Induction</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/equivalent-definitions-of-trees.html'>Proposition: Equivalent Definitions of Trees</a>)</p>
<p>By hypothesis, $G(V,E,\gamma)$ is an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">undirected graph</a>.</p>
<h3>$(1)\Rightarrow(2)$</h3>
<ul>
<li>Let \(G\) be a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/trees-and-forests.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Trees and Forests">tree</a>.</li>
<li>Let $G^\prime(V,E^\prime,\gamma^\prime)$ be a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/subgraphs-and-supergraphs.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Subgraphs and Supergraphs; Induced Subgraph">supergraph</a> of $G$ containing at least one additional <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">edge</a> $e^\prime\in E^\prime\setminus E.$</li>
<li>Without loss of generality, assume $e^\prime$ is not a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">loop</a> (otherwise, $G^\prime$ would contain a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/closed-walks-closed-trails-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Closed Walks, Closed Trails, and Cycles">cycle</a>).</li>
<li>In other words, without loss of generality, $\gamma^\prime(e^\prime)=\{v,u\}$ with $u\neq v.$</li>
<li>Since $G$ is a tree, it is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">connected</a>.</li>
<li>Therefore, there is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/paths-cycles-and-connectivity.html" title="Graph Theory / Part: Paths, Cycles and Connectivity">path</a> $P$ connecting $u$ and $v$.</li>
<li>Since $e^\prime$ connects $u$ and $v$ directly, $P$+$e^\prime$ is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/closed-walks-closed-trails-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Closed Walks, Closed Trails, and Cycles">cycle</a>.</li>
<li>Thus, $G$ contains no cycle and any supergraph of $G$ contains a cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h3>$(2)\Rightarrow(3)$</h3>
<ul>
<li>Let $G$ contain no cycle and let any supergraph of $G$ contain a cycle.</li>
<li>Let $u,v\in V$ be a pair of any vertices. </li>
<li>Because $G$ contains no cycle, it also contains no <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">loops</a>. Therefore, we can assume $u\neq v.$</li>
<li>Let $e^\prime=\{u,v\}$ be an additional edge of the supergraph $G^\prime:=(V,E\cup\{e^\prime\},\gamma).$</li>
<li>By assumption $G^\prime$ contains a cycle and this cycle must contain $e^\prime$, since $G$ had no cycles.</li>
<li>Without loss of generality, set $C=(v=v_0,e^\prime,u=v_1,e_2,\ldots,e_k,v_k=v)$ to a cycle containing $e^\prime.$</li>
<li>It follows that $P=(u=v_1,e_2,\ldots,e_k,v_k=v)$ is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/walks-trails-paths-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Walks, Trails, and Paths">path</a> connecting $u$ and $v$ in $G.$</li>
<li>Assume, there exists another path $Q=(u=v_1,e^\prime_2,\ldots,e^\prime_k,v_k=v)$ connecting $u$ and $v$ in $G.$<ul>
<li>By assumption $P\neq Q$ and therefore, there are indices $i\in\{2,\ldots,k\}$ such that $e_i\neq e^\prime_i.$</li>
<li>By the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/well-ordering-principle-of-natural-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Well-Ordering Principle of Natural Numbers">well-ordering principle</a>, there is a minimal such index $i\ge 2.$</li>
<li>Then, the edges $e_i$ and $e^\prime_i$ connect the vertex $v_{i-1}$ with two different vertices $v_{i}$ and $v^\prime_{i},$ otherwise $(v_{i-1},e_i,v_i,e^\prime_i,v_{i-1})$ woud be a cycle.</li>
<li>Since both $P$ and $Q$ end at the same vertex $v_k=v,$ the set of indices $j$ such that $j&gt;i$ and $v_j=v^\prime_j,$ is not empty.</li>
<li>Using the well-ordering principle once again, there is a minimal index $j$ such that $i &lt; j\le k,$ and at which both paths $P$ und $Q$ meet together again.</li>
<li>This would mean that between $v_{i-1}$ and $v_j$ there is a cycle formed by parts of the paths $P$ and $Q$.</li>
<li>This is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/the-proving-principle-by-contradiction.html" title="Logic / Lemma: The Proving Principle by Contradiction">contradiction</a> to the hypothesis, $G$ contained no cycle.</li>
<li>Thus, $P$ and $Q$ are identical.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It follows that for every pair of vertices $u,v\in V$ there is exactly one <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/walks-trails-paths-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Walks, Trails, and Paths">path</a> $P^k:=x_0x_1\ldots x_{k-1}x_k$ in $G$ with $x_0=u$ and $x_k=v$.</li>
</ul>
<h3>$(3)\Rightarrow(4)$</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assume, every pair of vertices $u,v\in V$ there is exactly one <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/walks-trails-paths-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Walks, Trails, and Paths">path</a> $P^k:=x_0x_1\ldots x_{k-1}x_k$ in $G$ with $x_0=u$ and $x_k=v$.</li>
<li>Trivially, $G$ is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">connected</a>.</li>
<li>Now, let us remove any edge $e\in E$ from $G$ with $\gamma(e)=\{u,v\}.$</li>
<li>If $u=v,$ then $e$ was a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">loop</a> and $P=u$ and $Q=(u,e)$ would be two different paths from $u$ to $u.$</li>
<li>Therefore, $u\neq v.$</li>
<li>Assume $G$ without the edge $e$ is still connected.<ul>
<li>Then there is a path $Q$ from $u$ to $v$ not passing through the edge $e.$</li>
<li>But then, $Q$ and $P=(u,e,v)$ would be two different paths in $G$ connecting $u$ and $v.$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It follows $G$ is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">connected</a> and the removal of any edge leaves $G$ disconnected ($G$ is "minimally connected").</li>
</ul>
<h3>$(4)\Rightarrow(5)$</h3>
<ul>
<li>Let $G$ be minimally connected.</li>
<li>We prove first the inequality $|E|\le |V|-1$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/proving-principle-by-complete-induction.html" title="Logic / Lemma: The Proving Principle by Complete Induction">by induction</a> on $n=|V|.$<ul>
<li>Base cases $n=1$<ul>
<li>The inequality is correct since $G$ is minimally connected, there are $0$ edges in $G,$ and $0\le 1-1.$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Induction step $n\to n+1$<ul>
<li>Assume, for all trees with $k$ vertices, $1 \le k  &lt; n,$ we have $|E|\le |V|-1.$ </li>
<li>$(4)$ shows that removing any edge $e$ disconnects $G$ in some <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connectivity-is-an-equivalence-relation-components-are-a-partition-of-a-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Proposition: Connectivity Is an Equivalence Relation - Components Are a Partition of a Graph">components</a> $G_1,\ldots G_p.$</li>
<li>By induction assumption $|E_i|\le |V_i|-1$ for all $i=1,\ldots,p.$</li>
<li>Because $G_1,\ldots G_p$ are a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connectivity-is-an-equivalence-relation-components-are-a-partition-of-a-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Proposition: Connectivity Is an Equivalence Relation - Components Are a Partition of a Graph">partition</a>, we can sum up all $p$ inequalities to get $|E|\le |V|-p\le |V|-1.$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It follows $|E|\le |V|-1$ for all minimally connected graphs $G.$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We now observe that for all minimally connected graphs $|V|\le |E|+1,$ since any edge connects at most $2$ different vertices. In other words $|E|\ge |V|-1.$ </li>
<li>Since $|E|\le |V|-1$ and $|E|\ge |V|-1,$ it follows $G$ is connected and $|E|=|V|-1.$ </li>
</ul>
<h3>$(5)\Rightarrow(6)$</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every $G$ is connected and $|E|=|V|-1.$</li>
<li>Assume, $C$ is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/closed-walks-closed-trails-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Closed Walks, Closed Trails, and Cycles">cycle</a> in $G$ containing some edge $e.$ </li>
<li>Then the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/subgraphs-and-supergraphs.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Subgraphs and Supergraphs; Induced Subgraph">subgraph</a> $H$ retrieved from $G$ by removing $e$ is still connected and contains $|V|-2$ edges.</li>
<li>This is a contradiction to the hypothesis.</li>
<li>Therefore, $G$ has no cycle and  $|E|=|V|-1.$</li>
</ul>
<h3>$(6)\Rightarrow(1)$</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assume, $G$ has no cycle and  $|E|=|V|-1.$</li>
<li>By definition, $G$ is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/trees-and-forests.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Trees and Forests">forest</a>.</li>
<li>Assume, $G$ is not <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">connected</a> and consists of the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connectivity-is-an-equivalence-relation-components-are-a-partition-of-a-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Proposition: Connectivity Is an Equivalence Relation - Components Are a Partition of a Graph">components</a> $G_1,\ldots,G_p.$</li>
<li>Since every $G_i$ is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/trees-and-forests.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Trees and Forests">tree</a>, we have by the implications $(1)\Rightarrow\ldots\Rightarrow(5)$ that $|E_i|=|V_i|-1$ for $i=1,\ldots,p.$</li>
<li>It follows $$|V|-1=|E|=\sum_{i=1}^p |E_i|=\sum_{i=1}^p (|V_i|-1)=|V|-p.$$</li>
<li>Now, it follows $p=1.$</li>
<li>Therefore, $G$ is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/trees-and-forests.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Trees and Forests">tree</a>.</li>
