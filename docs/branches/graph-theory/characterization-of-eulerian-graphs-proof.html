<h1>Proof</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/characterization-of-eulerian-graphs.html'>Theorem: Characterization of Eulerian Graphs</a>)</p>
<h3>"\(\Rightarrow\)"</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assume, a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/undirected-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Undirected Graph, Vertices, Edges, Simple Graph">simple graph</a> \(G(V,E)\) is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/eulerian-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Eulerian Graph">Eulerian</a>.</li>
<li>Then there is an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/eulerian-tour.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Eulerian Tour">Eulerian tour</a>.</li>
<li>Whenever this trail passes through a vertex, there is a contribution of \(2\) to the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/vertex-degrees-for-undirected-graphs.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Vertex Degrees for Undirected Graphs">degree</a> of that vertex. </li>
<li>Since each edge is used exactly once, the degree of each vertex is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-theory/even-and-odd-numbers.html" title="Number Theory / Definition: Even and Odd Numbers">even</a>.</li>
<li>In particular, \(G\) is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">connected</a>, since every vertex is connected to any other by a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/walks-trails-paths-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Walks, Trails, and Paths">path</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>"\(\Leftarrow\)"</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assume, \(G\) is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/connected-and-disconnected-graphs-bridges-and-cutvertices.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Connected and Disconnected Graphs, Bridges and Cutvertices">connected</a>, and every one of its vertices has an even degree.</li>
<li>We know from the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/splitting-a-graph-with-even-degree-vertices-into-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Lemma: Splitting a Graph with Even Degree Vertices into Cycles">lemma about splitting a graph with even degree vertices into cycles</a> that \(G\) can be split into <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/closed-walks-closed-trails-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Closed Walks, Closed Trails, and Cycles">cycles</a> \(C_1, C_2, C_3,\ldots\), no two of which have an edge in common.</li>
<li>Fit these cycles to make an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/eulerian-tour.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Eulerian Tour">Eulerian tour</a> as follows:<ul>
<li>Start at any vertex of \(C_1\) and travel round \(C_1\) until we meet a vertex of another cycle. Without any loss of generality, let it be \(C_2\) (otherwise re-label the cycles obtained in the order provided by the above lemma). </li>
<li>Travel the edges of \(C_2\), and then resume traveling round \(C_1\).</li>
<li>This gives a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/closed-walks-closed-trails-and-cycles.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Closed Walks, Closed Trails, and Cycles">closed trail</a> that includes \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If this trail includes all the edges of \(G\), then we have found the required Eulerian tour. </li>
<li>Otherwise, travel around our new closed trail, and add a new cycle, say \(C_3\).</li>
<li>Continue this process, until you have traversed enough cycles to include all the edges of \(G\). At the worst case, we will need all the cycles constructed in the above lemma.</li>
<li>It follows that \(G\) is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/graph-theory/eulerian-graph.html" title="Graph Theory / Definition: Eulerian Graph">Eulerian</a>.</li>
