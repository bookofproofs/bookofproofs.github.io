<h1>Explanation: Calculation Rules in a Group with Additive Notation</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/calculations-in-a-group.html'>Motivation: Calculations in a Group</a>)</p>
<p>For someone who is new to <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/group-theory.html">group theory</a> but is familiar with <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/number-systems-arithmetics.html">arithmetics</a> it might be surprising, that in a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/group.html">group</a> $(G,\ast)$, the same calculation rules apply if we exchange the operation $\ast$ by an addition sign $(G, +)$ or by a multiplication sign $(G, \cdot).$ </p>
<p>For instance, in the additive notation, the above <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/simple-calculation-rules-in-a-group.html">calculation rules in a group</a> can be formulated as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>$-e=e.$</li>
<li>$-(-x)=x$ for all \(x\in G\).</li>
<li>For all \(a,b\in G\), if \(a + x=b\) then \(x=-a+b\).</li>
<li>For all \(a,b\in G\), if \(x + a=b\) then \(x=b-a\).</li>
<li>If $a+x=a+y$ then $x=y$ and if $x+a=y+a$ then $x=y.$</li>
<li>$-(x+y)=-y+(-x)$ for all \(x,y\in G\).</li>
<li>\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \ldots + x_n:=(\ldots((x_1 + x_2) + x_3) + \ldots + x_n\) holds for all \(x_i\in G\).</li>
<li>\(x_{k_1} + x_{k_2} + \ldots + x_{k_n}=x_{1} + x_{2} + \ldots + x_{n}\)</li>
</ol>
<p>The "corresponding proof":<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/simple-calculation-rules-in-a-group.html">bookofproofs$555</a>proof/ of these (seemingly different) rules is exactly the same except for the notation. Please try to write down the proof in the additive notation it as an exercise!</p>
<p>Similarly, while the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/exponentiation-in-a-group.html">exponentiation in a group</a> is a new operation, which can be defined, if you use the multiplicative notation $(G,\ast)$, the same can be done in the additive case $(G, + ).$ Here, instead of an "exponentiation", we can define a "multiplication" as a new operation and explain it in terms of addition. To be more concrete, for an integer $n\in \mathbb Z$, we can define:</p>
<p>\[n\cdot x :=
\begin{cases}
e  &amp; \text{ if } n=0 \\
x + (n-1)\cdot x &amp; \text{ if } n &gt; 0.
\end{cases}\]</p>
<p>And for negative integers $-n$:</p>
<p>$$-n\cdot x:=n\cdot (-x).$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But you have to be very cautious! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the dot sign $[\cdot"$ in $n\cdot x$ does not (!) mean that we <em>multiply</em> the integer $n$ by a group element $x$. It only means that we introduce a shorter notation for adding $n$ times the element $x\in G$ to each other. That is also the reason why it makes sense to set the result to the "neutral element]<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/existence-of-a-neutral-element.html">bookofproofs$661</a> $e\in G$ in the case $n=0,$ since we add "none" to each other.</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness, we want to reformulate the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/rules-for-exponentiation-in-a-group.html">exponentiation rules</a> and translate them into the additive notation for groups:</p>
<p>\[\begin{array}{cl}
(1)&amp;n\cdot x+ m\cdot x=(n+m)\cdot x,\\
\end{array}
\]</p>
<p>If the group is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/abelian-group.html">Abelian</a>, then
\[\begin{array}{cl}
(2)&amp;m\cdot (n\cdot x)=(mn)\cdot x.\\
(3)&amp;n\cdot x+n\cdot y=n\cdot (x + y).
\end{array}
\]</p>
<p>Again, the "proof":<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/rules-for-exponentiation-in-a-group.html">bookofproofs$676</a>proof/ would be exactly the same (try it as an exercise!).</p>
<p>Please note that the exponentiation rules - written down in the additive notation - are strongly reminiscent of a kind of a "distributivity rule" for groups. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But again, be cautious! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no distributivity rule for groups since in a group only one operation is defined - but for distributivity, we need two: addition and multiplication. Remember, and this is only a repetition of what has been said above: $n\cdot x$ does <em>not</em> mean that we multiply an integer $n$ by the group element $x.$ It only means that we add $x\in G$  $n$ times to each other.</p>
<p>The reason, why we haven't chosen the additive notation for introducing these calculation rules is that if you are a beginning student of group theory, there is a danger of confusing the operation sign $"\cdot"$ in $n\cdot x$ with the group operation, which is only the addition $(G, +).$</p>
