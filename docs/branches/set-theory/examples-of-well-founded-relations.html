<hr>

<p>By definition, <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/well-founded-relation.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Well-founded Relation">well-founded</a> relations can never be <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/reflexive-symmetric-and-transitive-binary-relations.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Reflexive, Symmetric and Transitive Binary Relations">reflexive</a>. Therefore, for instance, all <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/preorder-partial-order-and-poset.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Preorder, Partial Order and Poset">partial orders</a> are not well-founded. However, the definition of well-founded relations is not intuitive, and we want to give some concrete examples in order to get a better understanding of this definition.# Example: Examples of Well-founded Relations</p>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/well-founded-relation.html'>Definition: Well-founded Relation</a>)</p>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>Every <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/well-order-well-ordered-set.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Well-order, Well-ordered Set">well-order</a> in a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/strict-total-order-strictly-ordered-set.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Strict Total Order, Strictly-ordered Set">strictly-ordered</a> set is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/well-founded-relation.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Well-founded Relation">well-founded</a> relation. This follows immediately from the definitions of each of these two concepts. In particular, the strict order "$&lt;$" in the well-ordered set of natural numbers $(\mathbb N, &lt; )$ is well-founded. For instance, the subset $\{0\}$ has the minimal element $0,$ since there is no other natural number $m$ with $m &lt; 0.$ </p>
<h3>Example 1a</h3>
<p>Please note that if we take the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/total-order.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Total Order and Chain">total order</a> $(\mathbb N, \le)$ then it is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/well-order-well-ordered-set.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Well-order, Well-ordered Set">well-order</a> (version for <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/preorder-partial-order-and-poset.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Preorder, Partial Order and Poset">posets</a>), but it is not well-founded! For instance, the set $\{0\}$ contains $0$ as its <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/special-elements-of-ordered-sets.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Special Elements of Ordered Sets">minimum</a>, but $0$ is not <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/special-elements-of-ordered-sets.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Special Elements of Ordered Sets">minimal</a> in $\{0\}$ since $0\le 0.$ The <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/reflexive-symmetric-and-transitive-binary-relations.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Reflexive, Symmetric and Transitive Binary Relations">reflexivity</a> of "$\le$" prevents the order to be well-founded! </p>
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>The relation $R\subset\mathbb N\times\mathbb N$ defined by $nRm:\Leftrightarrow n+1=m$ means a relation in which the natural number $m$ is the successor of the natural number $n.$ This relation is well-founded since every non-empty subset of natural numbers contains at least one element $m$ such that it is <em>not</em> the successor of all of its elements. For instance, the number $3$ is not a successor of any of the elements of the subset $\{3,4,5,6\}.$</p>
<h3>Example 3</h3>
<p>Let $\mathcal P(X)$ be the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/power-set.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Power Set">power set</a> of a given <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/set-set-element-empty-set-cantor.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Set, Set Element, Empty Set">set</a> $X,$ and let $R\subseteq\mathcal P(X)\times \mathcal P(X)$ be the relation of being a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/subset-superset.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Subset and Superset">proper subset</a> "$\subset$", i.e. $xRy:\Leftrightarrow x\subset y$ is well-founded, since a given non-empty subset $S\subseteq \mathcal P(X)$ contains at least one set $x\in S$ such that it is not a proper subset of any other set $y\in S.$</p>
<h3>Example 4</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-theory/divisibility.html" title="Number Theory / Chapter: Divisibility">divisibility</a> relation $R$ defined on sets of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/set-theoretic-definitions-of-natural-numbers-ernst-zermelo-1908-john-von-neumann-1923.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Set-theoretic Definitions of Natural Numbers">natural numbers</a> defined by $X:=\{n\in\mathbb N\mid 1 \le n \}$ with $nRm \Leftrightarrow n\mid m\wedge n\neq m.$ For instance, the non-empty subset $S\subset X=\{4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$ contains $10,9,8,7,6$ as $R$-minimal elements, since there is no $w\in S$ dividing them with $w|m\wedge w\neq m.$</p>
<h3>Example 5</h3>
<p>The relation $R$ defined on the set of finite <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/strings-words-over-an-alphabet.html" title="Logic / Definition: Strings (words) over an Alphabet">strings over an alphabet</a> with a length $&gt;1$  by $nRm \Leftrightarrow n$ is a non-empty substring of $m$. For instance, take the alphabet $\{a,b,c\}$ and build the string $S=aabc$. This string has a length $&gt;2$ and contains $a,b,c$ as $R$-minimal elements since there is no substring of these strings, which is non-empty and is still in $S.$ </p>
<h3>Example 6</h3>
<p>The relation $R$ defined on the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/cartesian-product.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Cartesian Product">Cartesian product</a> $X:=\mathbb N Ã— \mathbb N$ of pairs of natural numbers, defined by $(n_1,n_2)R(m_1, m_2)\Leftrightarrow n_1 &lt; m_1\wedge n_2 &lt; m_2.$ For instance, take the non-empty subset of pairs 
$$\begin{array}{ccccc}
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\\
(3,0)&amp;(3,1)&amp;(3,2)&amp;(3,3)&amp;\ldots\\
(2,0)&amp;(2,1)&amp;(2,2)&amp;(2,3)&amp;\ldots\\
(1,0)&amp;(1,1)&amp;(1,2)&amp;(1,3)&amp;\ldots\\
(0,0)&amp;(0,1)&amp;(0,2)&amp;(0,3)&amp;\ldots
\end{array}$$
has the following $R$-minimal elements
$$\begin{array}{ccccc}
\vdots \\
(3,0) \\
(2,0) \\
(1,0) \\
(0,0)&amp;(0,1)&amp;(0,2)&amp;(0,3)&amp;\ldots
\end{array}$$</p>
<p>since only those pairs are both: contained in the subset, and there is no other pair comparable to them using the relation $R$</p>
<h3>Example 7</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/contained-relation.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Contained Relation &amp;quot;`$\in_X$`&amp;quot;">contained</a> relation $\in_X$ defined on a set $X$ is well-founded. This follows from the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/axiom-of-foundation.html" title="Set Theory / Axiom: Axiom of Foundation">axiom of foundation</a>. As a reminder, the axiom postulates </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Every non-empty set $X$ contains an element that is disjoint from X, formally $\forall X(X\neq\emptyset \Rightarrow\exists (z\in X)X\cap z=\emptyset).$"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The postulate is equivalent to </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is an element $z\in X$ and for no other element $x\in X$ we have $z\in x.$"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the definition of being a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/well-founded-relation.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Well-founded Relation">well-founded relation</a>, i.e. the axiom of foundation can be interpreted as the following requirement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Every non-empty set $X$ contains a $\in$-minimal element."</p>
