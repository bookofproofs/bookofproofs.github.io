<h1>Definition: Partial and Total Maps (Functions)</h1>
<p>Let \(A\) and \(B\) be two (not necessarily different) <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/set-set-element-empty-set-cantor.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Set, Set Element, Empty Set">sets</a> and let \(f \subseteq A \times B\) be a binary <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/relation.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Relation">relation</a>.
* a  <strong>total</strong>) <strong>function</strong> (or a <strong>map</strong>), if it is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/total-and-unique-binary-relations.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Total and Unique Binary Relations">left-total</a> and <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/total-and-unique-binary-relations.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Total and Unique Binary Relations">right-unique</a>. This is equivalant to saying that for every element \(x\in A\) there is exactly one element \(y\in B\) with \((x,y)\in f\). To express this, we write $f(x)=y$ for functions instead of writing $(x,y)\in f$ as we wrote for general relations.
* a  <strong>partial</strong>) <strong>function</strong> (or a <strong>map</strong>), if it is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/total-and-unique-binary-relations.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Total and Unique Binary Relations">right-unique</a>, but not left-total.</p>
<p>The following terms are strongly related to functions:
* $A$ is called the <strong>domain</strong> of $f$.
* $B$ is called the <strong>codomain</strong> of $f$. 
* The element \(f(x)=y\) for some $x\in A$ and $b\in B$ is called the <em>value of $f$ at the point $x$</em>.
* The set \(f[A]:=\{y\in B:f(x)=y\;\text{ for all }x\in A\}\) is called the <em>range:</em> (or <strong>image</strong>) of $f$.
* For some $y\in B$, the set $f^{-1}(y):=\{x\in A:f(x)=y\}$ is called the <em>fiber of $y$ under $f$</em>.
* The set $f^{-1}[B]:=\{x\in A:f(x)=y\text{ for all }y\in B\}$ is called the <strong>inverse image</strong> of $f$.
* If a partial function $f$ is <strong>undefined</strong> for an $a\in A$, i.e. $\not\exists b\in B:f(a)=b,$ then we write $f(a)=\perp.$</p>
