<hr>

<h1>Definition: Subset and Superset</h1>
<p>Let \(X\) be a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/set-set-element-empty-set-cantor.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Set, Set Element, Empty Set">set</a>. A set \(A\) is called a <strong>subset</strong> of \(X\) and denoted by \(A\subseteq X\), if each element of \(A\) is also an element of \(X\). Equivalently, X is a <strong>superset</strong> of \(A\), denoted as \(X\supseteq A\).</p>
<p>If, in addition, \(A\neq X\), then \(A\) is called a <strong>proper subset</strong> of \(X\) and denoted by \(A\subset X\). Equivalently, X is then a <strong>proper superset</strong> of \(A\), and denoted as \(X\supset A\). </p>
<p>We can draw supersets and subsets as Venn diagrams. In the following figure, $B$ is a subset of $A$ and $A$ is a subset of the universal set $U$:</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li>The set of all animals is the superset of all dogs.</li>
<li>The set of $A=\{\text{Italy,Georgia,Brasil}\}$ is a subset of the set $C=\{x:\, x \text{ is a country}\}.$ </li>
<li>The set of $\mathbb Z$ of all integers is a subset of the set $\mathbb Q$ of all rational numbers. </li>
