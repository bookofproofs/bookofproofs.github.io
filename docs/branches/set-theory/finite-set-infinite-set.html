<hr>

<p><a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/cardinal-number.html" title="Set Theory / Proposition: Cardinal Number">Cardinals</a> allow us to distinguish between finite and infinite sets very easy. But to really understand how this is accomplished, we have to make a connection between two facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic mathematics allows some <em>atomic objects</em> which are not sets themselves, like numbers, points, etc. In modern mathematics, almost <em>all</em> mathematical objects are sets. We will see later in <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/number-systems-arithmetics.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Branch: Number Systems and Arithmetics">number systems</a>, how numbers, including natural numbers, can be defined from a purely set-theoretical perspective. For the time being, just please keep in mind that not only the <em>set of natural numbers</em> $\mathbb N$ is a set, but also <em>every natural number</em> $n\in\mathbb N$ is a set. </li>
<li>For this reason, each natural number $n$ is a representative of its own cardinal equivalence class $|n|.$</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we are able to define exactly what it means for a set to be finite or to be infinite.</p>
