<hr>

<p>In the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/historical-development-of-set-theory.html" title="Set Theory / Part: Historical Development of Set Theory">historical development of set theory</a>, it was mentioned that <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/history/19th-century/russell.html" title="19Th Century / Person: Russell (2), Bertrand Arthur William">Russell</a> demonstrated, the following classical definition is not sufficient since it leads to paradoxical constructs. If you are a beginning student of the set theory, the classical definition of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/history/19th-century/cantor.html" title="19Th Century / Person: Cantor (2), Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp">Georg Cantor</a> (1845 - 1918) is a good starting point, because it is highly intuitive.</p>
<h1>Definition: Set, Set Element, Empty Set</h1>
<p>(Original, naive set definition of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/history/19th-century/cantor.html" title="19Th Century / Person: Cantor (2), Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp">Georg Cantor</a> (1895))<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A <strong>set</strong> is a combination of well-distinguishable, mathematical objects. Let \(X\) be a set. 
* If an object \(x\) belongs to the set \(X\), it is called ist <strong>element</strong> and written as \(x\in X\). 
* We write \(x\notin X\), if \(x\) is not an element of the set \(X\). 
* If $X$ has no elements, we call $X$ <strong>empty</strong>, and write $X=\emptyset,$ otherwise <em>non-empty</em> and write  $X\neq\emptyset.$</p>
