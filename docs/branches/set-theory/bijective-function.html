<h1>Definition: Bijective Function</h1>
<p>A function \(f:A\mapsto B\) is called <strong>bijective</strong>, if and only if it is both, <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/injective-function.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Injective Function">injective</a> and <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/surjective-function.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Surjective Function">surjective</a>.
