<hr>

<h1>Lemma: The Proving Principle by Contradiction</h1>
<p>Let \(p\) be a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/syntax-of-pl0-propositions-as-boolean-terms.html" title="Logic / Definition: Syntax of PL0 - Propositions as Boolean Terms">proposition</a> and \(\neg p\) its <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/negation.html" title="Logic / Definition: Negation">negation</a>. By showing that:
\[\neg p \Rightarrow 0\]
it follows that 
\[p = 1.\]</p>
<p>This proving method is called <strong>by contradiction</strong> or <strong>reductio ad absurdum</strong>.</p>
<p>Formally, reductio ad absordum is the following logical argument:
 $$\begin{array}{rll}
\neg p\Rightarrow 0&amp;\text{premise}&amp;\text{e.g. It is false that the sun is not shining.}\\
\hline 
p&amp;\text{conclusion}&amp;\text{e.g. Therefore, the sun is shining.}\\ 
\end{array} $$</p>
