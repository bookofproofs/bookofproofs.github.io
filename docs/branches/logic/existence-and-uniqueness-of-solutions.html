<h1>Example: Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/methods-of-mathematical-proving.html'>Part: Methods of Mathematical Proving</a>)</p>
<p>In many cases in mathematics, we are given an equation (or some equations) which depend on some unknowns and we want to find a solution to this / these equation(s). Let denote our equation by $f(x)=0$ and the unknown by $x$. The problem of finding a solution $x$ can usually be split into two different key questions. </p>
<h3>Question 1: Does $f(x)=0$ has <strong>at least</strong> one solution?</h3>
<p>This question is known as the <strong>existence problem</strong> of finding a solution for $f(x)=0.$ We can solve the existence problem by the following strategies:</p>
<h1><strong>Strategy 1</strong>: Finding an explicit solution</h1>
<p>Usually, it is possible to apply this strategy in some very few special cases. The disadvantage of this strategy is that it requires a way to solve the equation(s) and that is usually not applicable for finding the solutions in generalized cases.</p>
<h1><strong>Strategy 2</strong>: Abstract argumentation</h1>
<p>Sometimes, it is possible to find a logical argument for the existence of a solution, for instance, <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/the-proving-principle-by-contradiction.html" title="Logic / Lemma: The Proving Principle by Contradiction">by contradiction</a>. The disadvantage of this strategy is that does not supply us with an explicit solution.</p>
<h1><strong>Strategy 3</strong>: Finding a procedure (algorithm) to find a solution</h1>
<p>If we manage to find an algorithm which needs only a finite number of steps to find a solution to $f(x)=0,$ then this algorithm also solves the above existence problem.</p>
<p>If mathematicians succeed to solve the existence problem by applying e.g. the above-mentioned strategies, then they say</p>
<p><strong>"$f(x)=0$ has at least one solution."</strong> </p>
<h3>Question 2: Does $f(x)=0$ has <strong>at most</strong> one solution?</h3>
<p>This question is known as the <strong>uniqueness problem</strong> of finding a solution for $f(x)=0.$ Like for the existence problem, there are multiple strategies to tackle the uniqueness problem:</p>
<h1><strong>Strategy 1</strong>: Proof by contradiction</h1>
<p>First, we assume that $x,y$ are both solutions, i.e. $f(x)=0$ and $f(y)=0,$ and that $x\neq y.$ From these assumptions, we try to conclude a contradiction. This implies that $x=y$ which is equivalent to the uniqueness of any existing solution. </p>
<h1><strong>Strategy 2</strong>: Proof by <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/the-proving-principle-by-contraposition-contrapositive.html" title="Logic / Lemma: The Proving Principle By Contraposition, Contrapositive">contraposition</a>.</h1>
<p>In this strategy, we try to conclude that from $x\neq y$ it follows that $x$ and $y$ cannot be both solutions of $f.$ If we succeed, then it implies the uniqueness of any existing solution. </p>
<p>If mathematicians succeed to solve the uniqueness problem by applying e.g. the above-mentioned strategies, then they say</p>
<p><strong>"$f(x)=0$ has at most one solution."</strong> </p>
<p>Usually, the existence and the uniqueness problems can be treated independently from each other.</p>
