<h1>Motivation: What does not have to be proved in mathematics?</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/methods-of-mathematical-proving.html'>Part: Methods of Mathematical Proving</a>)</p>
<p>Mathematical proofs are the strength of mathematics. In the following statements, however, do not have to be proven:</p>
<h3>Mathematical Axioms</h3>
<p>Axioms are small, well-understood set of sentences, which are used to axiomatize a given mathematical branch, i.e. to show that its claims can be derived from these axioms. Typically, there are two types of axioms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Logical axioms</em>
Logical axioms are usually statements that are taken to be true within the system of logic they define (e.g. the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--1-plane-geometry/axiom-of-straight-line-determined-by-two-points.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  1 Plane Geometry / Axiom: 1.1: Straight Line Determined by Two Distinct Points">a straight line is determined by two distinct points</a>), </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Non-logical axioms</em> 
Non-logical axioms are actually defining properties for the domain of a specific mathematical theory (e.g. the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/commutativity.html" title="Algebra / Definition: Commutativity">commutativity law</a>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Modern mathematics admits multiple, equally "true" systems of logic, based on distinct systems of axioms. The system of axioms used in BookOfProofs (work in progress) can be found in the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/index/bb-index.html" title="Index / Index: By Building Blocks">Building Block Index</a>.</p>
<h3>Vacuously True Statements</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/interpretation-of-propositions-the-law-the-excluded-middle.html" title="Logic / Definition: Interpretation of Propositions - the Law of the Excluded Middle">proposition</a>: \(S\) is <strong>"vacuously true"</strong>, if it resembles statements, which can be reduced to the following basic forms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>\(\forall x: P(x) \Rightarrow Q(x)\), where it is the case that \(\forall x: \neg P(x)\).<br>
As examples, consider the following statements (all being vacuously true):</p>
<ul>
<li>"If the Sun is not a star, then it doesn't shine."</li>
<li>"If the Earth is a disk, then our ship going to the west is lost!"</li>
<li>"If \(2\times 2 \neq 4\) then \(2\times 2 +1\neq 5\)." </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(\forall x \in \emptyset: Q(x)\), where the set \(\emptyset\) is empty.<br>
As examples, consider the following statements (all being vacuously true):</p>
<ul>
<li>"All cell phones in an empty box are turned off."</li>
<li>"All cell phones in an empty box are turned on."</li>
<li>"Since all elements \(\alpha\in\emptyset\) are transitive sets, so \(\emptyset\) is an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/ordinal-number.html" title="Set Theory / Definition: Ordinal Number">ordinal number</a>."</li>
<li>"There is only one way to permute \(0\) objects. So, \(0!=1\)."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(\forall \xi: Q(\xi)\), where the symbol \(\xi\) is restricted to a type that has no representatives.<br>
As examples, consider the following statements (all being vacuously true):</p>
<ul>
<li>"Our services cover all adult persons under the age of 18."</li>
<li>"Let \(X\) be the set of integers \(x\) such that \(x^2 &lt; 0\). All such \(x\) are even, i.e. divisible by \(2\)."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
