<h1>Proof: By Euclid</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--8-continued-proportion/construction-of-sequence-of-numbers-with-given-ratios.html'>Proposition: 8.04: Construction of Sequence of Numbers with Given Ratios</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>For let the least number, $G$, measured by (both) $B$ and $C$ have be taken <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/existence-of-least-common-multiple.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.34: Existence of Least Common Multiple">[Prop. 7.34]</a>.</li>
<li>And as many times as $B$ measures $G$, so many times let $A$ also measure $H$.</li>
<li>And as many times as $C$ measures $G$, so many times let $D$ also measure $K$.</li>
<li>And $E$ either measures, or does not measure, $K$.</li>
<li>Let it, first of all, measure ($K$).</li>
<li>And as many times as $E$ measures $K$, so many times let $F$ also measure $L$.</li>
<li>And since $A$ measures $H$ the same number of times that $B$ also (measures) $G$, thus as $A$ is to $B$, so $H$ (is) to $G$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/proportional-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.20: Proportional Numbers"> [Def. 7.20] </a>, <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/proportional-numbers-are-proportional-alternately.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.13: Proportional Numbers are Proportional Alternately">[Prop. 7.13]</a>.</li>
<li>And so, for the same (reasons), as $C$ (is) to $D$, so $G$ (is) to $K$, and, further, as $E$ (is) to $F$, so $K$ (is) to $L$.</li>
<li>Thus, $H$, $G$, $K$, $L$ are in <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/geometric-progression-continued-proportion.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: Geometric Progression, Continued Proportion">continued proportion</a> in the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/ratio.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.03: Ratio">ratio</a> of $A$ to $B$, and of $C$ to $D$, and, further, of $E$ to $F$.</li>
<li>So I say that (they are) also the least (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/number.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.02: Number">numbers</a> in <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/geometric-progression-continued-proportion.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: Geometric Progression, Continued Proportion">continued proportion</a> in these ratios).</li>
<li>For if $H$, $G$, $K$, $L$ are not the least <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/number.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.02: Number">numbers</a> in <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/geometric-progression-continued-proportion.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: Geometric Progression, Continued Proportion">continued proportion</a> in the ratios of $A$ to $B$, and of $C$ to $D$, and of $E$ to $F$, let $N$, $O$, $M$, $P$ be (the least such <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/number.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.02: Number">numbers</a>).</li>

<li>So, for the same (reasons), $C$ also measures $O$.</li>
<li>Thus, $B$ and $C$ (both) measure $O$.</li>
<li>Thus, the least number measured by (both) $B$ and $C$ will also measure $O$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/least-common-multiple-divides-common-multiple.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.35: Least Common Multiple Divides Common Multiple">[Prop. 7.35]</a>.</li>
<li>And $G$ (is) the least number measured by (both) $B$ and $C$.</li>
<li>Thus, $G$ measures $O$, the greater (measuring) the lesser.</li>
<li>The very thing is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/the-proving-principle-by-contradiction.html" title="Logic / Lemma: The Proving Principle by Contradiction">impossible</a>.</li>
<li>Thus, there cannot be any <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/number.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.02: Number">numbers</a> less than $H$, $G$, $K$, $L$ (which are) continuously (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/proportional-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.20: Proportional Numbers">proportional</a>) in the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/ratio.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.03: Ratio">ratio</a> of $A$ to $B$, and of $C$ to $D$, and, further, of $E$ to $F$.</li>
<li>So let $E$ not measure $K$.</li>
<li>And let the least number, $M$, measured by (both) $E$ and $K$ have been taken <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/existence-of-least-common-multiple.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.34: Existence of Least Common Multiple">[Prop. 7.34]</a>.</li>
<li>And as many times as $K$ measures $M$, so many times let $H$, $G$ also measure $N$, $O$, respectively.</li>
<li>And as many times as $E$ measures $M$, so many times let $F$ also measure $P$.</li>
<li>Since $H$ measures $N$ the same number of times as $G$ (measures) $O$, thus as $H$ is to $G$, so $N$ (is) to $O$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/proportional-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.20: Proportional Numbers"> [Def. 7.20] </a>, <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/proportional-numbers-are-proportional-alternately.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.13: Proportional Numbers are Proportional Alternately">[Prop. 7.13]</a>.</li>

<li>And so, for the same (reasons), as $C$ (is) to $D$, so $O$ (is) to $M$.</li>
<li>Again, since $E$ measures $M$ the same number of times as $F$ (measures) $P$, thus as $E$ is to $F$, so $M$ (is) to $P$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/proportional-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.20: Proportional Numbers"> [Def. 7.20] </a>, <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/proportional-numbers-are-proportional-alternately.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.13: Proportional Numbers are Proportional Alternately">[Prop. 7.13]</a>.</li>
