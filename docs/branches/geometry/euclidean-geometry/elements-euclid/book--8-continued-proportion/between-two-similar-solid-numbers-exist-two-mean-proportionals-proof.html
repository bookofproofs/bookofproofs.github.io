<h1>Proof: By Euclid</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--8-continued-proportion/between-two-similar-solid-numbers-exist-two-mean-proportionals.html'>Proposition: Prop. 8.19: Between two Similar Solid Numbers exist two Mean Proportionals</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Let $A$ and $B$ be two <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/similar-rectangles-and-similar-cuboids.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.21: Similar Rectangles and Similar Cuboids, Similar Plane and Solid Numbers">similar solid numbers</a>, and let $C$, $D$, $E$ be the sides of $A$, and $F$, $G$, $H$ (the sides) of $B$.</li>
<li>And since similar <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-11-elementary-stereometry/solid-figures-three-dimensional-polyhedra.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 11 Elementary Stereometry / Definition: Def. 11.01: Solid Figures, Three-Dimensional Polyhedra">solid</a> (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/number.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.02: Number">numbers</a>) are those having <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/proportional-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.20: Proportional Numbers">proportional</a> sides <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/similar-rectangles-and-similar-cuboids.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.21: Similar Rectangles and Similar Cuboids, Similar Plane and Solid Numbers"> [Def. 7.21] </a>, thus as $C$ is to $D$, so $F$ (is) to $G$, and as $D$ (is) to $E$, so $G$ (is) to $H$.</li>
<li>I say that two <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/number.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.02: Number">numbers</a> fall (between) $A$ and $B$ in <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--6-similar-figures/geometric-mean-theorem.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  6 Similar Figures / Corollary: 6.08: Geometric Mean Theorem">mean proportion</a>, and (that) $A$ has to $B$ a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/cubed-ratio.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.10: Cubed Ratio">cubed ratio</a> with respect to (that) $C$ (has) to $F$, and $D$ to $G$, and, further, $E$ to $H$.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="fig19e" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/euclid/Book08/fig19e.png?raw=true" /></p>
<ul>
<li>For let $C$ make $K$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $D$, and let $F$ make $L$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $G$.</li>
<li>And since $C$, $D$ are in the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/having-the-same-ratio.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.05: Having the Same Ratio">same ratio</a> as $F$, $G$, and $K$ is the (number created) from (multiplying) $C$, $D$, and $L$ the (number created) from (multiplying) $F$, $G$, [thus] $K$ and $L$ are <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/similar-rectangles-and-similar-cuboids.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.21: Similar Rectangles and Similar Cuboids, Similar Plane and Solid Numbers">similar plane numbers</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/similar-rectangles-and-similar-cuboids.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.21: Similar Rectangles and Similar Cuboids, Similar Plane and Solid Numbers"> [Def. 7.21] </a>.</li>
<li>Thus, there exits one <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/number.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.02: Number">number</a> in <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--6-similar-figures/geometric-mean-theorem.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  6 Similar Figures / Corollary: 6.08: Geometric Mean Theorem">mean proportion</a> to $K$ and $L$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--8-continued-proportion/between-two-similar-plane-numbers-exists-one-mean-proportional.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  8 Continued Proportion / Proposition: Prop. 8.18: Between two Similar Plane Numbers exists one Mean Proportional">[Prop. 8.18]</a>.</li>
<li>Let it be $M$.</li>
<li>Thus, $M$ is the (number created) from (multiplying) $D$, $F$, as shown in the theorem before this (one).</li>
<li>And since $D$ has made $K$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $C$, and has made $M$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $F$, thus as $C$ is to $F$, so $K$ (is) to $M$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiples-of-ratios-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.17: Multiples of Ratios of Numbers">[Prop. 7.17]</a>.</li>
<li>But, as $K$ (is) to $M$, (so) $M$ (is) to $L$.</li>
<li>Thus, $K$, $M$, $L$ are in <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/geometric-progression-continued-proportion.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: Geometric Progression, Continued Proportion">continued proportion</a> in the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/ratio.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.03: Ratio">ratio</a> of $C$ to $F$.</li>
<li>And since as $C$ is to $D$, so $F$ (is) to $G$, thus, alternately, as $C$ is to $F$, so $D$ (is) to $G$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/proportional-numbers-are-proportional-alternately.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.13: Proportional Numbers are Proportional Alternately">[Prop. 7.13]</a>.</li>
<li>And so, for the same (reasons), as $D$ (is) to $G$, so $E$ (is) to $H$.</li>
<li>Thus, $K$, $M$, $L$ are in <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/geometric-progression-continued-proportion.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: Geometric Progression, Continued Proportion">continued proportion</a> in the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/ratio.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.03: Ratio">ratio</a> of $C$ to $F$, and of $D$ to $G$, and, further, of $E$ to $H$.</li>
<li>So let $E$, $H$ make $N$, $O$, respectively, <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $M$.</li>
<li>And since $A$ is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-11-elementary-stereometry/solid-figures-three-dimensional-polyhedra.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 11 Elementary Stereometry / Definition: Def. 11.01: Solid Figures, Three-Dimensional Polyhedra">solid</a>, and $C$, $D$, $E$ are its sides, $E$ has thus made $A$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> the (number created) from (multiplying) $C$, $D$.</li>
<li>And $K$ is the (number created) from (multiplying) $C$, $D$.</li>
<li>Thus, $E$ has made $A$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $K$.</li>
<li>And so, for the same (reasons), $H$ has made $B$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $L$.</li>
<li>And since $E$ has made $A$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $K$, but has, in fact, also made $N$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $M$, thus as $K$ is to $M$, so $A$ (is) to $N$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiples-of-ratios-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.17: Multiples of Ratios of Numbers">[Prop. 7.17]</a>.</li>
<li>And as $K$ (is) to $M$, so $C$ (is) to $F$, and $D$ to $G$, and, further, $E$ to $H$.</li>
<li>And thus as $C$ (is) to $F$, and $D$ to $G$, and $E$ to $H$, so $A$ (is) to $N$.</li>
<li>Again, since $E$, $H$ have made $N$, $O$, respectively, <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $M$, thus as $E$ is to $H$, so $N$ (is) to $O$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/ratios-of-multiples-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.18: Ratios of Multiples of Numbers">[Prop. 7.18]</a>.</li>
<li>But, as $E$ (is) to $H$, so $C$ (is) to $F$, and $D$ to $G$.</li>
<li>And thus as $C$ (is) to $F$, and $D$ to $G$, and $E$ to $H$, so (is) $A$ to $N$, and $N$ to $O$.</li>
<li>Again, since $H$ has made $O$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $M$, but has, in fact, also made $B$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $L$, thus as $M$ (is) to $L$, so $O$ (is) to $B$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiples-of-ratios-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.17: Multiples of Ratios of Numbers">[Prop. 7.17]</a>.</li>
<li>But, as $M$ (is) to $L$, so $C$ (is) to $F$, and $D$ to $G$, and $E$ to $H$.</li>
<li>And thus as $C$ (is) to $F$, and $D$ to $G$, and $E$ to $H$, so not only (is) $O$ to $B$, but also $A$ to $N$, and $N$ to $O$.</li>
<li>Thus,   $A$, $N$, $O$, $B$ are in <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/geometric-progression-continued-proportion.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: Geometric Progression, Continued Proportion">continued proportion</a> in the aforementioned ratios of the sides.
So I say that $A$ also has to $B$ a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/cubed-ratio.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.10: Cubed Ratio">cubed ratio</a> with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding side - that is to say, with respect to (that) the number $C$ (has) to $F$, or $D$ to $G$, and, further, $E$ to $H$.</li>
<li>For since $A$, $N$, $O$, $B$ are four <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/geometric-progression-continued-proportion.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: Geometric Progression, Continued Proportion">numbers in continued proportion</a>, $A$ thus has to $B$ a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/cubed-ratio.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.10: Cubed Ratio">cubed ratio</a> with respect to (that) $A$ (has) to $N$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/cubed-ratio.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.10: Cubed Ratio"> [Def. 5.10] </a>.</li>
<li>But, as $A$ (is) to $N$, so it was shown (is) $C$ to $F$, and $D$ to $G$, and, further, $E$ to $H$.</li>
<li>And thus $A$ has to $B$ a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/cubed-ratio.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.10: Cubed Ratio">cubed ratio</a> with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding side - that is to say, with respect to (that) the number $C$ (has) to $F$, and $D$ to $G$, and, further, $E$ to $H$.</li>
<li>(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.</li>
