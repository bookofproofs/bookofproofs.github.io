<h1>Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Those magnitudes measured by the same measure are said (to be) <strong>commensurable (in length)</strong>, but (those) of which no (magnitude) admits to be a common measure (are said to be) <strong>incommensurable (in length)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Modern Formulation</h3>
<p>Two <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--1-plane-geometry/straight-line-segment-and-ray.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  1 Plane Geometry / Definition: 1.04: Straight Line, Segment and Ray">segments</a> of lengths \(\alpha &gt; 0\) and \(\beta &gt; 0\) are called 
 <strong>commensurable (in length)</strong>, if there exists a segment of length \(\gamma\) being an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/magnitude-aliquot-part.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.01: Magnitude is Aliquot Part">aliquot part</a> of both,  \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), i.e. such that \[\alpha=p\gamma,\quad\beta=q\gamma\]

<p>Equivalently, the segments are commensurable, if their <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/ratio.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.03: Ratio">ratio</a> is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/definition-of-rational-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Definition of Rational Numbers">rational number</a>, formally,
\[\frac{\alpha}\beta=\frac{p\gamma}{q\gamma}=\frac pq.\]</p>
<p>If \(\alpha,\beta\) are not commensurable, we call them <strong>incommensurable (in length)</strong>.</p>
