<p>To be more exact, straight lines can either be commensurable in square only, incommensurable in length only, or commensurable/incommensurable in both length and square, with an assigned straight line (translator's note).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>Let the length of the assigned straight line be unity. Then rational straight lines have lengths expressible as \(k\) or \(\sqrt{k}\), depending on whether the lengths are commensurable in length, or in square only, respectively, with unity. All other straight lines are irrational (translator's note).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
