<h1>Proof: By Euclid</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/incommensurability-of-sum-of-incommensurable-magnitudes.html'>Proposition: Prop. 10.016: Incommensurability of Sum of Incommensurable Magnitudes</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>For let the two <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">incommensurable</a> magnitudes $AB$ and $BC$ be laid down together.</li>
<li>I say that that the whole $AC$ is also <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">incommensurable</a> with each of $AB$ and $BC$.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="fig015e" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/euclid/Book10/fig015e.png?raw=true" /></p>
<ul>
<li>For if $CA$ and $AB$ are not <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">incommensurable</a> then some magnitude will measure [them].</li>
<li>If possible, let it (so) measure (them), and let it be $D$.</li>
<li>Therefore, since $D$ measures (both) $CA$ and $AB$, it will thus also measure the remainder $BC$.</li>
<li>And it also measures $AB$.</li>
<li>Thus, $D$ measures (both) $AB$ and $BC$.</li>
<li>Thus, $AB$ and $BC$ are <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">commensurable</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length"> [Def. 10.1] </a>.</li>
<li>But they were also assumed (to be) <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">incommensurable</a>.</li>
<li>The very thing is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/the-proving-principle-by-contradiction.html" title="Logic / Lemma: The Proving Principle by Contradiction">impossible</a>.</li>
<li>Thus, some magnitude cannot measure (both) $CA$ and $AB$.</li>
<li>Thus, $CA$ and $AB$ are <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">incommensurable</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length"> [Def. 10.1] </a>.</li>
<li>So, similarly, we can show that $AC$ and $CB$ are also <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">incommensurable</a>.</li>
<li>Thus, $AC$ is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">incommensurable</a> with each of $AB$ and $BC$.</li>
<li>And so let $AC$ be <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">incommensurable</a> with one of $AB$ and $BC$.</li>
<li>So let it, first of all, be <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">incommensurable</a> with $AB$.</li>
<li>I say that $AB$ and $BC$ are also <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">incommensurable</a>.</li>
<li>For if they are <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">commensurable</a> then some magnitude will measure them.</li>
<li>Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be $D$.</li>
<li>Therefore, since $D$ measures (both) $AB$ and $BC$, it will thus also measure the whole $AC$.</li>
<li>And it also measures $AB$.</li>
<li>Thus, $D$ measures (both) $CA$ and $AB$.</li>
<li>Thus, $CA$ and $AB$ are <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">commensurable</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length"> [Def. 10.1] </a>.</li>
<li>But they were also assumed (to be) <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">incommensurable</a>.</li>
<li>The very thing is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/the-proving-principle-by-contradiction.html" title="Logic / Lemma: The Proving Principle by Contradiction">impossible</a>.</li>
<li>Thus, some magnitude cannot measure (both) $AB$ and $BC$.</li>
<li>Thus, $AB$ and $BC$ are <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">incommensurable</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length"> [Def. 10.1] </a>.</li>
