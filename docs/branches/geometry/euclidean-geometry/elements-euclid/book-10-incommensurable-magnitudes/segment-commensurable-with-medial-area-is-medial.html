<h3>(Corollary to Proposition 23 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>And (it is) clear, from this, that an (area) <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">commensurable</a> with a <strong>medial area</strong> is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/medial-is-irrational.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Proposition: Prop. 10.021: Medial is Irrational">medial</a>.</p>

<p>A <strong>medial area</strong> is equal to the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--1-plane-geometry/square-rectangle-rhombus-rhomboid-trapezium.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  1 Plane Geometry / Definition: 1.22: Square, Rectangle, Rhombus, Rhomboid, Trapezium">square</a> on some <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/medial-is-irrational.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Proposition: Prop. 10.021: Medial is Irrational">medial</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--1-plane-geometry/straight-line-segment-and-ray.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  1 Plane Geometry / Definition: 1.04: Straight Line, Segment and Ray">straight line</a>.
