<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Euclid introduced <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/proportional-magnitudes.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.06: Proportional Magnitudes">proportionality</a> for <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/order-relation-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Order Relation of Real Numbers">positive real numbers</a> already in Book 5 (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/proportional-magnitudes.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.06: Proportional Magnitudes">Def. 5.06</a>).</li>
<li>However, now he restricts this definition to <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/order-relation-for-integers-positive-and-negative-integers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Order Relation for Integers - Positive and Negative Integers">positive integers</a>: Euclid calls the positive integers $a,b,c$ and $d$ "proportional" if the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/rectangular-number-plane-number.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.16: Rectangular Number, Plane Number">rectangular numbers</a> \(a\cdot d\) and \(b\cdot c\) are equal, formally</li>
</ul>
<p>\[a\cdot d = b\cdot c.\]</p>
<ul>
<li>Please note that this is exactly the case if they represent the same rational numbers. </li>
<li>In fact, being proportional in the sense of the above definition is an equivalence relation which can be used to define <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/definition-of-rational-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Definition of Rational Numbers">rational numbers</a>: Two rational numbers \(a/b\) and \(c/d\) are equivalent, if and only if  $ad=bc.$</li>
</ul>
<p>\[\frac ab\sim\frac cd\Longleftrightarrow a\cdot d = b\cdot c.\]</p>
