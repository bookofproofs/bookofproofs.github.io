<h1>Proof: By Euclid</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/least-common-multiple-of-three-numbers.html'>Proposition: 7.36: Least Common Multiple of Three Numbers</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>For let the least (number), $D$, measured by the two (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/number.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.02: Number">numbers</a>) $A$ and $B$ have been taken <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/existence-of-least-common-multiple.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.34: Existence of Least Common Multiple">[Prop. 7.34]</a>.</li>
<li>So $C$ either measures, or does not measure, $D$.</li>
<li>Let it, first of all, measure ($D$).</li>
<li>And $A$ and $B$ also measure $D$.</li>
<li>Thus, $A$, $B$, and $C$ (all) measure $D$.</li>
<li>So I say that ($D$ is) also the least (number measured by $A$, $B$, and $C$).</li>
<li>For if not, $A$, $B$, and $C$ will (all) measure [some] number which is less than $D$.</li>
<li>Let them measure $E$ (which is less than $D$).</li>
<li>Since $A$, $B$, and $C$ (all) measure $E$ then $A$ and $B$ thus also measure $E$.</li>
<li>Thus, the least (number) measured by $A$ and $B$ will also measure [$E$] [[Prop. 7.35]]<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/least-common-multiple-divides-common-multiple.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.35: Least Common Multiple Divides Common Multiple">bookofproofs$2365</a>.</li>
<li>And $D$ is the least (number) measured by $A$ and $B$.</li>
<li>Thus, $D$ will measure $E$, the greater (measuring) the lesser.</li>
<li>The very thing is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/the-proving-principle-by-contradiction.html" title="Logic / Lemma: The Proving Principle by Contradiction">impossible</a>.</li>
<li>Thus, $A$, $B$, and $C$ cannot (all) measure some number which is less than $D$.</li>
<li>Thus, $A$, $B$, and $C$ (all) measure the least (number) $D$.</li>
<li>So, again, let $C$ not measure $D$.</li>
<li>And let the least number, $E$, measured by $C$ and $D$ have been taken <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/existence-of-least-common-multiple.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.34: Existence of Least Common Multiple">[Prop. 7.34]</a>.</li>
<li>Since $A$ and $B$ measure $D$, and $D$ measures $E$, $A$ and $B$ thus also measure $E$.</li>
<li>And $C$ also measures [$E$].</li>
<li>Thus, $A$, $B$, and $C$ [also] measure $E$.</li>
<li>So I say that ($E$ is) also the least (number measured by $A$, $B$, and $C$).</li>
<li>For if not, $A$, $B$, and $C$ will (all) measure some (number) which is less than $E$.</li>
<li>Let them measure $F$ (which is less than $E$).</li>
<li>Since $A$, $B$, and $C$ (all) measure $F$, $A$ and $B$ thus also measure $F$.</li>
<li>Thus, the least (number) measured by $A$ and $B$ will also measure $F$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/least-common-multiple-divides-common-multiple.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.35: Least Common Multiple Divides Common Multiple">[Prop. 7.35]</a>.</li>
<li>And $D$ is the least (number) measured by $A$ and $B$.</li>
<li>Thus, $D$ measures $F$.</li>
<li>And $C$ also measures $F$.</li>
<li>Thus, $D$ and $C$ (both) measure $F$.</li>
<li>Hence, the least (number) measured by $D$ and $C$ will also measure $F$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/least-common-multiple-divides-common-multiple.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.35: Least Common Multiple Divides Common Multiple">[Prop. 7.35]</a>.</li>
<li>And $E$ is the least (number) measured by $C$ and $D$.</li>
<li>Thus, $E$ measures $F$, the greater (measuring) the lesser.</li>

<li>Thus, $A$, $B$, and $C$ cannot measure some number which is less than $E$.</li>
<li>Thus, $E$ (is) the least (number) which is measured by $A$, $B$, and $C$.</li>
<li>(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.</li>
