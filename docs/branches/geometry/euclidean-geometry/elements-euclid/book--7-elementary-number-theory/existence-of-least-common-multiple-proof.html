<h1>Proof: By Euclid</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/existence-of-least-common-multiple.html'>Proposition: 7.34: Existence of Least Common Multiple</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>For $A$ and $B$ are either <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/coprime-relatively-prime-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.12: Co-prime (Relatively Prime) Numbers">prime to one another</a>, or not.</li>
<li>Let them, first of all, be <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/coprime-relatively-prime-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.12: Co-prime (Relatively Prime) Numbers">prime to one another</a>.</li>
<li>And let $A$ make $C$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $B$.</li>
<li>Thus, $B$ has also made $C$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $A$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/natural-number-multiplication-is-commutative.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.16: Natural Number Multiplication is Commutative">[Prop. 7.16]</a>.</li>
<li>Thus, $A$ and $B$ (both) measure $C$.</li>
<li>So I say that ($C$) is also the least (number which they both measure).</li>
<li>For if not, $A$ and $B$ will (both) measure some (other) number which is less than $C$.</li>
<li>Let them (both) measure $D$ (which is less than $C$).</li>
<li>And as many times as $A$ measures $D$, so many <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/unit-one.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.01: Unit">units</a> let there be in $E$.</li>
<li>And as many times as $B$ measures $D$, so many <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/unit-one.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.01: Unit">units</a> let there be in $F$.</li>
<li>Thus, $A$ has made $D$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $E$, and $B$ has made $D$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $F$.</li>
<li>Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) $A$ and $E$ is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) $B$ and $F$.</li>
<li>Thus, as $A$ (is) to $B$, so $F$ (is) to $E$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/relation-of-ratios-to-products.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.19: Relation of Ratios to Products">[Prop. 7.19]</a>.</li>

<li>Thus, $B$ measures $E$, as the following (number measuring) the following.</li>
<li>And since $A$ has made $C$ and $D$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $B$ and $E$ (respectively), thus as $B$ is to $E$, so $C$ (is) to $D$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiples-of-ratios-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.17: Multiples of Ratios of Numbers">[Prop. 7.17]</a>.</li>
<li>And $B$ measures $E$.</li>
<li>Thus, $C$ also measures $D$, the greater (measuring) the lesser.</li>
<li>The very thing is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/the-proving-principle-by-contradiction.html" title="Logic / Lemma: The Proving Principle by Contradiction">impossible</a>.</li>
<li>Thus, $A$ and $B$ do not (both) measure some number which is less than $C$.</li>
<li>Thus, $C$ is the least (number) which is measured by (both) $A$ and $B$.</li>

<li>So let $A$ and $B$ be not <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/coprime-relatively-prime-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.12: Co-prime (Relatively Prime) Numbers">prime to one another</a>.</li>
