<h1>Proposition: 5.11: Equality of Ratios is Transitive</h1>
<h3>(Proposition 11 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/ratio.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.03: Ratio">Ratios</a> which are) the same with the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/having-the-same-ratio.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.05: Having the Same Ratio">same ratio</a> are also the same with one another.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For let it be that as $A$ (is) to $B$, so $C$ (is) to $D$, and as $C$ (is) to $D$, so $E$ (is) to $F$.</li>
<li>I say that as $A$ is to $B$, so $E$ (is) to $F$.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modern Formulation</h3>
<p>In modern notation, this proposition reads that if \[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta\text{ and }\frac\gamma\delta=\frac\epsilon\zeta\] then \[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\epsilon\zeta\]</p>
<p>for all <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/order-relation-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Order Relation of Real Numbers">positive real numbers</a> \(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\epsilon,\zeta\).</p>
<h3>Generalized Formulation</h3>
<p>see <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/set-theory/equality-inequality.html" title="Set Theory / Proposition: The Equality of Sets Is an Equivalence Relation">any equality is an equivalence relation</a> (and in particular transitive)</p>
<p>see also <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--1-plane-geometry/equality-is-an-equivalence-relation.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  1 Plane Geometry / Explanation: 1.1: Equality is an Equivalence Relation (related to Subsection: Common Notions (all Books))">common notion 1.1</a>.
The above proposition is true for all <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/definition-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Definition of Real Numbers">real numbers</a> with \(\beta\neq 0, \delta\neq 0, \zeta\neq 0\).</p>
