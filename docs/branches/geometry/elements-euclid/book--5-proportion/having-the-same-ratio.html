<p>Magnitudes are said to be <strong>in the same ratio</strong>, the first to the second, and the third to the fourth, when equal <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiple-number-multiplying-another-number.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.05: Multiple, Number Multiplying another Number">multiples</a> of the first and the third either both exceed, are both equal to, or are both less than, equal <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiple-number-multiplying-another-number.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.05: Multiple, Number Multiplying another Number">multiples</a> of the second and the fourth, respectively, being taken in corresponding order, according to any kind of multiplication whatever.</p>
