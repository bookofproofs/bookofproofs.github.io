<h1>Definition: Geometric Progression, Continued Proportion</h1>
<p>A <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/real-sequence.html" title="Analysis / Definition: Real Sequence">sequence of real numbers</a>  \((\alpha_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\) is called a <strong>geometric progression</strong> (or a <strong>continued proportion</strong>), if its sequence members can be built recursively by \[\begin{array}{rcl}\alpha_0&amp;:=&amp;\alpha\\\alpha_n&amp;:=&amp;\alpha\beta^n\end{array}\]
for some fixed <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/definition-of-real-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Definition of Real Numbers">real numbers</a> \(\alpha,\beta\) with \(\beta\neq 0\). Thus the sequence is given by \(\alpha,\alpha\beta,\alpha\beta^2,\alpha\beta^3\ldots\).</p>
<p>The number \(\beta\) is called the <strong>common ratio</strong> or <strong>scale factor</strong>.</p>
