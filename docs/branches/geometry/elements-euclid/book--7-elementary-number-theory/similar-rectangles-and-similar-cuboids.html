<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nowadays, the term <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/similarity.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Definition: Similarity">similarity</a> is related to geometrical figures rather than numbers. </li>
<li>However, the numerical proportions of the sides of rectilinear figures are indeed a defining property of similar rectilinear figures, as it was already demonstrated by Euclid in the previous Book 6 for triangles (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--6-similar-figures/equiangular-triangles-are-similar.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  6 Similar Figures / Proposition: 6.04: Equiangular Triangles are Similar">Prop 6.04</a> and <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--6-similar-figures/triangles-with-proportional-sides-are-similar.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  6 Similar Figures / Proposition: 6.05: Triangles with Proportional Sides are Similar">Prop 6.05</a>).</li>
