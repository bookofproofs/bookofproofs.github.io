<h1>Proof: By Euclid</h1>

<ul>
<li>Let any multitude whatsoever of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/number.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.02: Number">numbers</a>, $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, be in <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/geometric-progression-continued-proportion.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: Geometric Progression, Continued Proportion">continued proportion</a>, (starting) from a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/unit-one.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.01: Unit">unit</a>.</li>
<li>And let the (number) after the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/unit-one.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.01: Unit">unit</a>, $A$, be prime.</li>
<li>I say that the greatest of them, $D$, will be measured by no other (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/number.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.02: Number">numbers</a>) except $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>

<ul>
<li>For, if possible, let it be measured by $E$, and let $E$ not be the same as one of $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>
<li>So it is clear that $E$ is not prime.</li>
<li>For if $E$ is prime, and measures $D$, then it will also measure $A$, (despite $A$) being prime (and) not being the same as it <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--9-number-theory-applications/elements-of-geometric-progression-from-one-divisible-by-prime.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  9 Number Theory Applications / Proposition: Prop. 9.12: Elements of Geometric Progression from One Divisible by Prime">[Prop. 9.12]</a>.</li>
<li>The very thing is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/the-proving-principle-by-contradiction.html" title="Logic / Lemma: The Proving Principle by Contradiction">impossible</a>.</li>
<li>Thus, $E$ is not prime.</li>
<li>Thus, (it is) composite.</li>
<li>And every <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/composite-number-euclid.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.13: Composite Number">composite number</a> is measured by some <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/prime-number.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.11: Prime Number">prime number</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/existence-of-prime-divisors-euclid.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.31: Existence of Prime Divisors">[Prop. 7.31]</a>.</li>
<li>Thus, $E$ is measured by some <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/prime-number.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.11: Prime Number">prime number</a>.</li>
<li>So I say that it will be measured by no other <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/prime-number.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.11: Prime Number">prime number</a> than $A$.</li>
<li>For if $E$ is measured by another (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/prime-number.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.11: Prime Number">prime number</a>), and $E$ measures $D$, then this (<a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/prime-number.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.11: Prime Number">prime number</a>) will thus also measure $D$.</li>
<li>Hence, it will also measure $A$, (despite $A$) being prime (and) not being the same as it <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--9-number-theory-applications/elements-of-geometric-progression-from-one-divisible-by-prime.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  9 Number Theory Applications / Proposition: Prop. 9.12: Elements of Geometric Progression from One Divisible by Prime">[Prop. 9.12]</a>.</li>
<li>The very thing is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/the-proving-principle-by-contradiction.html" title="Logic / Lemma: The Proving Principle by Contradiction">impossible</a>.</li>
<li>Thus, $A$ measures $E$.</li>
<li>And since $E$ measures $D$, let it measure it according to $F$.</li>
<li>I say that $F$ is not the same as one of $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>
<li>For if $F$ is the same as one of $A$, $B$, $C$, and measures $D$ according to $E$, then one of $A$, $B$, $C$ thus also measures $D$ according to $E$.</li>
<li>But one of $A$, $B$, $C$ (only) measures $D$ according to some (one) of $A$, $B$, $C$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--9-number-theory-applications/elements-of-geometric-progression-from-one-which-divide-later-elements.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  9 Number Theory Applications / Proposition: Prop. 9.11: Elements of Geometric Progression from One which Divide Later Elements">[Prop. 9.11]</a>.</li>
<li>And thus $E$ is the same as one of $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>
<li>The very opposite thing was assumed.</li>
<li>Thus, $F$ is not the same as one of $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>
<li>Similarly, we can show that $F$ is measured by $A$, (by) again showing that $F$ is not prime.</li>
<li>For if ($F$ is prime), and measures $D$, then it will also measure $A$, (despite $A$) being prime (and) not being the same as it <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--9-number-theory-applications/elements-of-geometric-progression-from-one-divisible-by-prime.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  9 Number Theory Applications / Proposition: Prop. 9.12: Elements of Geometric Progression from One Divisible by Prime">[Prop. 9.12]</a>.</li>

<li>Thus, $A$ measures $F$.</li>
<li>And since $E$ measures $D$ according to $F$, $E$ has thus made $D$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $F$.</li>
<li>But, in fact, $A$ has also made $D$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $C$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--9-number-theory-applications/elements-of-geometric-progression-from-one-which-divide-later-elements-1.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  9 Number Theory Applications / Corollary: 9.11: Elements of Geometric Progression from One which Divide Later Elements (related to Proposition: Prop. 9.11: Elements of Geometric Progression from One which Divide Later Elements)"> [Prop. 9.11 corr.] </a>.</li>
<li>Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) $A$, $C$ is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) $E$, $F$.</li>
<li>Thus, proportionally, as $A$ is to $E$, so $F$ (is) to $C$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/relation-of-ratios-to-products.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.19: Relation of Ratios to Products">[Prop. 7.19]</a>.</li>
<li>And $A$ measures $E$.</li>
<li>Thus, $F$ also measures $C$.</li>
<li>Let it measure it according to $G$.</li>
<li>So, similarly, we can show that $G$ is not the same as one of $A$, $B$, and that it is measured by $A$.</li>

<li>And $A$ measures $F$.</li>
<li>Thus, $G$ also measures $B$.</li>
<li>Let it measure it according to $H$.</li>
<li>So, similarly, we can show that $H$ is not the same as $A$.</li>
<li>And since $G$ measures $B$ according to $H$, $G$ has thus made $B$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/multiplication-of-numbers.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Definition: 7.15: Multiplication of Numbers"> (by) multiplying</a> $H$.</li>

<li>Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) $H$, $G$ is equal to the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--1-plane-geometry/square-rectangle-rhombus-rhomboid-trapezium.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  1 Plane Geometry / Definition: 1.22: Square, Rectangle, Rhombus, Rhomboid, Trapezium">square</a> on $A$.</li>
<li>Thus, as $H$ is to $A$, (so) $A$ (is) to $G$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--7-elementary-number-theory/relation-of-ratios-to-products.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  7 Elementary Number Theory / Proposition: 7.19: Relation of Ratios to Products">[Prop. 7.19]</a>.</li>

<li>Thus, the greatest (number) $D$ cannot be measured by another (number) except (one of) $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>
<li>(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.<div class='qed'>&#8718;</div></li>
