<h1>Proof: By Euclid</h1>
<p>(related to <a href='https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/greatest-common-measure-of-three-commensurable-magnitudes.html'>Proposition: Prop. 10.004: Greatest Common Measure of Three Commensurable Magnitudes</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Let $A$, $B$, $C$ be the three given <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">commensurable</a> magnitudes.</li>
<li>So it is required to find the greatest common measure of $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="fig004e" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/euclid/Book10/fig004e.png?raw=true" /></p>
<ul>
<li>For let the greatest common measure of the two (magnitudes) $A$ and $B$ have been taken <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/greatest-common-measure-of-commensurable-magnitudes.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Proposition: Prop. 10.003: Greatest Common Measure of Commensurable Magnitudes">[Prop. 10.3]</a>, and let it be $D$.</li>
<li>So $D$ either measures, or [does] not [measure], $C$.</li>
<li>Let it, first of all, measure ($C$).</li>
<li>Therefore, since $D$ measures $C$, and it also measures $A$ and $B$, $D$ thus measures $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>
<li>Thus, $D$ is a common measure of $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>
<li>And (it is) clear that (it is) also (the) greatest (common measure).</li>
<li>For no magnitude larger than $D$ measures (both) $A$ and $B$.</li>
<li>So let $D$ not measure $C$.</li>
<li>I say, first, that $C$ and $D$ are <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">commensurable</a>.</li>
<li>For if $A$, $B$, $C$ are <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">commensurable</a> then some magnitude will measure them which will clearly also measure $A$ and $B$.</li>
<li>Hence, it will also measure $D$, the greatest common measure of $A$ and $B$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/greatest-common-measure-of-commensurable-magnitudes-1.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Corollary: Cor. 10.003: Greatest Common Measure of Commensurable Magnitudes (related to Proposition: Prop. 10.003: Greatest Common Measure of Commensurable Magnitudes)"> [Prop. 10.3 corr.] </a>.</li>
<li>And it also measures $C$.</li>
<li>Hence, the aforementioned magnitude will measure (both) $C$ and $D$.</li>
<li>Thus, $C$ and $D$ are <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">commensurable</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length"> [Def. 10.1] </a>.</li>
<li>Therefore, let their greatest common measure have been taken <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/greatest-common-measure-of-commensurable-magnitudes.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Proposition: Prop. 10.003: Greatest Common Measure of Commensurable Magnitudes">[Prop. 10.3]</a>, and let it be $E$.</li>
<li>Therefore, since $E$ measures $D$, but $D$ measures (both) $A$ and $B$, $E$ will thus also measure $A$ and $B$.</li>
<li>And it also measures $C$.</li>
<li>Thus, $E$ measures $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>
<li>Thus, $E$ is a common measure of $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>
<li>So I say that (it is) also (the) greatest (common measure).</li>
<li>For, if possible, let $F$ be some magnitude greater than $E$, and let it measure $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>
<li>And since $F$ measures $A$, $B$, $C$, it will thus also measure $A$ and $B$, and will (thus) measure the greatest common measure of $A$ and $B$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/greatest-common-measure-of-commensurable-magnitudes-1.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Corollary: Cor. 10.003: Greatest Common Measure of Commensurable Magnitudes (related to Proposition: Prop. 10.003: Greatest Common Measure of Commensurable Magnitudes)"> [Prop. 10.3 corr.] </a>.</li>
<li>And $D$ is the greatest common measure of $A$ and $B$.</li>
<li>Thus, $F$ measures $D$.</li>
<li>And it also measures $C$.</li>
<li>Thus, $F$ measures (both) $C$ and $D$.</li>
<li>Thus, $F$ will also measure the greatest common measure of $C$ and $D$ <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/greatest-common-measure-of-commensurable-magnitudes-1.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Corollary: Cor. 10.003: Greatest Common Measure of Commensurable Magnitudes (related to Proposition: Prop. 10.003: Greatest Common Measure of Commensurable Magnitudes)"> [Prop. 10.3 corr.] </a>.</li>
<li>And it is $E$.</li>
<li>Thus, $F$ will measure $E$, the greater (measuring) the lesser.</li>
<li>The very thing is <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/logic/the-proving-principle-by-contradiction.html" title="Logic / Lemma: The Proving Principle by Contradiction">impossible</a>.</li>
<li>Thus, some [magnitude] greater than the magnitude $E$ cannot measure $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>
<li>Thus, if $D$ does not measure $C$ then $E$ is the greatest common measure of $A$, $B$, $C$.</li>
<li>And if it does measure ($C$) then $D$ itself (is the greatest common measure).</li>
<li>Thus, the greatest common measure of three given <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book-10-incommensurable-magnitudes/magnitudes-commensurable-and-incommensurable-in-length.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes / Definition: Def. 10.01: Magnitudes Commensurable and Incommensurable in Length">commensurable</a> magnitudes has been found.</li>
<li>(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.<div class='qed'>&#8718;</div></li>
