<h3>Modern Formulation</h3>
<p>Two <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--1-plane-geometry/straight-line-segment-and-ray.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  1 Plane Geometry / Definition: 1.04: Straight Line, Segment and Ray">segments</a> of lengths \(\alpha &gt; 0\) and \(\beta &gt; 0\) are called 
 <strong>commensurable in square</strong>, if there exists a figure of area \(\gamma\) being an <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/magnitude-aliquot-part.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.01: Magnitude is Aliquot Part">aliquot part</a> of the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--1-plane-geometry/square-rectangle-rhombus-rhomboid-trapezium.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  1 Plane Geometry / Definition: 1.22: Square, Rectangle, Rhombus, Rhomboid, Trapezium">square</a> areas \(\alpha^2\) and \(\beta^2\), i.e. such that \[\alpha^2=p\gamma,\quad\beta^2=q\gamma\]
for some <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/set-theoretic-definitions-of-natural-numbers-ernst-zermelo-1908-john-von-neumann-1923.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Definition: Set-theoretic Definitions of Natural Numbers">natural numbers</a> \(p &gt; 0\) and \(q &gt; 0\).</p>
<p>Equivalently, the segments are commensurable in square, if the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/ratio.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: 5.03: Ratio">ratio</a> of their squares is a <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/definition-of-rational-numbers.html" title="Number Systems Arithmetics / Proposition: Definition of Rational Numbers">rational number</a>, formally,
\[\frac{\alpha^2}{\beta^2}=\frac{p\gamma}{q\gamma}=\frac pq.\]</p>
<p>If \(\alpha,\beta\) are not commensurable in square, we call them <strong>incommensurable in square</strong>.</p>
