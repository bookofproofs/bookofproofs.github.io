<h1>Definition: Def. 11.01: Solid Figures, Three-Dimensional Polyhedra</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>solid</strong> is a (figure) having length and breadth and depth.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Modern Formulation</h3>
<p>A <strong>solid</strong> or <em>tree-dimensional polyhedron</em> is a three dimensional object with flat polygonal faces, straight edges and vertices (corners).</p>
