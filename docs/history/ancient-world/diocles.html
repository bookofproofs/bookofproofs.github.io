<h1>Person: Diocles Of Carystus</h1>

<p><strong>Diocles</strong> was a Greek mathematician who was the first to prove the focal property of a parabolic mirror and studied the cissoid curve as part of an attempt to duplicate the cube.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In this work we are told that Diocles studied the cissoid as part of an attempt to duplicate the cube.</li>
<li>The extracts quoted by Eutocius from Diocles' On burning mirrors showed that he was the first to prove the focal property of a parabolic mirror.</li>
<li>Although Diocles' text was largely ignored by later Greeks, it had considerable influence on the Arab mathematicians, in particular on al-Haytham.</li>
<li>Latin translations from about 1200 of the writings of al-Haytham brought the properties of parabolic mirrors discovered by Diocles to European mathematicians.</li>
<li>Recently, however, some more information about Diocles' life has come to us from the Arabic translation of Diocles' On burning mirrors whose discovery is described below.</li>
<li>From this work we learn that Zenodorus travelled to Arcadia and entered into discussions with Diocles, so that certainly Diocles was working in Arcadia at the time.</li>
<li>It is only recently that an Arabic translation of Diocles On burning mirrors has been found in the Shrine Library in Mashhad, Iran.</li>
<li>The first of these propositions proves what has long been known to have been first established by Diocles, namely the focal property of the parabola.</li>
<li>These constructions are again properties of the parabola that Diocles was the first to give.</li>
<li>The duplication of the cube problem, again referred to by Eutocius, is studied by Diocles in Proposition 10.</li>
<li>The next two propositions solve the problem of inserting two mean proportions between a pair of magnitudes using the cissoid curve which was invented by Diocles.</li>
<li>In On burning mirrors Diocles also studies the problem of finding a mirror such that the envelope of reflected rays is a given caustic curve or of finding a mirror such that the focus traces a given curve as the Sun moves across the sky.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 240 BC. Died about 180 BC.</p>
