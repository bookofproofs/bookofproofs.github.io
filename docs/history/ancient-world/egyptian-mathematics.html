<h1>Topic: Egyptian Mathematics</h1>
<p>The most we know about <strong>Egyptian mathematics</strong> is from the papyrus Rhind, which contained 85 problems, and the <em>Moscow</em> papyrus, containing 25 problems. The papyri were dated about 1700 BC to 1550 BC. The Rhind Papyrus was the largest and best preserved mathematical papyrus from ancient Egypt. It is a copy of papyrus from around 1850 BC. </p>
<p><img alt="portion of the Rhind Papyrus" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Egyptian_A%27h-mos%C3%A8_or_Rhind_Papyrus_%281065x1330%29.png" />
(a portion of the Rhind Papyrus, Wikimedia: Unknown - British Museum, EA10057)</p>
<p>The Egyptians had a <em>decimal system</em> with specific signs, but it was different from the modern place value system. </p>
<p>The mathematics was mostly additive. For instance, in order to multiply 11 and 13, the number 13 was written as a sum of powers of $2$, i.e. $1,4,8$, then the number $11$ was multiplied by those numbers, i.e. $11,44,88$ and the numbers were added $11+44+88=143.$ </p>
<p>The most prominent feature of Egyptian mathematics was its fractional arithmetics, which was based on the so-called <strong>unit fractions</strong>, i.e. fractions with the nominator $1.$ The Rhind Papyrus contains a table with the decomposition of the fractions $\frac 2n$ for $n=5,\ldots,331$, for instance, $$\frac 27=\frac 14+\frac 1{28},\quad \frac 2{97}=\frac 1{56}+\frac 1{679}+\frac 1{776}.$$
This kind of fractional arithmetics was cumbersome and prevented a substantial development of mathematics in Ancient Egypt. </p>
<p>The problems dealt with contents of bread and beer, with the feeding of animals or with the volumes of granaries. Some of them were more theoretical, for instance, containing <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--5-proportion/geometric-progression-continued-proportion.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  5 Proportion / Definition: Geometric Progression, Continued Proportion">geometrical progressions</a>, like the problem dealing with $7$ houses, in each of which there were $7$ cats, each which chased $7$ mice, etc. The area of the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--1-plane-geometry/circle-circumference-radius.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  1 Plane Geometry / Definition: 1.15: Circle, Circumference, Radius">circle</a> with the diameter $d$ was given as $(d-\frac d9)^2,$ which corresponds to the value $\frac{256}{11}\approx 3.1605$ for the number $\pi.$ The most remarkable result in the papyri is the formula for the volume of a pyramid trunk with a square profile: $V=\frac h3(a^2+ab+b^2)$ with $a,b$ being the lengths of the sides of the profile and $h$ being its height, because the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/book--1-plane-geometry/the-pythagorean-theorem.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Book  1 Plane Geometry / Proposition: 1.47: Pythagorean Theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a> was not yet known.</p>
