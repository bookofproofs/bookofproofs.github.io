<h1>Person: Gan De</h1>
<p><img alt="avatar.png" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/avatar.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Gan De</strong> was one of the earliest of the Chinese astronomers.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>He was one of the earliest of Chinese astronomers and made observations which he recorded giving dates and coordinates.</li>
<li>We have included Gan De this archive for one reason only.</li>
<li>That is that a quotation from his book Suixing Jing (Treatise on Jupiter) was recorded by later writers.</li>
<li>Apparently, there was a small reddish star appended to its side.</li>
<li>Of course the intriguing question is what was the small reddish star which Gan De saw?</li>
<li>If he did see one of the Galilean satellites, then it would have been Ganymede which is the brightest of the four.</li>
<li>Ganymede can have a magnitude of 4.6 which means that it is within the range which anyone might expect to see.</li>
<li>However the reason that Ganymede is not readily visible is that Jupiter, being so much brighter and so close to Ganymede when viewed from earth, obscures the faint satellite.</li>
<li>Gan De might have possessed exceptional eyesight and been able to separate the faint Ganymede and the bright Jupiter.</li>
<li>The only thing in the description which would have one doubt this is the fact that Gan De records the small star on the side of Jupiter to be reddish.</li>
<li>However, we must remember that he observed under conditions of absolutely no light pollution, something impossible today.</li>
<li>Evidence on the positive side suggesting that he did indeed observe Ganymede comes from the accuracy of his observations in general.</li>
<li>and also gave accurately observed details of the planet's movements throughout its 12 year cycle.</li>
<li>We also know that Gan De produced star catalogues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 400 BC, China. Died about 340 BC, China.</p>
