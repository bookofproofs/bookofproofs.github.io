<h1>Topic: Babylonian Mathematics</h1>
<p>As the Babylonians subdued the <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/history/ancient-world/sumerian-mathematics.html">Sumers</a> in the 18th century B.C, they have taken over their sexagesimal system and refined the underlying mathematics from <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/number-systems-arithmetics/number-systems-arithmetics.html">arithmetics</a> to <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/algebra/algebra.html">algebra</a> Babylonians were able to solve linear and quadratic equations with up to two variables and also cubic equations of the form $$x^3+x^2=a$$ for a given $a.$ Geometrical problems were often transformed into their algebraic forms. Babylonians were in the possession of formulae for the areas of simple <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/euclid-elements/book-1-plane-geometry/right-triangle-obtuse-triangle-acute-triangle.html">right-angled</a> figures, including the so-called <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/euclid-elements/book-1-plane-geometry/the-pythagorean-theorem.html">Pythagorean theorem</a> <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/square-roots.html">Square roots</a> have been approximated using the formula $$a=\sqrt{A}=\frac 12\left(a+\frac Aa\right).$$</p>
<p>Babylonian mathematics allowed to compute compound interest, for instance, problems like how long would it take to double a sum of money if the interest was $20$%. This results in the equation $$\left(1\frac 15\right)^x=2.$$ Although they did not know <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/analysis/logarithm-to-a-general-base.html">logarithms</a>, they solved such equations by finding that a solution $x$ must be between $ &gt; 3$ and $&lt; 4$ and further approximating the result by a <em>linear interpolation</em>.</p>
<p>Babylonians also studied astronomy, including the movements of the Sun, the Moon and the Planets. Especially calculations related to astronomy had to be more precise than those related to every-day measurements or taxes. Some of them have been performed with the precision up to several sexagesimal digits after the comma.</p>
