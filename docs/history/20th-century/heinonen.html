<p><strong>Juha Heinonen</strong> was a Finnish born mathematician who worked in America and was known for his research on geometric function theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>While at high school, Heinonen was passionate about athletic pursuits, especially cross-country skiing.</li>
<li>After graduating from high school, Heinonen was conscripted into the Finnish army to serve as an officer for a year.</li>
<li>Heinonen entered this university to study mathematics after serving for a year in the army.</li>
<li>Following the award of his doctorate, Heinonen continued to work as a research assistant for the Academy until 1988.</li>
<li>The year 1988 was a remarkable year for Heinonen in terms of his publications, for no fewer than six of his publications appeared.</li>
<li>In 1992 Heinonen's postdoctoral Assistant Professorship came to an end and he was appointed again as a Research Assistant in the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters.</li>
<li>In 1997 both returned to Michigan and in 2000 Heinonen became a full professor at Michigan.</li>
<li>Heinonen's research record was outstanding which was recognised by the award of an Alfred P Sloan Foundation Grant in 1992, and National Science Foundation Grants during 1989-1991, 1991-1993, 1994-1995, and 1996-1999.</li>
<li>Heinonen published two important books: (with Olli Martio and Tero Kilpeläinen) Nonlinear Potential Theory of Degenerate Elliptic Equations (1993); and Lectures on Analysis on Metric Spaces (2001).</li>
<li>In addition to these books, a 44-page pamphlet Geometric embeddings of metric spaces was published in 2003 being notes from a graduate level course Heinonen gave at the University of Jyväskylä.</li>
<li>In August 2004 Heinonen lectured on Lipschitz analysis at the 14th  Jyväskylä Summer School and the notes were published in a 77-page pamphlet.</li>
<li>In 2002 Heinonen gave the invited lecture The branch set of a quasiregular mapping at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Beijing.</li>
<li>We have already mentioned Heinonen's love of sport and his cross-country skiing achievements while at high school.</li>
<li>Heinonen died at the age of 47 'after a brief but courageous battle with kidney cancer'.</li>
<li>The Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan established the Juha Heinonen Memorial Graduate Student Fellowship in his honour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 July 1960, Toivakka, Finland. Died 30 October 2007, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.</p>
