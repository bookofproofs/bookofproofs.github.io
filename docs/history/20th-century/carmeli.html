<p><strong>Moshe Carmeli</strong> was an Iraqi-born Israeli mathematician who worked in various areas of mathematical physics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moshe was fascinated by what he heard and quickly learned the basics of the subject.</li>
<li>Carmeli finished his D.Sc. from the Technion, Haifa in 1964.</li>
<li>Carmeli's field included gravitation and gauge field theory, the theory of spinors as applied to physics, Einstein special and general relativity, and astrophysics.</li>
<li>Carmeli was author and co-author to more than 120 research papers and 9 books.</li>
<li>based on lectures given by Carmeli at the Institute of Theoretical Physics of the State University of New York at Stony Brook and at the Ben Gurion University.</li>
<li>Carmeli received many awards and honours.</li>
<li>Moshe Carmeli was a Visiting Professor and Member of the Institute for Theoretical Physics, SUNY, Stony Brook, 1977-78, and again in September and October 1981.</li>
<li>Re-envisioning Einstein's theories of Special and General Relativity and building on the work of Edwin Hubble, Dr Carmeli has suggested that the universe's expansion must be constantly accelerating, and that time is therefore relative; in other words, it can only be measured relative to the position and velocity of the measurer.</li>
<li>Carmeli's work has posed an intriguing set of problems for theoretical physicists and has even been investigated by scholars for its philosophical and religious implications.</li>
<li>He is currently on sabbatical at the University of Victoria doing research on subatomic particles with the University of Victoria physicist Fred Cooperstock, with whom Dr Carmeli has a longstanding personal and professional relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 June 1933, Baghdad, Iraq. Died 27 September 2007, Beer Sheva, Israel.</p>
