<p><strong>Shreeram Shankar Abhyankar</strong> was an Indian-born American mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although Shreeram (known to his friends as Ram) was born in Ujjain, he only spent the first two years of his life there.</li>
<li>Shreeram attended school in Gwalior and, after graduating, went to the Royal Institute of Science of Bombay University intending to major in physics.</li>
<li>The only mathematician who was there that morning was Oscar Zariski, so Abhyankar had his first meeting with Zariski who immediately began asking Abhyankar what courses he would take.</li>
<li>Abhyankar had already talked to Masani before leaving India and been advised by him on suitable courses but Zariski, quickly realising Abhyankar's potential, suggested the most advanced courses.</li>
<li>Abhyankar was awarded a Master's Degree by Harvard in 1952 and continued to study there for his doctorate advised by Zariski.</li>
<li>Zariski was very interested in the question of resolution of singularities of positive characteristic surfaces and mentioned this to Abhyankar as an important problem which was probably too difficult for a Ph.D. problem.</li>
<li>Abhyankar became fascinated with this problem, and after a tremendous effort solved it as his Ph.D. thesis.</li>
<li>Around the time that Abhyankar was a research student working in algebraic geometry, Alexander Grothendieck was taking a totally new approach to the topic.</li>
<li>In 1963 Abhyankar was appointed to Perdue University as a full professor and he was named Marshall Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at Perdue in 1967.</li>
<li>Let us quote from several of the people who knew Abhyankar and his approach to mathematics.</li>
<li>Not everyone appreciated Abhyankar's style, however, particularly his love of arguing with others.</li>
<li>In particular he loved to get into deep arguments with other professors when he was at the University of Pune and this annoyed the vice-chancellor so much that he banned Abhyankar from the premises.</li>
<li>Abhyankar was elected a Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy (1987) and a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences (1988).</li>
<li>The American Mathematical Society introduced a new honour of 'Fellow of the American Mathematical Society' in 2012 and Abhyankar was among the initial list of those receiving this honour on 1 November 2012.</li>
<li>Abhyankar suffered a heart attack in his home while sitting at his desk working on mathematics on the morning of Friday 2 November 2012.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 22 July 1930, Ujjain, India. Died 2 November 2012, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.</p>
