<p><strong>Frank Smithies</strong> was a Scottish mathematician who worked on integral equations, functional analysis, and the history of mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Frank Smithies Senior was an engineer who was a staunch trade union man with strong Socialist views.</li>
<li>It was their Socialist involvement which led to their meeting after Frank Senior moved to Edinburgh in 1907.</li>
<li>Roberts was so impressed by Frank that he accepted him free of charge.</li>
<li>Roberts did an excellent job and ensured that Frank was in a good position to take the entrance examination for Edinburgh University in March 1927.</li>
<li>This is particularly significant since Smithies developed a love of the history of mathematics and made many excellent contributions which we discuss towards the end of this biography.</li>
<li>Smithies graduated in 1933 and began research on integral equations with Hardy at Cambridge.</li>
<li>Funded by a Carnegie Fellowship and a St John's College studentship, Smithies then spent two years at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.</li>
<li>After returning to Cambridge in 1938, Smithies taught at St John's College and continued his research.</li>
<li>Smithies early work was on integral equations and in 1958 his text Integral equations was published by Cambridge University Press in their Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics and Mathematical Physics Series.</li>
<li>Although he published little in the way of original research in functional analysis after 1940, Smithies was the greatest influence on the development of the subject in Britain.</li>
<li>Smithies looks in detail at the development of the concept of an adjoint operator in the years before the Hahn-Banach theorem.</li>
<li>After Smithies retired in 1979 he began to take an interest in the history of mathematics, which he had from his undergraduate days, to a more serious level.</li>
<li>In 1982 Smithies published the paper The background to Cauchy's definition of the integral.</li>
<li>Smithies last paper was A forgotten paper on the fundamental theorem of algebra published in the Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London in 2000.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 10 March 1912, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 16 November 2002, Cambridge, England.</p>
