<h1>Person: Golub, Gene Howard</h1>

<p><strong>Gene Golub</strong> was an Amercian mathematician who worked in numerical linear algebra.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>They met for the first time in Chicago and later married, having two sons with Alvin the older and Gene the younger.</li>
<li>Golub's home was not in the Jewish area of Chicago, but he attended Haugan Elementary School which was in the Jewish area.</li>
<li>In his final semester Golub had taken the Digital Computer Programming course and he was offered a position as an assistant in the computing laboratory.</li>
<li>Had it not been for the Korean War, Golub may have ended his education at this point but remaining at the University of Illinois to study for a doctorate allowed him to get a draft deferment.</li>
<li>Following the award of his doctorate, Golub had a number of short-term posts.</li>
<li>He was invited by Eugene Isaacson to spend the year 1965-66 at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University where he was an Adjunct Assistant Professor.</li>
<li>In 1980 Golub lectured on the numerical solution of large linear systems at a summer school in France.</li>
<li>In 1992 Golub, jointly with James M Ortega, published Scientific computing and differential equations.</li>
<li>Then in 2005, jointly with Moody T Chu, Golub published Inverse eigenvalue problems: theory, algorithms, and applications.</li>
<li>The list of honours Golub received for his outstanding contributions is too long to list here.</li>
<li>However, his condition got worse nevertheless, he was feeling generally unwell and in particular his legs hurt very much.</li>
<li>Golub could not spend a day without other people.</li>
<li>Anywhere in the world, a numerical analyst knows who is meant by 'Gene'.</li>
<li>They knew that it would fall to them to do most of the writing; but Golub saw the connections, knew the literature, and made the paper happen.</li>
<li>Gene Golub was restless and never entirely happy.</li>
<li>He was a demanding friend; behind his back, we all had Gene stories to tell.</li>
<li>It was a huge back: Gene was big, dominating any room he was in, and grew more impressive and imposing with the years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 February 1932, Chicago, USA. Died 16 November 2007, Stanford, USA.</p>
