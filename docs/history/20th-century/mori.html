<h1>Person: Mori, Shigefumi</h1>

<p><strong>Shigefumi Mori</strong> is a Japanese mathematician who won a Fields Medal for his work on algebraic manifolds.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After the award of his Ph.D., Mori remained as an assistant at Kyoto until 1980 when he was appointed as a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Nagoya.</li>
<li>In 1990 Mori returned to a chair at Kyoto University.</li>
<li>Mori works on algebraic geometry.</li>
<li>Mori's work achieved a remarkable continuation of classification efforts in algebraic geometry and in many ways provides a fitting chapter in the progress of algebraic geometry through the 20th  century.</li>
<li>Mori was awarded a Fields Medal at the 1990 International Congress which was held in the city in which he had studied as a student, namely Kyoto in Japan.</li>
<li>In 1981 Mori completed the classification of Fano 3-folds and worked on the minimal model programme.</li>
<li>Shigefumi Mori initiated the program with a decisively new and powerful technique, guided the general research direction with some good collaborators along the way, and finally finished up the program by himself overcoming the last difficulty.</li>
<li>Mori has received many other awards for his outstanding work.</li>
<li>The same year as he was awarded the Fields Medal, in 1990, Mori was awarded the Cole Prize in Algebra from the American Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>Mori took the decisive steps over a ten-year period in extending the classical theory of algebraic surfaces to dimension three: prior to Mori's breakthroughs this problem seemed out of reach.</li>
<li>Mori's beautiful work also makes major inroads into the problem in higher dimensions.</li>
<li>In 1998 Mori published the monograph Birational geometry of algebraic varieties which he coauthored with János Kollár.</li>
<li>Mori continues to publish important papers such as: Rational curves on algebraic varieties (2000), (with O Fujino) A canonical bundle formula (2000), Semistable extremal neighborhoods (2002), (with V Alexeev) Bounding singular surfaces of general type (2003), and (with Y Prokhorov) Q-conic bundles (2008).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 February 1951, Nagoya, Japan.</p>
