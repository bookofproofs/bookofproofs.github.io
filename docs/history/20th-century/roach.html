<p><strong>Gary Roach</strong> was a Welsh mathematician who spent much of his career in Scotland. His research was mainly in the area of applied analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>There Roach attended Southwell Minster School where he excelled as a sportsman.</li>
<li>After graduating with his first degree, Roach joined the Royal Air Force.</li>
<li>During the years when he was working for BP and also studying for his M.Sc., Roach met and married Isabella Grace Willins Nicol, a young girl from Fife, Scotland.</li>
<li>Back in the UK, Roach was appointed as a lecturer at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, Scotland.</li>
<li>Roach was vice-convener of the committee from 1992 to 1996 and convener in 1996-97.</li>
<li>Roach's research was mainly in the area of applied analysis.</li>
<li>His early papers were: On the approximate solution of elliptic, self adjoint boundary value problems (1967); Fundamental solutions and surface distributions (1968); Approximate Green's functions and the solution of related integral equations (1970); and (jointly with Robert A Adams) An intrinsic approach to radiation conditions (1972).</li>
<li>These were the first of over 150 papers published by Roach.</li>
<li>In 1982 Roach published a second edition of the book which he had updated and added two additional chapters.</li>
<li>Roach's last three books are: (1) Wave scattering by time-dependent perturbations.</li>
<li>In his own CV, Roach gives his recreations as mountaineering, photography, philately, gardening, and music.</li>
<li>In 1983 Gary joined The Nomads Club.</li>
<li>This body, formed in 1895, exists as a forum for discussion and debate, and Gary presented an Annual Paper to the Club, on a matter chosen by the President of the year.</li>
<li>This gave Gary considerable pleasure, owing to the subject usually having absolutely nothing to do with Science or Mathematics! He was President in Session 1998-99 and was made an Honorary Member in 2010.</li>
<li>Roach received many honours including being elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1977), awarded a D.Sc. by the University of Manchester (1991), and awarded an honorary Sc.D. by the University of Łódź, Poland, in 1993.</li>
<li>We note that Roach had a long list of letters after his name: OStJ, FRSE, FRSA, FRAS, BSc, MSc, PhD, DSc, ScD, CMath.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 8 October 1933, Penpedairheol, South Wales. Died 17 March 2012, Bannockburn, Stirlingshire, Scotland.</p>
