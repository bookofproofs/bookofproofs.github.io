<h1>Person: Bers, Lipman</h1>

<p><strong>Lipman Bers</strong> was a Latvian-born American mathematician who worked on  pseudoanalytic functions, Riemann surfaces and Kleinian groups.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>There were a number of reasons why Bers chose to go to Prague at this time.</li>
<li>Indeed Bers did obtain his doctorate which was awarded in 1938 from the Charles University of Prague where he wrote a thesis on potential theory under Karl Loewner's supervision.</li>
<li>Equally dangerous was the fact that Bers had no homeland since he was a wanted man in Latvia, and was a left wing academic.</li>
<li>Bers applied for a visa to the USA and, while waiting to obtain permission, he wrote two papers on Green's functions and integral representations.</li>
<li>Between 1945 and 1949 Bers worked at Syracuse University, first at Assistant Professor, later as Associate Professor.</li>
<li>Gelbart wanted to build up the department at Syracuse and attracting both Bers and Loewner was an excellent move.</li>
<li>Here Bers began work on the problem of removability of singularities of non-linear elliptic equations.</li>
<li>Bers then became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton where he began work on Teichmüller theory, pseudoanalytic functions, quasiconformal mappings and Kleinian groups.</li>
<li>When Bers met Lavrent'ev three years later he asked him the same questions and, indeed, Ahlfors had been correct in guessing why Lavrent'ev had credited him.</li>
<li>In 1951 Bers went to the Courant Institute in New York, where he was a full professor, and remained there for 13 years.</li>
<li>In 1958 Bers address the International Congress of Mathematicians in Edinburgh, Scotland, where he lectured on Spaces of Riemann surfaces and announced a new proof of the measurable Riemann mapping theorem.</li>
<li>In his talk Bers summarised recent work on the classical problem of moduli for compact Riemann surfaces and sketched a proof of the Teichmüller theorem characterizing extremal quasiconformal mappings.</li>
<li>Bers was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1959-60, and a Fulbright Fellow in the same academic year.</li>
<li>From 1959 until he left the Courant Institute in 1964, Bers was Chairman of the Graduate Department of Mathematics.</li>
<li>In 1964 Bers went to Columbia University where he was to remain until he retired in 1984.</li>
<li>During this period Bers was Visiting Miller Research Professor at the University of California at Berkeley in 1968.</li>
<li>We have yet to say something about Bers' great passion for human rights.</li>
<li>Bers received many honours for his contributions in addition to those we have mentioned above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 May 1914, Riga, Russia (now Latvia). Died 29 October 1993, New Rochelle, New York, USA.</p>
