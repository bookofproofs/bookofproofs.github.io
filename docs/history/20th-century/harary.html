<p><strong>Frank Harary</strong> was an American mathematician known as one of the "fathers" of modern graph theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Harary family, however, originally came from Syria.</li>
<li>Frank, the first of their children, was brought up in New York where he attended school.</li>
<li>Harary was awarded his doctorate in 1948 for his thesis The Structure of Boolean-like Rings.</li>
<li>Harary was appointed as an Instructor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1948.</li>
<li>In 1950 Harary published a paper containing results from his doctoral thesis.</li>
<li>Harary notes that it was submitted to the American Mathematical Society in November 1948 but was then sent to Duke Mathematical Journal in March 1949.</li>
<li>Harary was steadily promoted in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan becoming an assistant professor in 1953, an associate professor in 1959, and a professor of mathematics in 1964.</li>
<li>Harary's research moved towards graph theory.</li>
<li>The second half of the 1960s saw another side of the activities of Harary and his wife Jayne Perlman.</li>
<li>"We just wanted these properties for the land value," claims Harary, "we wanted to move the tenants out." "But we don't want to see the tenants in the streets," adds Mrs Harary.</li>
<li>Harary's most famous book was his classic Graph theory published in 1969.</li>
<li>Harary wrote five further books, each one written jointly with a colleague.</li>
<li>The final two books published by Harary were both jointly written with Per Hage.</li>
<li>It is quite impossible to give even an indication of the papers that Harary wrote due to the remarkable number.</li>
<li>MathSciNet lists around 600 items as authored by Frank Harary, but this does not tell the whole story since over 100 of his papers appeared in journals concerned with topics other than mathematics, not covered by MathSciNet.</li>
<li>Many people considered Harary to be the world-leading graph theorist and he was in much demand to lecture to universities, societies, academies and other organisations.</li>
<li>In a rather outdated CV (probably written in 1998), Harary recorded that he had lectured in 166 different cities in the United States and 274 cities in other countries.</li>
<li>Harary received many honours for his contributions.</li>
<li>Harary and his wife Jayne were divorced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 March 1921, New York City, New York, USA. Died 4 January 2005, Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA.</p>
