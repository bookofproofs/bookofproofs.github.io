<h1>Person: Leech, John</h1>

<p><strong>John Leech</strong> was an English mathematician who is best known for the <em>Leech lattice</em> which is important in the theory of finite simple groups.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After graduating Leech was appointed to a post with Ferranti in Manchester where he worked on the construction of an early digital computer.</li>
<li>In 1954 Leech left Ferranti to return to Cambridge, becoming a research student in the mathematical laboratory.</li>
<li>Leech was appointed as Reader and first Head of Computing Science at Stirling.</li>
<li>Leech is, however, best known for the Leech lattice which gives rise to three sporadic simple groups.</li>
<li>In 1965 he submitted a supplement to the paper giving a packing in 24 dimensions with a lattice now known as the Leech lattice.</li>
<li>Leech knew that the symmetry group would be interesting, and he worked on it for some time giving a lower bound for its order (which later proved to be the actual order of the group).</li>
<li>A few weeks before his death, Leech visited us in St Andrews on each day for about a week and four of us worked on a number of problems which had been left unsolved by Leech 30 years before.</li>
<li>Leech died almost exactly one month after Gorenstein who had overseen the classification of finite simple groups.</li>
<li>The three sporadic groups which Conway deduced from Leech's lattice play an important role in the classification.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 July 1926, Weybridge, Surrey, England. Died 28 September 1992, On board the SS Waverley, at sea between Rothesay and Largs, Scotland.</p>
