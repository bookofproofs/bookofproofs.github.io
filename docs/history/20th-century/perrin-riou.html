<h1>Person: Perrin-Riou, Bernadette</h1>

<p><strong>Bernadette Perrin-Riou</strong> is a French mathematician who has made important contributions to number theory. She was awarded the 1999 Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize from the American Mathematical Society.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Both Perrin-Riou's parents had been born in Les Vans but, her mother being a physicist and her father a chemist working in Paris, the family moved to Neuilly-sur-Seine, within the Paris area.</li>
<li>It was in Neuilly-sur-Seine that Bernadette and her two sisters were brought up.</li>
<li>Bernadette's two sisters became physicists, but she was turned on to mathematics by an inspiring teacher, Pascal Monsellier, when she was studying at the Lycée.</li>
<li>The small-scale, personal atmosphere was well suited to Perrin-Riou, and she found that she liked to delve deeply into subjects.</li>
<li>Perrin-Riou completed her undergraduate studies in 1977 and began to undertake research.</li>
<li>In 1983, following the award of her doctorate, Perrin-Riou was appointed Maître de Conférences at the Pierre et Marie Curie University.</li>
<li>In 1985 Perrin-Riou's second child was born, another son.</li>
<li>At the International Congress of Mathematicians at Zürich in 1994, Perrin-Riou gave the invited address p-adic L-functions.</li>
<li>In this volume, Perrin-Riou presents a theory of p-adic L-functions coming directly from p-adic Galois representations (or, more generally, from motives).</li>
<li>The work described in this text led to Perrin-Riou being awarded several major prizes.</li>
<li>In 2001 Perrin-Riou published another major text Théorie d'Iwasawa des Representations p-adiques Semi-Stables Ⓣ(Iwasawa Theory of p-adic  semi-stable representations).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 August 1955, Les Vans, Ardèche, France.</p>
