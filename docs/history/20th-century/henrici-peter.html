<p><strong>Peter Henrici</strong> was a Swiss mathematician best known who worked in the field of numerical analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>By this time Henrici was working in the United States.</li>
<li>In 1951 Henrici had gone to the United States where he obtained a position at the American University in Washington, D.C, and also was a visitor at the National Bureau of Standards.</li>
<li>Let us look briefly at some of the classic texts that Henrici published.</li>
<li>Another impressive text by Henrici Elements of numerical analysis appeared in 1964.</li>
<li>These texts were rightly praise as remarkable achievements, but the high point of Henrici's writings must he the three volume work Applied and computational complex analysis.</li>
<li>In 1964 Henrici was an invited plenary speaker at the sixteenth British Mathematical Colloquium held in Leicester and he lectured to the Colloquium on Some applications of the quotient-difference algorithm in classical analysis.</li>
<li>Peter Henrici the man - his personality, his warmth and humour and modesty - will remain in our memories, as will for some of us his passion for music, the experience of listening to or playing with an extraordinarily gifted pianist.</li>
<li>A Prize has been established to honour Henrici.</li>
<li>This Prize is given to honour Peter Henrici who was such an eminent figure in Applied Mathematics and Numerical Analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 13 September 1923, Basel, Switzerland. Died 13 March 1987, Zürich, Switzerland.</p>
