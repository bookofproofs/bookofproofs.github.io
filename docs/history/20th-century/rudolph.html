<h1>Person: Rudolph, Daniel Jay</h1>

<p><strong>Daniel Rudolph</strong> was an American mathematician who worked in ergodic theory and dynamical systems.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Of course, as part of his studies in theoretical physics, Rudolph studied mathematics courses and he soon decided that he wanted to be a mathematician rather than a theoretical physicist.</li>
<li>After graduating with a B.S., Rudolph went to Stanford University to undertake research.</li>
<li>Rudolph's 59-page thesis was entitled Non-Bernoulli Behavior of the Roots of K-Automorphisms and it earned him a Ph.D. in 1975.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate, Rudolph spent the year 1975-76 as a postdoctoral fellow at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</li>
<li>In the summer of 1976 Rudolph returned to the United States, taking up a fellowship at the Miller Institute of the University of California at Berkeley.</li>
<li>Several papers by Rudolph appeared while he was at the Hebrew University.</li>
<li>Rudolph spent three years at Stanford (1978-81) but during this time he stayed at the University of Maryland during the autumn of 1979 participating in the 'Special Year in Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems'.</li>
<li>Rudolph's older brother Gregory had studied at Fort Collins High School and Colorado State University, graduating with a degree in physical science in 1969.</li>
<li>He married Kristin Ellen Johnson on 17 March 1968; they had two children, Lisa Michelle Rudolph (born 1970) and Scott Bowen Rudolph (born 1972).</li>
<li>The plane, a twin-engine Beechcraft, piloted by Gregory Rudolph crashed while attempting to land at Cedar City Airport.</li>
<li>Dan Rudolph spent 23 years at the University of Maryland where he was appointed as a full professor in 1985.</li>
<li>Before 1991, Rudolph would work at the university all day and then spend his evenings with friends or participating in his modern dance.</li>
<li>In fact he would often perform with modern dance companies and a friend even choreographed a duet dedicated to Rudolph's parents entitled 'For Bill and Johnalou' in which he starred.</li>
<li>In 1991 Rudolph married Michelle Hyde; they had three children, Beatrice, Jonah and Layton.</li>
<li>Rudolph was devoted to his children and evenings became a precious time to be spent with the children - no longer with friends or dance.</li>
<li>Rudolph published two important books.</li>
<li>In fact Janet Whalen Kammeyer was Rudolph's first Ph.D. student, writing her thesis Classifying the two point extensions of Bernoulli Z actions at the University of Maryland and receiving the degree in 1988.</li>
<li>In 2005 Rudolph was appointed to the Albert C Yates Endowed Chair in Mathematics in the College of Natural Sciences of Colorado State University.</li>
<li>However, a second tragedy soon hit the Rudolph family.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 October 1949, Sheridan, Wyoming, USA. Died 4 February 2010, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.</p>
