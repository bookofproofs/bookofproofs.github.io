<p><strong>Sixto Ríos García</strong> was a Spanish mathematician who wrote many important papers in both analysis and statistics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although Sixto's parents were both teachers, both his fraternal and maternal grandparents were involved in agriculture.</li>
<li>He was an influence on the young Sixto, encouraging him to read and appreciate books.</li>
<li>In 1916, when Sixto was three years old, his parents requested a transfer to teach in schools in Los Navalmorales, Toledo, and their request was granted.</li>
<li>One of Ríos's fellow students, but slightly older, was Luis Antonio Santaló.</li>
<li>Ríos was elected as a student representative on the Faculty Board in 1930 and, in the following year, was awarded a scholarship by the Mathematical Seminar and there met Julio Rey Pastor for the first time; Rey Pastor was based in Argentina but spent a short time in Madrid each winter.</li>
<li>In the academic year 1931-32 Ríos studied a course on Mathematical Statistics taught by Esteban Terradas.</li>
<li>On 22 June 1932 Ríos was awarded a Bachelor's degree in Exact Sciences from the Universidad Central de Madrid.</li>
<li>One day Ríos placed on the chalkboard, before Barinaga arrived, an easy and simple solution he had found to one of the difficult problems.</li>
<li>Ríos was excused military service on health grounds but the Commander of the Military Command of Cercedilla required him to become his assistant secretary, making him teach mathematics to military chiefs.</li>
<li>The delay in publication of the papers (written four years earlier) was due to the civil war and similarly there was a delay in Ríos receiving the prize, which did not happen until 15 November 1941.</li>
<li>In January 1943 Ríos became Head of the Analysis Section of the Jorge Juan Institute of the Higher Council of Scientific Research.</li>
<li>On 11 December of the same year Ríos was awarded the Alfonso X El Sabio Prize for his work La prolongación analítica de la integral de Dirichlet Stieltjes Ⓣ(The analytic continuation of the integral of Dirichlet-Stieltjes).</li>
<li>María was twenty-three years old and Ríos was thirty-seven at the time of their marriage.</li>
<li>Ríos with his sons Sixto Ríos-Insua and David Ríos-Insúa collaborated on the six author paper Allais phenomena and completeness of preferences (1997) with J Pachón, M A Pacios and P García Barreno.</li>
<li>Before taking up the chair of statistics, Ríos had published a number of books on analysis such as Lectures on the theory of the integral (Spanish) (1942), Lectures on the theory of the analytic continuation of Dirichlet series (Spanish) (1943), La Prolongación Analítica de la Integral de Dirichlet-Stieltjes Ⓣ(The analytical continuation of the Integral of Dirichlet-Stieltjes) (1944), Conferencias sobre la Representación Analítica de Funciones Ⓣ(Conferences on the analytical representation of functions) (1945), and Conceptos de Integral Ⓣ(Concepts of Integral) (1946).</li>
<li>With his move from analysis to statistics, Ríos has a publication list with a remarkable range of important works.</li>
<li>Ríos received many honours, some of which we now list.</li>
<li>In 1958 Ríos was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.</li>
<li>In the following year he was honoured with the street in which he was born in Pelahustán being named 'Sixto Ríos'.</li>
<li>In 1983, at the age of 70, Ríos retired.</li>
<li>His son, Sixto Ríos-Insua, died in Madrid on 11 June 2008 and less than a month later Ríos died of bronchitis at the Clínica de la Luz in Madrid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 January 1913, Pelahustán, Toledo, Spain. Died 8 July 2008, Madrid, Spain.</p>
