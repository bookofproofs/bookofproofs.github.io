<p><strong>Rufus Isaacs</strong> was an American mathematician who specialised in game theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Philip Isaacs came from a lowly background but became a successful businessman.</li>
<li>Rufus was brought up in New York City where he attended the Franklin School.</li>
<li>After graduating, Isaacs was employed by the Carrier Corporation of Syracuse, New York.</li>
<li>After two years with the Carrier Corporation, where his talent and problem solving abilities were greatly appreciated, Isaacs enrolled in the Master's mathematics programme at Columbia University in New York.</li>
<li>Isaacs constructed a theory of functions of a complex variable which springs entirely and basically from the concept of the difference quotient (instead of the derivative) and called these functions monodiffric.</li>
<li>In his Ph.D. Thesis, Isaacs presented 29 new theorems with proofs and applications ...</li>
<li>In 1941, even before the award of his Ph.D., Isaacs had taken up a job with Hamilton Standard Propellers, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</li>
<li>This firm was a major manufacturer of aircraft propellers and Isaacs was employed as a Senior Analytical Engineer.</li>
<li>The marriage is considered by Isaacs as the prime event of his life.</li>
<li>Isaacs joined Hamilton Standard Propellers around the time the United States entered World War II.</li>
<li>In 1945, after the war ended, Isaacs was appointed as an assistant to Karl Menger in the Mathematics Department of Notre Dame University, South Bend, Indiana.</li>
<li>Back once again in the aviation industry, Isaacs was involved in the design of intercontinental guided missiles.</li>
<li>Let us return to our description of Isaacs' career.</li>
<li>In addition to these positions, Isaacs was a professor at George Washington University, Washington, DC, from 1961 to 1967.</li>
<li>After these many jobs in industry, Isaacs became a full-time academic for the final ten years of his working life.</li>
<li>Isaacs returned to one of his many mathematical loves, namely pure mathematics, when he published the paper The distribution of primes in a special ring of integers in 1979.</li>
<li>Isaacs received several honours for his innovative work.</li>
<li>One final honour that we note is the establishment of the Rufus Isaacs prize by the International Society of Dynamic Games.</li>
<li>Some vignettes in recent years capture images of the man friends will remember with affection: Rufus visiting the sailing ship Cutty Sark to verify the accuracy of his hand crafted model, the radio-transmitting unloseable golf ball he purchased out of curiosity and promptly lost, and his professed desire to write a book entitled 'Engineering for Mathematicians'.</li>
<li>Isaacs did not have many years of retirement to enjoy since, at the age of 66, he died from cancer in Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 June 1914, New York City, New York, USA. Died 18 January 1981, Baltimore, USA.</p>
