<p><strong>Leonard Carlitz</strong> was an American mathematician who published more than 700 papers mainly in  finite field theory, number theory and combinatorics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Michael Carlitz sold coffee in Philadelphia and, later, ran a tobacco store in the same city.</li>
<li>Leonard attended school in Philadelphia and his remarkable academic talents were clear at this time.</li>
<li>On completing his Master's degree, Carlitz remained at the University of Pennsylvania to study for his doctorate which was supervised by Howard H Mitchell (a student of Oswald Veblen).</li>
<li>Carlitz replied: "During his lifetime Gauss gave seven different proofs of this result.</li>
<li>Immediately after the award of his doctorate, Carlitz received a National Research Council Fellowship which let him spend a year at the California Institute of Technology working with E T Bell.</li>
<li>They had two sons Michael Carlitz, born in 1939, and Robert D Carlitz born in 1945.</li>
<li>Michael Carlitz became a IBM computer programmer while Robert became a University of Pittsburgh physics professor.</li>
<li>In a way he was lucky for two members of the Mathematics Department at Duke University, Joseph M Thomas and John H Roberts, both had connections to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and learnt first hand about Carlitz's talents.</li>
<li>This changed when Thomas and Roberts were appointed, in 1930 and 1932 respectively, who were then able to add Carlitz in 1932.</li>
<li>His supervising professor there reported that Carlitz "so far excelled the other students here as to be literally in a class by himself." Only the "serious financial situation" at Pennsylvania, the professor explained, kept them from offering Carlitz a position there, and he was being considered at several major universities.</li>
<li>Thomas, Roberts, Gergen and Carlitz taught almost all the mathematics graduate courses at Duke University until the 1950s.</li>
<li>Carlitz remained on the Faculty at Duke from his appointment in 1932 until he retired in 1977.</li>
<li>Carlitz was involved in the plans that were drawn up for the journal and he served on its editorial board from 1938 to 1973.</li>
<li>Carlitz was Managing Editor of the Duke Mathematical Journal from 1945.</li>
<li>Carlitz strongly opposed this and argued strongly that the board should keep its role in appointing new board members.</li>
<li>Indeed, Carlitz was a mentor not only to his students but to a number of younger mathematicians.</li>
<li>34 (1967), 293-305 and also J V Brawley, 'Dedicated to Leonard Carlitz: The Man and his Work', Finite Fields Appl.</li>
<li>MathSciNet lists 237 papers with Carlitz's name in the title.</li>
<li>Looking at the first few of these which occur in papers written in the last ten years we see: Carlitz's identity for the Bernoulli numbers; Al-Salam-Carlitz polynomials; Carlitz-type qqq-Euler polynomials; Carlitz's qqq-Bernoulli numbers; Carlitz inversions and identities; Carlitz module analogues of Mersenne primes; Carlitz cyclotomic polynomials; Rademacher-Carlitz polynomials; Carlitz-Wan conjecture for permutation polynomials; Carlitz rank of permutations; Tricomi-Carlitz polynomials; Stieltjes-Carlitz polynomials; Carlitz's type q-tangent numbers; q-generating functions of the Carlitz; Carlitz-Srivastava polynomials; Carlitz's trilinear generating functions; Bernoulli-Carlitz numbers; Carlitz's q-operators; Dedekind-Carlitz polynomials; Carlitz algebras; Carlitz logarithms; Carlitz-Goss gamma function; and Carlitz compositions.</li>
<li>1 (2) (1995), a volume specially dedicated to Carlitz.</li>
<li>Shortly after his return to Duke University, Professor Carlitz sent me a large package of reprints along with a number of very helpful comments and references.</li>
<li>Even in the several months prior to his death, Carlitz could readily identify the composers of the classical music pieces to which he was listening.</li>
<li>Clara Carlitz died in 1990 after their marriage which had lasted 57 years.</li>
<li>Carlitz continued to live in his home on the edge of the campus until June 1999 when he was 92 years of age and his health was failing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 26 December 1907, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 17 September 1999, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.</p>
