<p><strong>Brian Kuttner</strong> was an English mathematician who worked on Fourier Series.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His mother was Lilian Frances Kuttner (born in Stepney about 1875).</li>
<li>Brian Kuttner had a younger brother Conrad Adolph  and sister Elsa Marion (twins born 1910).</li>
<li>Brian Kuttner attended University College School in London and from there he won a scholarship to study at Christ's College Cambridge.</li>
<li>Kuttner spent a while in Göttingen studying with Edmund Landau and received his doctorate in 1934.</li>
<li>However, before the award of his doctorate Kuttner had been appointed in 1932 as an assistant lecturer at the University of Birmingham.</li>
<li>At Birmingham Kuttner joined the Mathematics Department headed by G N Watson.</li>
<li>Most of Kuttner's early work is on Fourier series and summability.</li>
<li>Hardy quotes some of these early results of Kuttner's in his treatise Divergent series (1949).</li>
<li>at the age of only 26, Kuttner proved a basic theorem in the general theory of trigonometric series, a result delightful for both the deceptive simplicity of its statement and the elegance of its proof.</li>
<li>Zygmund greatly admired this theorem of Kuttner, which now occupies an honoured place in Zygmund's monumental work on trigonometric series.</li>
<li>Kuttner's interests outside mathematics included travelling and walking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 April 1908, London, England. Died 2 January 1992, Birmingham, England.</p>
