<h1>Person: Khruslov, Evgenii Yakovlevich</h1>

<p><strong>Evgenii  Khruslov</strong> is a Ukrainian mathematician who applied the theory of partial differential equations to physical problems.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Evgenii managed to find some old maps printed on strong paper which they used to fill cracks.</li>
<li>After these years of terror, life improved for Khruslov when he began his schooling on 1 September 1944.</li>
<li>Khruslov's eyesight was not perfect, so he failed the medical examination and was forced to look for another higher education Institution.</li>
<li>Mathematics was one of the topics that had fascinated Khruslov ever since his days at school.</li>
<li>He had noticed that Khruslov's colleagues always asked for his help when they had a mathematical problem to solve so Klyagin approached Khruslov and offered to introduce him to Marchenko whom he described as "a real mathematician".</li>
<li>The meeting went ahead and this marked the beginning of a life-long friendship between Khruslov and Marchenko.</li>
<li>Realising that Khruslov was a skilled engineer, Marchenko explained the problem to him.</li>
<li>Despite the fact that Khruslov did not have a solid background in mathematics at this time, he was able to make good progress with the problem in under a week using an unconventional approach.</li>
<li>Marchenko, amazed at how quickly and how deeply Khruslov had penetrated into the problem and, realising what potential he had, suggested to him that he study for a Candidate's Degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.) at the at the Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering.</li>
<li>Although Khruslov had large gaps in his mathematical knowledge, Marchenko persuaded him that these could be quickly filled if he was working with mathematicians.</li>
<li>The Tyazhpromelectroproject did not want to lose their excellent engineer Khruslov but they released him from his duties so that he could study at the Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering.</li>
<li>In 1961 Khruslov began research at the Institute working on problems suggested by Marchenko.</li>
<li>In 1964 Khruslov and his advisor published the joint paper Boundary value problems with fine-grained boundary in the journal Mathematics Miscellany.</li>
<li>In 1965 Khruslov was awarded a Candidate's Degree for the innovative work on differential equations in his thesis Dirichlet boundary value problems in domains with fine-grained boundary for self-adjoint elliptic operators.</li>
<li>Typical of Khruslov's work on fluid flow is his paper (with V A L'vov) Perturbation of a viscous incompressible fluid by small particles (Russian) (1978).</li>
<li>In 1986 Khruslov was appointed head of the Department of Mathematical Modelling of Physical Processes at the Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering.</li>
<li>But Khruslov was always an optimist - not only by his words but, first and foremost, by working hard on getting talented young people into research work ...</li>
<li>A distinctive feature of Khruslov's approach is that he promotes the disciples of his colleagues with the same energy as he does his own pupils.</li>
<li>Khruslov did not just work at the Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering for he also has been giving lectures on various topics at the Kharkov National University where he has supervised a number of PhD students.</li>
<li>Khruslov has been honoured in several different ways.</li>
<li>Outside mathematics, Khruslov's main hobby is sport.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 January 1937, Kharkov, Ukraine.</p>
