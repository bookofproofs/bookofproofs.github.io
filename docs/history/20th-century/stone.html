<p><strong>Stone</strong> is best known for the Stone-Weierstrass theorem on uniform approximation of continuous functions by polynomials.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>During the period that he was an instructor Stone's interests followed very much those of his research supervisor Birkhoff.</li>
<li>In 1928 Stone was promoted to associate professor at Harvard.</li>
<li>Although he would return to Harvard again in 1933, Stone first accepted a post as associate professor at Yale from 1931 to 1933.</li>
<li>During these years Stone's research took a number of different directions.</li>
<li>Stone's book is very different in spirit, in aim, in tone, in style, in timeliness, and in applicability.</li>
<li>The work was begun in 1928, when Stone was 25; it was published when he was 29.</li>
<li>This article included the celebrated Stone-von Neumann uniqueness theorem.</li>
<li>These papers contain what today is called Stone-Čech compactification theory.</li>
<li>One particularly important result proved by Stone during this period was a substantial generalisation of Weierstrass's theorem on uniform approximation of continuous functions by polynomials.</li>
<li>This result is now known as the Stone-Weierstrass theorem.</li>
<li>This did not happen easily for Stone negotiated for a year with Robert Maynard Hutchins, President of the University of Chicago, before taking up the appointment.</li>
<li>Stone did an outstanding job in returning this famous research school to the eminence it had previously known.</li>
<li>Stone won the argument, the offer was made to Whitney, but he turned it down preferring to remain at Harvard.</li>
<li>Again Stone won the argument and this time the offer was accepted.</li>
<li>Stone continued to appoint leading mathematicians.</li>
<li>This last appointment proved the hardest to get past the Chicago administration and Stone threatened to resign in a bid to get his own way.</li>
<li>From 1952 Stone stepped down as head of department in favour of Mac Lane but he remained at Chicago until he retired in 1968.</li>
<li>Stone received many honours for his outstanding achievements.</li>
<li>Stone was elected president of the International Mathematical Union in 1952-54 and he was president of the International Committee of Mathematical Instruction from 1961 to 1967.</li>
<li>Marshall Stone was a man with a very broad outlook and a wide range of interests who seems to have thought rather deeply about a number of issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 8 April 1903, New York, USA. Died 9 January 1989, Madras (now Chennai), India.</p>
