<p><strong>Archibald Macintyre</strong> was an English mathematician who worked on complex analysis. He taught in Aberdeen and at the Univeversity of Cincinatti. He was married to Sheila Scott Macintyre.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>William Macintyre, who used his middle name of Archibald, was born in 1878 in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, and was a schoolmaster at a public elementary school in Sheffield.</li>
<li>Archibald Macintyre was educated at the Central Secondary School, Sheffield.</li>
<li>The school opened on 10 March 1880 as the Central Higher Grade School in the centre of Sheffield, and re-located to its present site at High Storrs (and renamed High Storrs Grammar School) in 1933, a few year Macintyre had completed his studies there.</li>
<li>Macintyre spent the academic year 1929-30 undertaking research at Cambridge advised by Edward Collingwood.</li>
<li>Collingwood, although seven years older than Macintyre, had a rather unusual route to teaching at Cambridge.</li>
<li>After one year of research at Cambridge, Macintyre was appointed as a temporary Assistant Lecturer attached to the Mathematics Department of Swansea University College.</li>
<li>Archibald Read Richardson had been appointed as professor of mathematics at Swansea in 1920 and was head of department at this time.</li>
<li>Macintyre moved to Sheffield in 1931 where he was appointed as an Assistant Lecturer in the Mathematics Department.</li>
<li>Through an introduction by Edmund Whittaker, Macintyre met the mathematician Sheila Scott.</li>
<li>Archibald and Sheila Macintyre undertook some joint mathematical work.</li>
<li>In volume 23 of the Journal of the London Mathematical Society (1948) there are two papers by the Macintyres.</li>
<li>The first, by Sheila Scott Macintyre, is an 8-page entitled A functional inequality while the next paper, by Archibald Macintyre, is a 3-page paper entitled Note on the preceding paper.</li>
<li>Sheila Macintyre proved two new theorems attacking Wright's question while Archibald Macintyre used one the lemmas in Sheila Macintyre's paper to generalise a theorem proved by Wright in an earlier paper.</li>
<li>A few years later, in 1952, the two Macintyres published a more conventional type of joint paper, namely the 2-author work Theorems on the convergence and asymptotic validity of Abel's series which was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</li>
<li>Archibald Macintyre was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 3 March 1947.</li>
<li>At Aberdeen, Macintyre was thesis advisor to James Clunie.</li>
<li>They returned to Aberdeen in 1959 but, on 30 September of that year, Archibald Macintyre resigned his Senior Lectureship at Aberdeen so that he could take up a permanent post as Research Professor in Mathematics at Cincinnati.</li>
<li>Sheila Macintyre resigned her Lectureship at the same time and was also appointed as a professor in the Mathematics Department at Cincinnati where she taught until her early death from breast cancer in March 1960.</li>
<li>In 1963 Macintyre was named Charles Phelps Taft Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cincinnati.</li>
<li>Although Macintyre is best known for his work in pure mathematics, he did have interests in applied mathematics and physics.</li>
<li>Finally, let us record that Macintyre was a member of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, the London Mathematical Society and the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 July 1908, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. Died 4 August 1967, Ohio, USA.</p>
