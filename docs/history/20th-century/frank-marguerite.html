<p><strong>Marguerite Straus Frank</strong> is famed both for her remarkable new discoveries of simple Lie algebras, and her solution to the problem of maximising a concave quadratic function, now known as the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Marguerite Straus's parents were Julius Salomone Straus (known as Jules) (1886-1946) and Paula Straus (1899-?).</li>
<li>Jules Straus was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, on 17 September 1886.</li>
<li>Paula Straus was born in Pinsk, Poland on 2 February 1899.</li>
<li>Marguerite sent the early years of her life in Paris where she began her education at a private school.</li>
<li>Jules Straus had became ill in 1924 when he contracted encephalitis lethargica during an epidemic.</li>
<li>Paula Straus made visits to New York, where she stayed in the Barbizon Plaza Hotel, and to Canada in the years 1935, 1936 and 1937.</li>
<li>Marguerite at this time is eleven years old, 4 ft 8 ins tall with brown hair and brown eyes.</li>
<li>Marguerite Straus attended the Jarvis Collegiate Institute, a high school in Toronto named after Jarvis Street where it is located.</li>
<li>Straus quickly became enthusiastic about the algebra she was learning in his classes.</li>
<li>Straus graduated with a B.A. from the University of Toronto in 1947 and won a fellowship to attend graduate school at Harvard University.</li>
<li>Richard Brauer had given Straus a love of algebra but at Harvard she was assigned to Oscar Zariski who was working on algebraic geometry.</li>
<li>Zariski had been appointed to the chair of mathematics at Harvard in 1947, the year in which Straus began her graduate studies there.</li>
<li>Although when she arrived at Harvard, Straus had been expecting to study first for a Master's degree, then proceed to a Ph.D., in fact she somewhat lost confidence in herself in the highly charged competitive environment.</li>
<li>Marguerite sensed a grudging tolerance and disparagement in his glance, and she seemed to freeze in his presence.</li>
<li>Marguerite arranged to take classes in history and philosophy in Paris, France, back where she had spent the first eleven years of her life.</li>
<li>Over the next few years Marguerite returned to Canada for the summer.</li>
<li>While she was in Paris, Straus met Joseph Nathaniel Frank when both attended discussion groups at the Collège Philosophique.</li>
<li>By this time Marguerite and Joseph were close and they decided that the would return together to Chicago.</li>
<li>Marguerite felt sure he would understand both Noether's work and her own.</li>
<li>Marguerite introduced herself, but glossed over her previous education.</li>
<li>Marguerite was struck with the contrast with her former supervisor.</li>
<li>Marguerite wrote out the solution in longhand and brought it to Professor Albert's office.</li>
<li>Marguerite had discovered a brand new class of simple Lie algebras.</li>
<li>Once he learned that Marguerite had studied under Brauer and Zariski, her achievement made sense to him.</li>
<li>This paper by Marguerite Frank was A new class of simple Lie algebras (1954).</li>
<li>Marguerite Frank and Adrian Albert worked on the ideas that Marguerite Frank had developed and discovered further infinite classes of simple Lie algebras.</li>
<li>While in Chicago, Marguerite Frank wrote up her Ph.D. thesis entitled New simple Lie algebras which was submitted to Harvard University where she was still registered as a graduate student.</li>
<li>Marguerite Frank joined the optimisation group at Princeton run by Albert Tucker who was collaborating with Harold Kuhn (1925-2014).</li>
<li>Marguerite started to find out about linear programming, the simplex method of George Dantzig, and game theory.</li>
<li>Joseph Frank, a world leading expert on the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky, died in Palo Alto, California, on 27 February 2013.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 8 September 1927, Paris, France.</p>
