<p><strong>Laurence Chisholm Young</strong> was a German-born mathematician who worked in measure theory, the calculus of variations, optimal control theory and potential theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Laurence attended the Gymnasium in Lausanne and completed his studies two years early.</li>
<li>It was a difficult period for Laurence, ready intellectually to be studying at university, but held back by the illness.</li>
<li>Young was Isaac Newton Student at Cambridge in 1930, was awarded an MA in 1931 after studying with Fowler and Littlewood, and he was elected to a fellowship in 1931.</li>
<li>Young first met Joan Elizabeth Mary Dunnett in 1927 when he was asked by Geoffrey Miller to come with him when he went to have tea with his cousin Elizabeth.</li>
<li>Young remained at Wisconsin-Madison for the rest of his career, retiring in 1975 at the age of 70.</li>
<li>In 1969 Young published Lectures on the calculus of variations and optimal control theory.</li>
<li>This book is based on the theory of generalised curves, a topic which Young himself founded.</li>
<li>Another important book written by Young was Mathematicians and their times: History of mathematics and mathematics of history published in 1981.</li>
<li>This book is an outstanding one based on Young's reading of the original source material.</li>
<li>The book also tells us a great deal about the way Young himself approached mathematics.</li>
<li>Of course to read original sources requires a great knowledge of languages and this Young certainly possessed.</li>
<li>After he retired, Young taught students at the University of Campinas in Brazil for many years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 July 1905, Göttingen, Germany. Died 24 December 2000, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.</p>
