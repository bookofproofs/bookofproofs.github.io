<p><strong>Murray Macbeath</strong> was a Scottish mathematician who worked at Bletchley Park during the war. He specialised in discrete and transformation groups.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alexander Macbeath, Murray's father, was a Highlander born in Applecross, Ross, Scotland.</li>
<li>Alec Macbeath was a lecturer in Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow when their first child, a son Murray the subject of this biography, was born.</li>
<li>Murray was the eldest of his parents' four children, having a sister Catriona Kennedy Macbeath (1925-2013) who was born in Glasgow, and two brothers, Innis Stewart Macbeath (1928-1996) and Alan Macbeath (1930-2001), both born in Belfast.</li>
<li>Murray and his younger siblings were all brought up in Belfast where their father worked for the rest of his career.</li>
<li>Murray's school education was in Belfast and he continued his university studies there at Queen's University, graduating with a B.A. with first class honours in Mathematics in 1942.</li>
<li>Macbeath was assigned to Hut 7 which had the task of breaking the Japanese navy codes.</li>
<li>Others, such as Gordon Welchman, have taken a different approach and so much of the work done by Macbeath and others at Bletchley Park is now well known.</li>
<li>Macbeath spoke Gaelic as well as English but to crack Japanese codes one had to be fluent in Japanese.</li>
<li>Macbeath published Non-convex regions in three and more dimensions (1949) and participated in the Seminar on convex sets at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, during 1949-1950.</li>
<li>Macbeath spoke in the seminar on compactness theorems and his contribution appeared in the mimeographed notes that were produced.</li>
<li>In 1950 Macbeath was awarded his Ph.D. by Princeton University for his 53-page thesis The Geometry of Non-Homogeneous Lattices.</li>
<li>Before returning to England, Macbeath and two friends travelled round the United States in a car.</li>
<li>Back in England, Macbeath was appointed as a senior fellow at Clare College, Cambridge.</li>
<li>Macbeath left Cambridge when he was appointed as a lecturer at the newly opened University College of North Staffordshire which had been founded in 1949.</li>
<li>It became the University of Keele in 1962 but Macbeath left long before that to take up the chair of mathematics at University College, Dundee.</li>
<li>Macbeath was appointed to fill the chair of mathematics at University College, Dundee, taking up the appointment in 1953.</li>
<li>Henry Jack was one of the lecturers in Macbeath's department and they wrote the joint paper The volume of a certain set of matrices (1959).</li>
<li>It was while he was in Dundee that Macbeath became interested in Hurwitz Groups, a topic in which he became a leading expert.</li>
<li>In 1963, Macbeath was appointed professor of mathematics at Birmingham University and he held this post until 1979.</li>
<li>Soon after arriving in Birmingham, Macbeath published Elementary Vector Algebra (1964).</li>
<li>Macbeath was a good athlete and liked to keep fit.</li>
<li>Macbeath retired in 1990 and returned to live in his native Scotland.</li>
<li>In England, Macbeath lived in Wellesbourne, Warwickshire, and now was given an honorary position at the University of Warwick.</li>
<li>Among the honours that Macbeath received, we note that he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 7 March 1955.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 30 June 1923, Glasgow, Scotland. Died 14 May 2014, Warwick, England.</p>
