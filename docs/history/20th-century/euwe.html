<h1>Person: Euwe, Machgielis</h1>
<p><img alt="Euwe.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Euwe.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Machgielis "Max" Euwe</strong> was a Dutch chess grandmaster and mathematician. He was the fifth player to become World Chess Champion.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>However, Euwe was indeed a very fine mathematician who concentrated more on his mathematics throughout his life than on his chess.</li>
<li>Max Euwe's parents were Elisabeth and Cornelius Euwe.</li>
<li>When he was eighteen years old Euwe was awarded his Abitur after attending a six-form High School in Amsterdam.</li>
<li>Euwe made his first trip abroad, going to England to play in the famous Hastings Chess Tournament where he took fourth place.</li>
<li>It should not be thought that Euwe kept his study of chess distinct from his mathematical studies.</li>
<li>Euwe then lectured on mathematics in Winterswyk and Rotterdam and was appointed to the Lyceum for Girls in Amsterdam, teaching mathematics there from 1926 to 1940.</li>
<li>His doctoral studies behind him, from December 1926 to January 1927 Euwe narrowly lost a match with Alekhine 2 games to 3 won with 5 draws.</li>
<li>At this stage Alekhine was not World Chess Champion, but soon after this he won the title and Euwe saw that, having competed so well with Alekhine, he was in with a chance at becoming World Champion himself.</li>
<li>It had always been the intention of the rules that this should not be possible, but the rule that a game is a draw if the same sequence of moves occurs three times in succession was not, as Euwe showed, sufficient.</li>
<li>However in an Euwe - Capablanca match which was played later Euwe lost 0 wins to 2 with 8 draws.</li>
<li>Euwe played the Nottingham International Chess Tournament from 10 August to 28 August 1936 while he was World Champion.</li>
<li>Despite this overall impression of caution, it is worth noting that Euwe shared the prize for the most wins in his score during the tournament.</li>
<li>While Euwe was World Champion he changed the way that players competed for the title.</li>
<li>The one exception was the return match between Euwe and Alekhine which went ahead according to the conditions already arranged at the time of the first match.</li>
<li>In his return match with Alekhine things went badly for Euwe after winning the first game, and he lost the match by a margin of five points.</li>
<li>After this Euwe went through a rather bad spell as regards his chess.</li>
<li>During the war Euwe led work to provide food for people through an underground charity organisation.</li>
<li>Euwe became interested in electronic data processing and was appointed as Professor of Cybernetics in 1954.</li>
<li>In 1970 Euwe was elected the president of FIDE and held that position until 1978.</li>
<li>Euwe made huge efforts to ensure that the match was played but, unfortunately, despite every effort eventually the match had to be awarded to Karpov by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 20 May 1901, Watergraafsmeer, near Amsterdam, Netherlands. Died 26 November 1981, Amsterdam, Holland.</p>
