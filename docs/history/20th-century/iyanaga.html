<h1>Person: Iyanaga, Shokichi</h1>

<p><strong>Shokichi Iyanaga</strong> was a Japanese mathematician who published some papers in topology, functional analysis, and geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In his second year of study Iyanaga took further courses by Takagi which developed group theory, representation theory, Galois theory, and algebraic number theory.</li>
<li>Although it was this latter topic which would eventually attract Iyanaga, at this stage of his undergraduate career he was attracted to differential equations.</li>
<li>Iyanaga's paper was so good that Yosiye had it published in the Japanese Journal of Mathematics.</li>
<li>Surprisingly Iyanaga wrote a second paper while in his second undergraduate year.</li>
<li>Both Iyanaga's two papers appeared in print in 1928.</li>
<li>In his third undergraduate year Iyanaga was allowed to take part in Takagi's seminar on class field theory.</li>
<li>A question by Takagi led Iyanaga to prove a result which further led to his first paper on class field theory (and his third published paper while he was an undergraduate).</li>
<li>Graduating in 1929, Iyanaga remained at Tokyo University where he worked under Takagi for his doctorate.</li>
<li>For example K Shoda, who was a student of Takagi, had studied with Schur in Berlin and with Emmy Noether in Göttingen, and returned to Japan around the time that Iyanaga began his graduate studies.</li>
<li>Most of the graduate students from Tokyo went to study in Germany but Iyanaga decided to go to France as well as Germany.</li>
<li>Takagi came over to Europe for this Congress (he was vice-President) and met up with Iyanaga who had gone from Hamburg to Zürich for the Congress.</li>
<li>Iyanaga went to Paris in 1932 where he met up with Chevalley whom he had got to know well while in Hamburg.</li>
<li>In fact Iyanaga did, for various reasons, little original research from this time on.</li>
<li>Iyanaga managed to solve a question of Artin on generalising the principal ideal theorem and this was published in 1939.</li>
<li>Iyanaga was promoted to Professor at Tokyo University in 1942 but by this time Japan had entered World War II.</li>
<li>Iyanaga joined the Science Council of Japan in 1947.</li>
<li>In 1965 Iyanaga became Dean of the faculty of Science at Tokyo University.</li>
<li>One important role which Iyanaga had that we have not yet mentioned was that of President of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction from 1975 to 1978.</li>
<li>Iyanaga received honours such as being awarded the Rising Sun from Japan in 1976, being elected a member of the Japan Academy of Science in 1978, and receiving the Order of Legion d'Honneur from France in 1980.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 2 April 1906, Tokyo, Japan. Died 1 June 2006, Tokyo, Japan.</p>
