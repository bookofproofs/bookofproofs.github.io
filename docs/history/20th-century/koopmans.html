<ul>
<li>His parents, Sjoerd Koopmans and Wijtske van der Zee, were both school teachers who held education in the highest regard.</li>
<li>Home life was happy with much music making (Tjalling was taught to play the violin) and frequent religious instruction.</li>

<li>The first discovery was by L V Kantorovich, a Soviet citizen, the second was by T C Koopmans, Dutch, and the third by G B Dantzig, American.</li>
<li>Koopmans joined the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics at the University of Chicago in 1944.</li>
