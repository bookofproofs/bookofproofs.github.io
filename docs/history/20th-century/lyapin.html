<p><strong>Evgeny Sergeevich Lyapin</strong> was a Ukranian mathematician who worked in algebraic systems.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Because his health was poor, Sergey Evgenyevich, who had been born in St Petersburg, had been sent to Yalta in the Crimea when he was a young boy.</li>
<li>It was in Odessa that Sergey Evgenyevich's son, Evgeny Sergeevich, was born.</li>
<li>Evgeny Sergeevich was interested in mathematics, physics, economics and history when at high school.</li>
<li>Not accepted for the subject of his first choice, Evgeny Sergeevich decided that he would study history.</li>
<li>This, it was explained to Evgeny Sergeevich, would open doors to him and allow him to study at university.</li>
<li>In 1936 Lyapin graduated from Leningrad State University but continued to undertake research there under the supervision of V A Tartakovskii.</li>
<li>At this time Lyapin's research was on the theory of groups and he published his first papers on this topic in 1936-37.</li>
<li>During the siege Lyapin remained in Leningrad but had to give up his mathematical research and contribute to the war effort.</li>
<li>Lyapin began to publish papers on semigroups, the first of these appearing in 1947.</li>
<li>Lyapin worked extensively on partial groupoids and the results from his many papers were put together to form a monograph written jointly with A E Evseev  and published in Russian as Partial algebraic actions in 1991.</li>
<li>Yet, if a faculty member would come to inform him of some negative aspects in the work of a colleague, Lyapin would always stop such conversation demanding that both faculty members meet and discuss the matter between them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 September 1914, Odessa, Russian Empire (now Ukraine). Died 13 January 2005, St Petersburg, Russia.</p>
