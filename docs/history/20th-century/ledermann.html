<p><strong>Walter Ledermann</strong> was a refugee from Germany who did his doctorate at St Andrews and taught here until 1946. He did important work in algebra and in particular in group theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although very little mathematics was taught in German schools in general, Walter had the advantage that the Leibniz Gymnasium taught more mathematics than other schools as a mark of respect for Leibniz after whom the school was named.</li>
<li>In 1928, when he was seventeen years old, Ledermann graduated from the Leibniz Gymnasium and received the necessary certificate which allowed him to study at any German university.</li>
<li>At the University of Berlin Ledermann was taught by many famous mathematicians including Schur, Schmidt, von Mises, Planck, Schr√∂dinger, Hopf, Feigl, and others.</li>
<li>Ledermann spent one semester in 1931 in Marburg but other than this all his courses were taken in Berlin.</li>
<li>He was not, however, allowed to lecture but he examined Ledermann before the end of 1933.</li>
<li>Ledermann was nearing the end of his studies for the Staatsexamen (which would allow him to teach) when Hitler came to power and began passing the anti-Jewish legislation.</li>
<li>It was quite clear to Ledermann that he had to leave Germany to escape the Nazi persecution of the Jews.</li>
<li>Ledermann's doctoral studies were supervised by Turnbull and he was awarded his Ph.D. in 1936.</li>
<li>Ledermann was able to use his expert knowledge of matrix theory to put the work of this group onto a sound mathematical footing.</li>
<li>The quality of the work Ledermann undertook at this time is clearly shown from the fact that Edinburgh awarded him a D.Sc. for it in 1940.</li>
<li>While in Edinburgh Ledermann also worked with Max Born and A C Aitken.</li>
<li>In 1938 Ledermann returned to St Andrews.</li>
<li>Your special knowledge of the applications of mathematics to problems involving matrices and statistics is an advantage; but you will realise, Walter, in view of the needs of this Department, that proficiency in teaching Applied Mathematics and the functions connected therewith will be important.</li>
<li>Ledermann remained at St Andrews from 1938 until 1946.</li>
<li>Ledermann accepted a lectureship at the University of Manchester in 1946.</li>
<li>By the time he left Manchester, Ledermann had been promoted to a Senior lecturer.</li>
<li>As well as work in matrix theory which we have commented on above, Ledermann was especially known for his work in homology theory, group theory, and number theory.</li>
<li>Other books which Ledermann has written for undergraduates include Complex numbers (1960), Integral calculus (1964), Multiple integrals (1966), Introduction to group theory (1973), and Introduction to group characters (1977).</li>
<li>Among the editorial work undertaken by Ledermann is his editorship of the Journal of the London Mathematical Society (1968-71) and of the Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society (1974-77).</li>
<li>Ledermann has received honours for his work which include election to the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1944) and an honorary doctorate from the Open University (1993).</li>

* In 1938 Ledermann returned to St Andrews.
* Your special knowledge of the applications of mathematics to problems involving matrices and statistics is an advantage; but you will realise, Walter, in view of the needs of this Department, that proficiency in teaching Applied Mathematics and the functions connected therewith will be important.
* Ledermann remained at St Andrews from 1938 until 1946.
* Ledermann's wife Ruth (known as Rushi) was a psychotherapist and the newly married couple decided to move to a bigger city so that Ruth might be able to pursue her work.
* Ledermann accepted a lectureship at the University of Manchester in 1946.
