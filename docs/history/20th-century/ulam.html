<h1>Person: Ulam, Stanislaw Marcin</h1>

<p><strong>Stan Ulam</strong> solved the problem of how to initiate fusion in the hydrogen bomb. He also devised the 'Monte-Carlo method' widely used in solving mathematical problems using statistical sampling.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>At the age of ten, Ulam entered the gymnasium in Lwów and, about this time, he became interested first in astronomy and then in physics.</li>
<li>However this required an understanding of mathematics and so, at age 14, he began to study mathematics from books, going well beyond the school level mathematics he was learning.</li>
<li>Now with interests in astronomy, physics and mathematics, Ulam entered the Polytechnic Institute in Lwów.</li>
<li>Ulam obtained his Ph.D. from the Polytechnic Institute in Lwów in 1933 where he studied under Banach.</li>
<li>Ulam, in 1930, strengthened Banach's result by proving it without using the Generalised Continuum Hypothesis.</li>
<li>In 1935 Ulam received an invitation from von Neumann to visit the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton for a few months.</li>
<li>In 1940 Ulam was appointed as an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin.</li>
<li>In 1943 Ulam became an American citizen.</li>
<li>This two-stage radiation implosion design, which became known as the Teller-Ulam configuration, led to the creation of modern thermonuclear weapons.</li>
<li>Ulam, with J C Everett, also proposed the 'Orion' plan for nuclear propulsion of space vehicles.</li>
<li>A crippling technical weakness coupled with an extraordinarily creative imagination is the drama of Stan Ulam.</li>
<li>While Ulam was at Los Alamos, he developed the 'Monte-Carlo method' which searched for solutions to mathematical problems using a statistical sampling method with random numbers.</li>
<li>Ulam's writing include A collection of mathematical problems (1960), Sets numbers and universes (1974) and Adventures of a Mathematician (1976).</li>
<li>Thus Ulam has always had a very hard time bringing himself to write anything for publication, either in long hand or with a typewriter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 13 April 1909, Lemberg, Austrian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 13 May 1984, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA.</p>
