<h1>Person: Zuse, Konrad</h1>

<p><strong>Konrad Zuse</strong> was a German  computer pioneer who invented the world's first programmable computer: the Z3.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It was these studies in engineering which led Zuse to become interested in developing a mechanical device for calculating around 1934.</li>
<li>After graduating Zuse joined the Henschel Aircraft Company where he worked on stress analysis.</li>
<li>His work again involved a great deal of calculation and so, to help him perform these calculations, Zuse built his Z1 computer in his parents living room.</li>
<li>Zuse completed the machine in 1938.</li>
<li>The main reason why Zuse succeeded in building his mechanical computer where Babbage had failed, was the fact that Zuse's Z1 was a binary machine with two position switches to represent 0 and 1.</li>
<li>However, to say that Zuse succeeded with the Z1 is a bit of an exaggeration, for the machine did not work very well.</li>
<li>Zuse's plans to develop a bigger and better computer the Z2 involved keeping the same memory system but replacing the mechanical arithmetic unit by electromechanical relays.</li>
<li>He then progressed to build the Z3 which was the first computer which Zuse built to be used rather than to test out his ideas.</li>
<li>However when Zuse proposed a computer based on electronic valves, the proposal was rejected on the grounds that the Germans were so close to winning the War that further research effort was not necessary.</li>
<li>Some of Zuse's computers were destroyed in bombing raids near the end of the war although the Z3 was reconstructed in 1960 for display in a museum in Munich.</li>
<li>Zuse began work on his Z4 computer in 1942, and it was almost complete when, due to continued air raids, it was moved from Berlin to Göttingen.</li>
<li>Zuse designed several computers other than those of his Z series.</li>
<li>The L1 computer which Zuse designed was not for solving arithmetical problems, but rather it was designed to solve logical problems.</li>
<li>Zuse set up his own computing company in 1950 and it was taken over by the Siemens electronics firm in 1967.</li>
<li>Zuse continued to undertake research on computers and acted as a consultant to Siemens after the firm took over complete control of Zuse's computer company in 1969.</li>
<li>As well as his hardware developments Zuse was also interested in software and he developed the first algorithmic programming language known as "Plankalkül" in 1945.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 22 June 1910, Berlin-Wilmersdorf, Germany. Died 18 December 1995, Hünfeld (near Fulda), Germany.</p>
