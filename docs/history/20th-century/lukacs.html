<p><strong>Eugene Lukacs</strong> was a Hungarian-American statistician known for his work on characterisation of distributions and stability theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After primary and the Realgymnasium secondary school, Lukacs entered the Technical University in Vienna in 1925 where he studied mechanical engineering.</li>
<li>After taking his first degree, Lukacs continued to study at Vienna for his doctorate.</li>
<li>This was no time to get an academic position in a university, so Lukacs took a post as a secondary school teacher in Vienna.</li>
<li>All this was bad news for Lukacs, particularly since he was Jewish.</li>
<li>Lukacs left school teaching in 1933 and took up a position as an actuary at an insurance company, having E Helly, another of Jewish origin, amongst his colleagues in the insurance company.</li>
<li>In 1937 Lukacs left the insurance company.</li>
<li>Elizabeth Lukacs left for the United States late in 1938 while Eugene left some time later, reaching the United States in February 1939.</li>
<li>While at the University of Vienna, Lukacs had met Wald who was also a Hungarian Jew.</li>
<li>Wald was working on statistics and probability and he persuaded Lukacs to take an interest in this topic too.</li>
<li>However Elizabeth Lukacs found a post teaching at Garrison High School in Baltimore and she encouraged Eugene to apply for a position at Friends High School in Baltimore.</li>
<li>In 1942 Lukacs had made an important contribution to mathematical statistics by introducing, for the first time, the method of differential equations in characteristic function theory.</li>
<li>After moving to Cincinnati, Lukacs worked with Szász who had held a post there from 1936.</li>
<li>He continued at Our Lady of Cincinnati College until 1953, although he spent some leave working as a mathematical statistician at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C. In 1953 Lukacs Eugene joined the Office of Naval Research and he later became the Head of its Statistics.</li>
<li>Lukacs moved again, this time in 1955 to the Catholic University of America where, in 1959, he set up the Statistical Laboratory becoming its director.</li>
<li>Lukacs retired in 1972, and went first to Bowling Green where he remained for four years.</li>
<li>Other topics to which Lukacs made major contributions include characterisations of distributions, stability of characterisation results and functional equations.</li>
<li>Lukacs's hobbies and interests included stamp and coin collecting, hiking, bird watching, photography and, as stated above, travelling.</li>
<li>We shall miss Eugene greatly, not only for his contributions to probability and statistics but also as a colleague, a friend and as a human being of integrity.</li>
<li>Lukacs undertook many editorial duties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 August 1906, Szombathely, Hungary. Died 21 December 1987, Washington D.C., USA.</p>
