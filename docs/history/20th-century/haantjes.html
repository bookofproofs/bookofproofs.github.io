<p><strong>Johannes Haantjes</strong> was a Dutch mathematician who worked in differential geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Johannes had one older brother Johan Haantjes (1908-1978) who studied physics and became director of the Philips Physics Laboratory in Eindhoven, and one younger brother Jetze Haantjes (1914-1975).</li>
<li>He also had four younger sisters Pietje Haantjes (1911-2002), Janneke Haantjes (1913-1994), Hinke Haantjes (1916-1992), and Grietje Haantjes (1922-2014).</li>
<li>Hantje Haantjes was a teacher and, at the time his son Johannes was born, he was the headmaster of the school in the village of Itens.</li>
<li>Johannes attended his father's school in Itens for his primary education, then moved to the Hogere Burgerschool in Leeuwarden for his secondary education.</li>
<li>When Johannes was in the middle of his secondary education, his father was appointed as headmaster of the school in Valkenburg (South Holland) so he completed his schooling in Leiden, a major city a few kilometres to the east of Valkenburg (which is now part of Katwijk).</li>
<li>After graduating from the High School in Leiden in 1927, Haantjes entered the University of Leiden where his chosen major subjects were mathematic and physics.</li>
<li>Haantjes was also taught by Jan Arnoldus Schouten who was the professor of mathematics at Delft University but taught a course on differential geometry at Leiden as a guest lecturer.</li>
<li>Another of Haantjes' lecturers was Johannes Droste (1886-1963).</li>
<li>Haantjes continued his studies at the University of Leiden, undertaking research for his doctorate advised by van der Woude.</li>
<li>Although Jan Schouten was not on the faculty of the University of Leiden, he did advise Haantjes in an unofficial capacity.</li>
<li>On 19 May 1933 Haantjes was awarded a Ph.D. for his 102-page thesis Het beweeglijk assenstelsel in de affiene ruimte Ⓣ(The moving coordinate system in the affine space).</li>
<li>A few months after Haantjes' thesis was accepted, his first paper, a joint publication with his thesis advisor van der Woude appeared.</li>
<li>By the time this paper was published, Haantjes was already working as an assistant to Jan Schouten at Delft University.</li>
<li>Schouten and Haantjes published two joint papers in 1934, namely Generelle Feldtheorie.</li>
<li>In 1936 Haantjes and Jan Schouten were co-authors of the article On the theory of the geometric object which was published in the Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>On 4 April 1939 Haantjes married Marie Antoinette Mulder in Leiden.</li>
<li>At the time of the marriage, Haantjes was 29 years old and his wife Marie was 24.</li>
<li>They had four children, the eldest being Hanneke Haantjes (1940-2007).</li>
<li>Marie Antoinette Haantjes died in 2001.</li>
<li>Haantjes gave his inaugural lecture Over enige grondbegrippen uit de meetkunde Ⓣ(On some basic concepts of geometry) in Leiden on 28 May 1948.</li>
<li>Haantjes published over 50 papers in his short career and we will now look at the titles and give a short extract from a review, of a few of these.</li>
<li>Haantjes also wrote the book Inleiding tot de Differentiaalmeetkunde Ⓣ(Introduction to differential geometry) (1954).</li>
<li>Today Haantjes is remembered by those working in metric geometry for the Haantjes-Finsler curve.</li>
<li>The Haantjes-Finsler curve is a metric notion of curvature suggested by Paul Finsler and developed by Haantjes in his paper Distance geometry.</li>
<li>Haantjes was a dedicated Christian who had many social interests.</li>
<li>H D Kloosterman was chair of this committee with Haantjes as its secretary.</li>
<li>This shows the strong international reputation that Haantjes had acquired.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 September 1909, Itens, Friesland, Netherlands. Died 8 February 1956, Leiden, Netherlands.</p>
