<h1>Person: Okounkov, Andrei Yuryevich</h1>

<p><strong>Andrei Yuryevich Okounkov</strong> won a Fields Medal in 2006 for his contributions bridging probability, representation theory and algebraic geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After the award of his first degree, Okounkov remained at Moscow State University undertaking research for his Candidate's degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.) supervised by Alexander Aleksandrovich Kirillov.</li>
<li>Okounkov was awarded his Candidate's degree in 1995 for his thesis Admissible Representation of Gelfand Pairs Associated with the Infinite Symmetric Group.</li>
<li>In 2002 Okounkov was appointed as a Professor at Princeton University.</li>
<li>Okounkov gave the first proof of the celebrated Baik-Deift-Johansson conjecture, which states that the asymptotics of random partitions distributed according to the Plancherel measure coincides with that of the eigenvalues of large Hermitian matrices.</li>
<li>An important and influential result of Okounkov is a formula he found in joint work with Borodin, which expresses a general Toeplitz determinant as the Fredholm determinant of the product of two associated Hankel operators.</li>
<li>The new techniques of working with random partitions invented and successfully developed by Okounkov lead to a striking array of applications in a wide variety of fields: topology of module spaces, ergodic theory, the theory of random surfaces and algebraic geometry.</li>
<li>Okounkov left Princeton in 2010 to take up a professorship of mathematics at Columbia University in New York.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 26 July 1969, Moscow, Russia.</p>
