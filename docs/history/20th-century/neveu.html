<h1>Person: Neveu, Jacques</h1>

<p><strong>Jacques Neveu</strong> was a Belgian mathematician who worked in France, specialising in probability theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Neveu went to France for university studies and continued to live in France for the rest of his life.</li>
<li>Neveu was awarded his doctorate in 1955 for his thesis Etude des semi-groupes de Markoff Ⓣ(Study of the Markoff semi-groups).</li>
<li>It was in Paris that Neveu worked for the whole of his career beginning at the Faculty of Science.</li>
<li>Neveu became a lecturer at the Collège de France in 1962.</li>
<li>We will discuss these below but first we look at various visits that Neveu made to the United States in the 1960s.</li>
<li>Neveu was in Berkeley to attend the Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability held in 1965-66.</li>
<li>At that time, my discussions with Jacques revolved around what would happen to this still planned university, to which Bruhat would devote ten years of his life.</li>
<li>One day we meet Jacques and his wife, Monique, at the baker's! The Neveus had bought a beautiful property in this Burgundy village, three kilometres from us.</li>
<li>In the living room, Jacques had installed a magnificent fireplace built to his plans, in which he liked to burn tree trunks of good size, for the great joy of his guests when the weather was cool.</li>
<li>It was in this context that Jacques discovered a new passion.</li>
<li>Other academics, scientists: some renowned archaeologists, physicists, curators of the Louvre Museum, chose to buy a second home in Mailly-le-Château and found themselves around the Neveus.</li>
<li>With the coming of age and the accumulating fatigue, Jacques had to call on a professional to execute the heavy work in his gardens.</li>
<li>Monique died of cancer and Jacques followed soon after her.</li>
<li>Neveu was honoured with being elected to the Inaugural Class of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society in 2013.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 November 1932, Watermael-Boitsfort, near Brussels, Belgium. Died 15 May 2016, Paris, France.</p>
