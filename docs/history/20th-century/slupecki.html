<p><strong>Jerzy Słupecki</strong> was a Chinese-born Polish mathematician who made important contributions to logic.</p>
<p>Jerzy Słupecki was a Polish mathematician who applied number theory and polynomial algorithms to solve differential equations &amp; contributed to various fields such as theory of linear integral equations, signal analysis, and Słupecki Covering.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stanisław Słupecki was actually born in Podolia and studied engineering in St Petersburg.</li>
<li>The reason that Jerzy was born in Manchuria was that his father, Stanisław, although a captain in the military, had been working on the construction of the East China Railway since 1900.</li>
<li>By the time Jerzy was born, the railway linked the Trans-Siberian Railway from Lake Baikal in Siberia through Harbin in Manchuria to the Russian port of Vladivostok in Siberia on the Sea of Japan.</li>
<li>Harbin was the Russian military base in Manchuria during this war, which was taking place at the time Jerzy was born.</li>
<li>The younger of his parents' two sons, Jerzy was brought up in Harbin where his parents enjoyed a good life style since his father Stanisław was well paid being promoted to colonel in 1912 and commander of a battalion in the 35th Siberian Rifle Regiment in 1914.</li>
<li>Jerzy's childhood was a time of great joy growing up in an environment with mixed races and nations, all with their different languages and customs, cultures and religions.</li>
<li>Jerzy's parents felt that their son would be safer if he were with them in Harbin so he returned there in 1918.</li>
<li>With Poland existing again as an independent country, the Słupecki family decided to return from Harbin to their own country.</li>
<li>This, however, proved not to be easy and only Stanisław Słupecki managed to return at this time and he joined the Polish army in December 1918.</li>
<li>The conditions were harsh and Jerzy's brother contracted tuberculosis.</li>
<li>Jerzy himself suffered poor health but had to work to support the family financially.</li>
<li>Eventually, in 1921, all the family returned to Warsaw where Jerzy was able to continue his much interrupted education.</li>
<li>Słupecki graduated from this High School in 1926 and, later in the same year, entered the Warsaw Technical University where he studied his favourite subject, namely architecture.</li>
<li>Mathematics had always been a second favourite for Słupecki but, later in life when he was enjoying a highly successful career, he still regretted having to give up studying architecture.</li>
<li>Once again Słupecki encountered unfortunate difficulties with his studies at Warsaw University.</li>
<li>Słupecki tried to help out the family finances with a variety of different jobs, some with the Warsaw Municipal Council and some with the Historical Museum.</li>
<li>Adolf Lindenbaum was only two months older than Słupecki but had been awarded a doctorate in 1928, the difference being simply a consequence of the problems which had hindered Słupecki's education.</li>
<li>Also Tarski, who was only two years older than Słupecki, had been teaching at Warsaw university since 1925.</li>
<li>As well as the important influence of these lecturers, an equally important influence on Słupecki from this time on was Andrzej Mostowski.</li>
<li>Mostowski was nine years younger than Słupecki but had begun his studies at Warsaw University in 1931.</li>
<li>Słupecki and Mostowski met regularly in Lourse's Café in Krakówskie Przedmieście, one of the most prestigious streets in Warsaw.</li>
<li>Słupecki graduated with a Master's degree from the University of Warsaw in 1935 having written a thesis advised by Jan Łukasiewicz.</li>
<li>Słupecki's thesis was outstanding and it received the Department Council's award.</li>
<li>Although he would have wished to remain at the University of Warsaw and study there for his doctorate, this was not possible in a situation where, despite having a school of extraordinary talents, it was not possible to employ someone as gifted as Słupecki.</li>
<li>With Łukasiewicz as his research advisor, Słupecki worked on his doctoral thesis while being a full-time secondary school teacher.</li>
<li>In the following year he submitted his thesis A proof of the axiomatizability of full systems of many-valued propositional calculus (Polish) and was awarded a Ph.D. Wacław Sierpiński was an examiner of Słupecki's thesis.</li>
<li>In particular Helena Rzeszotarska (1879-1976) ran an underground Gymnasium to teach young people and Słupecki taught in this school.</li>
<li>Słupecki taught in this underground university along with several of his friends and teachers such as Łukasiewicz and Mostowski.</li>
<li>In addition to these highly dangerous teaching duties, Słupecki also took part in the Konrad Żegota Committee, part of the Polish Resistance.</li>
<li>Many Poles were forced to undertake work for the Germans and, in mid-August 1944, Słupecki was sent to Germany as a labourer.</li>
<li>Słupecki volunteered to teach at the School of Telecommunications in the Praga district of Warsaw and he also taught at the Curie-Skłodowska State Gymnasium, back in the position he had held before the German invasion.</li>
<li>Later in 1945 Słupecki was appointed as an Assistant Professor at the University of Lublin.</li>
<li>the creative work of Jerzy Słupecki comprised five areas: (1) many-valued sentential calculi, (2) theory of deductive systems including metalogic of classical and non-classical logic and the consequence operation of rejection, (3) history of logic (i.e. modern investigations onto the syllogistic of Aristotle), (4) Leśniewski's systems, and (5) didactics of logic and mathematics.</li>
<li>Słupecki was conscious of the aim of his logical investigations as consisting in continuation, ramification and popularization of the logical investigations of his masters from the Warsaw school.</li>
<li>Słupecki was also the author of a number of books co-authored with colleagues and students.</li>
<li>At Wrocław University, Słupecki was Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry in 1953-55.</li>
<li>However, from 1950 this was only one of Słupecki's two positions and perhaps the one that interested him the least.</li>
<li>Słupecki certainly considered his work in Opole to be his most important contribution and in this, despite making many other significant contributions, he was probably correct.</li>
<li>Słupecki is considered the spiritual father and founder of mathematics and logic at the university in Opole.</li>
<li>Jerzy Słupecki was the author of many articles in an encyclopaedia and was a great populariser of mathematical logic.</li>
<li>Słupecki was the last Warsaw logician alive who began his scientific career in the golden twenty years of Polish logic (1919-1939).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 August 1904, Harbin, Manchuria, (now China). Died 15 January 1987, Wrocław, Poland.</p>
