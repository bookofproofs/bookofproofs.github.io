<p><strong>Bill Parry</strong> was an English mathematician who worked in the study of dynamical systems, and, in particular, in ergodic theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>William was always known as Bill.</li>
<li>His father Richard Parry, a sheet-metal worker, and brothers were active trade unionists with fairly left-wing views.</li>
<li>Called the 11-plus examination (since it was taken after the age of 11), it began to be used in this way only a year or so before Parry sat it.</li>
<li>Parry attended a school which specialised in woodwork and metalwork but his mathematical abilities were spotted by a teacher who persuaded him not to leave school early.</li>
<li>Continuing with school education in such a technical school was a problem, however, for there were no classes for Parry to attend in mathematics and arrangements had to be made for him to attend mathematics classes at Birmingham Technical College.</li>
<li>After passing the examinations at Birmingham Technical College, Parry was allowed to enter University College, London, to study mathematics.</li>
<li>Parry was active in student politics during his undergraduate years and at this time he joined the Communist Party.</li>
<li>During his one year course at Liverpool, Parry applied to Imperial College, London, to study there for his doctorate in mathematics.</li>
<li>Parry, and many fellow students, took part on the march and it was there he met Benita Teper who had recently arrived from South Africa, They married in 1958, the year they met, and had a daughter Rachel (born 1967).</li>
<li>After being awarded his doctorate by Imperial College, London, Parry was appointed as a lecturer at Birmingham University in 1960.</li>
<li>Parry's first paper On the b-expansions of real numbers  was published in 1960.</li>
<li>In Ergodic properties of some permutation processes (1962) Parry considered two modifications of a process of Maurice Kendall made by H E Daniels, showing that the first modification and the one-dimensional second modification are ergodic.</li>
<li>Particularly important in Parry's development as a research mathematician was the year 1962-63 during which he worked at Yale University in the United States with a group of other young mathematicians interested in ergodic theory.</li>
<li>In On Rohlin's formula for entropy (1964), Parry gives a formula for computing the entropy of an ergodic stationary non-atomic stochastic process with a finite number of states.</li>
<li>Parry was back working in his home city of Coventry when he was appointed to the University of Warwick as a Reader in 1968.</li>
<li>Parry published over 80 papers and a number of fine books.</li>
<li>Parry retired in 1999 and was appointed Professor Emeritus.</li>
<li>Bill Parry listed his hobbies as theatre, concerts, and walking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 July 1934, Coventry, England. Died 20 August 2006, Coventry, England.</p>
