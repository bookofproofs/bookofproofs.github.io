<h1>Person: Pastur, Leonid Andreevich</h1>

<p><strong>Leonid Pastur</strong> is a Ukrainian mathematical physicist and theoretical physicist.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>This determined both Pastur's subsequent scientific interests and his style of work.</li>
<li>This Institute was part of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and Pastur began work in the Department of Mathematical Physics which was headed by Vladimir Aleksandrovich Marchenko.</li>
<li>We note that Marchenko had just been appointed as Head of the Department when Pastur began research, and Evgenii Yakovlevich Khruslov began research as Marchenko's student at the same time.</li>
<li>Pastur was, at this time, appointed as a Junior Research Fellow.</li>
<li>Ilya Mikhailovich Lifshitz (1917-1982), the younger brother of Evgenii Mikhailovich Lifshitz, began working with Pastur in 1963.</li>
<li>Pastur was promoted to Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering in 1968 and awarded his Doctor of Science degree (equivalent in standard to a D.Sc. of the habilitation) in 1975 for his thesis Problems in the theory of disordered systems.</li>
<li>Since the above quote mentions two important monographs co-authored by Pastur, we should give a few further details of the second at this point.</li>
<li>Let us give details of Pastur's career at the Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering in Kharkov.</li>
<li>In Paris, Pastur had other appointments, namely as Head of Department of Theoretical Physics at the University Paris 7, Denis Diderot, from 2003.</li>
<li>Pastur also plays a major role in the administration of research in the Ukraine.</li>
<li>The most recent monograph by Pastur is Eigenvalue distribution of large random matrices (2011) written in collaboration with Mariya Shcherbina.</li>
<li>Pastur has been honoured for his many contributions.</li>
<li>In May 20013 the conference 'Mathematical Physics of Disordered Systems' was held in Hagen, Germany, in Pastur's honour.</li>
<li>To celebrate Leonid's 75th  birthday the Wednesday afternoon session will take place at the medieval castle Hohenlimburg near Hagen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 August 1937, Vinnytsya, Ukraine.</p>
