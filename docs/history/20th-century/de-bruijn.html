<h1>Person: De Bruijn, Nicolaas Govert</h1>

<p><strong>Nicolaas de Bruijn</strong> was a Dutch mathematician who worked in analysis, number theory, combinatorics and logic.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>De Bruijn, although still registered as an undergraduate at Leiden, became a full-time Assistant in the Department of Mathematics of the Technological University of Delft in September 1939.</li>
<li>In addition to this full-time assistantship, de Bruijn continued his studies at Leiden until 1941.</li>
<li>He undertook research on algebraic number theory and was awarded a doctorate on 26 March 1943 having submitted his thesis Over modulaire vormen van meer veranderlijken Ⓣ(Modular forms in several variables).</li>
<li>Already before he had been awarded his doctorate, de Bruijn had begun publishing papers.</li>
<li>For example he published On Steiner-Schläfli's hypocycloid (1940) which took a geometrical approach to ideas published by van der Woude earlier that year.</li>
<li>In 1941 he published Ein Satz über schlichte Funktionen Ⓣ(A theorem on simple functions)  followed by Common representative systems of two divisions of an aggregate into classes (1943) which generalised a theorem proved for finite sets by Denes König in 1916 and van der Waerden  in 1927, then for infinite sets by König and Valko in 1925.</li>
<li>In June 1944 de Bruijn became a Scientific Associate at Philips Research Laboratories in Eindhoven.</li>
<li>He showed the breadth of his research interests with The electrostatic field of a point charge inside a cylinder, in connection with wave guide theory (written jointly with C J Bouwkamp) in 1947.</li>
<li>He held this position at Philips Research Laboratories until October 1946 when he was appointed as a Professor in the Department of Mathematics of the Technological University of Delft.</li>
<li>In September 1952 de Bruijn was appointed as Professor in the  Department of Mathematics at the University of Amsterdam.</li>
<li>Its purpose is to teach asymptotic methods by explaining a number of examples in every detail, so as to suit beginners who seriously want to acquire some technique in attacking asymptotic problems...</li>
<li>It would be an excellent book to read in conjunction with a textbook or monograph on asymptotic expansions - if such a one existed: whether it can replace a textbook is a question which every reader will have to answer for himself.</li>
<li>Substantial revisions have not been made.</li>
<li>In September 1960 he became Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the Technological University of Eindhoven.</li>
<li>He held this position until 1 August 1984 when he retired and was made Professor Emeritus.</li>
<li>On returning to Eindhoven he renewed his links with the Philips Research Laboratories where he was made a Consultant in 1960, also a position he held until he retired in 1984.</li>
<li>We have already indicated above some of the remarkable breadth in de Bruijn's mathematical interests.</li>
<li>He lists his interests (on his website) as: Geometry, Number Theory, Classical and Functional Analysis, Applied Mathematics, Combinatorics, Computer Science, Logic, Mathematical Language, Brain Models.</li>
<li>In the past decade he has been also working on the theories of the human brain.</li>
<li>The language is so designed that it is incorrect to state a theorem without first "constructing" a proof of the theorem.</li>
<li>Thus a computer verification of a body of text translated into AUTOMATH provides automated proof checking.</li>
<li>De Bruijn has received, and continues to receive, many honours for his outstanding mathematical contributions.</li>
<li>He lists on his website: Member Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences since 1957; Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice 1970; Ridder Nederlandse Leeuw (Knight in the Order of the Lion) 1981; Snellius Medal 1985 (This medal of the "Genootschap ter Bevordering van natuur-, genees-, en heelkunde" is awarded only once in 9 years for the whole field of mathematics, natural sciences and medicine.</li>
<li>The work on the Automath project was the main motivation for this case); Honorary Member of the Dutch Mathematical Society (Wiskundig Genootschap) since 1988; AKZO Prize 1991; and in 2003 the Lifetime Achievement Award Nederlandse Vereniging v.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 9 July 1918, The Hague, The Netherlands. Died 17 February 2012, Nuenen, Netherlands.</p>
