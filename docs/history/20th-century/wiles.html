<p><strong>Andrew Wiles</strong> is an English mathematician famous for having finally proved _Fermat's Last Theorem _ in 1995.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>When Andrew was born Maurice Wiles was Chaplain at Ridley Hall, Cambridge.</li>
<li>Wiles' interest in Fermat's Last Theorem began at a young age.</li>
<li>In 1971, Wiles entered Merton College, Oxford, graduating with a B.A. in 1974.</li>
<li>Wiles did not work on Fermat's Last Theorem for his doctorate.</li>
<li>From 1977 until 1980 Wiles was a Junior Research fellow at Clare College, Cambridge and also a Benjamin Peirce Assistant Professor at Harvard University.</li>
<li>Wiles was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship which enabled him to visit the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifique in Paris and also the École Normale Supérieure in Paris during 1985-86.</li>
<li>This result set the stage for Wiles's work.</li>
<li>Wiles abandoned all his other research when he heard what had been proved and, for seven years, he concentrated solely on attempting to prove the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, knowing that a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem then followed.</li>
<li>In 1988 Wiles went to Oxford University where he spent two years as a Royal Society Research Professor.</li>
<li>In 1993 Wiles told two other mathematicians that he was close to a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.</li>
<li>In 1994 Wiles was appointed Eugene Higgins Professor of Mathematics at Princeton.</li>
<li>From 1995 Wiles began to receive many honours for this outstanding piece of work.</li>
<li>In addition to the prizes and awards mentioned above, Wiles has continued to receive many honours for his outstanding work.</li>
<li>In the same year he was honoured by having "asteroid 9999 Wiles" named after him.</li>
<li>In 2000, Andrew Wiles became "Sir Andrew Wiles" when he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire by the Queen.</li>
<li>He received the Pythagoras Award in Crotone, Italy, in 2004 and, in the following year, Wiles received the Shaw Prize.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 April 1953, Cambridge, England.</p>
