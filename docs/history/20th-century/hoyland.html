<h1>Person: Høyland, Arnljot</h1>
<p><img alt="Hoyland.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Hoyland.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Arnljot Høyland</strong> was a Norwegian mathematical statistician who worked in reliability theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His parents were Torleiv Høyland (1893-1989), a teacher, and Sigyn Tønnesdtr Husebø (1899-1994), a clerk.</li>
<li>Arnljot was one of his parents' three children.</li>
<li>Torleiv Høyland was the author of the book Laerernes Kirkenesferd Ⓣ(The teachers' journey to Kirkenes) (1946).</li>
<li>Torleiv Høyland was prisoner no 1850 there.</li>
<li>Arnljot Høyland is internationally renowned for his work in mathematical statistics.</li>
<li>Høyland met Alf Prøysen, a famous Norwegian writer and musician, during the last years of the war.</li>
<li>They cooperated among other things on shows, and it was in this context that Høyland composed the melody Prøysen later used in his "Julekveldsvise".</li>
<li>Because if this Høyland was interviewed several times on Norwegian television in the 1990s.</li>
<li>Høyland completed his high school studies and took his matriculation examination in 1943.</li>
<li>At this time Høyland was a sixteen year old schoolboy.</li>
<li>However, Høyland completed his high school studies and took his matriculation examination in 1943.</li>
<li>At the end of the war, in autumn 1945, Høyland began to study at the University of Oslo.</li>
<li>Høyland was given some tests and then told he could start work.</li>
<li>Høyland needed the money, so he accepted.</li>
<li>This led to his mathematics studies at university, which Høyland completed while holding his position in the Intelligence Service, having a high component of mathematical statistics.</li>
<li>He had written the works in Esperanto which Høyland had to read.</li>
<li>As to his work with the Intelligence Service, Høyland says that 1948 was an exciting year.</li>
<li>Høyland retired from the Norwegian Defence in 1954, having attained the rank of a major.</li>
<li>David Blackwell was head of statistics at that time and he advised Høyland to register as a Ph.D. student.</li>
<li>Lehmann was using the lectures he was giving as the basis for his famous book Testing Statistical Hypotheses (1959) and Høyland received a "thanks" in the Preface to the book for having worked through all the problems.</li>
<li>Back in Norway, Høyland had difficulties because he was arguing for non-parametric statistics.</li>
<li>After working as a lecturer at the University of Oslo from 1959 to 1965, Høyland was hired by the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) in Trondheim as a senior lecturer in 1965 and later became a professor of mathematical statistics.</li>
<li>Høyland was the first person who specialised in statistics that NTH hired.</li>
<li>Høylands 2-volume textbook Sannsynlighetsregning og statistisk metodelaere Ⓣ(Probability and statistical methods), published in 1972-73, was compulsory reading for the students at NTH for over 20 years.</li>
<li>When professor Høyland returned to NTNU (NTH at that time), he was very enthusiastic and wanted to start a course in reliability analysis at NTNU, using the book by Barlow and Proschan.</li>
<li>Bent Natvig stayed only a short time and left NTNU during the summer of 1977 - so when the first ordinary course in reliability analysis was to be lectured, professor Høyland had to be the lecturer - with assistance from Marvin Rausand who took over Bent Natvig's position as an assistant professor.</li>
<li>Høyland and Rausand were co-authors of an international textbook System Reliability Theory: Models and Statistics Methods (1994).</li>
<li>Høyland was known for his cheerful spirit and his musicality.</li>
<li>Arnljot Høyland was appointed Knight of First Class of the Order of St Olav in 1995.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 February 1924, Baerum, Norway. Died 21 December 2002, Trondheim, Norway.</p>
