<h1>Person: Lindenbaum, Adolf</h1>
<p><img alt="Lindenbaum.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Lindenbaum.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Adolf Lindenbaum</strong> was a Polish mathematician, logician and topologist. He was executed by the Nazis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are no records of Adolf's early years although we can assume that he was brought up in Warsaw.</li>
<li>At the time that Lindenbaum was born, Poland did not exist as an independent country but had been partitioned between Austria-Hungary, Prussia and Russia.</li>
<li>Lindenbaum, who was sixteen at the time, enlisted in an organisation set up by the Polish White Cross to help the soldiers.</li>
<li>We should mention one of Lindenbaum's classmates at the Jana Kreczmara Gymnasium.</li>
<li>This was Mojżesz David Kirszbraun (1903 or 1904-1942) who, like Lindenbaum, showed outstanding mathematical abilities at the school.</li>
<li>He graduated at the same time as Lindenbaum and the two entered the University of Warsaw to study mathematics together.</li>
<li>Lindenbaum and Kirszbraun were close friends and undertook joint research projects while at university.</li>
<li>On 14 September 1922 Lindenbaum applied for admission to the Mathematics department in the Faculty of Philosophy of Warsaw University.</li>
<li>During the five years of his university course, Lindenbaum was taught by some outstanding academics.</li>
<li>Alfred Tarski taught at the Polish Pedagogical Institute in Warsaw from 1922 to 1925 but began teaching at the University of Warsaw in session 1925-26 when he taught on cardinal numbers, a course which Lindenbaum attended.</li>
<li>Since Lindenbaum also attended Tarski's elementary mathematics (plane geometry) course in 1926-27 it looks likely that he was attending courses by a friend to give him support rather than to learn new mathematics.</li>
<li>Lindenbaum also attended a logic course by Tadeusz Kotarbiński (1886-1981).</li>
<li>Lindenbaum also attended a course on the history of philosophy given by Władysław Tatarkiewicz (1886-1880) who had taught in Wilno and Poznań before taking up an appointment in Warsaw in 1923.</li>
<li>Tatarkiewicz was also an expert on aesthetics and the history of art, and taught a course on French art which Lindenbaum attended.</li>
<li>In fact Lindenbaum's student career ended in a slightly strange way.</li>
<li>From 1929 to 1934 Lindenbaum worked on his habilitation thesis.</li>
<li>After the two papers listed above, Lindenbaum published the following papers between 1928 and 1934: Sur quelques propriétés des fonctions de variable réelle Ⓣ(On some properties of functions of a real variable) (1928); Remarques sur une question de la méthode axiomatique Ⓣ(Notes on a question of the axiomatic method) (1930); (with A Kozniewski) Sur les opérations d'addition et de multiplication dans les classes d'ensemble Ⓣ(On the operations of addition and multiplication in the general classes) (1930); Sur les ensembles ordonnés Ⓣ(On ordered sets) (1931); Bemerkung zu den vorhergehenden "Bemerkungen ..." des Herrn J.</li>
<li>After presenting his habilitation thesis, Lindenbaum became a docent in the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences.</li>
<li>Courses taught by Lindenbaum were on set theory, measure theory, algebra, actuarial mathematics and the foundations of mathematics.</li>
<li>In addition to the research that he was publishing, Lindenbaum and Tarski collaborated on writing the book Theorie der eineinendeutigen Abbildungen Ⓣ(Theory of unambiguous illustrations).</li>
<li>As one might imagine, being Jewish, Lindenbaum had problems.</li>
<li>In 1935 Polish universities adopted an anti-Semitic policy which meant that Lindenbaum had little chance of being promoted beyond docent.</li>
<li>Janina had received a doctorate from Warsaw in 1926 advised by Tadeusz Kotarbiński who had also taught Lindenbaum.</li>
<li>Both she and Lindenbaum had delivered papers at the First Congress of Mathematicians from Slavic Countries held in Warsaw in September 1929.</li>
<li>Lindenbaum did other things which would later put his life in danger.</li>
<li>Lindenbaum realised the danger he was in both as a Jew and as a known Communist.</li>
<li>He knew that the Germans had lists of names of Polish Communists and other critics of Hitler's regime which, particularly because of the petitions and letters he had signed, terrified Lindenbaum.</li>
<li>The Soviets set up the Białystok Pedagogical Institute and Lindenbaum was appointed as a docent at the Institute.</li>
<li>Lindenbaum does not appear to have made any efforts to escape which is slightly strange given that he was fully aware of the danger he was in from the Germans.</li>
<li>It is not known exactly when Lindenbaum was executed but it is believed that he too was murdered at Ponary soon after his arrest.</li>
<li>described Lindenbaum as "a man of unusual intelligence".</li>
<li>Mostowski once called Lindenbaum the most lucid mind in the foundations of mathematics.</li>
<li>Legendary stories told by Lindenbaum's friends and colleagues document many cases of theorems discovered by him but proved by someone else, as he had no time to complete his ideas.</li>
<li>Fraenkel had claimed to prove this but Lindenbaum and Mostowski in a 1938 paper, claim that there are errors and obscurities in Fraenkel's proof which they correct.</li>
<li>Lindenbaum also worked on the propositional calculus and its connection to logical matrices.</li>
<li>Two other significant achievements are what is today called the Lindenbaum algebra and the maximalisation theorem sometimes today called Lindenbaum's Lemma.</li>
<li>Lindenbaum was a member of the Polish Mathematical Society from 1926, becoming treasurer of the Warsaw branch of that Society in 1938.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 12 June 1904, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 1942, Ponary (now Paneriai), (near Vilnius), Lithuania.</p>
