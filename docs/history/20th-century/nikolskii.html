<p><strong>Serge Nikolski</strong> was a Russian mathematician who worked in functional analysis and partial differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have never seen anything other than Mikhalovich for his patronymic.</li>
<li>At the age of fourteen Serge Mikhalovich began working as a forester but also had a job as an observer at the Krasnyi Kordon meteorological station, one of around twenty large and well-equipped meteorological stations then existing in Russia.</li>
<li>Nikolski tried in 1925 to enter the Kiev Polytechnical Institute without a recommendation, but he was rejected, not even given an examination.</li>
<li>Thus, Nikolski found himself in Ekaterinoslav (now Dnepropetrovsk).</li>
<li>We have given quite a few details about Gruzintsev since we believe that he was important in changing Nikolski from a career in engineering to one in mathematics.</li>
<li>Nikolski graduated from Dnipropetrovsk University in 1929 and began teaching at the University as an assistant professor.</li>
<li>Nikolski taught mathematics courses at several of these new educational establishments.</li>
<li>Pavel Sergeevich Aleksandrov, Benjamin Fedorovich Kagan, Ivan Georgievich Petrovsky and Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov made frequent visits and gave lectures at Dnipropetrovsk.</li>
<li>Kolmogorov, who had been appointed a professor at Moscow University in 1931, was very impressed by Nikolski's work and began to advise him on writing a Candidate's thesis (equivalent to a Ph.D.).</li>
<li>Nikolski was allowed to spend 1934-35 as a graduate student at Moscow State University where he attended lecture courses on functional analysis by Abraham Ezechiel Plessner and Lazar Aronovich Lyusternik (1899-1981), as well as seminars by Kolmogorov and Igor' Nikolaevich Khlodovskii (1903-1951) on approximation theory.</li>
<li>Nikolski submitted his Candidate's Thesis Linear equations in Banach space in 1935 and, after defending his thesis, was awarded the degree.</li>
<li>German armies advanced towards Moscow and Nikolski played his part in defending the city by working for the Moscow fire brigade and also, along with Alexey Andreevich Lyapunov (1911-1973) (a mathematician working at the Steklov Mathematical Institute), helped with constructing anti-tank fortifications in Maloyaroslavets about 125 km south west of Moscow.</li>
<li>Nikolski was later awarded the medal "For the Defence of Moscow".</li>
<li>In late 1941 members of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow were evacuated to Kazan where they were housed in Kazan University and Nikolski was one of those evacuated.</li>
<li>In 1947 Nikolski was appointed as a professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT).</li>
<li>Over the following fifty years, Nikolski worked at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, at the Steklov Mathematical Institute, and at MIPT.</li>
<li>Nikolski was a plenary speaker delivering the lecture Einige Fragen der Approximation von Funktionen durch Polynome Ⓣ(Some questions on approximation of functions by polynomials.).</li>
<li>The Russian school in this subject, which is now led by Nikolski, has been particularly active during the past two decades.</li>
<li>As we noted right at the start of this biography, Nikolski lived to be 1907 years old.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 30 April 1905, Zavod Talitsa, Perm Province, Russian Empire. Died 9 November 2012, Moscow, Russia.</p>
