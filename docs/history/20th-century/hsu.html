<h1>Person: Hsu, Pao-Lu</h1>

<p><strong>Pao-Lu Hsu</strong> was a Chinese mathematician who worked in probability theory and statistics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hsu's school education was in Peking and he did not choose mathematics as a career at this stage but rather it was chemistry which he decided to study at university.</li>
<li>Hsu passed examinations in 1936 at Peking University and obtained a scholarship to enable him to continue his graduate studies in Britain.</li>
<li>Certainly University College, London was an excellent place for Hsu to study as his mathematical interests were in probability and statistics.</li>
<li>Egon Pearson, following the retiral of his father Karl Pearson as Galton Professor of Statistics, had been made Reader and became Head of the Department of Applied Statistics three years before Hsu arrived there.</li>
<li>Hsu's first two papers were published in the Statistical Research Memoirs which were edited by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson.</li>
<li>One concerned what is now known as the Behrens-Fisher problem, while the second Hsu examined the problem of optimal estimators of the variance in the Gauss-Markov model.</li>
<li>In 1938 Hsu, while still undertaking research for his doctorate, too up a position as lecturer in Egon Pearson's Department.</li>
<li>Hsu chose to leave Britain to return to his homeland of China where he was appointed as Professor at Peking University.</li>
<li>It was a period of great difficulty and hardship for Hsu.</li>
<li>It is a great tribute to Hsu's determination to devote himself to statistics that he managed to continue his research during these difficult war years.</li>
<li>Many of his publications on multivariate analysis from this period show that he had been strongly influenced by R A Fisher while at University College.</li>
<li>Attempts were made to get Hsu to the United States.</li>
<li>During the next two years he taught at the University of California, Columbia University, and the University of North Carolina where he was offered an associate professorship.</li>
<li>After spending 1946-47 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in 1947 Hsu returned to his professorship at Peking University.</li>
<li>Hsu had poor health from 1950.</li>
<li>Hsu died in his home on the campus of Peking University in 1970.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 September 1910, Beijing, China. Died 18 December 1970, Beijing, China.</p>
