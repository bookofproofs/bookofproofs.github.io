<p><strong>Stanisław Knapowski</strong> was a Polish mathematician who worked on prime numbers and number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stanisław was brought up in Poznań until the Second World War began.</li>
<li>The occupying German forces expelled thousands of the Polish people from the west of the country and the Knapowskis were forced to settle in the Kielce province in south-eastern Poland.</li>
<li>Four German extermination camps were located in Kielce and young Stanisław grew up there in very difficult circumstances.</li>
<li>After the war ended in 1945 efforts were made to allow displaced people to return to their homes, and the Knapowskis returned to Poznań where Stanisław attended the local gymnasium, excelling in mathematics.</li>
<li>In 1952 Knapowski went to Wrocław University to continue his studies.</li>
<li>Knapowski returned to the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań where he was appointed as an assistant.</li>
<li>Indeed this is precisely what Knapowski began to work on and he obtained his doctorate in 1957 from the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań for his thesis Zastosowanie metod Turaná w analitycznej teorii liczb Ⓣ(Applications of Turán's methods in analytic number theory) .</li>
<li>After this Knapowski went abroad.</li>
<li>Back in the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań Knapowski submitted his habilitation thesis On new "explicit formulae" in prime number theory which was published in Acta Arithmetica in 1960.</li>
<li>Turán was one of Knapowski's examiner's for his habilitation.</li>
<li>Despite his short mathematical career, Knapowski published 53 paper, mostly in algebra and number theory.</li>
<li>Two areas of number theory which received particular attention from Knapowski were the distribution of primes in different residue classes modulo kkk, and the sign changes in the remainder term in the prime number formula.</li>
<li>Among Knapowski's other number theory papers we mention: On prime numbers in arithmetical progression (1958), On the Möbius function (1958), Contributions to the theory of the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetical progressions (1961, 1962), On Linnik's theorem concerning exceptional L-zeros (1961), and Further developments in the comparative prime number theory (8 papers).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 May 1931, Poznań, Poland. Died 28 September 1967, Florida, USA.</p>
