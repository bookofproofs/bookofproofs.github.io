<p><strong>Stein Stromme</strong> was a Norwegian mathematician best known for his work in algebraic geometry</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sigmund Elling Stromme was a publisher spending most of his career with J W Cappelen Publishing, one of the oldest publishing houses of Norway founded in 1829.</li>
<li>Stein Arild Stromme studied at the Oslo katedralskole (the Oslo Cathedral School).</li>
<li>At this school, Stromme studied Norwegian, mathematics, physics, history, English, and physical education.</li>
<li>degree, Stromme was appointed as a Research associate at the University of Oslo and there he worked towards his Dr. philos.</li>
<li>Stromme's next four papers were all single authored: Deforming vector bundles on the projective plane (1983), A note on tau-constant families of plane curves (1984), Ample divisors on fine moduli spaces on the projective plane (1984), and Families of rational plane curves (1984).</li>
<li>degree, Stromme was appointed as a Senior lecturer at the University of Bergen in 1983.</li>
<li>Stein Arild created the balanced and strong research institute that we have today.</li>
<li>Stein Arild managed the feat of renewing the department while still remaining friends with his colleagues.</li>
<li>Stein Arild was a man of quiet manner.</li>
<li>Stromme was an organiser of many conferences held at the Sophus Lie Centre.</li>
<li>Stromme was an organiser of many of the Summer Schools: Deformation theory (1996); Representation theory for Lie-algebras (1997); Reflection groups (1998); Initial ideals (1999); Elliptic curves, finite fields and cryptography (2000); Motivic Homotopy theory (2002); Algebraic Combinatorics (2003); Modular forms (2004); Representation theory for finite groups (2005); and Algebraic statistics, tropical geometry and computational biology (2006).</li>
<li>In 1988 Stromme received an award for excellence in research from the Norges almenvitenskapelige forskningsrad (NAVF), the Norwegian research council that funds the natural sciences.</li>
<li>This award gave Stromme funds which he administered jointly with Geir Ellingsrud and Christian Peskine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 12 March 1951, Oslo, Norway. Died 31 January 2014, Lambertseter, Norway.</p>
