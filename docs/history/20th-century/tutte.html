<p><strong>Bill Tutte</strong> was an English mathematician best known for his work on code-breaking in World War II.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 1935 Tutte went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, to study the Natural Sciences Tripos taking chemistry as his major subject.</li>
<li>It was, however, with his mathematical friends R Leonard Brooks, Cedric A B Smith and Arthur H Stone that Tutte wrote his next paper.</li>
<li>In the paper which Tutte and his three friends published in the Duke Mathematical Journal in 1940 they associated a graph with a squaring and by looking at the flow of an electrical current through the graph reproved Dehn's theorems and proved many new ones.</li>
<li>Although this work was for many years covered by the Official Secrets Act, Tutte felt able to talk about it at his 80th  birthday celebrations in 1997.</li>
<li>Using these two messages Tutte was able to deduce the structure of the machine sending the message after four months of intense work.</li>
<li>By examining patterns in the characters, Tutte deduced that the machine sending the message had one wheel with 41 sprockets, and a second wheel with 31 sprockets.</li>
<li>Having worked out the structure of the encoding machine purely from the messages, a seemingly impossibly difficult task, Tutte set about writing algorithms decode FISH messages.</li>
<li>In 1943 the sophistication of the coding was increased and hand decoding using Tutte's algorithms became too hard.</li>
<li>A computer called Colossus was built to run Tutte's decoding algorithms and their success played a vital role towards the end of the war.</li>
<li>Rather strangely, although many such as Turing were honoured for their contributions at Bletchley Park, Tutte never received similar honours.</li>
<li>Despite having no formal qualifications at this stage, Trinity College elected Tutte to a Research Fellowship in Mathematics.</li>
<li>Tutte was soon publishing papers on many different aspects of graph theory.</li>
<li>Tutte's paper The dissection of equilateral triangles into equilateral triangles (1948) follows a similar theme to his first mathematics paper on squaring rectangles.</li>
<li>Donald Coxeter at the University of Toronto had reviewed some of these papers and was certainly fully aware of Tutte's remarkable potential.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate in 1948 Coxeter invited Tutte to take up a post at the University of Toronto.</li>
<li>In the following year Tutte married Dorothea Mitchell; they had no children.</li>
<li>Tutte remained at Toronto until 1962 when he joined the faculty at the University of Waterloo.</li>
<li>Bill and Dorothea moved to a home in West Montrose, along the Grand River, where Tutte continued to live after his retirement in 1984 until the death of his wife 1994.</li>
<li>Tutte wrote many outstanding papers (Mathematical Reviews lists 168 papers by Tutte) and books.</li>
<li>Indeed, the style and content of the book betray throughout the influence of Professor Tutte's own work and the distinctive flavour of his personal approach to the subject.</li>
<li>Tutte has received many high honours for his work.</li>
<li>In 2001 Tutte received the $5,000 prize from the Centre de recherches mathématiques in Montreal and the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences in Toronto.</li>
<li>Outstanding mathematicians were attracted to work in this field, many of them inspired by Tutte's earlier results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 May 1917, Newmarket, Suffolk, England. Died 2 May 2002, Waterloo, Canada.</p>
