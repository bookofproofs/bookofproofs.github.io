<p><strong>Abraham Robinson</strong> was a Polish-born mathematician best known for the development of non-standard analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Abraham Robinson senior was also a highly talented man.</li>
<li>Hedwig Robinson was a teacher and she brought up her two sons in Germany until 1933 when Abraham was fourteen years old.</li>
<li>Hedwig, Abraham and Saul Robinson avoided the problems that Jews would have in Germany from 1933 by starting a new life in Palestine.</li>
<li>There Robinson completed his schooling and, in 1935, began studying mathematics under Fraenkel and Levitzki at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</li>
<li>Robinson was a brilliant student and, after graduating in 1939, he was awarded a scholarship to allow him to study at the Sorbonne in Paris.</li>
<li>As an undergraduate at the Hebrew University Robinson has been interested in both algebra and mathematical logic.</li>
<li>By now Robinson was a world leading authority in aerodynamics yet he continued with his interest in mathematical logic.</li>
<li>A collection of papers Model theory and algebra was published in 1975 as a memorial tribute to Robinson.</li>
<li>For Robinson was more than an excellent mathematician.</li>
<li>Robinson was a leading expert in remarkably different areas of mathematics.</li>
<li>Only one of his books deals with applied mathematics but it may surprise mathematicians who think of Robinson only as a mathematical logician to realise that almost half his papers are on applied mathematics, particularly on aerodynamics.</li>
<li>Robinson is best known, however, for his work on mathematical logic.</li>
<li>Robinson's contributions to model theory were developed during his time at the University of Toronto.</li>
<li>Robinson's most famous invention was non-standard analysis which he introduced in 1961.</li>
<li>In 1966 Robinson published his famous text Non-standard analysis.</li>
<li>We end this biography by giving some comments on Robinson's personality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 6 October 1918, Waldenburg, Germany (now Wałbrzych, Poland). Died 11 April 1974, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.</p>
