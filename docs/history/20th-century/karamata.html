<p><strong>Jovan Karamata</strong> was an outstanding mathematician who lived through the wars of the first half of the 20th century in the Balkans. He gained international fame with a 2-page proof of the Hardy-Littlewood theorem, and also did excellent work on slowly varying functions and on Tauberian theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stevan Karamata, who came from a famous family, was the fourth child of Atanasije Karamata and his wife Marija Jovica.</li>
<li>We should mention that Stevan had a brother Kosta Karamata (1862-1920) who was a gymnasium mathematics teacher in Zemun.</li>
<li>Another of Stevan's brothers, also named Jovan Karamata, was the owner of a famous printing house, the director of the savings bank in Zemun, and a member of the Hungarian Parliament.</li>
<li>Stevan Karamata married Desanka Vukomanovic and they had six children: Atanasije, Ozren, Srdan, Smiljka, Kosta, and Jovan, the subject of this biography.</li>
<li>Atanasije died as a child so Jovan had four older siblings.</li>
<li>In 1909 Jovan Karamata began his primary schooling in Budapest, but soon his family moved to Zemun where there had been a Karamata family home for several generations.</li>
<li>By this time, however, Jovan's mother had died and Marija Karamata, his fraternal grandmother (by this time a widow), took on the role of mother to all of Stevan's children.</li>
<li>the devoted and deeply pious woman, about whom Jovan Karamata spoke with great respect, had, according to him, a lasting influence on his spiritual development.</li>
<li>Jovan began his secondary education at the Gymnasium in Zemun in 1912.</li>
<li>This had a relatively minor effect on Jovan's schooling in Zemun but the Second Balkan War, which broke out in 1913 worried Jovan's family much more.</li>
<li>Zemun, in Austro-Hungary at this stage, was considered in danger of Serbian attack, so Jovan's family sent the young boy to Osijek before the outbreak of World War I.</li>
<li>In 1915 Jovan's family moved him again, still trying to avoid the areas of conflict, and he went to Susak near Rijeka.</li>
<li>Not surprisingly, Jovan found these years extremely difficult and his education was suffering; he came close to having to repeat his third year at secondary school.</li>
<li>Srdan, Smiljka, Kosta and Jovan went to Switzerland at this time but Jovan's brother Ozren only joined them at the beginning of 1917.</li>
<li>Jovan spent one year studying at a boarding school in Cressier in the Canton of Bern where he became fluent in French.</li>
<li>Karamata graduated from the Gymnasium in 1918 and, later that year, began to study at the Gymnase Scientifique.</li>
<li>Karamata's father, Stevan Karamata, moved to Belgrade where two banks were merging to become the Jadransko-Podunavska Banka.</li>
<li>This was formally established on 11 May 1924 with Stevan Karamata as its Managing Director.</li>
<li>Stevan Karamata had seen the increasingly attractive economic and financial potential of Belgrade and had advised his son Jovan Karamata to study civil engineering.</li>
<li>Following this advice, in 1920 Jovan had enrolled in the Department of Civil Engineering at the Faculty of Technical Sciences of the University of Belgrade.</li>
<li>Following his advice, Karamata transferred to study mathematics in the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade.</li>
<li>The leading mathematician at Belgrade at this time was Mihailo Petrović and he played an important role in Karamata's university education.</li>
<li>Karamata graduated in 1925 and he was appointed as a temporary assistant of Mihailo Petrović.</li>
<li>Karamata's 2-page 1930 paper was one of the 50.</li>
<li>Returning to Belgrade, Karamata began a period of remarkably intense work.</li>
<li>Karamata was promoted to assistant professor in 1930 and in the following year he married the lawyer Emilija Nikolajevic (1906-1959), the daughter of the Belgrade judge Borislav Nikolajevic.</li>
<li>Jovan and Emilija Karamata had four children: two sons, Vladimir Karamata (born in 1934, who became an architect in Geneva) and Dimitri Karamata (born in 1935, who became a professor at the Medical Faculty of the University of Lausanne), and twin daughters, Maria (1938-1940) and Katarina (1938-2005, who became a biologist in Geneva).</li>
<li>Emilija was fluent in French and German and she assisted Karamata by typing his papers and taking the role of secretary in his correspondence with other mathematicians.</li>
<li>Karamata's mathematical output was very large with around 120 papers, 15 books (both monographs and textbooks) and 7 works about teaching.</li>
<li>Apart from greatest efforts in scientific work, Karamata also had other activities.</li>
<li>Karamata did not accept to rule of Milan Nedic's government, so was dismissed from his university position.</li>
<li>When the invaders were expelled, Karamata was again arrested in the belief he had collaborated.</li>
<li>Karamata worked hard to assist these students but times were difficult without most of his former friends and with new ideas about teaching but no new books.</li>
<li>Given Karamata's background, despite his attempts to fit in, it was inevitable that he would be considered "a reactionary bourgeois capitalist" by the Communist regime.</li>
<li>Karamata's wife Emilija died in 1959 and after this he seems to have become less happy with the direction of the Department of Mathematics at Geneva.</li>
<li>Both Karamata and his wife were heavy smokers and subsequently they both died prematurely from cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 February 1902, Zagreb, Austria-Hungary (now Serbia). Died 14 August 1967, Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
