<p><strong>Calixto Calderón</strong> is an Argentinian mathematician who has spent much of his career in the United States. He has made major contributions to ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, mathematical biology and the history of mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pedro Calderón, from an old colonial family, was a surgeon who had trained in Buenos Aires and later in Paris under Georges Marion, the famous French surgeon and urologist.</li>
<li>Pedro and Matilde had three children, a daughter Matilde Jr, a son Calixto, the subject of this biography, and a younger daughter María Teresa.</li>
<li>Pedro treated Matilde Jr and Calixto in the same way at the dinner table as he had Alberto and Margarita (known as Nenacha).</li>
<li>As well as mathematics and music, Calixto's parents gave him a love of modern languages.</li>
<li>Calixto was educated at the Colegio Marista San Josee de Mendoza.</li>
<li>This religious school was founded in 1917 and by 1947, when Calixto was a primary pupil, there were 405 primary pupils and 204 secondary pupils.</li>
<li>His favourite subject at school was physics but his father believed that to have a good career one needed to study practical subjects so, after graduating from the school, Calixto entered the University of Cuyo to study engineering.</li>
<li>The University of Cuyo was Calixto's local university, situated in Mendoza.</li>
<li>Calderón entered the School of Engineering and there he studied mathematics, physics, technical drawing and chemistry.</li>
<li>Calixto's real love, however, was for mathematics and his brother Alberto Calderón, by this time Professor of Mathematics at the University of Chicago, encouraged him to switch to mathematics.</li>
<li>Alberto Calderón advised his brother to study at the University of Buenos Aires where, he said, Alberto González Domínguez was both an outstanding teacher and very supportive of his students.</li>
<li>Not only did Alberto Calderón give his brother strong moral support for the move but he also offered financial support.</li>
<li>In 1961 Calixto left the University of Cuyo and began to study mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires.</li>
<li>At this stage in his career, Oklander was an instructor and soon after delivering this course he went to the University of Chicago where he studied for a Ph.D. advised by Alberto Calderón.</li>
<li>Calixto Calderón was awarded his Licenciado en Ciencias Matemáticas in 1965.</li>
<li>After graduating from the University of Buenos Aires in 1965, Calixto Calderón spent a year as a specialist in the Department of Science Affairs at the Pan American Union in Washington, D.C. After this, he was appointed as an assistant professor at the University of Cuyo at Mendoza, then at the University of San Juan in San Juan followed by the University of San Luis in San Luis.</li>
<li>Calixto became my mentor.</li>
<li>Beyond mathematics, Calixto taught us how to be an analyst, to seek the heart of an issue, to understand a problem.</li>
<li>In fact, Calixto is a non-conventional mathematician and his work has expended in diverse areas, and presented new insights.</li>
<li>By that time Calixto had already started to think on new issues concerning harmonic analysis and partial differential equations.</li>
<li>In 1972 Calixto Calderón left Buenos Aires and returned to the University of Minnesota where he had been offered a permanent appointment.</li>
<li>He followed Calderón to the University of Minnesota in January 1973 and they wrote two joint papers: Weak type estimates for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal functions (1974); and On Abel summability of multiple Jacobi series (1974).</li>
<li>Calixto Calderón found his time at the University of Minnesota very positive in developing his career, particularly the collaboration he began with his two colleagues Néstor Marcelo Rivière (1940-1978) and Eugene Barry Fabes (1937-1997).</li>
<li>Calderón left the University of Minnesota in the autumn of 1974 to take up a tenured position at the University of Illinois Chicago Circle.</li>
<li>From these times are his articles on existence of solutions to Navier Stokes Equations in a very particular norm and through the years Calixto published articles in diverse areas such as tumour growth, multiscale species competition, probability.</li>
<li>For Calixto, doing mathematics never felt like an obligation but always an enjoyment.</li>
<li>It had always been the view of Prof Calderón that biology and medicine could benefit from systematised mathematical support just as how the disciplines of physics and engineering benefitted immensely from such support many years ago.</li>
<li>It is, therefore, not surprising that a number of doctoral candidates produced by Prof Calderón completed their dissertations on topics related to mathematical biology.</li>
<li>Calixto Calderón continued to hold the professorship at the University of Illinois Chicago until he retired in 2003.</li>
<li>This must refer to Graciela Delia Gnavi who was a Ph.D. student at the University of Buenos Aires when Calixto worked there in 1970-72.</li>
<li>We have not found any collaborative evidence for Calixto Calderón's first marriage and we note that Graciela Gnavi continues to write papers until 1988 giving her address as the University of Buenos Aires.</li>
<li>Calixto Calderón then married the medical practitioner Cathie E Dunal (born September 1952) with whom he had three children: Cayetana (born about 1986), Ruy Gaspar (born about 1989), and Alvar (born about 1991).</li>
<li>Calixto Calderón retired from the University of Illinois Chicago in 2003 but continued to teach at Oakton College in Des Plaines.</li>
<li>In 2012 a conference in honour of Calixto Calderón was organised at the Department of Mathematics and Actuarial Sciences of Roosevelt University, 16-18 November.</li>
<li>In Honor of Calixto P Calderón (Springer International Publishing, 2014) edited by A M Stokolos, C Georgakis and W Urbina.</li>
<li>Moreover, Calixto P Calderón proved very early in his career to be an influential teacher and mentor for Luis A Caffarelli, a world authority on Free Boundary Value Problems in Partial Differential Equations and recent recipient of the prestigious Israel's Wolf Prize.</li>
<li>The papers presented by his friends or colleagues and some of his former doctoral students at the conference in honour of Calixto P Calderón at Roosevelt University were indicative to a large extent of the wide scope and depth of his research work and scholarship in pure and applied mathematics.</li>
<li>Clearly, his work in pure mathematics was influenced by Alberto González Domínguez, Alberto P Calderón - his brother, Antoni Zygmund, and several other collaborators and colleagues.</li>
<li>Whereas his considerable research work in Mathematical Biology and Medicine might have been the result of the influence he received while growing up from his father, Dr Pedro J Calderón, an accomplished physician trained in Medicine in Buenos Aires and Paris.</li>
<li>Except for the appointments at the University of Cuyo, the University of Buenos Aires, and the University of Minnesota, Calixto P Calderón spent most of his distinguished academic career at the University of Illinois at Chicago (U.I.C.).</li>
<li>During his tenure at U.I.C., Calixto P Calderón was an active participant and invited speaker at seminars in the Chicago area, including the Calderón-Zygmund Seminar at the University of Chicago, and the analysis seminars at U.I.C., and at DePaul University.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 December 1939, Mendoza, Argentina.</p>
