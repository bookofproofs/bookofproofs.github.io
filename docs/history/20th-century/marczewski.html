<p><strong>Edward Marczewski</strong> was a Polish mathematician who worked in measure theory, descriptive set theory, general topology, probability theory and universal algebra.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>We will call him Marczewski for this biography.</li>
<li>At the University of Warsaw he was taught by Kuratowski who was teaching the first year calculus course that Marczewski attended.</li>
<li>The audience then was exceptionally large (about 300 persons), the largest in the pre-war period; Marczewski was the best.</li>
<li>Kuratowski directed Marczewski's studies and gave him much personal attention.</li>
<li>However it was two other mathematicians at the University of Warsaw who influenced Marczewski more than Kuratowski.</li>
<li>These were Mazurkiewicz and Sierpiński who interested Marczewski in measure theory and related topics.</li>
<li>He had remained interested in collaborating with Kuratowski and, in the same year as his doctorate was awarded, a joint paper by Marczewski and Kuratowski was published in Fundamenta Mathematicae.</li>
<li>Marczewski was right, but sadly time were about to change.</li>
<li>Marczewski was visiting Lwów when it was occupied by the German army and here, as throughout Poland, intellectuals perished.</li>
<li>Then Marczewski returned to Warsaw, but in the capital things were equally difficult.</li>
<li>For much of the war Marczewski survived in Warsaw suffering great hardships.</li>
<li>In Wrocław, Marczewski was a prisoner of the Germans while the Russian forces besieged the city.</li>
<li>On 6 May 1945 the Russian forces captured Wrocław and Marczewski was set free.</li>
<li>The most important outcome which Marczewski worked for was the setting up of a Polish university in Wrocław.</li>
<li>In addition to Marczewski, who was appointed as a professor, Steinhaus was appointed as Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.</li>
<li>Marczewski later became rector of the University and served for four years in this role.</li>
<li>The General Meeting considers it to be a matter of great importance that the Wrocław Section, under the direction of Professors B Knaster, E Marczewski, H Steinhaus and W Slebodzinski and in cooperation with the University and Technical University of Wrocław, should constitute one of the most active scientific centres radiating across the Western Territories.</li>
<li>Marczewski founded the journal Colloquium Mathematicum in 1946 in Wrocław, and he was its editor-in-chief for 30 years.</li>
<li>Marczewski was proposed as Deputy General Secretary of the Mathematical Institute.</li>
<li>We should end by making comments on Marczewski's mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 November 1907, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 17 October 1976, Wrocław, Poland.</p>
