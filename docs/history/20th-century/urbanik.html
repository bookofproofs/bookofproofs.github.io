<p><strong>Kazimierz Urbanik</strong> was a Polish mathematician (born in what is now Ukraine) best known for his work in stochastic processes and probability theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Urbanik family set up home in Brzeg.</li>
<li>Completing his secondary education in Brzeg in 1948 by passing the matura, Urbanik entered the University of Wrocław.</li>
<li>After graduating Urbanik was employed to teach at the university while he studied for his doctorate with Marczewski as his thesis advisor.</li>
<li>Urbanik then began to mix an interest in topology with measure theory and probability and his 1954 papers show this mix: Sur un problème de J F Pàl sur les courbes continues Ⓣ(On a J F Pàl problem on continuous curves); Limit properties of homogeneous Markov processes with a denumerable set of states; Sur la structure non-topologique du corps des opérateurs Ⓣ(On the non-topological structure of the body of operators); and Quelques théorèmes sur les measures Ⓣ(Some theorems on measures).</li>
<li>Urbanik remained at the University of Wrocław and habilitated there in 1957 becoming a dozent.</li>
<li>In the light of the comments we have already made about Urbanik's research, we need only explain where his interest in the last two of these five areas arose.</li>
<li>Urbanik published a number of highly significant papers on this topic such as Representation theorem for Marczewski's algebras (1959), A representation theorem for Marczewski's algebra (1960), (with E Marczewski) Abstract algebras in which all elements are independent (1960), and Linear independence in abstract algebras (1966).</li>
<li>In 1965 Urbanik was elected to the Polish Academy of Sciences, later serving two terms as Vice President.</li>
<li>Urbanik married Stefania; they had a son Witold and a daughter Jadwiga.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 February 1930, Krzemieniec, Poland (now Ukraine). Died 29 May 2005, Wrocław, Poland.</p>
