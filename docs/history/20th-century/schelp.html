<p><strong>Richard Schelp</strong> was an American mathematician who researched in graph theory and combinatorics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Schelp did not follow the standard route to become a university professor doing research in graph theory and combinatorics.</li>
<li>His thesis advisor was Richard Joseph Greechie who had obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Florida in 1966 with a thesis on lattice theory.</li>
<li>Greechie's thesis advisor had been David J Foulis and Schelp's first paper Coordinatization of orthocomplemented and orthomodular posets (1970), written in collaboration with Stanley P Gudder, generalised Foulis's results that an orthomodular lattice can be coordinatised by a Baer *-semigroup.</li>
<li>Schelp's 114-page thesis, Partial Baer *-semigroups and partial Baer semigroups, earned his a Ph.D. in 1970.</li>
<li>Schelp wrote a number of papers with his colleagues over the following years including: A partial semigroup approach to partially ordered sets (1972); (with Ralph Faudree and Cecil Rousseau) Theory of path length distributions (1973); (with Ralph Faudree) A solved and unsolved graph coloring problem, by P Erdős (1973); (with Ralph Faudree) All Ramsey numbers for cycles in graphs (1974); and (with Ralph Faudree) Path connected graphs (1974).</li>
<li>By 1975 Dick's Erdős number was 1 as a result of a four-author paper - Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp - 'Generalized Ramsey Theory for Multiple Copies'.</li>
<li>Perhaps we should also note at this point that MathSciNet lists 170 publications for Schelp.</li>
<li>It also lists 59 co-authors, and lists 95 joint publications of Schelp with Ralph J Faudree.</li>
<li>Dick Schelp played an important role in the process of getting to know the town and gradually consider it as my second hometown.</li>
<li>In addition to his passion for mathematics, Schelp was a member of the Lutheran church and a Sunday School teacher.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 April 1936, Kansas City, Missouri, USA. Died 29 November 2010, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.</p>
