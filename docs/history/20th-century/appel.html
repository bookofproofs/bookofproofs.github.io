<h1>Person: Appel, Kenneth Ira</h1>

<p><strong>Kenneth Appel</strong> was an American mathematician best-known for his part in proving the four-colour theorem.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Irwin Appel was born in Russia but emigrated to the United States.</li>
<li>As well as Kenneth, the subject of this biography, Irwin and Lillian Appel had a daughter Lois who was about five years younger than their son.</li>
<li>Kenneth lived the first few years of his life in Brooklyn but was brought up in Queens, New York, where the family moved after 1935.</li>
<li>Appel was educated in New York.</li>
<li>After graduating, Appel spent a short spell working as an actuary before serving for two years in the US army.</li>
<li>After two years of army service, Appel enrolled in the graduate programme at the University of Michigan in 1955.</li>
<li>Another important event in Appel's life happened while he was a graduate student.</li>
<li>Carole and Kenneth Appel had three children, Andrew Wilson Appel (1960-) who became professor of computer science at Princeton University, Laurel (1962-2013) who became a professor of biology at Wesleyan University, and Peter (1964-) who is Administrator of the US Research and Innovative Technology Administration.</li>
<li>Three months after he was married, Appel began a two-year appointment with the Institute for Defense Analyses.</li>
<li>Appel worked at this Center in Princeton using both his mathematical and computing expertise.</li>
<li>Following his two years with the Institute for Defense Analyses in Princeton, Appel was offered a assistant professorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana.</li>
<li>This result using computers to prove a mathematical theorem, was a technique that Appel used to great effect as we explain below.</li>
<li>Appel is best known, however, for his work with his colleague at the University of Illinois at Urbana, Wolfgang Haken where again he used computers to prove a theorem.</li>
<li>Appel and Haken published their first step towards a proof with The existence of unavoidable sets of geographically good configurations in 1976.</li>
<li>What makes the claim of Appel and Haken more convincing?</li>
<li>The proof was published in 1989 by Appel and Haken in the form of a book with title Every planar map is four colorable.</li>
<li>For their remarkable achievement, Appel and Haken were awarded the Delbert Ray Fulkerson prize by the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Programming Society in 1979.</li>
<li>In 1993 Appel left the University of Illinois and moved to New Hampshire when he was appointed as the Chairman of the Mathematics Department at the University of New Hampshire.</li>
<li>Retirement did not end Appel's involvement with teaching mathematics, however, for he was keen to participate in mathematics enrichment programmes in Dover schools and other southern Maine schools.</li>
<li>Appel's hobbies included playing tennis, collecting stamps, playing Go, and baking bread.</li>
<li>In October 2012 Appel was diagnosed with esophageal cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 8 October 1932, Brooklyn, New York, USA. Died 19 April 2013, Dover, New Hampshire, USA.</p>
