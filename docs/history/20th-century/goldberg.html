<h1>Person: Goldberg, Anatolii Asirovich</h1>

<p><strong>Anatolii Asirovich Goldberg</strong>was a Ukranian mathematician who moved to Israel. He worked in complex analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union meant that the initial years of the war had little effect on life in Zaporizhzhy and Anatolii Asirovich was able to continue his schooling.</li>
<li>Goldberg completed his secondary school studies in Lviv.</li>
<li>Aleksandr Sergeevich Kovanko (1893-1975) was chairman of the local Olympiad committee and he encouraged Goldberg to aim for a career as a university mathematics teacher.</li>
<li>Several other mathematicians at the university were equally important for Goldberg's development, including Boris Vladimirovich Gnedenko, Yaroslav Borisovich Lopatynsky, who held the chair of differential equations, and Lev Israelevich Volkovyskii who had been a student of Mikhail Alekseevich Lavrent'ev and was working on complex analysis, particularly quasiconformal mappings and Riemann surfaces.</li>
<li>Goldberg wrote his Master's thesis advised by Volkovyskii.</li>
<li>We note that the results that Goldberg obtained for the inverse problem of the theory of the distribution of values which he published in 1954 were not improved on during the next twenty years.</li>
<li>Anti-Semitism in the Ukraine at this time meant that, although Goldberg would have wished to work towards his Candidate's degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.) by studying at a university, this was almost impossible.</li>
<li>When Stalin died in 1953 Goldberg thought that the position of Jews might improve so he applied to study for his candidate's Degree at Lviv University.</li>
<li>There was, however, another possible, but extremely difficult, route to a Candidate's Degree left open to Goldberg.</li>
<li>Goldberg undertook the necessary work for his Candidate's Degree while working as a school teacher, teaching for 30 hours a week and undertaking further administrative tasks.</li>
<li>He submitted his thesis to Lviv University in 1955 and this not only led to the award of the degree but, as we shall explain, it led to Goldberg collaborating with the mathematicians at Kharkov University.</li>
<li>Boris Yakovlevich Levin examined Goldberg's Candidate's Thesis Some Problems of Distribution of Values of Meromorphic Functions in 1955 at Lviv University.</li>
<li>This led to Goldberg collaborating with Levin's colleagues at Kharkov University, in particular with Iossif Vladimirovich Ostrovskii.</li>
<li>The collaboration between Goldberg and Ostrovskii led to important results.</li>
<li>We should return to 1955, the year in which Goldberg was awarded his Candidate's Degree from Lviv University.</li>
<li>Following the award of this degree, Goldberg was appointed to Uzhgorod University as a docent where he worked for eight years before returning to Lviv University in 1963.</li>
<li>Goldberg was asked to give the opening memorial plenary lecture on memorial meeting in honour of Shlomo Strelitz at the 'Conference of Differential Equations and Complex Analysis' at the University of Haifa in December 2000.</li>
<li>Goldberg brings up a son, Mark, from a previous marriage.</li>
<li>In 1997 Goldberg retired from his professorship at Lviv and took up a position at Bar Ilan University in Israel.</li>
<li>In 1992 Goldberg, Ostrovskii and Levin, were joint recipients of the State Prize of Ukraine.</li>
<li>However, there appears to be some confusion in the literature regarding which things named for Goldberg are actually named for Anatolii Asirovich Goldberg.</li>
<li>The problem arises since there are a number of mathematicians named Goldberg.</li>
<li>He was also honoured following his death with a 'Conference on complex analysis dedicated to the memory of Anatolii Asirovich Goldberg' being held in Lviv, Ukraine, from 31 May to 5 June 2010.</li>
<li>Goldberg's talent as a remarkable storyteller goes hand in hand with the literary quality of his letters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 2 April 1930, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine). Died 11 October 2008, Netanya, Israel.</p>
