<p><strong>Satoshi Suzuki</strong> wa a Japanese mathematician who worked in algrabraic geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>For five years, from 1953 to 1958, Suzuki attended graduate level courses but in 1958 he left the university to take up a teaching position.</li>
<li>Suzuki taught at Kyoto Women's University during the academic year 1958-59 and he then taught at Momoyama Gakuin in Sakai, Osaka until 1961.</li>
<li>Even before he submitted his doctoral dissertation, in 1963, Suzuki had been promoted to associate professor and he became a full professor in 1970.</li>
<li>Although he was on the staff at Kyoto University for his whole career, Suzuki spent several years working at other universities.</li>
<li>At my suggestion, Suzuki wrote up his lecture notes ...</li>
<li>These notes, based on Suzuki's lectures at  Queen's University, Kyoto University and Florida State University, were published as Differentials of commutative rings  by Queen's University in 1971.</li>
<li>Among the papers which Suzuki published before these lecture notes are: On torsion of the module of differentials of a locality which is a complete intersection (1964); Note on formally projective modules (1966); On the flatness of complete formally projective modules (1968); Differential modules and derivations of complete discrete valuation rings (1969); and Modules of high order differentials of topological rings (1970).</li>
<li>Among other places where Suzuki taught are Rutgers University, New Brunswick, USA, where he spent six months in 1971 and another six months in 1988.</li>
<li>Suzuki's later work includes Higher differential algebras of discrete valuation rings (1974); Some types of derivations and their applications to field theory (1981); and On extensions of higher derivations for algebraic extensions of fields of positive characteristics (1989).</li>
<li>Anyway, many people were surprised by what Suzuki said at meetings or in casual conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 June 1930, Nagoya, Japan. Died 11 August 1991, Kyoto, Japan.</p>
