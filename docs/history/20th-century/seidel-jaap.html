<p><strong>Jaap Seidel</strong> was a Dutch mathematician who who worked in geometry and graph theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>At an early age already, Jaap had experience in what is now called Networking.</li>
<li>When it became clear that the closure was not going to be a short one, Seidel, who had continued his studies there up to that point, now transferred to the Free University of Amsterdam where he was strongly influenced by Johannes Haantjes.</li>
<li>Soon Seidel found an opportunity to escape from the Germans and was able to return to the Netherlands where he remained in hiding for the rest of the war.</li>
<li>From March to July 1946, Seidel taught engineering at a secondary training school in Amsterdam, then from September 1946 to September 1950 he taught at the prestigious Vossius Gymnasium in Amsterdam.</li>
<li>Haantjes had moved from Amsterdam to Leiden, so it was natural for Seidel to submit his doctoral studied there.</li>
<li>Haantjes and Seidel announced the results in the paper The congruence order of the elliptic plane (1947).</li>
<li>Seidel published full proof in his 71 page thesis published in 1948.</li>
<li>Seidel had been put in charge of the Entertainment Committee for the International Congresses of Mathematicians held in Amsterdam in September 1954.</li>
<li>In the spring of 1955 Seidel was given leave to study with Van der Ven in Rome, an unusual privilege for someone in his position.</li>
<li>Johannes Haantjes became ill in 1955 (he died in the following year) and Seidel was asked to give some of his courses at Leiden.</li>
<li>All these conferences published proceedings and Seidel's contribution was published in each.</li>
<li>We end this biography with two tributes to Seidel.</li>
<li>Many mathematicians, especially young ones, were influenced by Jaap.</li>
<li>Jaap's work makes connections with several branches in mathematics, and he had struck friendships with mathematicians all over the world.</li>
<li>Many of us have been warmly welcomed by Jaap and Ada into their home and into their family.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 August 1919, The Hague, The Netherlands. Died 8 May 2001, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.</p>
