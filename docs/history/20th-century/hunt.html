<p><strong>Gilbert Hunt</strong> was an American mathematician who worked in probability theory, Markov processes and potential theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gilbert, who was their only child, played tennis to a high standard from the time he was a young child.</li>
<li>Two years later Hunt was again ranked No. 1 in national junior indoor tennis.</li>
<li>During these years, Hunt had continued his tennis career in parallel with his university studies.</li>
<li>One reason that Hunt's tennis exploits gained so much publicity was that he was highly eccentric, so making a good story for the newspapers.</li>
<li>Hunt's studies at Brown University were interrupted in 1941 when the United States entered World War II.</li>
<li>Released from military service in 1946, Hunt went to Princeton where he studied for his doctorate advised by Salomon Bochner but at the same time acted as an assistant to John von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study.</li>
<li>In 1951 Hunt published Random Fourier transforms.</li>
<li>In this paper Hunt gives his address both as Cornell University and as National Bureau of Standards, Los Angeles.</li>
<li>Hunt then published An inequality in probability theory (1955) and a number of papers in 1956.</li>
<li>Given a Markov process and a random time, Hunt defines a new Markov process.</li>
<li>Hunt was appointed to the faculty at Princeton on 1959, teaching there until 1962 when he moved back to Cornell University.</li>
<li>After spending the three years 1962-65 at Cornell, Hunt returned to Princeton where he taught until he retired in 1986.</li>
<li>Hunt was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held 15-22 August 1962 in Stockholm.</li>
<li>In Europe for the Congress, Hunt spent part of session 1962-63 at Orsay in France where he gave a course of lectures on Martingales et processus de Markov.</li>
<li>The 1960s, however, proved a very difficult period for Hunt.</li>
<li>Hunt married twice, and was twice divorced.</li>
<li>We have commented on Hunt's eccentric style of playing tennis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 March 1916, Washington D.C., USA. Died 30 May 2008, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.</p>
