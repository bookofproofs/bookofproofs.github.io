<p><strong>Max Zorn</strong> was a German mathematician, best known for the so-called <em>Zorn's lemma</em>, equivalent to the <em>Axiom of Choice</em> .</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hamburg was Artin's first academic appointment and Zorn became his second doctoral student.</li>
<li>We shall explain below what an alternative algebra is and describe some of the mathematical contributions which Zorn made at this time.</li>
<li>Zorn emigrated to the United States and was appointed a Sterling Fellow at Yale University.</li>
<li>He worked there from 1934 to 1936 and it was during this period that he proposed "Zorn's Lemma" for which he is best known.</li>
<li>We describe below the form in which Zorn originally stated this result.</li>
<li>Since Zorn is best known for "Zorn's Lemma" it is perhaps appropriate that we should begin a discussion of his mathematical achievements by considering this contribution.</li>
<li>Of course Zorn did not call his result "Zorn's Lemma", rather it was given by him as a "maximum principle" in a short paper entitled A remark on method in transfinite algebra which he published in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society in 1935.</li>
<li>Perhaps in passing we should note that the name "Zorn's Lemma" was due to John Tukey.</li>
<li>Zorn's aim in this paper was to study field theory and in particular to improve on the method used for obtaining results in the subject.</li>
<li>What Zorn proposed in the 1935 paper was to develop field theory from the standard axioms of set theory, together with his maximum principle rather than Zermelo's well-ordering principle.</li>
<li>The form in which Zorn stated his maximum principle was as follows.</li>
<li>Zorn defined a collection of sets to be closed if the union of every chain is in the collection.</li>
<li>His maximum principle asserted that if a collection of sets is closed, then it must contain a maximal member, that is a set which is not a proper subset of some other in the collection.</li>
<li>The paper then indicated how the maximum principle could be used to prove the standard field theory results.</li>
<li>Today we know that the Axiom of Choice, the well-ordering principle, and Zorn's Lemma (the name now given to Zorn's maximum principle by Tukey and now the standard name) are equivalent.</li>
<li>Did Zorn know this when he wrote his 1935 paper?</li>
<li>Was Zorn's idea entirely new?</li>
<li>Well similar maximum principles had been proposed earlier in different contexts by several mathematicians, for example Hausdorff, Kuratowski and Brouwer.</li>
<li>investigates the claim that "Zorn's Lemma" is not named after its first discoverer, by carefully tracing the origins of several related maximal principles and of the name "Zorn's Lemma".</li>
<li>Zorn made other contributions to set theory, such as his 1944 paper Idempotency of infinite cardinals in which he proved that an infinite cardinal number is equal to its square.</li>
<li>His proof uses his maximum principle rather than using ordinal numbers as had been done in previous proofs of the result.</li>
<li>In addition to his well known work in infinite set theory, Zorn worked on topology and algebra.</li>
<li>Zorn went on to publish four papers on alternative algebras.</li>
<li>In Alternative rings and related questions I: existence of the radical published in 1941 Zorn considered the theory of the radical of an alternative ring.</li>
<li>We have looked briefly at Zorn's contributions to algebra and to set theory.</li>
<li>After 1947 Zorn stopped publishing mathematical papers.</li>
<li>Max's published work, as significant and substantial as it is, is not what we will remember him by.</li>
<li>It is rather Max's life-long dedication to mathematics and his apparently endless curiosity about mathematical ideas that we remember and from which we draw inspiration.</li>
<li>Outside speakers were usually charmed by Max and his passion for mathematics.</li>
<li>Zorn did spell this with two c's but it is named after the newspaper the New Orleans Picayune.</li>
<li>It was a one-sheet affair that Max called the world's smallest newspaper and that he gave to a few friends (usually by putting copies into his colleagues' mailboxes, and rarely, for distant friends, by mailing them).</li>
<li>Max Zorn married Alice Schlottau and they had one son Jens and one daughter Liz.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 6 June 1906, Krefeld, Germany. Died 9 March 1993, Bloomington, Indiana, USA.</p>
