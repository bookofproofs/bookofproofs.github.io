<h1>Person: Rota, Gian-Carlo</h1>

<p><strong>Gian-Carlo Rota</strong> was an Italian-born American mathematician and philosopher.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Giovanni Rota was a prominent anti-fascist and his name appears on a death list constructed by Mussolini.</li>
<li>Gian-Carlo was born into a talented family in Vigevano, many members of his family had achieved fame in their areas of expertise, for example one of Gian-Carlo's uncles, Flaiano, wrote scripts for Federico Fellini's films, including La Dolce Vita.</li>
<li>Gian-Carlo was educated in Italy up to the age of thirteen in 1945.</li>
<li>Giovanni Rota took his family to northern Italy where they hide for a time before crossing the border into Switzerland.</li>
<li>The family eventually escaped to Ecuador where Gian-Carlo completed his secondary school education.</li>
<li>The positive side to this remarkable escape story was that Rota was fluent in English, Italian, Spanish and French.</li>
<li>Rota entered the United States in 1950 at the age of eighteen to undertake his university studies.</li>
<li>After graduating, Rota entered Yale University where he studied for his Master's Degree in Mathematics which was awarded in 1954.</li>
<li>In this same year that he was awarded his doctorate, Rota married Teresa Rondón and he received a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to undertake research at the Courant Institute at New York University.</li>
<li>After spending the year 1956-57 in New York, Rota was appointed as Benjamin Peirce Instructor at Harvard University.</li>
<li>With the exception of two years, 1965 to 1967, when he was at the Rockefeller University, Rota remained at MIT for the rest of his career.</li>
<li>Rota was given the title Professor of Applied Mathematics at MIT but in 1972 his title was changed to Professor of Applied Mathematics and Philosophy.</li>
<li>Rota had a long association with the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory where he enjoyed being with his friend Ulam and collaborating with him.</li>
<li>Rota was also a consultant with the Rand Corporation from 1966 to 1971 and with the Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1969 to 1973.</li>
<li>As we have indicated above, Rota worked on functional analysis for his doctorate and, up to about 1960, he wrote a series of papers on operator theory.</li>
<li>These papers seem to have led Rota away from operator theory and into the area of combinatorics.</li>
<li>His first major work on combinatorics, which was to change the direction of the whole subject, was On the Foundations of Combinatorial Theory which Rota published in 1964.</li>
<li>Rota received the Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society in 1988.</li>
<li>Rota observes that combinatorics is providing the essential continuing link between mathematics and the sciences: biology (structure of large molecules), linguistics (context-free languages, automata theory), physics (statistical mechanics, phase transition problems, elementary particles).</li>
<li>Rota received many awards for his outstanding contributions to numerous areas.</li>
<li>Rota died in his sleep and was found in bed on the afternoon of 19 April 1999.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 27 April 1932, Vigevano, Italy. Died 18 April 1999, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.</p>
