<h1>Person: Zygmund, Antoni Szczepan</h1>

<p><strong>Zygmund</strong>'s work in harmonic analysis has application in the theory of waves and vibrations. He also did major work in Fourier analysis and its application to partial differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Antoni was the eldest of his parents' four children with three younger sisters Jadwiga, Felicja and Maria.</li>
<li>Antoni continued his education in Poltava then, in 1918, he returned to Poland which had become an independent country for the first time in well over 100 years.</li>
<li>At the University of Warsaw Zygmund was taught by, and very much influenced by, Janiszewski, Mazurkiewicz and Sierpiński.</li>
<li>Zygmund, however, was most influenced by Aleksander Rajchman and by Stanisław Saks who had been his school friend, although three years older than he was.</li>
<li>This gave Zygmund a life-long interest in the trigonometric series.</li>
<li>There was a forced break in Zygmund's studies in 1920 when he was called up for the army.</li>
<li>Zygmund obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Warsaw in 1923 for a dissertation on the Riemannian theory of trigonometric series written under Aleksander Rajchman's supervision.</li>
<li>On 12 February 1925 Zygmund married Irena Parnowska.</li>
<li>In 1926 Zygmund submitted his habilitation dissertation to the University of Warsaw and began teaching there.</li>
<li>Irena Zygmund worked in Vilnius as a school teacher until the birth of their first son Jerzy in 1935.</li>
<li>In going to Vilnius, Zygmund was going into a disputed city.</li>
<li>This was the situation when Zygmund was appointed to the chair of mathematics there.</li>
<li>In 1939 Zygmund was drafted into the Polish army as a reserve officer at the start of the Second World War.</li>
<li>Zygmund returned to Vilnius but then, on 10 October 1939, Vilnius was returned to Lithuania.</li>
<li>In 1940 Zygmund escaped with his wife and son from German controlled territory to the United States.</li>
<li>Zygmund brought Calderón back to Chicago, where he obtained his doctorate under Zygmund's supervision not too long after his arrival.</li>
<li>Not only did Zygmund have the role of Calderón's teacher and advisor, but was also his mentor and became his main collaborator.</li>
<li>Zygmund worked in analysis, in particular in harmonic analysis.</li>
<li>Zygmund's early work, as one might expect, continued to develop ideas from his doctoral studies with Aleksander Rajchman.</li>
<li>After meeting Paley at Cambridge in 1930-31, Zygmund wrote five joint papers with him, and both of them together with Norbert Wiener wrote Notes on random functions (1933).</li>
<li>The joint Zygmund-Paley work played an important role in Zygmund's book Trigonometric Series (1935).</li>
<li>In 1950, not long after beginning his long association with the University of Chicago, Zygmund published Trigonometric Interpolation.</li>
<li>We mentioned earlier in this article Zygmund's collaboration with Calderón.</li>
<li>Their joint work began with Calderón's doctoral thesis which answered some questions related to boundary behaviour of harmonic functions which had been posed by Zygmund earlier.</li>
<li>Together with Richard L Wheeden, Zygmund wrote Measure and integral (1977).</li>
<li>Zygmund received many honours for his outstanding achievements.</li>
<li>Zygmund suffered many sad losses during his life.</li>
<li>Rajchman, Zygmund's doctoral supervisor, was executed by the Nazis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 December 1900, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 30 May 1992, Chicago, Illinois, USA.</p>
