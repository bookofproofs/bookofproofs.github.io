<p><strong>George Lusztig</strong> is a Romanian-born mathematician who works on geometric representation theory and algebraic groups.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although they had discovered that results independently, Peterson and Lusztig wrote a joint paper Semi-characteristics and cobordism which was published in Topology in 1969.</li>
<li>He invited Lusztig to Princeton and, after he had returned to Timișoara, Lusztig applied for permission to go to Princeton.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate, Lusztig was appointed as a Research Fellow at Warwick University in England.</li>
<li>The year 1974 was an important one for Lusztig from a mathematical perspective.</li>
<li>Lusztig has remained as a professor at MIT being Norbert Wiener Professor from 1999 to 2009 and is now Abdun Nur Professor.</li>
<li>An excellent overview to Lusztig's contributions are given in the citation for the award of the American Mathematical Society's Leroy P Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement (2008).</li>
<li>By the time the monograph was published, Lusztig had solved these too and described them in the invited lecture he gave at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Vancouver in 1974 (mentioned above).</li>
<li>In 2003 Lusztig published Hecke algebras with unequal parameters.</li>
<li>In this book the theory is developed from scratch, in a purely combinatorial setup, through a sequence of 13 short chapters over 58 pages, complete with proofs and examples, from basic properties of Coxeter groups to Kazhdan-Lusztig cells and the definition of the so-called a-function.</li>
<li>In its first half the book presents an accessible self-contained introduction to the theory of cells and Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.</li>
<li>Lusztig has received major honours for his outstanding contributions.</li>
<li>We should note Lusztig's interest in yoga.</li>
<li>It can be no exaggeration to say that George Lusztig is one of the great mathematicians of our time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 20 May 1946, Timişoara, Romania.</p>
