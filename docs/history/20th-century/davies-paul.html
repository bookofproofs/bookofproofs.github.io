<p><strong>Paul Davies</strong> is an English theoretical physicist and astrobiologist who has popularised issues such as the origin of life and extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Margaret Thatcher became the Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959 (she became Prime Minister of Britain twenty years later), and she presented Paul with a copy of Norton's Star Atlas for an outstanding performance in his O level examinations at the 1962 Speech Day at the school.</li>
<li>From Woodhouse Grammar School, Paul went to University College, London, where he was awarded a B.Sc. with 1st  Class Honours in 1967.</li>
<li>On 28 July 1972, Davies married Susan Vivien Corti Woodcock; they had three daughters and one son.</li>
<li>In 1974 Davies published a major monograph The physics of time asymmetry.</li>
<li>Much of Davies's work during his time at King's College appears in his 1982 monograph Quantum fields in curved space written with Nicholas D Birrell who wrote his thesis The Application of Quantum Field Theory to Cosmology and Astrophysics (1979) while being advised by Davies.</li>
<li>In 1980 Davies was named Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.</li>
<li>In 1990 Davies went to Australia when appointed as Professor of Mathematical Physics at the University of Adelaide.</li>
<li>In 2003 he married Pauline, a science broadcaster.</li>
<li>Among Davies's better-known media productions were a series of 45 minute BBC Radio 3 science documentaries.</li>
<li>Davies has received many honours in addition to those mentioned in the above quotation.</li>
<li>Other honours received by Davies include: the ABC Eureka Prize (1991); the University of New South Wales Press Eureka Prize for the book 'The Mind of God' (1992); the Advance Australia Award for outstanding contributions to science (1993); and the Templeton Prize received from the John Templeton Foundation (1995).</li>
<li>Certainly the Templeton Prize was a very major award but Davies continued to receive a host of others including: the Asteroid 1992 OG was renamed (6870) Pauldavies (1999); he received the Kelvin Medal from the UK Institute of Physics (2001); he received the Michael Faraday Prize from the Royal Society (2002); he received the American Institute of Physics Science Writing Award (2003); he received the Trotter Prize from Texas A &amp; M University, USA (2004); and received an honorary D.Sc. from Macquarie University (2006).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 22 April 1946, London, England.</p>
