<h1>Person: Kublanovskaya, Vera Nikolaevna</h1>

<p><strong>Vera Kublanovskaya</strong> was a Russian mathematician who developed computational methods for solving spectral problems of algebra.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Krokino, where Vera was born, was a small fishing village on the south east side of Ozero Beloye, a lake due east of St Petersburg (named Petrograd at the time that she was born, but becoming Leningrad in 1924) and due north of Moscow.</li>
<li>It was at the town of Belozersk that Vera Nikolaevna attended secondary school and, after graduating, she took a course to train to become a primary school teacher.</li>
<li>Accepted without any further examinations, Vera Nikolaevna began her studies at the Pedagogical Institute in 1939.</li>
<li>This had little effect on life in Leningrad where Vera Nikolaevna met Dmitrii Konstantinovich Faddeev who strongly advised her that she should follow a career in mathematics.</li>
<li>When Vera Nikolaevna's mother became seriously ill she left Leningrad and returned to her home village of Krokino.</li>
<li>However, in 1945 Vera Nikolaevna decided that she would investigate whether Faddeev's suggestion that she study for a degree in mathematics at Leningrad State University still applied.</li>
<li>After three years of study, Vera Nikolaevna graduated from Leningrad State University and was given an appointment as a junior researcher at the V A Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Leningrad.</li>
<li>Vera Nikolaevna worked with Kantorovich on this project in a secret Leningrad laboratory until 1955.</li>
<li>It is remarkable that, in addition to her family duties and her work with Kantorovich, Kublanovskaya found time to undertake research for her candidate's degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.).</li>
<li>Following this Kublanovskaya was promoted to a senior researcher at the Steklov Mathematical Institute.</li>
<li>He set up a research group, which Kublanovskaya joined, developing PRORAB, an abbreviation of the Russian for "task manager".</li>
<li>That was the beginning of Vera Nikolaevna's activities on developing algorithms of numerical linear algebra.</li>
<li>Kublanovskaya continued publishing significant papers on related topics (all written in Russian) such as: (with Vera Faddeeva) Computational methods for the solution of the general eigenvalue problem (1962); On a method of orthogonalizing a system of vectors (1964); Reduction of an arbitrary matrix to tridiagonal form (1964); A numerical scheme for the Jacobi process (1964); Some bounds for the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix (1965); An algorithm for the calculation of eigenvalues of positive definite matrices (1965); On a certain process of supplementary orthogonalisation of vectors (1965); and A method for solving the complete problem of eigenvalues of a degenerate matrix (1966).</li>
<li>Also in 1966 she published a joint paper with Dmitrii Faddeev and Vera Faddeeva Sur les systèmes linéaires algébriques de matrices rectangulaires et mal-conditionnées.</li>
<li>In more recent work, Kublanovskaya has worked with Vladimir Borisovich Khazanov.</li>
<li>It is simply impossible to overestimate the role of V N Kublanovskaya in training students in the  field of numerical methods and computational mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 November 1920, Krokino, Vologda Oblast, Russia. Died 21 February 2012, St Petersburg, Russia.</p>
