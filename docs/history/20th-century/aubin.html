<p><strong>Thierry Aubin</strong> was a French mathematician who was a leading expert on Riemannian geometry and non-linear partial differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aubin submitted his thesis and graduated with a doctorate in 1969 but, in the previous year, he had already been appointed to the University of Lille.</li>
<li>Philippe Delanoë attended Aubin's graduate course at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in 1976-77 and then became his doctoral student.</li>
<li>This became known as the 'Yamabe problem' and it was something to which Aubin made substantial contributions.</li>
<li>Aubin proved an important special case of the Calabi conjecture in Equations du type Monge-Ampère sur les variétés kählériennes compactes Ⓣ(Equations of the Monge-Ampere type on compact Kähler varieties).</li>
<li>In fact in 1978 it was Shing-Tung Yau who extended Aubin's results and completed the proof of the Calabi conjecture which earned him a Fields medal in 1982.</li>
<li>Professor Aubin has also written several books about geometric PDE that have a wide influence in geometric analysis.</li>
<li>We consider Professor Aubin as one of the anchor in the field of geometric PDE in recent decades.</li>
<li>Let us now look briefly at three important books published by Aubin.</li>
<li>In 2001, Aubin published A course in differential geometry.</li>
<li>Aubin was honoured with the award of the Prix Servant from the Academy of Sciences in 1982.</li>
<li>Aubin applied these methods in novel ways to fully nonlinear equations, and to delicate semilinear variational problems.</li>
<li>Thierry Aubin was one of the true leaders.</li>
<li>Thierry Aubin was also a complex human being in search of new horizons.</li>
<li>Philippe Delanoë completed this Ph.D. with Aubin as his advisor in June 1982.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 6 May 1942, Béziers, France. Died 21 March 2009, Paris, France.</p>
