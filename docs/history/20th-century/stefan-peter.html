<p><strong>Peter Stefan</strong> was a Slovak mathematician who was known for his works on dynamical systems and mathematical entropy.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Peter obtained a post on there and lectured for 3 years.</li>
<li>Peter had been involved in politics in Czechoslovakia, supporting the political movement which hoped to humanise Communist rule by introducing basic civil freedoms, an independent judiciary, and other democratic institutions.</li>
<li>During Peter's visit to Warwick the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia on the night of August 20-21, 1968, installing a Soviet controlled security service.</li>
<li>Peter feared that he would be in danger if he returned, and since the reform programme had stopped, he preferred the freedom in Britain.</li>
<li>Stefan remained at the University of Warwick where he studied for a Ph.D. which was awarded in 1973.</li>
<li>However Stefan did not remain at Warwick while working for his doctorate.</li>
<li>Stefan had a love of freedom and he translated this into a love of climbing after his return from Paris.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 27 March 1941, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia). Died 18 June 1978, Tryfan, Snowdonia, Wales.</p>
