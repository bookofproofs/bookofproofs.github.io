<p><strong>Mark Krasnoselsky</strong> was a Ukrainian mathematician who worked in nonlinear functional analysis and its applications.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>At first the war had relatively little effect on Krasnosel'skii's university studies but in June 1941 German troops invaded and rapidly advanced towards Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev.</li>
<li>Krasnosel'skii then graduated from the United Ukrainian University in 1942 and at that point joined the Soviet army.</li>
<li>In August 1946 Krasnosel'skii returned to Kiev where he was able to continue his studies, but he also worked, first as an lecturer in descriptive geometry at the Kiev Highway Institute and later as a junior scientist at the Institute of Mathematics of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.</li>
<li>He attended lectures by many leading mathematicians including Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, Mark Grigorievich Krein, Boris Vladimirovich Gnedenko, Mikhail Alekseevich Lavrent'ev, and Aleksandr Gennadievich Kurosh.</li>
<li>Krasnosel'skii was awarded his Candidates Degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.) in 1948 for his thesis on The theory of extension of Hermitian operators.</li>
<li>Krasnosel'skii's first publication appeared in 1946, the year he returned to Kiev, and was Sur un critère pour qu'un domaine soit étoilé Ⓣ(On a criterion for a domain to be starred).</li>
<li>Following this he achieved a remarkable publication record with papers (all written in Russian) such as On the deficiency numbers of closed operators (1947), (with M G Krein) On the centre of a general dynamical system (1947), (with M G Krein) Fundamental theorems on the extension of Hermitian operators and certain of their applications to the theory of orthogonal polynomials and the problem of moments (1947), On the extension of Hermitian operators with a nondense domain of definition (1948), On self-adjoint extensions of Hermitian operators (1949), (with M G Krein) On a proof of the theorem on category of a projective space (1949), and On a fixed point principle for completely continuous operators in functional spaces (1950).</li>
<li>Having remained at Kiev until 1952, in that year Krasnosel'skii was appointed to the Chair of Functional Analysis at Voronezh State University in Voronezh, western Russia.</li>
<li>The next monograph, which Krasnosel'skii wrote jointly with three former doctoral students whom he advised at Voronezh State University, Petr Zabreiko, Evgenii Pustylnik, and Pavel Sobolevskii, was Integral operators in spaces of summable functions (1966).</li>
<li>In 1968 Krasnosel'skii left Voronezh and moved to Moscow where he was appointed as a Senior Scientific Fellow at the Institute of Automation and Remote Control, which was later renamed the Institute of Control Sciences, part of the USSR Academy of Sciences.</li>
<li>is a remarkable and important book, treating the theory and application of ordered Banach spaces and positive (linear and nonlinear) operators.</li>
<li>Krasnosel'skii was awarded many honours for his outstanding contributions including the Andronov Prize from the USSR Academy of Sciences, the Humboldt Prize, and an honorary degree from the University of Rouen in France.</li>
<li>Mark Krasnosel'skii was of noble personality, straightforward and uncompromising in matters of principle but always open minded and ready to help everyone.</li>
<li>The desire and ability of M A Krasnosel'skii to attract gifted young people to the research activity made themselves manifest from the beginning of his research work.</li>
<li>The reserve of scientific enthusiasm and optimism obtained by the students of M A Krasnosel'skii during the years of communication and joint research inspires them for many years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 27 April 1920, Starokonstantinov, Ukraine. Died 13 February 1997, Moscow, Russia.</p>
