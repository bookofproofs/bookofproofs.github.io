<p><strong>Joseph Kruskal</strong> was an American mathematician, statistician and computer scientist who worked in combinatorics and graph theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kruskal studied mathematics at the University of Chicago.</li>
<li>Joseph Bernard Kruskal Sr. died in 1950.</li>
<li>In 1954, Kruskal was awarded a Ph.D. by Princeton for his thesis The Theory of Well-Partially-Ordered Sets.</li>
<li>We should explain that while Kruskal was working towards his Ph.D., he was also employed at the US Office of Naval Research.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate, Kruskal continued to work for the US Office of Naval Research, spending the years 1954-1956 working on Princeton's Analytical Research Project.</li>
<li>During the three years 1956-59, Kruskal lectured at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and at the University of Wisconsin at Ann Arbor.</li>
<li>For example 'Kruskal's algorithm', a graph theory algorithm which finds a minimal spanning tree of a weighted graph, was described in his 1956 paper On the shortest spanning subtree of a graph and the traveling salesman problem.</li>
<li>The 'Kruskal's tree theorem' is the name now given to Kruskal's proof of the Vazsonyi's Conjecture which he published in Well-Quasi-Ordering, The Tree Theorem, and Vazsonyi's Conjecture (1960).</li>
<li>The 'Kruskal-Katona theorem' appears in Kruskal's 1963 paper The number of simplices in a complex and in Gyula O H Katona's 1968 paper A theorem of finite sets.</li>
<li>The 'Kruskal rank' or 'kkk-rank' appears in Kruskal's 1977 paper Three-way arrays rank and uniqueness of trilinear decompositions, with applications to arithmetic complexity and statistics.</li>
<li>In 1978 Kruskal published the book Multidimensional Scaling which was co-authored by Myron Wish.</li>
<li>There is another area to which Kruskal has made a major contribution, namely a field known as lexicostatistics or glottochronology which is a form of comparative linguistics.</li>
<li>Working with Isidore Dyen and Paul Black, Kruskal published the monograph An Indoeuropean Classification, a Lexicostatistical Experiment in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society in 1992.</li>
<li>In 1997 Kruskal announced that the 'Comparative Indoeuropean Data Corpus' was available.</li>
<li>Kruskal's interest in languages extended to an interest in how to write good scientific articles.</li>
<li>Kruskal was a fellow of the American Statistical Association and was honoured by being elected president of both the Psychometric Society and the Classification Society of North America.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 January 1928, New York City, New York, USA. Died 19 September 2010, Maplewood, New Jersey, USA.</p>
