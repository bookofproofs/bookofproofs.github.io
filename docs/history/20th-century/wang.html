<p><strong>Hsien Chung Wang</strong> was a Chinese-born American mathematician who worked in differential geometry, Lie groups and algebraic topology.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His original intention was to take a degree in physics so he began his studies taking courses which would lead to this degree.</li>
<li>On 7 July 1937 Japanese and Chinese troops clashed near Peking.</li>
<li>In late July further fighting broke out and the Japanese quickly captured Peking and Tientsin.</li>
<li>Tsing Hua University was moved to Southwest China where it was amalgamated with Nankai and Peking universities.</li>
<li>Wang had to journey to the new site of his university and begin his studies again.</li>
<li>Perhaps the political events had a positive effect as far as mathematics was concerned since Wang changed his studies to mathematics when he took them up again at the re-established university.</li>
<li>Wang graduated in 1941 and began to study under S S Chern.</li>
<li>He was awarded a master's degree in 1944 and began teaching in a school.</li>
<li>However, after one year, he was awarded a British Council Scholarship to continue his studies in England.</li>
<li>After a while at Sheffield he studied under Newman at Manchester and received a Ph.D. in 1948.</li>
<li>On his return to China, Wang took up a research post at the Chinese National Academy of Sciences.</li>
<li>However political events were again to play a major part in Wang's career.</li>
<li>Between early November 1948 and early January 1949 the Communists and Nationalists fought for control.</li>
<li>The Chinese National Academy of Sciences was set up on Taiwan and Wang followed the Academy there.</li>
<li>From 1949 Wang lived in the United States.</li>
<li>This was not an easy time to obtain a mathematics post in the United States and Wang, although he had an impressive reputation as a mathematician by this time, could only manage a succession of temporary posts.</li>
<li>First he taught at Louisiana State, then for two years at Baton Rouge before he spent his first year at Princeton in 1951-52.</li>
<li>Again he held temporary posts, this time for two years at Alabama Polytechnic, then 1954-55 at Princeton again, 1955-57 at the University of Washington in Seattle followed by a time at Columbia in New York.</li>
<li>Wang married during his time in Seattle.</li>
<li>The year 1957 saw Wang receive an offer of a permanent post for the first time.</li>
<li>This was at Northwestern University where he remained, having further spells at Princeton during this time, until 1966 when he was appointed to Cornell.</li>
<li>Wang worked on algebraic topology and discovered the 'Wang sequence', an exact sequence involving homology groups associated with fibre bundles over spheres.</li>
<li>These discoveries were made while he worked with Newman in Manchester.</li>
<li>Wang also solved, at that time, an important open problem in determining the closed subgroups of maximal rank in a compact Lie group.</li>
<li>Wang's most important work was on discrete subgroups of Lie groups, a topic on which he continued to work.</li>
<li>He published Two-point homogeneous spaces in 1952 which dealt with a homogeneous space of a compact Lie group.</li>
<li>His teaching and other mathematical and administrative activities continued unabated, however, and he played an important role in the department at Cornell.</li>
<li>He was very much liked there, as everywhere, for his modesty, generosity, kindness and curtsey.</li>
<li>He was a fine teacher and lecturer.</li>
<li>He enjoyed excellent health until he was suddenly stricken with leukaemia in June 1978.</li>
<li>He succumbed within weeks, to be survived for only a few months by his wife.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 April 1918, Peking (now Beijing), China. Died 25 June 1978, New York, USA.</p>
