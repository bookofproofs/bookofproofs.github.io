<h1>Person: Johnson (5), Barry</h1>

<p><strong>Barry Johnson</strong> was an English mathematician who worked on operator algebras.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Barry's mother was a secretary at Warner Brothers.</li>
<li>Barry was the oldest of his parents three children, having one younger brother and a younger adopted sister.</li>
<li>Johnson studied mathematics as his main subject but he was also extremely successful in his subsidiary subjects of physics and chemistry, winning a prize from the Royal Australian Chemical Institute.</li>
<li>Johnson's contribution to these, as well as his penetrating and challenging (but never aggressive) questioning of views expressed in lectures left no doubt among his teachers that we were contributing in a modest way to the training of a mathematical giant.</li>
<li>In order to undertake research in pure mathematics Johnson returned to England but he first taught at a grammar school in Tamworth before he began research in functional analysis at Gonville and Caius College of the University of Cambridge in October 1958.</li>
<li>Johnson completed his doctorate in 1961 with a thesis Centralisers in topological algebras.</li>
<li>While in the United States Johnson married Jennifer Munday in Reno.</li>
<li>The newly married couple returned to England in 1963 when Johnson was appointed as a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Exeter.</li>
<li>Johnson spent the year 1970-71 as a visiting professor at Yale University.</li>
<li>This was during a year in which Johnson was visiting professor at the University of California at Los Angelos, at Santa Barbara, and at Berkeley.</li>
<li>In 1978 Johnson was honoured by being elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London.</li>
<li>Johnson served the London Mathematical Society as a member of the Council during 1975-78, then as the 60th  president of the Society in 1980-82.</li>
<li>Johnson firmly believed, however, that the London Mathematical Society must remain totally non-political and that members of the Society could express their political views only as individuals.</li>
<li>Johnson was a governor of the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle from 1987.</li>
<li>Johnson is well known for his work on Banach algebras and operator algebras, in particular, studying cohomology in these algebras.</li>
<li>In 1972 Johnson wrote a joint paper with Ringrose and Kadison on cohomology of operator algebras and in the same year his book Cohomology in Banach algebras (1972) appeared.</li>
<li>We mentioned above that Johnson was President of the London Mathematical Society during 1980-82.</li>
<li>Barry also liked listening to music and doing his own repairs and alterations to their house and their cottage on the Scottish borders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 August 1937, Woolwich, London, England. Died 5 May 2002, Newcastle upon Tyne, England.</p>
