<p><strong>Emma Castelnuovo</strong> was an Italian mathematician known for her contributions to mathematics education.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>This award was named after Emma Castelnuovo.</li>
<li>Emma graduated in mathematics at the University of Rome in 1936.</li>
<li>Just after the Second World War, Emma with a university professor and a young colleague organized a successful series of talks held by mathematicians, physicists, philosophers, and educators.</li>
<li>Already at the beginning of her career Emma was looking for a way of teaching aimed at actively involving students.</li>
<li>In Emma's interpretation of Clairaut's project the winning ideas are: intuition, real problems, and history.</li>
<li>Some decades later Emma succeeded to have the elements of probability in the new Italian programmes for middle school launched in the 1970s.</li>
<li>Emma's new way of teaching geometry is based on the use of concrete materials, on looking at objects, discovering geometric properties, and in manipulating changing figures.</li>
<li>Since 1949 Emma was in contact with teachers of the École Decroly, where Paul Libois (1906-1991) used concrete materials.</li>
<li>On many occasions Emma refers to Enriques's view on the importance of the history of mathematics in building knowledge and claims to apply that view in her teaching.</li>
<li>This was the case of Emma who was asked by Gattegno to join CIEAEM (Commission Internationale pour l'Étude et l'Amélioration de l'Enseignement des Mathématiques - International Commission for the Study and Improvement of Mathematics Teaching).</li>
<li>Emma was president of CIEAEM from 1979 to 1981.</li>
<li>Emma was one of the two representatives of Italy and took an active part in the discussion about modern mathematics.</li>
<li>When Freudenthal succeeded in achieving the two goals of founding a new journal and having a conference dedicated to mathematics education, Emma was an active participant in both events.</li>
<li>Emma was a very special teacher for many reasons.</li>
<li>Emma's contributions to mathematics education was not only directed to students, but also to her colleagues, especially young colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 12 December 1913, Rome, Italy. Died 13 April 2014, Rome, Italy.</p>
