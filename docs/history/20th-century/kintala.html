<h1>Person: Kintala, Chandra Mohan Rao</h1>

<p><strong>Chandra Kintala</strong> was an Indian-born American computer scientist who worked on the theory of computer languages.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chandra was born in Berhampur which is a town in the south east of the state of Orissa in eastern India.</li>
<li>Kintala studied at the Rourkela Engineering College in Raurkela, Orissa.</li>
<li>Kintala was awarded a B.Tech.</li>
<li>Kintala studied for this degree and was awarded an M.Tech.</li>
<li>[We should note that the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, has three references to Kintala on its website, each giving a different year for him graduating with the M.Tech.</li>
<li>However, in 1974 Fischer moved to Pennsylvania State University in the United States to take up the position of Head of Department, and Kintala decided to move with his thesis advisor and enrolled in the Ph.D. programme at Pennsylvania State.</li>
<li>Kintala presented an extended abstract of his thesis results in a joint paper with his thesis advisor Patrick Fischer to the Ninth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing held at Boulder, Colorado in May 1977.</li>
<li>Following the award of his doctorate, Kintala was appointed as an Assistant Professor at the University of Southern California in 1977.</li>
<li>In 1978 Kintala published Refining nondeterminism in context-free languages.</li>
<li>As much as Chandra enjoyed life there, professionally and privately, he missed a close interaction with the more practical side of computer science.</li>
<li>Together with David Belanger, Kintala was awarded a patent for "A generator of program generators" in 1986.</li>
<li>Kintala's work with Yennun Huang also led to a Japanese patent for "Device and method for updating software" in 1995 and a Canadian patent for "Progressive retry method and apparatus having reusable software modules for software failure", also in 1995.</li>
<li>Although much of Kintala's work falls outside what we would call mathematics, there is still quite a substantial number of papers which do fall within that topic and are reviewed in Mathematical reviews.</li>
<li>In September 2006, Kintala left the United States and returned to India, taking up an appointment with Motorola Inc.</li>
<li>Based in Bangalore, Mr Kintala will oversee the work of all Motorola Lab centres of excellence in India.</li>
<li>Kintala was honoured with the award of the Smithsonian medal, sponsored by Computer World, in 1998.</li>
<li>His death is a loss to the U.S. technical community and to the nation, for teachers such as Chandra are badly needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 22 July 1948, Berhampur, Orissa, (now Brahmapur, Odisha) India. Died 5 November 2009, Summit, New Jersey, USA.</p>
