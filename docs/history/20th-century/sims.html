<p><strong>Charlie Sims</strong> was an American mathematician best known for his work in group theory and in particular for the discovery of one of the sporadic simple groups.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His parents were Ernest McPherson Sims (1883-1973) and Natalie Cornelia Coffin (1899-1987).</li>
<li>Ernest McPherson Sims, born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on 1 April 1883, was  the President and General Manager of a Metal Forming Company.</li>
<li>Charles Sims attended both Elementary and High School in his home town of Elkhart, Indiana.</li>
<li>While at Harvard, Sims met Annette, born 7 October 1941, when both were singing in the choir of Harvard-Epworth United Methodist Church on Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate, Sims taught for a short while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before being appointed to Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1965.</li>
<li>Charles and Annette C Sims lived at first at 52 Terhune Road in Princeton, but later moved to Allenhurst, a small town on the Atlantic Coast near Asbury Park.</li>
<li>Sims' research soon turned to permutation groups and computational techniques in general.</li>
<li>Sims' next paper was Computation of invariants in the theory of cyclotomic fields (1966).</li>
<li>In 1967 Sims made a major breakthrough when, working with Donald Higman, he discovered the previously unknown sporadic simple group now known as the Higman-Sims group.</li>
<li>The Higman-Sims group is a primitive permutation group of degree 100, has order 44 352 000 and has rank 3.</li>
<li>Sims made another major breakthrough which he announced to the conference Computational Problems in Abstract Algebra held in Oxford, England, 29 August to 2 September 1967.</li>
<li>The computer program that Sims refers to in the final sentence is now known as an implementation of the Schreier-Sims algorithm, a linear time algorithm devised by Sims to find the order of a permutation group given generating permutations.</li>
<li>In fact Sims announced the existence and uniqueness of Lyons' group at the conference Finite groups '72 held at the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, 23-24 March 1972.</li>
<li>At the conference Computational methods for representations of groups and algebras at the University of Essen, Essen, 1-5 April 1997, Sims and George Havas gave a presentation for this Lyons finite simple sporadic group.</li>
<li>Sims' outstanding research contributions were recognised in 1972 when he received the Rutgers University Board of Trustees Award for Excellence in Research.</li>
<li>Let us look now at some contributions that Sims made to the teaching and administration at Rutgers University.</li>
<li>Sims also organised conferences and workshops at Rutgers.</li>
<li>Sims wrote two books, the first being Abstract algebra: A computational approach (1984).</li>
<li>We present a summary of Sims' Preface and his Introduction.</li>
<li>Charles C Sims, The State University of New Jersey New Brunswick, was elected to the Inaugural Class of Fellows.</li>
<li>Indeed, from my point of view, Higman and Sims were the two people who introduced graph theory into the study of permutation groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 April 1937, Elkhart, Indiana, USA. Died 23 October 2017, St Petersburg, Florida, USA.</p>
