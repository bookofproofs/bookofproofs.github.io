<p><strong>W W Sawyer</strong> was an English-born mathematician who is best known for his inspiring books on elementary mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His father was Walter Percy Sawyer (1881-1948), a Surveyor of Taxes, and his mother was Elizabeth Whettnall Stevens (1884-1941).</li>
<li>Walter Percy Sawyer, born 25 June 1881, lived at Ranelagh House, Bounds Green Road, Wood Green, Tottenham, the son of Edward and Lavina Sawyer.</li>
<li>She married Walter Percy Sawyer in 1909 and they lived in Wood Green, Tottenham.</li>
<li>It was there that W W Sawyer, the subject of this biography, was born.</li>
<li>On 23 May 1912, W W Sawyer's sister, Mary Sawyer, was born, also in Osborne Cottage, East Street, St Ives.</li>
<li>Walter Warwick Sawyer did not spend his childhood in St Ives but rather in Tottenham, London, from 1911 to 1914, then at Harrow on the Hill, near London, from 1914 to 1918 after his family moved there.</li>
<li>Sawyer was an active member of The Adams Society, the mathematical society at St John's College, named after John Couch Adams.</li>
<li>On 16 November 1932, W W Sawyer traced the development of Wave Mechanics and the Hamilton-Jacobi Theory, and many interesting points, some quite original, were raised.</li>
<li>The Adams Society was not the only society Sawyer took an active part in, another being the Chess Club.</li>
<li>We note that Paul Dirac was Lucasian professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, appointed in the year before Sawyer began to undertake research.</li>
<li>Sawyer published Note on a paper of Bell and Wolfenden on electrolytic separation of diplogen in 1935.</li>
<li>In the paper Sawyer confirms that γ is independent of the mass of the isotope with a more accurate calculation.</li>
<li>In October 1935 Sawyer was appointed as an assistant to E T Copson, the Professor of Mathematics at University College, Dundee.</li>
<li>At this time University College, Dundee, was a college of the University of St Andrews, so Sawyer was at this time on the staff of the University of St Andrews.</li>
<li>The Mathematics department in Dundee that he joined was small with Copson as the professor, Frederick Bath as a lecturer, and two assistants, Sawyer and Cecil Gilbert.</li>
<li>After two years in Dundee, Sawyer moved to the University of Manchester in 1937, taking up an appointment of Assistant Lecturer in Mathematics of Engineering and Physics.</li>
<li>On 30 May 1940 Sawyer married Hilda Elizabeth Crowther (1920-2003), known as Betty, after, it is claimed, a ten day courtship.</li>
<li>Warwick and Betty Sawyer had one child, a daughter Anne Elizabeth Sawyer.</li>
<li>While Sawyer was at Manchester he published his first book, namely Mathematician's Delight (1943).</li>
<li>Sawyer remained in Manchester until 1944, the year he published his second paper A property of certain differential equations.</li>
<li>In 1944 Sawyer moved to the Leicester College of Technology where he lived at 12 Milligan Road, Leicester.</li>
<li>These experiences had a large impact on Sawyer's ideas about teaching and several of his later books, for example Search for Pattern and Design and Making, are clearly motivated by them.</li>
<li>In 1950 Sawyer moved to Canterbury College, Christchurch, New Zealand where he taught until 1956.</li>
<li>After a year at the University of Illinois, Sawyer was appointed as professor of mathematics at Wesleyan University.</li>
<li>Dr Sawyer will speak at 7:30 p.m. in room 111 of Mallory Hall on the topic, "A Pictorial Approach to Advanced Calculus." The lecture is open to the public.</li>
<li>A native of England, Dr Sawyer joined the faculty at Wesleyan in Middletown, Conn., in 1958.</li>
<li>Dr Sawyer is a member of both the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America.</li>
<li>Warwick Sawyer was an extraordinary individual who was very much his own master.</li>
<li>As well as his books, Sawyer wrote many papers on mathematics education.</li>
<li>We note that Sawyer did not write exclusively on mathematical education during his retirement, publishing the papers Conjectures related to the Hilbert matrix (1986) and Quotients of moment functions (1993).</li>
<li>After the death of his wife in 2003, Sawyer moved to Toronto to live with his daughter and her husband.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 April 1911, St Ives, Huntingdonshire, (now Cambridgeshire) England. Died 15 February 2008, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</p>
