<h1>Person: Iyahen, Sunday</h1>

<p><strong>Sunday Iyahen</strong> was a Nigerian mathematician who worked in topological vector spaces. He became a senator in the Nigerian parliament.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sunday Iyahen was given the name 'Sunday' since that was the day on which he was born.</li>
<li>We note the coincidence that he also died on a Sunday.</li>
<li>Iyahen attended the Saint Matthew's Primary school, Benin City (1944-45), and then the Saint Peter's School, Benin City (1945-51).</li>
<li>After one year, Iyahen moved to Saint Peter's School which had been established later, again by the Church Mission Society, and had an excellent reputation for academic record and discipline.</li>
<li>In 1952 Iyahen entered Edo College, Benin City, which had been established in February 1937.</li>
<li>At the University of Glasgow, Iyahen was advised by Alexander Provan Robertson (1925-1995) who had been born and brought up in Glasgow.</li>
<li>Iyahen was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Keele in 1967 for his thesis On certain classes of linear topological spaces.</li>
<li>Iyahen's first publication was Some remarks on countably barrelled and countably quasibarrelled spaces which was published in the 1966-67 volume of the Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>This paper gives Iyahen's address as the University of Keele but his next paper, which contained results from his thesis, On certain classes of linear topological spaces, submitted on 20 March 1967 and published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society in 1968, has his address as Department of Mathematics, University of Ibadan, Nigeria.</li>
<li>Before returning to Nigeria after the award of his Ph.D., Iyahen made a research visit to the University of Cambridge.</li>
<li>In 1971 Iyahen was promoted to Senior Lecturer at the University of Ibadan but, one year later moved to the University of Benin where he was appointed as an Associate Professor.</li>
<li>Iyahen published around 30 papers between 1967 and 1989.</li>
<li>Even though the army dissolved the house of legislature within few months of its inception, Professor S O Iyahen was already being noticed both within the house of parliament and by the general Public as a man who knows the meaning of the word Toil.</li>
<li>Sunday Iyahen was awarded many honours for his outstanding mathematical contributions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 October 1937, Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria. Died 28 January 2018, Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria.</p>
