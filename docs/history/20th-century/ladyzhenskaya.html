<p><strong>Olga Ladyzhenskaya</strong> was a Russian mathematician who worked on partial differential equations and finite-difference methods.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Olga's birth place Kologriv was surrounded by 'wild' forests, near the picturesque river Unzha.</li>
<li>Her mother was a hard-working housewife, looking after her husband and three daughters of whom Olga was the youngest.</li>
<li>She was the closest to her father who was a mathematics teacher and the catalyst for Olga's life long interest in mathematics.</li>
<li>It became apparent that Olga showed a strong talent for logical thinking from an early age.</li>
<li>Olga's grandfather, Gennady Ladyzhensky, was a famous painter.</li>
<li>All her life Olga carefully kept beautiful landscape paintings by her grandfather, some of them depicting fine views of the Unzha.</li>
<li>During Olga's upbringing, times were very hard especially for intellectuals descended from Russian nobility for whom everything was in short supply including food, paper and clothes.</li>
<li>Olga's two sisters were forbidden to finish their studies, being expelled from school, but the authorities allowed Olga to finish her studies.</li>
<li>However, Olga had problems continuing her education since she was the daughter of an "enemy of the nation".</li>
<li>Alexander Solschenizyn recalls in his epic of The Gulag Archipelago  that although Olga's father had been warned by a peasant that he was on the list of enemies of the state, he refused to run and hide.</li>
<li>This tragedy deeply affected Ladyzhenskaya and the family was placed in a very difficult situation with her mother and sisters having to do craft work and make dresses, shoes, soap, as this was their only way for their family to survive.</li>
<li>In 1939, despite leaving secondary school with excellent marks, Olga was forbidden to enter Leningrad State University as her father was thought of as an "enemy of the nation".</li>
<li>In 1943 she became a student at Moscow State University (MGU) due to the intervention of the mother of one of her pupils who, on returning to Moscow, persuaded the rector to invite Olga to MGU.</li>
<li>At University Olga's love of mathematics blossomed and she was awarded a Stalin stipend and a labourers ration card without which she would have been unable to survive.</li>
<li>After she graduated in 1947, Olga moved once again to Leningrad due to family circumstances and became a postgraduate at the Leningrad State University on the recommendation of MGU.</li>
<li>They were a loving couple yet their marriage was brief as Andrei wanted to have children, but Olga did not as she wished to devote her life to mathematics and she felt that children might be an obstacle.</li>
<li>Olga remained single for the rest of her life.</li>
<li>In 1949 Olga defended her doctoral dissertation (comparable to an habilitation) which was on the development of finite differences methods for linear and quasilinear hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations, formally supervised by Sobolev though in practice it was Smirnov.</li>
<li>Olga started to prepare her diploma thesis on a problem suggested by Petrovsky.</li>
<li>Many papers written jointly by Olga and Nina Ural'tseva were devoted to the investigation of quasilinear elliptic and parabolic equations of the second order.</li>
<li>From the mid-1950's Olga and her students made advances in the study of boundary-value problems for quasilinear elliptic and parabolic equations.</li>
<li>The following are a few of the numerous awards and achievements in Ladyzhenskaya's life.</li>
<li>In the Museum of Science (Boston, USA) Olga Ladyhenskaya's name is among other influential mathematicians of the 20th  century carved on a large marble desk in the Mathematics Exhibition Hall.</li>
<li>Olga had not been allowed to travel outside Eastern Europe, apart from in 1958 when she attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Edinburgh, and not again until 30 years later in 1988.</li>
<li>It was then that Leray saw the sights of Leningrad for the first time, including the Hermitage, Peterhof, and on meeting Olga realized that they had been researching the same topics.</li>
<li>When Olga first started to work on the Navier-Stokes equation, she was unaware of the work of Leray and Eberhard Hopf.</li>
<li>Olga, was not only interested in mathematics and science, but she had a passion for arts and was an active participant in the intellectual community of St Petersburg.</li>
<li>Olga's reputation as an independent spirit was furthered by her friendship with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the author and dissident.</li>
<li>Anna Akhmatova a famous Russian poet, knew Ladyzhenskaya so well that she devoted a poem to her.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 March 1922, Kologriv, Kostroma province, Russia. Died 12 January 2004, St Petersburg, Russia.</p>
