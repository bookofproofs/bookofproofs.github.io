<h1>Person: Meinhardt, Hans</h1>

<p><strong>Hans Meinhardt</strong> was a German scientist who is known for his pioneering work in the field of pattern formation in biology.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Already at this time the Soviet Army was in control of Mühlhausen, the city in which Hans was living, and it became part of the German Democratic Republic in 1949.</li>
<li>Hans began his school education in Mühlhausen.</li>
<li>The rest of Hans Meinhardt's education was in West Germany.</li>
<li>Meinhardt attended the University of Heidelberg and the University of Cologne where he studied mathematics and physics.</li>
<li>The Institute of Genetics, the first institute at a German university that was exclusively dedicated to research in molecular biology, was opened in 1962 and at the opening ceremony Niels Bohr gave the lecture "Light and life revisited." Meinhardt, a student at Cologne at this time, attended this lecture.</li>
<li>After completing his doctorate, Meinhardt was appointed to a 3-year postdoctoral position at the European High Energy Laboratory (CERN) in Geneva.</li>
<li>So after completing his three years as a postdoctoral worker at CERN, in 1969 Meinhardt joined the group headed by Alfred Gierer at the Max Planck Institute for Virus Research in Tübingen, Germany.</li>
<li>Meinhardt's first task at this Institute was an experimental one but again Meinhardt found experimental work not to his liking and looked for a theoretical project.</li>
<li>After attending a seminar, Meinhardt thought he could make use of his skills in computer modelling to simulate the experimental ideas presented in the seminar.</li>
<li>The University of Tübingen, however, had a computer centre with a Hollerith machine operated by punch cards, and Meinhardt was able to make use of this machine.</li>
<li>The result of this work was presented in the fundamental paper A theory of biological pattern formation  written by Gierer and Meinhardt and published in 1972.</li>
<li>Meinhardt continued to develop these models and in 1982 published the book Models of Biological Pattern Formation.</li>
<li>Among these models, that of Gierer and Meinhardt, first published about a decade ago, has accounted with notable success for Hydra regeneration and response to grafting and for effects of damage in early insect embryogenesis.</li>
<li>Meinhardt's book is principally a detailed account of the correlation of this model with a wide variety of experimental phenomena.</li>
<li>Meinhardt's second book was The Algorithmic Beauty of Sea Shells: The Virtual Laboratory (1995).</li>
<li>Meinhardt retired in 2003 but, like so many research scientists, he continued to work on a variety of projects.</li>
<li>Hans Meinhardt was a happy and dedicated scientist.</li>
<li>As Hans was fond of saying: "So wird's gemacht" - that's how it's done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 December 1938, Mühlhausen, Thuringia, Germany. Died 11 February 2016, Tübingen, Germany.</p>
