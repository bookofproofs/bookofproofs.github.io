<p><strong>Yozo Matsushima</strong> was a Japanese mathematician who worked in Lie groups and algebras.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Matsushima was appointed as an assistant in the Mathematical Institute of Nagoya Imperial University (like Osaka and other Japanese universities it would soon drop the name "Imperial" from its title) immediately he had received his B.Sc. degree, and he was in post in time for the 1942-43 academic year.</li>
<li>The first paper which Matsushima published contained a proof that a conjecture of Zassenhaus was false.</li>
<li>The 1947 volume of the Proceedings of the Japan Academy, containing two papers by Matsushima, did not appear until 1950 while the first volume of Journal of the Mathematical Society of Japan contained three of his papers.</li>
<li>Having earlier being promoted to associate professor, in 1953 Matsushima became a full professor at Nagoya University.</li>
<li>It was a visit which Matsushima greatly enjoyed, and which was most useful to him.</li>
<li>Equally Chevalley enjoyed the visit and invited Matsushima to spend the following year in France.</li>
<li>Matsushima presented some of his results to Ehresmann's seminar in Strasbourg, extending Cartan's classification of complex irreducible Lie algebras to the case of real Lie algebras.</li>
<li>When Shoda retired from the Chair of Algebra at Osaka University, Matsushima was appointed to fill the vacant chair in early 1960.</li>
<li>Back in Osaka, Matsushima jointly began to organise the United States-Japan Seminar in Differential Geometry which was held in Kyoto in June 1965.</li>
<li>In September 1966 Matsushima accepted a chair at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana in the United States.</li>
<li>Matsushima spent 14 years as a professor at Notre Dame before returning to Japan in 1980.</li>
<li>He reached the age of 60 in February 1981 and a volume of papers by colleagues and former students was published: Manifolds and Lie groups, Papers in honour of Yozo Matsushima.</li>
<li>Among the honours that Matsushima received, perhaps the most prestigious was the Asahi Prize which was presented to him for his research on continuous groups in 1962.</li>
<li>We have mentioned several topics on which Matsushima worked in the course of this biography.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 February 1921, Sakai, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. Died 9 April 1983, Osaka, Japan.</p>
