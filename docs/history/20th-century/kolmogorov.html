<h1>Person: Kolmogorov, Andrey Nikolaevich</h1>

<p><strong>Andrey Kolmogorov</strong> was one of the developers of probability theory. He later used this work to study the motion of the planets and the turbulent flow of air from a jet engine.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kolmogorov's mother also, tragically, took no part in his upbringing since she died in childbirth at Kolmogorov's birth.</li>
<li>His mother's sister, Vera Yakovlena, brought Kolmogorov up and he always had the deepest affection for her.</li>
<li>In fact it was chance that had Kolmogorov born in Tambov since the family had no connections with that place.</li>
<li>Kolmogorov's mother had been on a journey from the Crimea back to her home in Tunoshna near Yaroslavl and it was in the home of his maternal grandfather in Tunoshna that Kolmogorov spent his youth.</li>
<li>Kolmogorov's name came from his grandfather, Yakov Stepanovich Kolmogorov, and not from his own father.</li>
<li>After Kolmogorov left school he worked for a while as a conductor on the railway.</li>
<li>Then, in 1920, Kolmogorov entered Moscow State University but at this stage he was far from committed to mathematics.</li>
<li>Kolmogorov may have told this story as a joke but nevertheless jokes are only funny if there is some truth in them and undoubtedly this is the case here.</li>
<li>In mathematics Kolmogorov was influenced at an early stage by a number of outstanding mathematicians.</li>
<li>P S Aleksandrov was beginning his research (for the second time) at Moscow around the time Kolmogorov began his undergraduate career.</li>
<li>However the person who made the deepest impression on Kolmogorov at this time was Stepanov who lectured to him on trigonometric series.</li>
<li>It is remarkable that Kolmogorov, although only an undergraduate, began research and produced results of international importance at this stage.</li>
<li>This was wholly unexpected by the experts and Kolmogorov's name began to be known around the world.</li>
<li>Kolmogorov graduated from Moscow State University in 1925 and began research under Luzin's supervision in that year.</li>
<li>It is remarkable that Kolmogorov published eight papers in 1925, all written while he was still an undergraduate.</li>
<li>Another milestone occurred in 1925, namely Kolmogorov's first paper on probability appeared.</li>
<li>In 1929 Kolmogorov completed his doctorate.</li>
<li>An important event for Kolmogorov was his friendship with Aleksandrov which began in the summer of 1929 when they spent three weeks together.</li>
<li>There Aleksandrov worked on the topology book which he co-authored with Hopf, while Kolmogorov worked on Markov processes with continuous states and continuous time.</li>
<li>Kolmogorov's results from his work by the Lake were published in 1931 and mark the beginning of diffusion theory.</li>
<li>In the summer of 1931 Kolmogorov and Aleksandrov made another long trip.</li>
<li>They visited Berlin, Göttingen, Munich, and Paris where Kolmogorov spent many hours in deep discussions with Paul Lévy.</li>
<li>Aleksandrov and Kolmogorov bought a house in Komarovka, a small village outside Moscow, in 1935.</li>
<li>Among them were Aleksandrov, Gelfand, Kolmogorov, Petrovsky, and Khinchin.</li>
<li>The Department of Probability and Statistics was set up at the Institute and Kolmogorov was appointed as Head of Department.</li>
<li>Kolmogorov later extended his work to study the motion of the planets and the turbulent flow of air from a jet engine.</li>
<li>We must mention just a few of the numerous other major contributions which Kolmogorov made in a whole range of different areas of mathematics.</li>
<li>In topology Kolmogorov introduced the notion of cohomology groups at much the same time, and independently of, Alexander.</li>
<li>In 1934 Kolmogorov investigated chains, cochains, homology and cohomology of a finite cell complex.</li>
<li>In further papers, published in 1936, Kolmogorov defined cohomology groups for an arbitrary locally compact topological space.</li>
<li>At this conference both Kolmogorov and Alexander lectured on their independent work on cohomology.</li>
<li>In 1953 and 1954 two papers by Kolmogorov, each of four pages in length, appeared.</li>
<li>These papers mark the beginning of KAM-theory, which is named after Kolmogorov, Arnold and Moser.</li>
<li>Kolmogorov addressed the International Congress of Mathematicians in Amsterdam in 1954 on this topic with his important talk General theory of dynamical systems and classical mechanics.</li>
<li>If Kolmogorov made a major contribution to Hilbert's sixth problem, he completely solved Hilbert's Thirteenth Problem in 1957 when he showed that Hilbert was wrong in asking for a proof that there exist continuous functions of three variables which could not be represented by continuous functions of two variables.</li>
<li>Such an outstanding scientist as Kolmogorov naturally received a whole host of honours from many different countries.</li>
<li>In addition to the prizes mentioned above, Kolmogorov was awarded the Balzan International Prize in 1962.</li>
<li>Kolmogorov had many interests outside mathematics, in particular he was interested in the form and structure of the poetry of the Russian author Pushkin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 April 1903, Tambov, Tambov province, Russia. Died 20 October 1987, Moscow, Russia.</p>
