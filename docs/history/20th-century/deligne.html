<p><strong>Pierre Deligne</strong> is a Belgian mathematician who won a Fields Medal for his work on algebraic number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although Deligne was an undergraduate at the Free University of Brussels from 1962 to 1966, he spent the academic year 1965-66 at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate, Deligne went to the Institut des Hautes études Scientifiques at Bures-sur-Yvette in France where he was a visiting member until February 1970 when he became a permanent member of the Institute.</li>
<li>He also worked closely with Jean-Pierre Serre, leading to important results on the l-adic representations attached to modular forms, and the conjectural functional equations of L-functions.</li>
<li>Deligne remained based at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques until 1984 when he went to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in the United States, where he was appointed a professor.</li>
<li>A solution of the three Weil conjectures was given by Deligne in 1974.</li>
<li>This work brought together algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory and it led to Deligne being awarded a Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki in 1978.</li>
<li>Deligne has worked on many other important problems.</li>
<li>Deligne has been awarded many other honours for his outstanding contributions.</li>
<li>Viewed as a whole, Deligne's work concerns many different aspects of the cohomology of algebraic varieties.</li>
<li>Through an unparalleled blend of penetrating insights, fearless technical mastery and dazzling ingenuity, Deligne has singlehandedly brought about a new understanding of the cohomology of varieties, both classical and in finite characteristic, with numerous applications to deep problems in geometry and number theory.</li>
<li>Alone or in collaboration, Pierre Deligne has written about a hundred papers, most of them of sizeable length.</li>
<li>As winner of the Balzan Prize, Deligne received 1 million Swiss francs (about US$800,000), half of which would go to research projects involving young researchers in his field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 October 1944, Etterbeek, Brussels, Belgium.</p>
