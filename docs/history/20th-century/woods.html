<h1>Person: Woods, Leslie Colin</h1>

<p><strong>Leslie Woods</strong> was a New Zealand mathematician who worked in fluid mechanics, particularly in the area of plasmas.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His name was not Woods at this stage, that was a name he chose later in life, but rather he was Leslie Woodhead.</li>
<li>His father became a fisherman when Leslie was four years old and the family moved to Mercury Bay on Coromandel Peninsula on the north coast of the North Island.</li>
<li>There the family home was a tent and, after his younger brother died, Leslie lived in an isolated situation with only his mother and father for company.</li>
<li>The nearest village was Whitianga and the family moved there after a year so that Leslie could attend school.</li>
<li>It was not until he was fourteen years old when he began attending Brixton Road Primary School that Leslie wore shoes for the first time.</li>
<li>When one of the teachers at Seddon Memorial Technical College offered to pay for Leslie from his own pocket, his father relented.</li>
<li>Leslie then began the engineering course at Auckland University College.</li>
<li>In 1944 he was awarded an M.Sc. (Second Class) and in the same year, just before the birth of his first daughter, he changed his name from Woodhead to Woods.</li>
<li>Woods then did something that few others have ever done - after the award of his doctorate he studied for an Oxford B.A. which he was awarded in 1951.</li>
<li>By this time Woods had joined the New Zealand Defence Corps and they sent him to the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington in 1951.</li>
<li>In February 1954 Woods was appointed to a Senior Lectureship in Applied Mathematics at Sydney University.</li>
<li>Woods was Chairman of the Mathematical Institute at Oxford University from 1984 to 1989.</li>
<li>We should mention another important contribution by Woods.</li>
<li>As to Woods personal life we note that he had five daughters with his first wife Betty.</li>
<li>The book received a better review in "The Aeroplane" than in the physics literature, and it seems to have been ignored by the axiomatic applied mathematics community, with whom Woods had also become embattled; he did not like "rigor mortis".</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 6 December 1922, Reporoa, New Zealand. Died 15 April 2007, Oxford, England.</p>
