<p><strong>Laila Soueif</strong> is an Egyptian mathematician who became a professor of mathematics at Cairo University. She is an activist for human rights and has been involved in many demonstrations including calling for academic freedom at Cairo University.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In fact Mustafa Soueif translated the writings of Sigmund Freud into Arabic.</li>
<li>The mood of those around Soueif changed with everyone talking of the disaster for the country.</li>
<li>When Soueif was studying at the high school she would walk past Cairo University and see student sit-ins and banners of protest.</li>
<li>Soueif graduated from the high school in 1973 and, in the autumn of that year, she began to study mathematics at the University of Cairo.</li>
<li>Soueif worked with the group but did not join them, she was too intent on her mathematical studies.</li>
<li>In 1977, after Soueif graduated, she was appointed as a tutor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Cairo where she began working towards a Master's Degree in algebra.</li>
<li>Out on bail until Mubarak approved the sentence, he met up with Soueif who, on hearing of his sentence, had rushed back to Cairo.</li>
<li>Soueif returned to Poitiers and continued to undertake research for her Ph.D. advised by Annie Page.</li>
<li>Soueif published the paper Normalizing extensions and injective modules, essentially bounded normalizing extensions (1987).</li>
<li>Soueif was appointed to a tenured professorship in mathematics at Cairo University.</li>
<li>For her part, and even while retaining her mathematics professorship at Cairo University, Laila had gained a reputation as one of Cairo's most indefatigable "street" leaders, the veteran of countless protest marches against the government.</li>
<li>From demonstrations calling for academic freedom at Cairo University to the earliest manifestations of the Kifaya movement to the uprising of 2011 and beyond, Soueif is a curiously iconic figure.</li>
<li>Laila Soueif is someone who is driven by her complete commitment to social justice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 May 1956, London, England.</p>
