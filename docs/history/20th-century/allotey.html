<p><strong>Francis Allotey </strong>was a mathematician and physicist from Ghana who was awarded a Ph.D. by Princeton University in 1966. He returned to Ghana where he spent his career as a professor of mathematics and did outstanding work promoting mathematics and physics at all levels throughout Africa.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Joseph Kofi Allotey owned a shop which sold books, musical instruments and fishing equipment.</li>
<li>Alice Allotey was a dressmaker.</li>
<li>Joseph and Alice Allotey had seven children, three boys and four girls.</li>
<li>From the oldest to the youngest they are: Martha Allotey; Francis Allotey, the subject of this biography; Elizabeth Allotey; Augustine K F Allotey, born 5 September 1937, who became a student in London living at the same address as Francis in the late 1950s and early 1960s and became a pharmacist; Agatha Allotey; Theresa Allotey; and Michael Allotey.</li>
<li>They married and had two children, Francis Kojo Enu Allotey and Joseph Kobina Nyansa Allotey, while living at 54 Wayford Street, Battersea North, London.</li>
<li>Allotey's wife appears to have been known as Enid up till the time of her marriage, but after that she was known as Edoris.</li>
<li>At the Imperial College of Science and Technology, Allotey was taught by Abdus Salam (1926-1996), a Pakistani born theoretical physicist who was appointed to a chair at Imperial College in 1957 and set up the Theoretical Physics Department.</li>
<li>Allotey was also taught by Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett (1897-1974), who had been appointed as head of the Physics Department at Imperial College in 1953.</li>
<li>Allotey's other teachers included Eric Thomas Eady (1915-1966), a meteorologist, and Harry Jones (1905-1986), a theoretical physicist who made important contributions to the study of electrons in metals and who was head of the Mathematics Department at Imperial College from 1955.</li>
<li>Allotey said that he got ahead of the others in his class by studying papers published in the previous ten years.</li>
<li>In 1960, Allotey was awarded the Diploma of Imperial College (London) and on 30 December of that year Allotey, together with his wife and two children, left the Port of London on the S S Calabar heading for the port of Takoradi, Ghana.</li>
<li>This university had been Kumasi College of Technology, but had been awarded university status in 1961, the year Allotey began teaching there.</li>
<li>Although he was now well-qualified, Allotey wanted to undertake research for a Ph.D. on a topic he had started researching at Imperial College and was accepted by Princeton University in the United States.</li>
<li>Allotey says he was the first black student to be admitted to the graduate school, and that was the most exciting moment of his life.</li>
<li>Allotey was awarded the Prince Philip Gold medal of the Ghana Academy of Sciences for his contribution to physical sciences in 1973.</li>
<li>It was one of a great many awards that Allotey received.</li>
<li>In November 1981 Allotey's wife Edoris died.</li>
<li>Asie had two children from a previous marriage, Cilinnie and Kay, and so Allotey now gained two daughters.</li>
<li>It was the support of his professor at Imperial College, Abdus Salam, that helped Allotey use his skills to promote the study of mathematics and physics at all levels throughout Africa.</li>
<li>Allotey was one of 33 participants who attended the General Assembly; they all became founding fellows of the Academy.</li>
<li>Allotey took a leading role in the UN declaring that 2005 would be the International Year of Physics and 2015 would be the International Year of Light.</li>
<li>The first African Institute of Mathematics opened in South Africa in 2003 followed by a Senegal Institute in 2011, the Ghana one on Allotey's initiative in 2012, then Institutes in Cameroon  2013, in Tanzania 2014, and in Rwanda 2016.</li>
<li>Allotey reached the age of 85 in excellent health.</li>
<li>We all know now that though Kofi Allotey was born of ordinary circumstances, he lived an extraordinary and fascinating life as a father, academic and a renowned scholar.</li>
<li>From very humble beginnings, Prof Allotey defied all the odds and obstacles that came his way, and indeed there were many of those.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 9 August 1932, Saltpond, Gold Coast (now Ghana). Died 2 November 2017, Accra, Ghana.</p>
