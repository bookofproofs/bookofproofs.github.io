<h1>Person: Fichera, Gaetano</h1>

<p><strong>Gaetano Fichera</strong> was an Italian mathematician who worked in mathematical analysis, linear elasticity, partial differential equations and several complex variables.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Giuseppe and Marianna had four children, all sons, and Gaetano was the eldest.</li>
<li>Giuseppe Fichera had graduated with his laurea in mathematics from the University of Catania in 1921.</li>
<li>He had been a student of Bernardino Gaetano Scorza, who taught at Catania from 1916 to 1920, and Giuseppe had become an expert on the theory of group representations.</li>
<li>After Scorza moved to Naples, Giuseppe Fichera became an assistant to Mauro Picone who was appointed Head of Mathematics at Catania in 1921.</li>
<li>However, after Giuseppe Fichera's second son was born, he left university teaching to become a secondary school teacher of mathematics.</li>
<li>However, Giuseppe Fichera remained a close friend of Picone all his life and this was to have a considerable beneficial effect on the young Gaetano.</li>
<li>Having an excellent mathematician for a father, it is not surprising that the young Gaetano quickly developed a deep love for the subject.</li>
<li>However, by the time Fichera was studying with her, Nalli had become interested in tensorial calculus.</li>
<li>After two years at the University of Catania, Fichera went to Rome in 1939 to study with Mauro Picone.</li>
<li>Therefore, the output of Gaetano Fichera belongs in part to pure mathematics, in part to its applications to physical mathematics.</li>
<li>However, the war was to have a far greater impact on the young Fichera for, in February 1943 when he reached the age of 21, he was called up to fight.</li>
<li>Fichera refused to join the Italian army because it collaborated with Nazi Germany.</li>
<li>After being called up into the army on 1 February 1943, Fichera deserted but he was captured in September 1943 by Nazi troops and imprisoned in Teramo.</li>
<li>After a while Fichera was sent, still as a prisoner of the Germans but by now condemned to death, to Verona but he managed to escape from there on his third attempt and headed for Emilia-Romagna where he came across a group of partisans.</li>
<li>The partisans questioned Fichera who told them that he was a mathematician.</li>
<li>This immediately made them suspicious but one of the group, Giorgio Pescarini, was a mathematics teacher and he questioned Fichera to test whether he really was a mathematician.</li>
<li>Of course, his answers quickly convinced Pescarini, and therefore the whole group of partisans, that Fichera was genuine.</li>
<li>Fichera later jokingly remarked that this event effectively proved that mathematics could be useful in everyday life.</li>
<li>Fichera lived with the partisans in Alfonsine near Ravenna, fighting against the Germans, as the end of the war approached.</li>
<li>When they asked if there was someone who spoke English, Gaetano came forward and spoke to the three British soldiers in a very nonchalant manner.</li>
<li>Finished questioning the British thanked Gaetano and all of us, saluted us, and left taking the prisoners with them.</li>
<li>For us it was a pleasant surprise to discover that Gaetano, although so young, as well as being a graduate in mathematics, could speak two foreign languages with ease, something very rare in those days.</li>
<li>After the German surrender, Fichera remained in Alfonsine with the partisans for several months.</li>
<li>Back in Rome, Fichera resumed working for Picone where he became 'Libero Docente' in mathematical analysis in 1948; this is similar to the habilitation and gives the right to lecture in universities.</li>
<li>The methods Fichera used were based on those which had been developed by his teacher Picone.</li>
<li>Renato Caccioppoli, who was at the University of Naples, was one of the referees who recommended Fichera for this chair.</li>
<li>In fact he had also been a referee one year earlier when Fichera received his 'Libero Docente'.</li>
<li>After this Fichera and Caccioppoli remained close friends until Caccioppoli's death in 1959.</li>
<li>In 1956 Fichera moved to Rome when appointed to the chair of mathematical analysis at La Sapienza, the University of Rome.</li>
<li>The results of Gaetano Fichera in this field give useful information on the analytical structure of the 'memory kernel'.</li>
<li>In addition to this work in pure mathematics and mathematical physics, Fichera also made some important contributions to the history of mathematics.</li>
<li>Fichera was an outstanding lecturer, giving fascinating valuable lectures.</li>
<li>Also in 1954, Fichera published the two volume treatise Trattato di analisi matematica Ⓣ(Treatise on mathematical analysis).</li>
<li>In 1985 Fichera published another book based on his lectures on mathematical physics, namely Problemi analitici nuovi nella fisica matematica classica Ⓣ(New analytical problems in classical mathematical physics).</li>
<li>Fichera was a member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei and received their prestigious Antonio Feltrinelli Prize in 1976.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 8 February 1922, Acireale, Catania, Sicily, Italy. Died 1 June 1996, Rome, Italy.</p>
