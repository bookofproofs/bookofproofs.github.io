<p><strong>Tiberiu Popoviciu</strong> was a Romanian mathematician who worked in real and numerical analysis and helped to found computer science in Romania.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Gazeta Matematica (the Mathematical Gazette) ran annual mathematics contests and, in 1924, Popoviciu won the national Rumania-wide contest.</li>
<li>Popoviciu attended a variety of courses in the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Bucharest, specialising in mathematics.</li>
<li>In October 1928 Popoviciu was awarded his bachelor's degree in Mathematics and then began research for his Ph.D. thesis under the guidance of Paul Montel.</li>
<li>On 12 June 1933 Tiberiu Popoviciu defended, with great distinction, his Ph.D. thesis Sur quelques propriétes des fonctions d'une ou de deux variables réelles Ⓣ(On some properties of functions of one or two real variables).</li>
<li>After his return to Romania in 1933, Popoviciu began his university activities at Cluj where he was appointed first as librarian and then, after a year, as assistant lecturer in the Faculty of Sciences.</li>
<li>Originally teaching had been in German but, when Popoviciu taught there, the language of instruction was Romanian.</li>
<li>At this time Popoviciu left Cernăuți and he was appointed as an assistant professor of Mathematical Analysis at the University of Bucharest.</li>
<li>In 1946 Popoviciu returned to Cluj where he was appointed professor in the Chair of Algebra and Number Theory.</li>
<li>After two years in the Chair of Algebra and Number Theory, Popoviciu was appointed to the Chair of Mathematical Analysis in 1948.</li>
<li>Popoviciu made important contributions in Mathematical Analysis, Approximation Theory, Convexity, Numerical Analysis, Functional Equations, Algebra and Number Theory.</li>
<li>The road Tiberiu Popoviciu opened in the Constructive Theory of Functions and Functional Analysis allowed the establishment of linear functionals that intervene in the expression of the remainder in approximation operations.</li>
<li>Because Tiberiu Popoviciu's very outlook on Computation Practice transformed what was referred as Numerical Calculation before into a new discipline, Numerical Analysis, in the modern sense of this concept.</li>
<li>This point of view was understood and assumed by Tiberiu Popoviciu's students and underlies the foundation of what is now known as the Romanian School of Numerical Analysis and Approximation Theory.</li>
<li>Tiberiu Popoviciu is the founder of the Cluj School of Numerical Analysis.</li>
<li>The Institute of Numerical Analysis in Cluj, part of the Romanian Academy of Sciences, succeeded in gathering around it a group of gifted mathematicians, under the guidance of Tiberiu Popoviciu.</li>
<li>Popoviciu was the director of this Institute which, in 1961, produced one of the first Romanian computers DACICC-1 (Dispozitiv Automat de Calcul al Institutului de Calcul din Cluj).</li>
<li>Some other achievements of Tiberiu Popoviciu were: the reactivation, in 1958, of the journal Mathematica (Cluj), the founding, in 1972, of the journal Revue d'Analyse Numerique et de Theorie de l'Approximation, and the opening, in 1967, of a research seminar: 'The Itinerant Seminar on Functional Equations', later renamed as 'The Itinerant Seminar on Functional Equations, Approximation and Convexity'.</li>
<li>Tiberiu Popoviciu was, in November 1948, elected a corresponding member and from 20 March 1963 a full member of the Romanian Academy.</li>
<li>Popoviciu published Numerical Analysis.</li>
<li>We note that the Tiberiu Popoviciu High School of Computer Science was founded in 1971 and named for Popoviciu as the founder of computer science in Romania.</li>
<li>The Institute for Scientific Computing of the Romanian Academy is now named the "Tiberiu Popoviciu" Institute for Scientific Computing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 16 February 1905, Arad, Transylvania (now Romania). Died 29 October 1975, Cluj, Romania.</p>
