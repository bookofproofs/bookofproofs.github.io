<p><strong>Clarence Francis Stephens</strong> was the ninth African American to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics. He developed what became known as the 'Morgan-Potsdam Miracle' method of teaching, based on problem solving with very few lectures.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His African American father, R Samuel Stephens (1875-1925), was a chef and railroad worker who married Jeannette Moorehead (1886-1918) on 3 January 1906 in Mecklenburg, North Carolina.</li>
<li>Of the six children, three boys and three girls, we have records of only five, Irene Elizabeth Stephens (born 1910), Doris Stephens (born 1912), Claude James Stephens (born 1915), Clarence Francis Stephens (born 1917), the subject of this biography, and Samuel Lloyd Stephens (born 1918).</li>
<li>Clarence's mother died during a flu epidemic on 20 October 1918, less than two months after the birth of Samuel Lloyd Stephens.</li>
<li>Clarence's father died in 1925 when Clarence was about eight years old, leaving him an orphan.</li>
<li>Harrisburg had no high schools for African American children, so when Stephens reached high school age he contemplated running away and going to the north where it would have been possible for him to attend High School.</li>
<li>Irene Stephens made the same offer to Clarence Stephens' two brothers so all three boys studied at Harbison Institute.</li>
<li>He often asked Clarence to go to the blackboard and show his classmates the steps for solving a problem.</li>
<li>Clarence explained how to think about mathematical problems, because he wanted them to be able to solve difficult assignments on their own.</li>
<li>The school fees were $100 and Stephens worked on the school farm during the summer to earn the money to pay the fees.</li>
<li>Harbison Institute was run by the Board of Missions for Freedmen of the United Presbyterian Church and, although brought up a Baptist, Stephens joined the United Presbyterian Church, attending the church next to the school.</li>
<li>Stephens was a fine sportsman, playing football and baseball to a high standard while at the school.</li>
<li>Stephens, as the best student in his year, was offered a scholarship which he accepted.</li>
<li>In his first year at Johnson C Smith University, Stephens was taught by Robert Langham Douglass (1870-1949), the professor of mathematics.</li>
<li>Stephens was delighted to find that Douglass did very little lecturing but based most of his teaching on problem solving.</li>
<li>This would become Stephens' preferred way of teaching in his own career.</li>
<li>In his first year Stephens had to make deliveries for the drug store on foot, but the store owner purchased a bicycle for him during his second year and he was able to make more deliveries.</li>
<li>Clarence was chosen for the job because he could solve a problem set by the hotel manager.</li>
<li>Claude Stephens, fortunately, had found his own summer job as a barber.</li>
<li>In his final year at Johnson C Smith University, Stephens took the courses History of Mathematics, Differential Equations, Advanced Calculus and Modern Geometry.</li>
<li>He was taught in this year by George Frederick Woodson (1901-1985) who was very impressed when Stephens, asked to solve 10 of the 58 problems in the Advanced Calculus course, actually solved all 58.</li>
<li>He suggested to Stephens that the University of Michigan would be a good place for graduate studies and, after graduating from Johnson C Smith University in the summer of 1938, a couple of months later he was beginning graduate studies at Michigan.</li>
<li>Again Stephens faced financial problems since the University of Michigan provided no financial support.</li>
<li>Stephens had been unable to find an advisor for algebra, the topic on which he wished to undertake research, and settled for a compromise undertaking research on difference equations with Nyswander.</li>
<li>Although teaching went well for Stephens at the College, there was no members of staff with whom he could discuss research.</li>
<li>Discussions with Nyswander were not too profitable for he advised Stephens that the problems he was proposing to solve were too difficult.</li>
<li>By the end of 1941 Stephens had made a breakthrough in his research and began writing up his thesis.</li>
<li>Stephens did war service from 1942 to 1946 as a Teaching Specialist in the US Navy, assigned to the Great Lakes Naval Base in Waukegan, Illinois, where sailors were trained.</li>
<li>Stephens married Harriette Josephine Briscoe (1919-2007), the daughter of the medical doctor Charles Emanuel Briscoe and his wife Eloise S Childers, on 21 December 1942 at Ann Arbor.</li>
<li>They had a daughter H Jeanette Stephens (born about 1944), and a son, Clarence F Stephens Jr. (born about 1948).</li>
<li>Janette went on to earn a Ph.D. in mathematical education from the University of Iowa while Clarence F Stephens Jr. was awarded a Master's Degree in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin.</li>
<li>After completing his war service at the Great Lakes Naval Base, Stephens returned to Prairie View College, now as a professor of mathematics.</li>
<li>In 1947 the President of Morgan State College invited Stephens to become Professor of Mathematics at the College.</li>
<li>Stephens took up the position in the autumn of 1947.</li>
<li>Instead of lecturing to us about mathematics Dr Stephens used to talk to us about famous mathematicians he had known.</li>
<li>After Dr Stephens received his PhD he was invited to spend a year at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.</li>
<li>When Dr Stephens did lecture he would solve something that at first seemed a mystery to us.</li>
<li>In 1962 Stephens left Morgan State College when he was appointed as acting chair of mathematics at the State University of New York at Geneseo.</li>
<li>Thank you, Dr Stephens, for giving me encouragement during my years at Potsdam and for many years since.</li>
<li>Dr Stephens words live on.</li>
<li>Vasily Cateforis succeeded Stephens as chair of the State University of New York Potsdam's Mathematics Department and was also his former student at Morgan State.</li>
<li>Stephens received many honours in addition to those mentioned above.</li>
<li>The Seaway Section of the Mathematical Association of America named their teaching award after Stephens in 2003.</li>
<li>In 2018 he received the National Association of Mathematicians Centenarian Award and the Association named their Stephens annual teaching award in his honour.</li>
<li>At this time a tombstone was erected with Harriette's birth and death dates, and also Clarence's name and date of birth; he was preparing to join her.</li>
<li>Clarence Stephens lived with his son on his own thirty acre farm, located near Dansville, New York.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 July 1917, Gaffney, South Carolina, USA. Died 5 March 2018, Rochester, New York, USA.</p>
