<p><strong>Albert Bharucha-Reid</strong> was an American mathematician who worked on probability theory, Markov chains, and statistics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>We shall, however, for simplicity use the name Bharucha-Reid throughout this biography.</li>
<li>William and Mae Reid had three children: William Micajah Reid (born 27 September 1924 in Elizabeth City, Virginia); Cora M Reid (born about 1925/26); and Albert Turner Reid, the subject of this biography.</li>
<li>Albert was given the name Turner because he was related to Charles Henry Turner (1867-1923), the first African American to receive a Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Chicago, who published over 70 papers and made important advances in zoology, particularly in understanding insect behaviour.</li>
<li>In 1930, when Albert was two years old, the family were living at Chesapeake, Elizabeth City, Virginia.</li>
<li>They were still at the same address ten years later, and at this time Albert was in 7th grade of Elementary School.</li>
<li>Bharucha-Reid graduated from George P Phenix High School in Hampton, Virginia, a school for African Americans created by the Hampton Institute, in 1944 and then for a time attended Howard University in Washington D.C. followed by the Hampton Institute.</li>
<li>While undertaking research on mathematical biology, probability and statistics at Chicago, Bharucha-Reid also worked at a Research Assistant in Mathematical Biology at the University.</li>
<li>On 5 June 1954 Albert Reid married the Indian Rodabe Phiroze Bharucha (born 15 June 1930) in Cook County Illinois, and, shortly after that time, changed his name from Reid to Bharucha-Reid.</li>
<li>We note that Rodabe also changed her name to Bharucha-Reid and she was awarded a doctorate by Wayne State University in 1972 for her thesis Organized behavior under stress.</li>
<li>Albert and Rodabe Bharucha-Reid had two children, Kurush Feroze Bharucha-Reid and Rustam William Bharucha-Reid (born 1967).</li>
<li>We note that Kurush Bharucha-Reid, born on 29 March 1955, became an intelligence and special operations expert in the United States Army, serving with great distinction.</li>
<li>Now let us give a comment on the name change to Bharucha-Reid.</li>
<li>Albert Bharucha-Reid attended the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, December 1954 and July-August 1955 and presented the paper On the Stochastic Theory of Epidemics.</li>
<li>His name on the paper in the published Proceedings is given as A T Bharucha-Reid and the affiliation Columbia University.</li>
<li>He and his wife, and first child took a flight from New York to Bombay, India, on 12 June 1956, however, and gave their names as Albert Reid, Rodabe Reid and Kurush Reid.</li>
<li>When they returned, flying from Bombay to Idlewild Airport, New York on 7 October 1956 they gave their names as Albert T Bharucha-Reid and Rodabe P Bharucha-Reid.</li>
<li>When Bharucha-Reid was undertaking the research for the paper On the Stochastic Theory of Epidemics mentioned above, he was supported by funds provided under Contract AF 18(600)-939 with the USAF School of Aviation Medicine, Randolph Field, Texas.</li>
<li>Bharucha-Reid had left Columbia University in 1955 and worked as an Assistant Research Statistician at the University of California, Berkeley for the year 1955-1956 before taking up the appointment of Instructor at the University of Oregon in 1956.</li>
<li>Bharucha-Reid published two different types of books.</li>
<li>The book with Masilamani Sambandham was published a year after Bharucha-Reid died.</li>
<li>The second type of book that Bharucha-Reid published consisted of long articles written by experts in their fields.</li>
<li>Bharucha-Reid explains his aims with these series in the Preface to the first of these books.</li>
<li>We gave details above of Bharucha-Reid's career up to 1981.</li>
<li>During his last months at Atlanta University, Bharucha-Reid was very active in several aspects of the physics program.</li>
<li>For example, in 1994 the National Association of Mathematicians inaugurated the NAM Albert Turner Bharucha-Reid Lecture Series.</li>
<li>Tepper Gill had been one of Bharucha-Reid's Ph.D. students.</li>
<li>Dr Bharucha-Reid also mentored at least thirteen Ph.D. students.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 13 November 1927, Hampton, Virginia, USA. Died 26 February 1985, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.</p>
