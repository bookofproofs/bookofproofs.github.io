<p><strong>Walter McAfee</strong> was an African-American scientist and astronomer, best known for his part in the world's first lunar radar echo experiments.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Luther McAfee had been educated at Texas College, which was run by the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, and then became a carpenter.</li>
<li>Walter attended High School in Marshall graduating in 1930.</li>
<li>McAfee was awarded a Bachelor's Degree with distinction from Wiley College June of 1934 and began to look for jobs.</li>
<li>McAfee was only 19 years old so did not worry too much when he did not quickly find a teaching job.</li>
<li>McAfee was a hard worker and most summers when the school was on vacation, he studied high level courses at the university.</li>
<li>Applications asked for a photograph to be included and McAfee was rejected several times, almost certainly because he was Black.</li>
<li>McAfee was well qualified to be on this team for he had published papers on radar-echoing areas, radar cross sections and refraction studies in the atmosphere.</li>
<li>Official reports of the projects success, however, failed even to mention that McAfee was on the team.</li>
<li>McAfee's Ph.D. was in physics and was supervised by Hans Bethe.</li>
<li>It was to study radio astronomy and solar physics and was presented to McAfee by President Eisenhower.</li>
<li>McAfee was induced into the Science Hall of Fame at Wiley College in 1982.</li>
<li>On 28 July 1997 the McAfee Center was dedicated at Fort Monmouth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 2 September 1914, Ore City, Upshure County, Texas, USA. Died 18 February 1995, South Belmar, New Jersey, USA.</p>
