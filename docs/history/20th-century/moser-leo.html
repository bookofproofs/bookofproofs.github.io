<p><strong>Leo Moser</strong> was an Austrian-born Canadian mathematician who worked in number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Leo attended primary school in Winnipeg, where his parents had set up home, and continued his secondary education there.</li>
<li>Remaining in Winnipeg, Leo then entered the University of Manitoba to study mathematics.</li>
<li>For his doctoral studies, Moser went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</li>
<li>Alfred Brauer's interests were in number theory and so this was the area in which Moser began his research.</li>
<li>Even before he had submitted his dissertation, Moser had several papers published.</li>
<li>Moser was appointed at Texas Technical College, but shortly after this he was offered a position in the University of Alberta, and he moved back to Canada to take up the job in 1951.</li>
<li>Although the department was small and had no separate building to itself, Leo Moser was the centre of activity discussing problems with any one who cared to listen.</li>
<li>Professor Moser was very hospitable and the evening parties at his home were always a treat.</li>
<li>Moser loved the problem based type of mathematical questions.</li>
<li>We mention above the heart problems which afflicted Moser all his life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 April 1921, Vienna, Austria. Died 9 February 1970, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.</p>
