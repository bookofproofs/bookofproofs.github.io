<p><strong>Raymond Lorch</strong> was a Swiss-born American mathematician who worked in general topology and functional analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His father, Henry John Lorch (1868-1957), was born in Brighton, Sussex, England, the son of a German father and English mother.</li>
<li>Ray's older brother Arthur E Lorch was born in Frankfurt, Germany in 1904.</li>
<li>Ray's older sister Madeline D Lorch was born in Frankfurt, Germany in 1905.</li>
<li>In 1916 Henry Lorch emigrated to the United States, leaving his family behind until he was settled.</li>
<li>In the following year Myrtle, Arthur, Madeline, and Ray left Switzerland to join up with Henry Lorch who was working as a bank clerk in Bergen, New Jersey.</li>
<li>Lorch attended Columbia University in New York where he studied mathematics and was awarded a Bachelor's degree, summa cum laude, in 1928.</li>
<li>Obtaining a university position would have been almost impossible for Lorch but, fortunately for him, he was awarded a National Research Council Fellowship to finance a year of postdoctoral study at Harvard University working with Marshall Stone.</li>
<li>Stone advised Lorch to more deeply study Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces.</li>
<li>With the Great Depression still causing great worries about future jobs, Lorch applied for an extension to his one-year National Research Council Fellowship to visit the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.</li>
<li>Lorch did not feel that anyone could carry out all the tasks that were expected of the assistant but he said he wouldd think it over.</li>
<li>Lorch had a productive year with Frigyes Riesz.</li>
<li>Returning to the United States in May 1935, Lorch was appointed as an Instructor in mathematics at Columbia University.</li>
<li>In 1941 Lorch was promoted to assistant lecturer at Columbia University.</li>
<li>Lorch was enthusiastic about visiting European countries and able to deliver lectures in five different languages.</li>
<li>We noted above that Lorch was divorced from his first wife in 1955.</li>
<li>Like Lorch, she was divorced from her first husband, Claude Bové, in 1955.</li>
<li>Ray and Maristella Lorch had two daughters Lavinia Edgarda Lorch and Donatella Livia Lorch.</li>
<li>Between 1958 and 1990, Ray and Maristella de Panizza Lorch worked to enhance links, particularly educational links, between Europe and the United States.</li>
<li>Lorch was Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at Barnard College from 1948 to 1963, and served as chairman of the committee on instruction in 1961.</li>
<li>Lorch played an active role in the American Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>It was music that was Lorch's greatest passion outside mathematics.</li>
<li>It was fitting that Columbia University's Italian Academy for Advanced Studies, founded in 1991 by Maristella de Panizza Lorch, presented the first annual E R Lorch Memorial Recital on Wednesday, 1 May 2013 with a performance by Italian pianist Emanuele Torquati.</li>
<li>In May 1989 Ray and Maristella de Panizza Lorch visited Hungary to celebrate Ray's long connections with the country beginning with his doctoral studies there in 1934.</li>
<li>Lorch died on at St Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center in Manhattan after a long illness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 22 July 1907, Nyon, Switzerland. Died 5 March 1990, Manhattan, New York City, New York County, USA.</p>
