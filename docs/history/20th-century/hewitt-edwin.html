<p><strong>Edwin Hewitt</strong> made fundamental contributions to functional analysis, measure theory, and topology as well as Diophantine approximation, the structure of semigroups and abstract harmonic analysis. He is well-known for his discovery, in collaboration with Leonard Jimmie Savage, of the Hewitt-Savage zero-one law.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Margaret, born in Cheyenne, Laramie, Wyoming to William Eugene Guthrie and Margaret S Hewitt on 19 April 1889, was a teacher of English to adults and a co-author of An outline of vocabulary building; a course for adult Americans.</li>
<li>Edwin, 10 years old at this time, is attending school.</li>
<li>Edwin Hewitt, of 5016 Ellis Avenue, Chicago, Ill., Leelanau School, Glen Arbor, Michigan.</li>
<li>We get some information about Hewitt from the 1940 US Census.</li>
<li>Hewitt was awarded a first degree in 1940 and continued to undertake postgraduate studies for his Master's Degree which was awarded in 1941.</li>
<li>Hewitt undertook research with Marshall Stone as his thesis advisor.</li>
<li>Mr Hewitt was graduated from Harvard in 1940, where he received his master's degree in 1941 and his Ph.D. in 1942.</li>
<li>The College records her address as 79 Chilton Street, Belmont, Massachusetts and her "not-so-secret passions are mountains, mathematicians, pretzels, and poetry." The date of their marriage is given as 4 March 1944 but that does not quite work with the fact that Hewitt returned to the United States on 10 August 1944.</li>
<li>Hewitt taught at Bryn Mawr College for the year 1946-47, then moved to Chicago where he had two half-time jobs, one in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Chicago, the other on a military research project Chicago Ordnance Research.</li>
<li>Hewitt spent the whole of his career at the University of Washington but spent time away on teaching visits, research visits and sabbatical leave: Uppsala, Sweden (1951-52), Australian National University, Canberra (1963; 1970; 1976, Mathematics Institute of Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia (1969-70; 1973; 1976), Erlangen and Passau, Germany (1975-76; 1986), the University of Texas (1972-73), the University of Fairbanks, Alaska (1982), Hokkaido University, Japan (1982), University of Passau, Federal Republic Germany (1986), University of Singapore (1988).</li>
<li>His definitive departure at the age of 35 from topological research in favour of harmonic analysis and locally compact abelian groups has been much noted and discussed by Hewitt-watchers and interested amateur historians.</li>
<li>Hewitt loved mathematics, music and, above all, travelling.</li>
<li>Edwin Hewitt is in this last group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 20 January 1920, Everett, Snohomish, Washington, USA. Died 21 June 1999, Seattle, Washington, USA.</p>
