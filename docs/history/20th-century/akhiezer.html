<p><strong>Naum Il'ich Akhiezer</strong> was a Soviet mathematician whose main work was on function theory and approximation theory. He also produced works on the history of mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The town of Cherikov, called Cherykau in Belarusian, had around 5500 inhabitants when Naum Il'ich was born.</li>
<li>His brother Alexander Il'ich Akhiezer was ten years younger than Naum Il'ich and went on to become a famous theoretical physicist.</li>
<li>Naum Il'ich attended the local Gymnasium in Cherikov, graduating in 1918.</li>
<li>Akhiezer studied at the Kiev Institute of Public Education, entering in 1922 on a three-year course of study.</li>
<li>Akhiezer and Krein became friends and around ten years later collaborated on mathematical projects.</li>
<li>Akhiezer graduated from the Kiev Institute of Public Education in 1924.</li>
<li>In addition to his school teaching, at this time Akhiezer was assisting Dmitry Aleksandrovich Grave by conducting practical classes for him at one of the Higher Educational Institutes in Kiev.</li>
<li>Akhiezer's research was on the theory of functions of a complex variable and its applications to aerodynamics.</li>
<li>In the first of these papers Akhiezer solved the problem of finding the polynomial with three fixed coefficients deviating least from zero on a given interval.</li>
<li>From 1933 Akhiezer worked at Kharkov University.</li>
<li>Akhiezer had never been awarded a doctorate since academic degrees of Master of Science and Doctor of Science had been abolished in the USSR in 1918.</li>
<li>However, they were reintroduced in 1934 and, in 1936 Akhiezer was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Physical-Mathematical Sciences.</li>
<li>In 1937 Akhiezer, working with his friend M G Krein, solved the extremal problem for the class of differentiable periodic functions.</li>
<li>Akhiezer continued to work on this topic and was later to solve the extremal problem for the class of analytic functions.</li>
<li>He persuaded several mathematicians including Akhiezer to join the Institute in the early 1960's and Akhiezer became head of the Department of the Theory of Functions at this Institute.</li>
<li>Akhiezer's later work, in addition to that on the theory of moments, included joint work with Sergei Bernstein on completeness of sets of polynomials.</li>
<li>Akhiezer wrote 150 papers and 10 books, one of which was the important Theory of Operators in Hilbert Space.</li>
<li>His great personal charm, sparkling wit and cheerfulness, and his open and friendly attitude towards the young, have always attracted talented young people to Akhiezer, a great number of whom have developed into good mathematicians who are working in various cities of the USSR.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 6 March 1901, Cherikov, Ruussian Empire (now Belarus). Died 3 June 1980, Kharkov, USSR.</p>
