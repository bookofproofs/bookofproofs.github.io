<p><strong>Edray Herber Goins</strong> is an Afro-American mathematician working on elliptic curves and icosahedral Galois representations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Edray Goins was brought up along with his brother.</li>
<li>Eddi Beatrice Brown became a teacher, married Goins, and in 1972 she gave birth to Edray Herber Goins, the subject of this biography, in South Central Los Angeles.</li>
<li>The Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Test at the time that Goins was at high school consisted of a mathematics section and a verbal section.</li>
<li>In 1989 Goins received a National Merit Scholarship Honourable Mention, and in the following year he graduated from High School and was awarded a National Achievement Scholarship.</li>
<li>Indeed Goins' American Physical Society Scholarship was renewed for the year 1992-93.</li>
<li>At the California Institute of Technology, Goins was advised by the mathematics professor Dinakar Ramakrishnan and the theoretical physics professor Steven C Frautschi.</li>
<li>In June 1994, Goins graduated with a B.S. majoring in Mathematics and Physics.</li>
<li>In 1994 Goins was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (Honourable Mention) and a National Physical Science Consortium Graduate Fellowship which enabled him to begin research for a Ph.D. at Stanford University.</li>
<li>Although the date on which he submitted his Ph.D. thesis is shown clearly on a copy on the web as "August 1999," and "Copyright by Edray Herber Goins 1999," Stanford University has a copy of the thesis on their website dated "October 2002" and has "Copyright by Edray Herber Goins 2003." This is puzzling but the 1999 date is surely correct since that copy has the signatures of the examiners on it while the 2002 copy does not.</li>
<li>Goins' first two papers appear in the book Council for African American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences.</li>
<li>As the first of these gives Goins' address as Stanford University while the second gives his address as Institute for Advanced Study Princeton, we conjecture that the first paper was presented at the 1997 conference while the second was presented at the 1999 conference.</li>
<li>Several of Goins' papers are particularly attractive and at least the problems they studied is understandable without a deep knowledge of mathematics.</li>
<li>Another lovely paper is Goins' paper Palindromes in different bases: A conjecture of J Ernest Wilkins (2009).</li>
<li>Goins was awarded many research grants, most having the theme of promoting mathematical participation by minority groups.</li>
<li>Shortly after writing this article, Goins resigned from Purdue University and accepted a position at Pomona College from July 2018.</li>
<li>For a Black Mathematician, What It's Like to Be the 'Only One', published in The New York Times in February 2019, looks at Goins' decision and comments on the reaction, both positive and negative.</li>
