<p><strong>Fritz Ursell</strong> was a German-born mathematician who moved to England and became a leading expert in the mathematical modelling of waves.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fritz, who had one sister, began his schooling in a kindergarten and all went well until 1933 when the Ursell family's troubles began.</li>
<li>At the Comenius Gymnasium, Fritz learnt Greek and Latin.</li>
<li>It provided a good classical education but the mathematics teaching was poor and Fritz had little interest in this topic.</li>
<li>Fritz's mother Leonore had a cousin working as a doctor in London and a friend Jeannette Franklin-Kohn who had left Düsseldorf for England where she had set up an organisation in Bournemouth to help Jewish German children escape from the Nazis.</li>
<li>Franklin-Kohn arranged for Fritz to enter Streete Court School, a Preparatory School in Westgate-on-Sea, Kent.</li>
<li>Ursell did well at Clifton College partly, he believed, because of his good grounding in Latin gained in Düsseldorf.</li>
<li>If he left school, Ursell would have had to return to Germany where his parents were still living.</li>
<li>H C Beaven, the Head of Mathematics at Clifton College, advised Ursell's parents to let their son specialise in mathematics since he felt that in this subject Ursell would have a good chance of a university scholarship.</li>
<li>Ursell's parents did not like the idea that their son would study a "useless" subject like mathematics but, nevertheless, they reluctantly agreed to let him follow Beaven's advice.</li>
<li>Ursell entered the Upper Fifth Mathematics class at Clifton College in January 1939.</li>
<li>Ursell's father was no longer allowed to practise as a doctor.</li>
<li>Two days later Britain was at war with Germany and the whole Ursell family were enemy aliens.</li>
<li>Fritz was doing well at Clifton College where he was studying mathematics, physics, English, Old Testament and German.</li>
<li>Fritz Ursell was told that, as an enemy alien, he could not remain in Bristol since enemy aliens could not live within 50 miles of the coast.</li>
<li>We note that, after Ursell left Clifton College, on 2 December 1940 bombs hit the school buildings and Clifton College was evacuated to Bude on the Cornish coast.</li>
<li>The Head of Mathematics at Marlborough College was the excellent teacher Alan Robson and, guided by him, Ursell gained a distinction in the School Certificate examinations.</li>
<li>In January 1941, Ursell matriculated at Trinity College Cambridge.</li>
<li>Only five students were in Ursell's class at this stage, and they included Freeman Dyson and James Lighthill.</li>
<li>Ursell, feeling that the other students were much better than he was, approached Besicovitch with his worries.</li>
<li>After taking courses by G H Hardy on divergent series, J E Littlewood on complex analysis, A E Ingham on number theory, W V D Hodge on Riemann surfaces, and P A M Dirac on quantum mechanics, Ursell graduated with distinction in 1943.</li>
<li>Ursell published a joint paper with Norman Frederick Barber, The Generation and Propagation of Ocean Waves and Swell.</li>
<li>We note that Norman Barber played an important role in Ursell's development.</li>
<li>In September 1947 Ursell left the Admiralty Research Laboratory and, having been awarded an Imperial Chemical Industries 3-year research fellowship, joined the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Manchester.</li>
<li>The fellowship, although funded by Imperial Chemical Industries, allowed Ursell to undertake research in any area and he had no commitment to ICI.</li>
<li>Ursell asked Trinity if he could have leave of absence and was allowed to spend the three years at Manchester before taking up the Trinity Fellowship.</li>
<li>Ursell's parents and sister continued to live in Cambridge but his father died on 4 December 1947 at the age 68.</li>
<li>Ursell wrote three important papers while at Manchester, namely Surface waves on deep water in the presence of a submerged circular cylinder.</li>
<li>In 1950 Ursell returned to Cambridge where, in addition to his Trinity Fellowship, he was appointed to a University Lectureship in Applied Mathematics.</li>
<li>In 1961 Ursell was offered the Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics at the University of Manchester.</li>
<li>However, this was no easy decision for Ursell since he was unsure whether he wanted to take on the administrative work involved in such a position.</li>
<li>Ursell was honoured by being elected to the Royal Society of London in 1972.</li>
<li>Aside from his consummate skills as a mathematician, Fritz was a true renaissance man, capable of conversing knowledgeably yet modestly, on a wide range of subjects including European history, politics, music, and literature, especially Shakespeare.</li>
<li>After dying peacefully in hospital at age 89, Ursell's funeral took place on Tuesday 15 May 2012 at Manchester Crematorium.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 28 April 1923, Düsseldorf, Germany. Died 11 May 2012, Manchester, England.</p>
