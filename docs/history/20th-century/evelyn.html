<p><strong>Cecil John Alvin Evelyn</strong> was an amateur mathematician who produced some works on number theory and geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>John Harcourt Chichester Evelyn was a pupil at the leading independent school Eton College before studying at Christ Church, University of Oxford.</li>
<li>It was at Eton that Evelyn became fascinated by mathematics, particularly by number theory and geometry.</li>
<li>At Oxford he had become friendly with Hubert Linfoot who was one year older than Evelyn.</li>
<li>Both Evelyn and Linfoot were interested in number theory at this time and they worked together on some problems which we now describe.</li>
<li>Between 1929 and 1933, Evelyn and Linfoot produced six joint papers, all with the title On a problem in the additive theory of numbers.</li>
<li>After the joint papers with Linfoot, Evelyn did not publish any further mathematics papers for over 30 years.</li>
<li>We also note Evelyn's address on his papers.</li>
<li>A book was to be Evelyn's final mathematical publication.</li>
<li>We mentioned above that Evelyn had many interests in addition to mathematics.</li>
<li>Evelyn called it a tragedy "to mislead the readers," as he says in his Preface.</li>
<li>Evelyn later produced a 'Comedy of Faust'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 August 1904, London, England. Died 24 May 1976, Deptford, Kent, England.</p>
