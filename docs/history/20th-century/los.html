<p><strong>Jerzy Łoś</strong> was a Polish mathematician, logician, economist, and philosopher. He is especially known for his work in model theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In addition to looking after the estates, Zofia Łoś was a local government councillor, president of the school council in Torskie, and held other roles in health insurance and agricultural organisations.</li>
<li>On 28 December 1936 Zygmunt Łoś died in a plane crash near Susiec, a village in eastern Poland.</li>
<li>In the crash, due to icing, Zygmunt Łoś, one other passenger Jósef Zimmermann and one of the two members of the crew Jósef Fronc, were killed.</li>
<li>In 1937 Łoś entered the Jan Kazimierz University of Lwów where he began studying medicine, then philosophy and chemistry.</li>
<li>Łoś had been in a region controlled by the Soviets but, after the German invasion, it was German troops that controlled the region Łoś was living in.</li>
<li>After the award of his Master's Degree, Łoś moved to Wrocław, where a very active group of mathematicians, including Hugo Steinhaus, Bronisław Knaster and Edward Marczewski, started to build a new department.</li>
<li>Steinhaus, in particular, greatly influenced the direction that Łoś's research would take.</li>
<li>Łoś was appointed first as an assistant in the Department of Physics at Wrocław and then as an assistant in the Department of Logic there.</li>
<li>He undertook research for his Ph.D. with Jerzy Słupecki (1904-1987) as his advisor.</li>
<li>Łoś was awarded his Ph.D. in 1949 for his thesis On logical matrices (Polish).</li>
<li>It is not easy to give an adequate account of the results contained in Łoś's monograph in a short review.</li>
<li>In the reviewer's opinion Łoś's work is of very real value.</li>
<li>In the same year, 1949, Łoś joined the Real Functions group in the Mathematical Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences and continued to hold various positions in the Institute, in parallel to his university posts, until he retired in 1991.</li>
<li>In 1961 Łoś moved from Toruń to Warsaw where he lectured at the University and worked at various Institutes of the Polish Academy of Sciences: the Institute of Philosophy; the Institute of Mathematics; and, towards the end of his career, the Institute of Computer Science.</li>
<li>In the same year of 1955 Łoś published On the axiomatic treatment of probability which looks at the mathematical foundations of probability.</li>
<li>One of the areas of mathematical economics that Łoś studied was associated with von Neumann models consisting of pairs of matrices containing production process data.</li>
<li>Łoś received many honours during his career including the Cross of Merit, Polonia Restituta, the Award of the Secretary of the Polish Academy of Sciences for achievements in mathematical economics, Sierpinski Medal, and the Jurzykowski Award for activity in the Solidarity movement.</li>
<li>In the spring of 1996 Łoś suffered a stroke which he survived but lived with a serious condition for the final two years of his life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 22 March 1920, Lwów, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 1 June 1998, Warsaw, Poland.</p>
