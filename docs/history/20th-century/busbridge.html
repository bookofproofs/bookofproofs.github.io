<p><strong>Ida Busbridge</strong> worked on integral equations and radiative transfer. She was the first woman appointed to an Oxford fellowship in mathematics. She taught at the University of Oxford for 35 years.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>She was one of the first British women to earn a Doctorate in Mathematics, achieving the distinction in 1895.</li>
<li>She was one of the first two women to be admitted to the London Mathematical Society in 1908, alongside Charlotte Angas Scott.</li>
<li>Busbridge developed a unique textural notation method for teaching mathematics, which went on to become a part of the Integrated Science syllabus.</li>
<li>She also became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA) in 1912 for her work in educational reform and mathematics education.</li>
<li>Busbridge was instrumental in pushing for the equal recognition of the accomplishments of women in mathematics, helping to secure the British Association for the Advancement of Science's gold medal for her contemporary and fellow mathematician Charlotte Angas Scott in 1912.</li>
<li>She was awarded the Helena Walters Prize in 1917 for her contributions to mathematics and mathematics education.</li>
<li>She wrote several textbooks, including Elementary Mathematics in 1894, Theory of Co-ordinate Geometry in 1908, and Higher Mathematics and its Practical Application in 1913.</li>
<li>Busbridge also wrote a series of essays praising the accomplishments of British women mathematicians, which was published in the Mathematical Gazette in 1915.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 10 February 1908, Plumstead, Kent, England. Died 27 December 1988, Bromley, Kent, England.</p>
