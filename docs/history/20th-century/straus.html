<p><strong>Ernst Straus</strong> was a German-born American mathematician who worked in a variety of areas including relativity and combinatorics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ernst's father Elias Straus was an attorney.</li>
<li>It was also a large family with Ernst being the youngest of his parents five children; three daughters and two sons.</li>
<li>Later in 1933 Elias Straus died of cancer and right after this Rahel Straus and the rest of the family moved to Palestine and made their home in Jerusalem.</li>
<li>Ernst attended a number of different schools but he had no high school diploma when he entered the Hebrew University.</li>
<li>There he was taught by Motzkin who later emigrated to the United States and undertook joint work with Straus which we will discuss below.</li>
<li>Again Straus had no undergraduate degree when he went to the United States and enrolled in Columbia University in New York in 1941.</li>
<li>Before moving to Princeton, Straus married Louise Miller who was, like him, a graduate student at Columbia University.</li>
<li>They married in the autumn of 1944 and moved to Princeton where Straus began working with Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study.</li>
<li>Louise and Ernst had two sons, Daniel born in 1954 and Paul born in 1957.</li>
<li>During the four years that Straus worked with Einstein they wrote three joint papers.</li>
<li>Straus submitted his doctoral thesis on Einstein's unified field theory to Columbia University and was awarded his doctorate in 1948.</li>
<li>Straus had been working with Einstein on mathematical physics yet while at Princeton he had developed an interest in number theory from Artin, Erdős, Selberg and Siegel.</li>
<li>In fact Straus became a close friend of Erdős and went on to write 21 joint papers with him over many years.</li>
<li>When he went to the University of California at Los Angeles as an instructor in mathematics in 1948, Straus therefore had already wide mathematical interests.</li>
<li>In 1949 Straus collaborated with Richard Bellman publishing Continued fractions, algebraic functions and the Padé table in which they gave a method for obtaining the rational approximants of Frobenius-Padé for power series expansions of algebraic functions.</li>
<li>Let us note that Straus had a close association with the Pacific Journal of Mathematics being on the editorial board from 1951 to 1964, and being the managing editor between 1954 and 1959.</li>
<li>Two years later Straus published Curvature in Hilbert geometries also written jointly with Kelly.</li>
<li>Straus wrote 21 joint papers with Erdős.</li>
<li>An earlier joint paper by Straus and Erdős was On linear independence of sequences in a Banach space (1953).</li>
<li>In this Straus showed that for every positive integer nnn, there exists a set A(m,n)A(m,n)A(m,n) of positive integers such that nnn has exactly mmm partitions into elements of A(m,n)A(m,n)A(m,n) for every m,1≤m≤p(n)m, 1 ≤ m ≤ p(n)m,1≤m≤p(n), where p(n)p(n)p(n) is the number of partitions of nnn.</li>
<li>Straus died of a massive heart attack at the age of 61.</li>
<li>This intellectual power was combined with a deep and radiant humanity which made Ernst truly beloved by his colleagues, students, and friends.</li>
<li>Ernst worked tirelessly on behalf of men and women who were unjustly persecuted by their governments for speaking out in defence of freedom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 February 1922, Munich, Germany. Died 12 July 1983, Los Angeles, California, USA.</p>
