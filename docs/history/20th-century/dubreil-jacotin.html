<h1>Person: Dubreil-Jacotin, Marie-Louise</h1>
<p><img alt="Dubreil-Jacotin.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Dubreil-Jacotin.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin</strong> was a French mathematician who worked in fluid mechanics and abstract algebra. She was the second woman in France to obtain a doctorate in pure mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Marie-Louise's father put her name down for a place at the newly opened Jules-Ferry Lycée and there her brilliance was noticed by her teachers, especially the mathematics teacher who was the sister of Élie Cartan.</li>
<li>Marie-Louise took the baccalaureate in elementary mathematics and at this stage encountered a particularly good piece of luck.</li>
<li>This College, named after the French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal, had special mathematics classes to which girls were not allowed entry, but M Coulom was persuaded by his daughter to make an exception in the case of Marie-Louise.</li>
<li>Often one piece of good fortune is balanced by bad fortune and in the case of Marie-Louise's study at the Collège de Chaptal this was exactly what happened.</li>
<li>But the decree of the ministry published afterwards in the official journal named twenty male students at the top and then Marie-Louise at the head of the Bousiers de licence.</li>
<li>Paul Dubreil, whom Marie-Louise had met while they both studied at the École Normale Supérieure, had been awarded a Rockefeller scholarship in 1929 and at the time of their marriage was on a European tour which would let him study with the top mathematicians in Germany and Italy.</li>
<li>After her marriage Dubreil-Jacotin went with her husband to Hamburg, Frankfurt, Rome and Göttingen.</li>
<li>In the summer of 1931 Dubreil-Jacotin and her husband spent a term at Göttingen where they involved themselves in the vigorous research groups led by Hilbert and Weyl.</li>
<li>At the start of the new academic year 1931-32 Paul Dubreil took up an appointment at the University of Lille and Marie-Louise continued to work on her thesis on fluids but began to take an interest in algebra.</li>
<li>Dubreil-Jacotin's interests in algebra had now reached the point where she offered it as a subsidiary subject at her oral.</li>
<li>It would have made sense for the University of Nancy to employ Dubreil-Jacotin too, but they did not wish to employ a husband and wife in the same department.</li>
<li>Dubreil-Jacotin, therefore, accepted a position of research assistant at Rennes.</li>
<li>Two years later Dubreil-Jacotin was appointed as an assistant lecturer at Rennes.</li>
<li>One might reasonably ask how the Dubreils brought up their daughter when Marie-Louise worked in places such as Rennes, Lyon and Poitiers while Paul worked in Nancy.</li>
<li>Remember too that these were the years of the Second World War which began around the time that Dubreil-Jacotin became an assistant lecturer in Rennes.</li>
<li>The train that Marie-Louise took each Tuesday was destroyed by a bloody bombing of the Rennes railway station.</li>
<li>Marie-Louise accepted the risks calmly as part of her job.</li>
<li>However Marie-Louise was still commuting weekly from Poitiers to Paris and her mother's ill health put her under increasing stress.</li>
<li>In her memory the Ile de France Yacht Club founded a "Challenge Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin" judged on two contests: a regatta and a bridge tournament.</li>
<li>Two years later Dubreil-Jacotin was involved in a car accident which did not seem too serious at the time but she died of a heart attack five weeks later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 July 1905, Paris, France. Died 19 October 1972, Paris, France.</p>
