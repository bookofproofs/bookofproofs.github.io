<p><strong>Sheila Scott Macintyre</strong> taught at the University of Aberdeen and worked in analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>James Scott was born in Banchory.</li>
<li>It was usual for the top students in those days to study at Oxford or Cambridge University after taking their first degree at a Scottish University.</li>
<li>Scott spent three years at Girton College at Cambridge.</li>
<li>Scott returned to Scotland to train as a teacher and she taught for five years in a number of schools from 1934.</li>
<li>Scott then taught mathematics for a short time at James Allen's School for Girls.</li>
<li>After this, Scott spent another short period teaching mathematics, this time at Stowe School in Buckingham.</li>
<li>This school had been founded in 1923 and had over 500 pupils when Scott taught there.</li>
<li>During this period Edmund Whittaker introduced Sheila Scott to Archibald James Macintyre who was a mathematics lecturer at Aberdeen University.</li>
<li>Sheila Macintyre completed her doctoral dissertation under E M Wright's supervision in 1947.</li>
<li>The Laplace transformation was applied here, as it had been by various previous writers on the theory of functions, notably by A J Macintyre.</li>
<li>Mrs Macintyre later devised an integral transform in which the kernel was obtained from that of the Laplace transform by a process involving fractional differentiation, and applied it to extend the theory of the Gregory-Newton and Abel interpolation series.</li>
<li>Let us add a comment on Sheila and Archibald Macintyre's joint work.</li>
<li>In volume 23 of the Journal of the London Mathematical Society (1948) there are two papers by the Macintyres.</li>
<li>The first, by Sheila Scott Macintyre, is an 8-page entitled A functional inequality while the next paper, by A J Macintyre, is a 3-page paper entitled Note on the preceding paper.</li>
<li>Sheila Macintyre proves two new theorems attacking Wright's question while Archibald Macintyre uses one the lemmas in Sheila Macintyre's paper to generalise a theorem proved by Wright in an earlier paper.</li>
<li>A few years later, in 1952, the two Macintyres published a more conventional type of joint paper, namely the 2-author work Theorems on the convergence and asymptotic validity of Abel's series (mentioned by Cossar in the quote above) which was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</li>
<li>Sheila Macintyre was an active member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society and of the Mathematical Association.</li>
<li>They returned to Aberdeen in 1959 but, on 30 September of that year, Archibald Macintyre resigned his Senior Lectureship at Aberdeen so that he could take up a permanent post as Research Professor in Mathematics at Cincinnati.</li>
<li>Sheila Macintyre resigned her Lectureship at the same time and was also appointed as a professor in the Mathematics Department at Cincinnati where she taught until her early death from breast cancer.</li>
<li>He settled there where he outlived Sheila Macintyre by three years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 April 1910, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 21 March 1960, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.</p>
