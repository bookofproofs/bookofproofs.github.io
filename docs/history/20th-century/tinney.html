<p><strong>Sheila Power</strong> was an Irish mathematician and theoretical physicist.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Michael Power had been appointed to the Chair of Mathematics at University College Galway in 1912 and he held this position for over forty years until he retired in 1955.</li>
<li>Sheila was educated at the Dominican College of Taylor's Hill in Galway.</li>
<li>From the Dominican College of Taylor's Hill in Galway, Sheila went to the Dominican women's house in Cabra on the outskirts of Dublin.</li>
<li>Power continued to study at University College Dublin for her Master's Degree which she received in 1939.</li>
<li>Born had been forced to flee from Germany when the Nazis came to power in 1933 and, after spells in north Italy and in Cambridge, he had been appointed to the Tait Chair of Applied Mathematics at Edinburgh in 1936.</li>
<li>The next in the series, published in the same journal in 1942, was by Power and it was entitled On the stability of crystal lattices.</li>
<li>Stability of rhombohedral Bravais lattices by H W Peng and S C Power.</li>
<li>Sheila Power had been awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Edinburgh in 1941 and in the same year she was appointed as an assistant lecturer at University College, Dublin.</li>
<li>In the photograph below taken at the Institute for Advanced Studies during the July 1942 Colloquium, Sheila Power is seen on the far left.</li>
<li>Sheila Power, Pádraig de Brún, Paul Dirac, Éamon de Valera, Arthur Conway, Arthur Eddington, Erwin Schrödinger, Albert Joseph McConnell.</li>
<li>When she first joined the staff at University College, Dublin, Power had a very heavy teaching load.</li>
<li>In 1944 Power published Note on the Influence of Damping on the Compton Scattering in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.</li>
<li>Many years later, Sheila Power would tell her students about her time at Princeton, queuing up for coffee with Albert Einstein.</li>
<li>Sheila Power has the distinction of being one of these four.</li>
<li>Despite her outstanding achievements, Power was not promoted at University College, Dublin, as one would have expected and many of her colleagues sympathised with her on not being made a professor.</li>
<li>In 1951 Sheila Power attended the Edinburgh Mathematical Society Colloquium held at the University of St Andrews.</li>
<li>We note that R D Misra, who also worked in Born's research group at Edinburgh with Power, attended both the 1938 and 1951 Colloquia.</li>
<li>Tinney taught postgraduate students in addition to her undergraduate teaching load.</li>
<li>Tinney continued her association with the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and she was appointed as a Research Associate in the School of Theoretical Physics of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies for the three year period from October 1954 to September 1957.</li>
<li>Hugh Tinney is a concert pianist with a distinguished international reputation who performs regularly with both the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra.</li>
<li>For a time Ethna Tinney was a producer with RTÉ Lyric fm.</li>
<li>Sheila Tinney retired in 1978 when she reached the age of sixty.</li>

<p>Born had been forced to flee from Germany when the Nazis came to power in 1933 and, after spells in north Italy and in Cambridge, he had been appointed to the Tait Chair of Applied Mathematics at Edinburgh in 1936.

* Also at the 1951 Colloquium in St Andrews is Miss N Power who, we assume, must be a sister of Sheila Power.
