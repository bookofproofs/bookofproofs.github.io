<h1>Person: Kumano-Go, Hitoshi</h1>

<p><strong>Hitoshi Kumano-Go</strong> was a Japanese mathematician who specialised in partial differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Entering Osaka University after graduating from high school, Kumano-Go studied mathematics and graduated in 1958.</li>
<li>As is frequently the case, the problem which Kumano-Go studied was to extend work which had been completed earlier by his supervisor.</li>
<li>In 1962 Kumano-Go was appointed as an assistant at Osaka University.</li>
<li>During these years Kumano-Go published a series of papers which studied the local and global uniqueness of the solutions of the Cauchy problem for partial differential equations.</li>
<li>In two papers Kumano-Go also studied non-uniqueness of solutions of the Cauchy problem.</li>
<li>Kumano-Go spent the two academic years 1967-69 visiting the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University.</li>
<li>These were years of great benefit to Kumano-Go who was able to develop many ideas in conversations with Kurt Friedrichs, Peter Lax, Louis Nirenberg and others.</li>
<li>In 1971 Kumano-Go was promoted to full professor.</li>
<li>One other important monograph written by Kumano-Go should be mentioned.</li>
<li>In addition to his work on pseudo-differential operators, Kumano-Go published a series of papers on the product of Fourier integral operators.</li>
<li>Kumano-Go suffered ill health and was admitted to Osaka Hospital in May 1981.</li>
<li>At the height of his mathematical contributions at the age of 46, Kumano-Go sadly died.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 October 1935, Arita, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. Died 24 August 1982, Osaka, Japan.</p>
