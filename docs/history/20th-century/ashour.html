<p><strong>Attia Ashour</strong> was an Egyptian mathematician who worked in electromagnetism.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ashour moved to Cairo to continue his education.</li>
<li>The standard course was for four years of secondary education which Ashour completed in 1939.</li>
<li>At this stage Ashour had to make a decision as to what subjects to study at university.</li>
<li>Ashour studied pure mathematics and applied mathematics, chemistry and physics in his first year but quickly discovered that, although he had a talent for mathematics and theoretical subjects, he was one of the poorest of the students at practical physics experiments.</li>
<li>Money, however, was not important to Ashour, and so he took the Faculty of Science scholarship.</li>
<li>One of the applied mathematics lecturers knew Sydney Chapman, a professor at Imperial College, University of London, and arranged an interview for Ashour with Chapman.</li>
<li>The interview went very well, and Chapman admitted Ashour as a doctoral student.</li>
<li>Although Chapman would have liked to be Ashour's advisor, since he was soon to leave Imperial College to take up a position at the University of Oxford, he arranged for Albert T Price to become Ashour's advisor.</li>
<li>Ashour returned to Cairo University in early 1949 where he was appointed as a lecturer.</li>
<li>Professor Ashour was appointed Professor Emeritus of Applied Mathematics, Cairo University, in 1984.</li>
<li>Professor Ashour was a visiting scientist at Queen Mary College, London University in 1954; at the Physics Institute, Bonn University, 1955; 1955-1956, at the Institute de Radium, University de Paris; 1962-1963, Exeter University, UK; and 1972, Physics Department, Ibadan University, Nigeria.</li>
<li>Professor Ashour was past president of the Mathematical and Physical Society of Egypt and the editor of the 'Proceedings' of the Society.</li>
<li>On the international scene, Professor Ashour was a Member of the Editorial Boards of the Journals: 'Africa Mathematica', 'Arab Journal of Mathematics', and the 'Journal of Geophysics'.</li>
<li>For some time, Professor Ashour was a member of the Advisory Board to the Director General of UNESCO on Science and the 21st Century.</li>
<li>Professor Ashour co-authored the books covering the Mathematics Syllabus of the General Certificate of Education as early as 1958.</li>
<li>Professor Ashour has authored more than 50 scientific papers in as many years.</li>
<li>This person can be no other than Dr Attia Ashour, a much respected and much loved member of our community.</li>
<li>Dr Ashour, please accept this small gift and the gratitude of the International Union of Geodesy &amp; Geophysics for your 22 years of service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 13 September 1924, Damietta, Egypt. Died 17 April 2017, Cairo, Egypt.</p>
