<li>Alele-Williams participated in these workshops from 1963 to 1975.</li>
<li>In 1968 Alele-Williams was promoted to Senior Lecturer at the University of Lagos and, in 1974, Associate Professor of Mathematics.</li>
<li>Alele-Williams was appointed as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Benin in 1985.</li>
<li>It was to this scenario that Professor Grace was appointed as vice chancellor in 1985.</li>
<li>But being appointed the first female vice chancellor of a Nigerian or an African university was barely the issue for Alele-Williams.</li>
<li>Mama Grace Alele-Williams opened her doors to everyone, treated students with respect, listened to what they had to say, encouraged academic freedom, victimized no one on account of holding contrary views and made the University of Benin a true place of learning.</li>

<li>On Saturday, 25 November 2017, Alele-Williams was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Benin.</li>
<li>On that day six eminent Nigerians were awarded honorary degrees, one of the six being Alele-Williams.</li>
