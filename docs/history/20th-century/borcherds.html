<p><strong>Richard Borcherds</strong> is a South African born mathematician known for his work in lattices, group theory and infinite-dimensional algebras, for which he was awarded the Fields Medal in 1998.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After the award of an M.Sc. and Ph.D. in physics, Peter Borcherds became a lecturer in physics at the University of Cape Town.</li>
<li>When Richard was about a year old his parents left South Africa and went to Aldermaston in England.</li>
<li>Richard attended King Edward's School in Birmingham.</li>
<li>Borcherds entered Trinity College, Cambridge where he was an undergraduate.</li>
<li>Borcherds had been appointed as a Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1983 and held this post until 1987.</li>
<li>Borcherds invented the notion of a vertex algebra and used it to solve the Conway-Norton conjecture, which concerns the representation theory of the monster group (this theory is sometimes called "monstrous moonshine").</li>
<li>Borcherds's work is also important in physics, as it lays rigorous groundwork for conformal field theory in two dimensions.</li>
<li>Borcherds remained as a Royal Society University Research Fellow at Cambridge until 1992, and then spent the following year as a lecturer at Cambridge.</li>
<li>In 1992 Borcherds was awarded a Junior Whitehead Prize by the London Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>Borcherds has made a number of important and original contributions to mathematics, with striking and surprising applications.</li>
<li>Another important concept invented by Borcherds is that of a 'vertex operator algebra'.</li>
<li>In a marvellous synthesis of the ideas which he has been developing, Borcherds has proved conjectures of Conway and Norton on the 'Moonshine' module for the Monster group.</li>
<li>for his contributions to algebra, the theory of automorphic forms, and mathematical physics, including the introduction of vertex algebras and Borcherds' Lie Algebras, the proof of the Conway-Norton moonshine conjecture and the discovery of a new class of automorphic infinite products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 November 1959, Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
