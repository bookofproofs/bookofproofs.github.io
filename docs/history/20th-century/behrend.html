<h1>Person: Behrend, Felix Adalbert</h1>

<p><strong>Felix Adalbert Behrend</strong> was a German mathematician who worked in combinatorics, number theory and topology.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Felix W Behrend had a doctorate and was a mathematics and physics teacher at the Herderschule in Berlin.</li>
<li>His son, Felix Junior, also attended the Herderschule in Berlin, showing exceptional talents not only for mathematics but also creative writing.</li>
<li>Behrend studied number theory for his doctorate at the University of Berlin with Erhard Schmidt as his advisor.</li>
<li>Of course 1933, the year that Behrend was awarded his doctorate, was also the year that Hitler came to power in Germany.</li>
<li>We have not mentioned earlier that the Behrend family were Jewish since it had not seemed particularly significant prior to 1933.</li>
<li>This did not affect Behrend directly since he was not in employment at this time, but it quickly affected the family.</li>
<li>Behrend's father was, by this time, headmaster of a leading Berlin school and he was first demoted and later dismissed from his post.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate Behrend decided to leave Germany and continue his studies away from Nazi influence.</li>
<li>After his release in 1942, Behrend was appointed as a tutor at the University of Melbourne.</li>
<li>Behrend was promoted to lecturer in the Mathematics Department of the University of Melbourne in 1943, then to senior lecturer in 1948, and finally to associate professor 1954-62.</li>
<li>In A contribution to the theory of magnitudes and the foundations of analysis (1956) Behrend characterised the additive semigroup of positive real numbers, the "magnitudes" of the title.</li>
<li>Behrend is commemorated by the 'Behrend memorial lecture in mathematics', established at the University of Melbourne in 1963 with funds provided by his widow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 April 1911, Charlottenburg, Berlin, Germany. Died 27 May 1962, Richmond, Victoria, Australia.</p>
