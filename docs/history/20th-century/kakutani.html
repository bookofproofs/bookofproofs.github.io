<h1>Person: Kakutani, Shizuo</h1>

<p><strong>Shizuo Kakutani</strong> was a Japanese-born American mathematician who worked in probability theory, ergodic theory and complex analysis, and is best known for his fixed-point theorem.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shizuo was the youngest of the two sons in the family, the eldest being Seiichi who was eight years older.</li>
<li>Seiichi studied physics at Kyoto University and it was through him that Shizuo was first introduced to mathematics.</li>
<li>Shizuo was fascinated and was enthusiastic to learn more mathematics.</li>
<li>The first problem was that Kakujiro Kakutani had made the decision that one of his two sons would follow him into law and take over his practice in due course.</li>
<li>Clearly Seiichi was training to be a physicist and not studying law so Shizuo would have to be the one to follow his father.</li>
<li>After completing his middle school, Shizuo entered Konan High School in Kobe to prepare for his university studies.</li>
<li>By the time Shizuo graduated, his father relented seeing that his son was so keen to study mathematics at university.</li>
<li>However, Shizuo was now not qualified to enter a mathematics course at either the University of Tokyo or Kyoto University since these had absolute rules regarding entry qualifications.</li>
<li>There was one possible route for Shizuo which was to enter Tohoku University in Sendai.</li>
<li>Kakutani applied but there were only fifteen places, and seventeen applicants.</li>
<li>Of the seventeen, exactly fifteen had the science qualification from high school so it looked like an easy task to decide to admit those and to turn down Kakutani.</li>
<li>However, after due consideration it was decided to admit all seventeen applicants and Kakutani had scrape through.</li>
<li>At Tohoku University Kakutani was introduced to the theory of analytic functions.</li>
<li>Indeed on the strength of this work Weyl invited Kakutani in 1940 to spend two years at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.</li>
<li>Kakutani not only took great interest in the work of Weyl's group at Princeton but also the group of mathematicians working with von Neumann on measure theory and ergodic theory.</li>
<li>Kakutani also made many visits during which he met mathematicians such as Garrett Birkhoff, G D Birkhoff, Stone, Wiener, and Hille.</li>
<li>In December 1941 with Kakutani still studying at Princeton, war broke out between the United States and Japan with the entry of the U.S.A. into the Second World War.</li>
<li>Of course this put Kakutani in a difficult position for he was now a guest in a country at war with his own.</li>
<li>What, you may wonder, did Kakutani do.</li>
<li>On his return to Japan Kakutani accepted the appointment as assistant professor at Osaka University.</li>
<li>Kakutani, however, managed to continue to produce a stream of papers containing highly original ideas.</li>
<li>In 1948 Kakutani was again invited to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.</li>
<li>On one of his frequent visits to New York, Kakutani met Kay Uchida and they were married in 1952; they had one daughter Michiko.</li>
<li>Kakutani contributed to several areas of mathematics.</li>
<li>Kakutani was to remain at Yale until he retired in 1982.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 28 August 1911, Osaka, Japan. Died 17 August 2004, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.</p>
