<p><strong>Ernest Corominas</strong> was a Catalan mathematician who worked in South America and ended up in France. He worked on generalised derivatives and ordered sets.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ernest's mother was Celestina Vigneaux i Cibils (1878-1964), a teacher and educationalist who introduced the Montessori method into Catalan schools.</li>
<li>Pere and Celestina Corominas were married in 1902 and the first of their eight children, Joan Coromines, was born on 21 March 1905.</li>
<li>Ernest had an older sister, Júlia Coromines Vigneaux who was born in 1910.</li>
<li>Ernest Corominas was brought up in Barcelona where he entered the University of Barcelona.</li>
<li>Spain was plunged into a civil war in July 1936, close to the time that Corominas graduated.</li>
<li>Given that we have already said that Corominas's father was a left-wing Republican politician, it will come as no surprise to learn that Corominas joined the Republican army.</li>
<li>One of these was around Barcelona where Corominas was part of the Republican defenders when the Nationalists launched an all out assault late in December 1938.</li>
<li>The campaign was fought in January and February 1939 with Corominas ordered to destroy bridges to ensure that the remnants of the Republican army could escape.</li>
<li>By February 1939 Corominas, together with many of his fellow soldiers and civilian refugees, had escaped to France.</li>
<li>Corominas was now one of around 500,000 Spanish refugees in France but they were not welcomed there, especially the Republican soldiers.</li>
<li>Corominas sailed for Chile on the SS Winnipeg from Port Trompeloup Pauillac, north of Bordeaux, on 4 August 1939.</li>
<li>With Corominas and fellow Republican soldiers on board, the SS Winnipeg sailed through the Panama Canal and at that time they learnt of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union made on 23 August.</li>
<li>Corominas had not had a chance to take up employment due to the Spanish Civil War.</li>
<li>He had been in Barcelona when Corominas was studying at the University and they had met at this time.</li>
<li>Rey Pastor offered Corominas the position of Assistant in Mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires.</li>
<li>This was quite a bold move since Corominas had not had the opportunity to study mathematics any further after graduating with his first degree.</li>
<li>However, strongly encouraged by Rey Pastor, Corominas spent a year at the University of Buenos Aires making good use of the library there to read advanced mathematical texts.</li>
<li>Corominas now began to undertake research in mathematics and publish his results.</li>
<li>Continuing to work on generalised derivatives, Corominas published On Peano's generalized derivatives (Spanish) in 1946 which improves on results obtained by Arnaud Denjoy on Peano derivatives.</li>
<li>While living in Mendoza, Corominas met Maria Edith Guevara, the cousin of Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who later became a revolutionary and friend of Fidel Castro.</li>
<li>Corominas married Maria Edith Guevara in Mendoza in 1946; they later had three children, Edith, Henri, and Helene who were all born in Paris.</li>
<li>Corominas was dismissed from his position but Arnaud Denjoy, who had been impressed by Corominas's papers, offered him a position at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris in 1947.</li>
<li>He invited Corominas to join him at the CSIC so, in 1952, Corominas returned to Barcelona taking up a position at the CSIC.</li>
<li>Once settled into his new position Corominas produced a remarkable result published in two joint papers with Ferran Sunyer i Balaguer.</li>
<li>Corominas hoped that he would be able to set up a research school in Barcelona but, despite Rey Pastor's best efforts, he only ever had temporary appointments which were badly-paid.</li>
<li>We know that the CSIC was politicised and Corominas, with his Republican military background and family connections, must have been discriminated against.</li>
<li>Hopeful that this would give him the right atmosphere for teaching and research, Corominas had accepted a position at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas.</li>
<li>However, Caracas did not provide Corominas with the peace he looked for to devote himself to mathematics.</li>
<li>There was a military siege of the Central University where Corominas was working.</li>
<li>Corominas had no fellow mathematicians interested in the topics that he studied so, when he was offered a professorship at the Claude Bernard University of Lyon in France in 1964 he was happy to accept.</li>
<li>Retirement certainly did not stop Corominas continuing to attend seminars and conferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 February 1913, Barcelona, Spain. Died 24 January 1992, Lyon, France.</p>
