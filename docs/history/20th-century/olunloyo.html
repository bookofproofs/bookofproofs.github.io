<p><strong>Victor Olunloyo</strong> is a Nigerian mathematician who published results on number theory. He became governor of Oyo State in Nigeria in October 1983 until unseated by a military coup.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Horatio Olunloyo, a scholar, organist and administrator who also served in the Nigerian Army, died of high blood pressure on 29 December 1948 at the age of 42.</li>
<li>Victor, the subject of this biography was the oldest of the children while Vincent Olusegun Sowemimo Olunloyo (1943-2017), or Segun as he was known, was the third born.</li>
<li>Victor Olunloyo attended Holy Trinity Primary School, Ebute-Ero, Lagos in 1939, a school founded by Anglican missionaries in 1888.</li>
<li>Olunloyo was the only one in his class who had come after passing Standard 5, the others all having passed Standard 6.</li>
<li>Victor was in his first year at Government College when his father died in December 1948.</li>
<li>Among his dormitory roommates at that time were Sulaiman Botsende Lagundoye, who became a radiologist and medical professor, Akinwande Oluwole Babatunde Soyinka, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, Oladipo Olujumi Akinkugbe, who became a professor of medicine, and Olalekan Are, who became "Nigeria's foremost agronomist, civil/public servant, philanthropist." Not only did Victor Olunloyo excel at mathematics at Government College, but he was also an excellent cricketer, an outstanding opening bowler, who played in the school team.</li>
<li>Today the University of St Andrews is located only in the town of St Andrews but, when Olunloyo began his studies there, Queen's College, Dundee, was also part of the University of St Andrews.</li>
<li>With scholarships in both mathematics and engineering, Olunloyo was a student in Queen's College, Dundee.</li>
<li>We note that six years after Olunloyo left the University of St Andrews, Queen's College, Dundee became a separate university in 1967, the University of Dundee.</li>
<li>John Jackson wrote to the Students Officer, Western Nigeria Office in London, on 4 April 1957 supporting Olunloyo's scholarship being renewed.</li>
<li>Olunloyo was not only interested in his mathematical studies for he was also the President of the Musical Society.</li>
<li>By 1966, Olunloyo was back at the University of Ibadan.</li>
<li>Let us note at this stage that there seems to be quite a lot of confusion between Victor Olunloyo and his brother Vincent Olunloyo.</li>
<li>Both have the same initials, V O S Olunloyo, and both wrote papers under this name.</li>
<li>MathSciNet believes that both Victor and Vincent are the same person and various others have made this error.</li>
<li>Vincent Olunloyo spent time at Cornell University in the United States and wrote papers on ordinary and partial differential equations, fluid mechanics and numerical analysis.</li>
<li>Despite his engineering scholarship, Victor Olunloyo seems to have only published papers on pure mathematics.</li>
<li>Interestingly, Victor Olunloyo, the subject of this biography, does not seem to have published papers on the results of his Ph.D. thesis and his first papers are on number theory.</li>
<li>Olunloyo did not only have a career as a mathematician, he also had a political career.</li>
<li>One of Majekodunmi's first tasks was to appoint Olunloyo as Commissioner for Economic Development for the Western Region.</li>
<li>Adeyinka Adebayo (1928-2017) became governor of the Western region and he re-appointed Olunloyo as Commissioner for Economic Development.</li>
<li>In August 1983 Olunloyo, as a member of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN), stood in the election for Governor of Oyo State.</li>
<li>Olunloyo won taking 58 per cent of the vote against 40 per cent for Bola Ige.</li>
<li>Olunloyo did not even appear in court.</li>
<li>Olunloyo's victory was, however, short lived since three months later there was a military coup.</li>
<li>Dr Olunloyo while addressing a large crowd of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) faithfuls and residents of the state that thronged the historic Mapo Hall for his public declaration for the governorship race stated emphatically that he remained the only aspirant without any record of corruption having held eleven different executive offices in the past.</li>
<li>Dr Olunloyo who paid a glowing tribute to the founding fathers and previous political actors of the state said, "at times such as this, there should be no room for new comers to governance.</li>
<li>Olunloyo was not chosen as PDP candidate, however, the choice being Rasheed Ladoja who was duly elected governor of Oyo State on 29 May 2003.</li>
<li>In 2009 Olunloyo was chair of a panel set up to investigate the collapse of a part of the Pharmacy section of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology.</li>
<li>This was said to have angered the governor, Adebayo Alao-Akala, who allegedly moved to prevail on his predecessor to reconsider its position and rewrite the report, but Olunloyo refused.</li>
<li>Olunloyo was elected chairman of the PDP Planning and Strategy Committee for Ibadanland with the aim of promoting the Party's success in the 2011 Nigerian election.</li>
<li>In 2012 Victor Olunloyo left the PDP political party and joined the Action Congress of Nigeria party.</li>
<li>Finally let us note that Olunloyo was married to Funmilayo, who worked in the Civil Service, being there when she met Olunloyo, and they had ten children.</li>
<li>The second of these children was Kemi Omololu-Olunloyo (born Olukemi Omololu-Olunloyo, 6 August 1964) who became a journalist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 April 1935, Ibadan, Nigeria.</p>
