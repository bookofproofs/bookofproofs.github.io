<p><strong>Bruce Kellogg</strong> was an American mathematician who worked in partial differential eequations  (both theoretical and in the modelling of real phenomena).</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ernest Kellogg (born 1902), whose parents were Royal S Kellog and Clara Fry, was from Yonkers, New York.</li>
<li>He did not use the name Royal, but was always known as Bruce.</li>
<li>Kellogg spent part of his youth in Washington and graduated from the Western High School in 1948.</li>
<li>After graduating, Kellogg worked for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a research scientist in the nuclear power industry before joining the Mathematics Department of the University of Maryland in 1966.</li>
<li>While working at Westinghouse's Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory, Kellogg published papers such as: (with L C Noderer) Scaled iterations and linear equations (1960); Another alternating-direction-implicit method (1963); Difference equations on a mesh arising from a general triangulation (1964); An alternating direction method for operator equations (1964); and (with J Spanier) On optimal alternating direction parameters for singular matrices (1965).</li>
<li>In 1966 Kellogg was appointed to the Institute for Fluid Dynamics and Applied Mathematics of the University of Maryland, College Park.</li>
<li>Charles R Johnson, whose middle name was Royal, was a colleague of Bruce Kellogg at Maryland.</li>
<li>A major theme in Bruce's opus is the numerical solution of singular perturbation problems.</li>
<li>Kellogg published over 100 papers having 46 co-authors and, by June 2013,  they had received 837 citations by 661 authors.</li>
<li>Kellogg's own introduction to Higher order singularities for interface problems.</li>
<li>Here are a few examples of his post-retirement papers, mostly with Kellogg's own summary.</li>
<li>While he was working at the University of Maryland, Kellogg had lived at 7504 Hancock Avenue, Takoma Park, which is a suburb of Washington D.C. The Kelloggs sold their home in Takoma Park in March 2001.</li>
<li>Kellogg died at the Smith Phayer Hospice House of the Carolina Foothills in Landrum, South Carolina.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 28 December 1930, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Died 30 April 2012, Landrum, South Carolina, USA.</p>
