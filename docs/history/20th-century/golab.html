<p><strong>Stanisław Gołąb</strong> was a Polish mathematician who worked in particular on the field of affine geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hoborski was quick to spot the mathematical talents in his young pupil, and he guided him through his secondary school career, giving  Gołąb a deep love of geometry.</li>
<li>Entering the Jagiellonian University in Kraków in 1920,  Gołąb studied mathematics in the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics.</li>
<li>However, although only two years into an undergraduate degree, in 1922  Gołąb was given a position as a teaching assistant in the Mining Academy in Kraków.</li>
<li>However  Gołąb continued teach at the Mining Academy and to undertake research in mathematics.</li>
<li>However he was registered as a doctoral student at the Jagiellonian University with Stanisław Zaremba as his formal thesis supervisor.</li>
<li>Before submitting his thesis,  Gołąb studied in Italy with Tullio Levi-Civita and E Bompiani, in Czechoslovakia with Ludwig Berwald, and also in Göttingen.</li>
<li>Since he wanted to become a university professor of mathematics,  Gołąb worked on his habilitation.</li>
<li>Gołąb also continued to lecture at the Mining Academy and in 1939 he was promoted to associate professor there.</li>
<li>After the 1925 paper we mentioned above,  Gołąb published 3 papers in 1928, 3 papers in 1929, 4 papers in 1930, 1 paper in 1931, 6 papers in 1932, 9 papers in 1933, 4 papers in 1934, 5 papers in 1935, 2 papers in 1936, 5 papers in 1937, and 11 papers in 1938.</li>
<li>Gołąb was one of those at the meeting in the Collegium Novum on that day.</li>
<li>Gołąb, of course, was one of those arrested.</li>
<li>Gołąb, being one of the younger professors, was not released at that time and he suffered in the camps until December 1940 when, after a year of imprisonment, he was released.</li>
<li>Gołąb worked as a bookkeeper for a forestry organisation from the time of his release until the end of World War II.</li>
<li>Gołąb was one of those who, despite the knowledge that were they caught they would almost certainly have been murdered, taught at both the Mining Academy and at the Jagiellonian University.</li>
<li>All Polish mathematicians working in the theory of functional equations are - directly or indirectly - pupils of Professor  Gołąb.</li>
<li>at least a few dozen, perhaps even hundreds, of engineers not only had the opportunity of discussing their projects or results with Professor  Gołąb, but also as a result of this discussion could enrich and improve their research work.</li>
<li>In 1956  Gołąb published the book Tensor calculus (Polish).</li>
<li>Let us also mention the book Funktionalgleichungen der Theorie der geometrischen Objekte Ⓣ(Functional equations in the theory of geometric objects)  which  Gołąb wrote jointly with J Aczél and published in 1960.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 26 July 1902, Travnik, Bosnia, Austro-Hungarian Empire. Died 30 April 1980, Kraków, Poland.</p>
