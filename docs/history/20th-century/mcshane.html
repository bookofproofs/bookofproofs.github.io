<p><strong>Edward J McShane</strong> was an American mathematician noted for his work in the calculus of variations and integration theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After attending school in New Orleans, McShane entered Tulane University.</li>
<li>After completing his first degrees (for he had two!), McShane continued to study at Tulane for his Master's degree in mathematics while teaching mathematics as an instructor.</li>
<li>With the award of a Master's degree from Tulane in 1927, McShane went to the University of Chicago to undertake studies for his doctorate.</li>
<li>McShane spent part of the following two years at Princeton, part at Ohio State, part at Harvard and part at Chicago.</li>
<li>In 1935 McShane was appointed to a professorship at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, where, except for temporary appointments elsewhere, he was to remain for the rest of his life.</li>
<li>McShane had been asked to complete a questionnaire.</li>
<li>McShane is famous for his work in the calculus of variations, Moore-Smith theory of limits, the theory of the integral, stochastic differential equations, and ballistics.</li>
<li>In 1974, the year he retired and was made Professor Emeritus at Virginia, McShane published Stochastic calculus and stochastic models which again reflected his work on the mathematical setting for quantum mechanics.</li>
<li>McShane was much involved with both the American Mathematical Society and with the Mathematical Association of America.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 10 May 1904, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. Died 1 June 1989, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.</p>
