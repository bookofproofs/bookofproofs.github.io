<p><strong>Gelfond</strong> developed basic techniques in the study of transcendental numbers.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gelfond entered Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at Moscow State University in 1924 and completed his undergraduate studies in 1927.</li>
<li>He then began research under the supervision of Aleksandr Khinchin and Vyacheslaw Stepanov and completed his postgraduate studies in 1930.</li>
<li>The second of these 1929 papers contained the lecture which Gelfond gave to the First All-Union Mathematics Congress held in Kharkov in 1930.</li>
<li>These papers by Gelfond represent a major step forward in the study of transcendental numbers.</li>
<li>In the second of the 1929 papers Gelfond applied this result to prove that certain numbers are transcendental, so solving a special case of Hilbert's Seventh Problem.</li>
<li>After his return to Russia, Gelfond taught mathematics from 1931 at Moscow State University where he held chairs of analysis, theory of numbers and the history of mathematics.</li>
<li>Gelfond developed basic techniques in the study of transcendental numbers, that is numbers that are not the solution of an algebraic equation with rational coefficients.</li>
<li>In addition to his important work in the number theory of transcendental numbers, Gelfond made significant contributions to the theory of interpolation and the approximation of functions of a complex variable.</li>
<li>This result is now known as Gelfond's theorem and solved Problem 7 of the list of Hilbert problems.</li>
<li>(In 1966 Alan Baker proved Gelfond's Conjecture in general.) Gelfond's papers in 1933 and 1934, which include his remarkable achievement, are: Gram determinants for stationary series (written jointly with Khinchin) (1933); A necessary and sufficient criterion for the transcendence of a number (1933); Functions that take integer values at the points of a geometric progression (1933); On the seventh problem of D Hilbert (1934); and On the seventh problem of Hilbert (1934).</li>
<li>Gelfond addressed the Second All-Union Mathematics Congress in Leningrad in 1934) on Transcendental numbers.</li>
<li>We now look briefly at a number of books which Gelfond wrote.</li>
<li>This was based on a text of the same title which Gelfond originally published in 1936.</li>
<li>Also in 1952 Gelfond published the low level Solving equations in integers  which was translated into English in 1960.</li>
<li>In 1962 Gelfond published the book Elementary methods in the analytic theory of numbers  written jointly with Linnik.</li>
<li>A further text by Gelfond is Residues and their applications (1966).</li>
<li>Many eminent mathematicians think roughly along the same lines as less eminent ones, though more rapidly and in a more organised way; Gelfond always thought in his own way, one that was unconventional and quite original.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 October 1906, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 7 November 1968, Moscow, Russia.</p>
