<h1>Person: Keisler, Jerome</h1>

<p><strong>Jerome Keisler</strong> is an American mathematician whose work included model theory and non-standard analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Harry, born on 21 July 1909 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was not given a middle name, so he changed his name to Harry Benton Keisler.</li>
<li>Sadly Harry Keisler died on 14 April 1950 when Jerome was thirteen years old.</li>
<li>Jerome Keisler studied at the California Institute of Technology, graduating with the degree of Bachelor of Science in mathematics in 1959.</li>
<li>These papers were introduced by Olga Taussky-Todd who taught Keisler at the California Institute of Technology.</li>
<li>Keisler's progress was rapid and his first paper appeared in print in 1960.</li>
<li>We note that Chen Chung Chang (1927-2014) collaborated with Keisler throughout his career and they wrote joint papers and books.</li>
<li>Richard A Dean taught Keisler at the California Institute of Technology.</li>
<li>Keisler was awarded a Ph.D. in 1961, after only two years of research at Berkeley, after submitting his 45-page thesis Ultraproducts and elementary classes.</li>
<li>After the award of his Ph.D. in 1961, Keisler was appointed as a mathematician at the Institute for Defense Analysis in Princeton, New Jersey.</li>
<li>In 1982, Keisler was named William F Vilas professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</li>
<li>Keisler attended the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Stockholm in August 1962.</li>
<li>Keisler has written a number of books, some of which have run to several editions.</li>
<li>In 2018 Keisler was presented with the Albert Nelson Marquis Lifetime Achievement Award by Marquis Who's Who.</li>
<li>An accomplished listee, Dr Keisler celebrates many years' experience in his professional network, and has been noted for achievements, leadership qualities, and the credentials and successes he has accrued in his field.</li>
<li>Dr Keisler has made seminal contributions in mathematical logic, particularly in the areas of model theory and nonstandard analysis.</li>
<li>Dr Keisler is also a member and a former vice president of the Association of Symbolic Logic and a member of the American Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>An elected fellow of the American Mathematical Society, Dr Keisler accepted an Alfred P Sloan fellowship from 1966 to 1968.</li>
<li>Moreover, Dr Keisler has been selected for inclusion in many editions of Who's Who in America.</li>
<li>In recognition of outstanding contributions to his profession and the Marquis Who's Who community, Howard Jerome Keisler, PhD, has been featured on the Albert Nelson Marquis Lifetime Achievement website.</li>
<li>Although Keisler retired in 2002, he certainly did not ease up on his outstanding publishing record with, up to February 2020, over 40 papers appearing in print from 2003 onwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 December 1936, Seattle, Washington, USA.</p>
