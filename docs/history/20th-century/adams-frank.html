<h1>Person: Adams (4), Frank</h1>

<p><strong>Frank Adams</strong> was an English algebraic topologist who pioneered methods for calculating the homotopy of spheres.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adams served in the Royal Engineers during 1948 and 1949 before beginning his university education.</li>
<li>Adams entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1949 to study mathematics.</li>
<li>Family life was extremely important to Adams, though he preferred to keep it separate from his professional life.</li>
<li>This happened during the year 1954 which Adams spent as a junior lecturer at the University of Oxford.</li>
<li>He returned to Cambridge in 1956 to take up the Fellowship and during this period he developed the spectral sequence which today is called the "Adams' spectral sequence".</li>
<li>Adams won a Commonwealth Scholarship which enabled him to visit Chicago as a research associate in 1957-58.</li>
<li>The conjecture that Adams solved was the famous conjecture about the existence of HHH-structures on spheres.</li>
<li>After spending further time in Princeton, Adams took up a post at Manchester as a Reader in 1962, being appointed to Newman's chair when he retired in 1964.</li>
<li>In 1964 Adams was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.</li>
<li>In 1970 Adams succeeded Hodge as Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at Cambridge, and at this time he returned to Trinity College.</li>
<li>Stable homotopy theory (1964) is a short 74 page book which is based on six lectures Adams gave at the University of California at Berkeley in 1961.</li>
<li>It is in two parts, the first contains a description of the topics that Adams thought essential for any young mathematician interested in algebraic topology.</li>
<li>It links to a wide variety of textbooks with Adams indicating the one which treats the topic in the way he considers best.</li>
<li>The second part contains excerpts from some famous papers on algebraic topology together with surveys of generalized cohomology theories and complex cobordism written by Adams.</li>
<li>Adams' book fills this need nicely and it can be recommended to anyone seeking a substantial overview of the main topics.</li>
<li>As is evident from the lecture courses which Adams published, his lectures were well prepared but usually hard.</li>
<li>The competitive instinct in Adams was highly developed, for example in his attitude to research.</li>
<li>Adams received many awards for his work.</li>
<li>Finally we note that seven years after Adams died another book was published based on his lecture courses.</li>
<li>The book is based on lectures which Adams gave at Cambridge which he considered to be sequel to his book Lectures on Lie groups (1969).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 November 1930, Woolwich, London, England. Died 7 January 1989, Near Brampton, Huntingdonshire, England.</p>
