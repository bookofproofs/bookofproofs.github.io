<p><strong>Harry Reuter</strong> was born in Germany but came to England as a refugee in 1935. His career was at the University of Manchester, the University of Durham and Imperial College, London. He contributed to a wide range of topics but is best know for outstanding contributions to probability, particularly to Markov processes.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>He was the son of Ernst Rudolf Johannes Reuter (1889-1953) and Charlotte Gertrud Herta Scholz (1901-1977).</li>
<li>Ernst Reuter, the son of Karl Georg Wilhelm Reuter and his wife Auguste Elise Wilhelmine Karoline, married Charlotte Gertrud Herta Scholz on 7 January 1920, the day she became nineteen years old.</li>
<li>The children were Hella, born 1920, and Harry, the subject of this biography, born the following year.</li>
<li>Harry was brought up by his father and his sister Hella by her mother.</li>
<li>Ernst Reuter was a member of the Berlin Government from 1926, responsible for transportation.</li>
<li>He married Johanna Margarete Kleinert (26 December 1899-1974) on 15 July 1927 and from then on, Johanna became Harry's mother.</li>
<li>After Ernst was arrested Harry and his step-mother stayed in Magdeburg for a while, then moved to Hannover where his step-mother came from and they stayed there.</li>
<li>Ernst Reuter was held in Dachau Concentration Camp but after his release he travelled to England and went to Cambridge.</li>
<li>Ernst applied for Harry to have the place and by April 1935 it was agreed.</li>
<li>Harry's step-mother accompanied him to England, and then she returned to Germany.</li>
<li>We should note here that Harry Reuter was not a typical refugee fleeing Germany at that time since most of the refugees had fled because they were Jewish, but the Reuter family were persecuted for their political views.</li>
<li>Ernst Reuter looked for a job in England but nothing came up and he then went to Ankara in Turkey where he was offered a job.</li>
<li>Ernst's wife joined him in Ankara but Harry remained in Cambridge.</li>
<li>The Burkills assumed legal responsibility for Harry and for that of another refugee boy from Austria.</li>
<li>So they asked to stay, Reuter drove his jeep back to Heidelberg in a hurry to get rations, and John Todd brought the authorization for some milk for our coffee table, where we all sat on the library terrace in the May sun.</li>
<li>Süss need not have worried since Reuter and John Todd said they could avert that, and continued drinking their coffee.</li>
<li>Since Reuter's father is mentioned in this quote we should note that Ernst Reuter became somewhat of a hero in this period.</li>
<li>His war service at an end, Reuter returned to Cambridge to continue his studies aiming for a doctorate.</li>
<li>In 1945 Reuter married Eileen Grace Legard (1921-2012), the second daughter of the leather merchant Hubert Ronald Legard and his wife Amy Key.</li>
<li>Harry and Eileen Reuter had four children: Timothy Reuter (1947-2002), Penelope Reuter (1949-2017), Stella Reuter and Elizabeth Reuter.</li>
<li>In 1946 Max Newman approached Reuter with an offer of a position at the University of Manchester.</li>
<li>Reuter decided to accept the offer from Manchester and left Cambridge without finishing his doctorate.</li>
<li>The first thing to note here is that right from the beginning of his research career, Reuter was working on topics in pure mathematics, applied mathematics and physics.</li>
<li>We should also explain briefly about Reuter's three collaborators on the above papers.</li>
<li>At the University of Manchester, Reuter was a colleague of Walter Ledermann.</li>
<li>David Kendall met Reuter at the British Mathematical Colloquium held in Durham in September 1953.</li>
<li>Reuter spent sabbatical leave at Yale in the United States in 1958 where he was able to work with William Feller.</li>
<li>The choice of Durham as a venue in 1963 was a natural consequence of the fact that Harry was by now Professor there, and ever since there has been a close association between that University and the LMS.</li>
<li>In 1965 Reuter moved from Durham to London when he was appointed to the chair of Pure Mathematics at Imperial College.</li>
<li>While Prof Reuter has, for example, made a study of competition between insect populations, his most, important work concerns the theory of general Markov chains.</li>
<li>Prof Reuter has shown that operator theory is a natural tool for tackling many of these problems and that it may be applied to solve some of them under wide conditions.</li>
<li>In 1983 Reuter retired from his chair at Imperial College and went to live in Cambridge.</li>
<li>At 47 Madingley Road, one was always sure of a warm welcome from Harry and Eileen, and equally sure to find support and wisdom, and a very gentle reproof if one had done something really outrageous.</li>
<li>Reuter served the London Mathematical Society as editor of the Journal and Secretary of the Society in 1966-69.</li>
<li>it is for his personal qualities that those fortunate enough to have known Harry will best remember him.</li>
<li>He had a first-rate mind; nothing that Harry did - research, teaching, administration - was hurried or skimped; he was a perfectionist, without being fussy.</li>
<li>He had a delightful sense of humour, which he would deploy with a straight face and in his own inimitable tones (he spoke with no trace of his native German but utterly distinctively - in a Harry Reuter accent, as it were).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 November 1921, Berlin, Germany. Died 20 April 1992, Cambridge, England.</p>
