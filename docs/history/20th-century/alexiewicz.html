<p><strong>Andrzej Alexiewicz</strong> was a Polish mathematician, born in what is now Ukraine, who was an expert at functional analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The city quickly became an important Polish centre for learning and culture and it was in this atmosphere that Andrzej's education took place.</li>
<li>After graduating from High School, Alexiewicz began his studies at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów.</li>
<li>It was the third largest of Poland's universities, having around 6000 students when Alexiewicz began to study there.</li>
<li>Żyliński had supervised Władysław Orlicz's doctoral thesis on orthogonal series and it was Orlicz who became a friend, advisor and collaborator of Alexiewicz.</li>
<li>In 1941 Alexiewicz was appointed as an assistant lecturer at the Lwów State University, but in June 1941 Germany attacked its former ally, the Soviet Union.</li>
<li>The university could no longer operate, so Alexiewicz had to give up his position there.</li>
<li>Alexiewicz was one of the academics working there, but he also taught in an underground university, and continued to undertake research towards his doctorate.</li>
<li>In fact, several years later, Alexiewicz submitted a two-part paper On sequences of operations based on his thesis to Studia Mathematica which was published in volume 11 in 1949-50.</li>
<li>Now, as the war entered its final stages, Alexiewicz realised that Lwów would not remain a part of Poland when the war ended.</li>
<li>By this time Alexiewicz was married with children; his son Władysław Alexiewicz, who became a famous physicist, was born in November 1943.</li>
<li>This made Poznań a natural choice for Alexiewicz since he would remain a colleague of Orlicz.</li>
<li>Together with his family, Alexiewicz arrived in Poznań on 5 May 1945.</li>
<li>Orlicz, who held the chair of mathematics, and Alexiewicz then faced a major task rebuilding the department of mathematics at Poznań which had been completely destroyed during the war.</li>
<li>The reopened Polish University of Poznań, to which Orlicz and Alexiewicz were appointed, was a small institution with hardly any infrastructure and few teaching staff.</li>
<li>Alexiewicz was awarded a doctorate in July 1945 on the basis of his thesis which had been examined in Lwów.</li>
<li>It is in this work that Alexiewicz introduced the 'Alexiewicz norm', which is an integral norm that makes a certain space of integrable functions into a topological vector space.</li>
<li>In 1953 Alexiewicz was promoted to associate professor, becoming an ordinary professor in 1961 after a reorganisation had taken place at the University of Poznań.</li>
<li>A new Institute of Mathematics was created, its first head being Alexiewicz who held this position until he retired in 1987.</li>
<li>During his time at Poznań, Alexiewicz held a number of important positions in the university.</li>
<li>We have indicated above some of the mathematical areas that Alexiewicz worked on.</li>
<li>The painting presented the waterfall "Huk" in Kosmacz, one of the favourite places of professor Alexiewicz.</li>
<li>Professor Andrzej Alexiewicz had a discerning musical taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 February 1917, Lwów, Poland, Austria-Hungarian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 11 July 1995, Poznań, Poland.</p>
