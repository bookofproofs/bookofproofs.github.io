<p><strong>Sun-Yung Alice Chang</strong> is a Chinese born American mathematician  whose research interests include the study of certain geometric types of nonlinear partial differential equations and the related extremal inequalities and problems in isospectral geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Soon after this Chang's family moved from mainland China to the Republic of China in Taiwan.</li>
<li>In her thesis, Chang worked on problems in classical analysis, in particular the study of boundary behaviour of bounded analytic functions on the unit disc.</li>
<li>After receiving her doctorate, Chang was appointed as an assistant professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo for the academic year 1974-1975.</li>
<li>In 1980 Chang returned to the University of California at Los Angeles as an associate professor, being later promoted to full professor.</li>
<li>Chang's research interests include the study of certain geometric types of nonlinear partial differential equations.</li>
<li>Perhaps Chang's greatest honour was the award of the 1995 Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics.</li>
<li>Chang received the prize at the American Mathematical Society meeting in San Francisco in January 1995.</li>
<li>In 1998, in addition to her Professorship at the University of California, Los Angeles, Chang was appointed Professor at Princeton University.</li>
<li>Chang is married to Paul Yang, also a Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University; they have one daughter and one son.</li>
<li>Chang has received many honours in addition to the Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics which we described above.</li>
<li>On 28 April 2009 the National Academy of Sciences announced that Chang had been elected a member.</li>
<li>In June 2009 Chang was one of the organisers of '2009 the Program for Women and Mathematics' held at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.</li>
<li>As to her hobbies, Chang lists reading novels, taking walks and listening to music.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 March 1948, Xi-an, China.</p>
