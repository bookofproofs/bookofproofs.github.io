<p><strong>Floyd Burton Jones</strong> was an American mathematician who worked mainly in topology.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>This had the effect of making Jones grow up wishing to be a lawyer, for his father mixed with the top lawyers of the County.</li>
<li>Jones won a Regents' Scholarship to study at the University of Texas and when he entered the University he was certainly still intending to become a lawyer and he enrolled in the pre-law program.</li>
<li>Law is a subject which requires a student to be able to memorise large amounts of information and Jones soon discovered that this was not one of his strengths.</li>
<li>Lawyers do not need to study mathematics but chemists do, and so at this point Jones took mathematics courses.</li>
<li>Perhaps the main factor which led Jones to finally decide to become a mathematician was R L Moore.</li>
<li>He quickly spotted Jones's talents for the subject even when he was only taking the mathematics courses necessary for the chemistry degree.</li>
<li>Moore did not try to make Jones change degrees for a second time and indeed he did complete his chemistry degree in 1932.</li>
<li>At this point Moore showed how deeply he believed in Jones's mathematical ability for he offered him a job as a part-time mathematics instructor.</li>
<li>This was too good an offer to refuse so Jones took up the post in September 1932 and at the same time he began studies for his doctorate in mathematics.</li>
<li>In 1942 Jones left the University of Texas to undertake War work at Harvard Underwater Sound Laboratory where he helped develop scanning sonar used in anti-submarine warfare.</li>
<li>Jones wrote 67 papers, his first in 1935 being on separable spaces, while his third in 1937 on normal spaces is one of his most important.</li>
<li>as brilliant as Jones' research was, it was overshadowed by his great skill as a teacher and his work as a human being.</li>
<li>the magical power of Jones in the classroom - a master who breathes the very life of mathematics into his students.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 22 November 1910, Cisco, Texas, USA. Died 15 April 1999, Santa Barbara, California, USA.</p>
