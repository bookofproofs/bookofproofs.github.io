<p><strong>Harvey Greenspan</strong> played an important role in establishing Applied Mathematics as a subject in its own right in the United States. He studied fluid dynamics both from a theoretical and from an experimental perspective, making major contributions to fluid flow, wave motion and bio-fluid dynamics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Greenspan was educated in Brooklyn where after his primary education, his secondary education was at the Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York.</li>
<li>Harvey graduated from the High School in 1950 and began studying mathematics at the City College of New York.</li>
<li>Greenspan was awarded a Ph.D. by Harvard University in 1956 for his thesis The generation of edge waves by moving pressure distributions.</li>
<li>Following the award of his doctorate, Greenspan was appointed as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Harvard University, a position he held from 1957 to 1960.</li>
<li>Greenspan was appointed as an Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1960.</li>
<li>This, then, was the problem which Greenspan faced at MIT.</li>
<li>In 1964 Greenspan was promoted to Professor of Applied Mathematics.</li>
<li>Another task that Greenspan took on at this time was setting up a computing laboratory.</li>
<li>In 1968 Greenspan published the monograph The Theory of Rotating Fluids.</li>
<li>Greenspan had a major impact on the teaching of applied mathematics at MIT, introducing around ten courses himself into the curriculum.</li>
<li>Greenspan retired from his chair at MIT in 2002 and was made Professor Emeritus.</li>
<li>We have seen how Greenspan tried over the years to put forward his own ideas about how applied mathematics should be taught.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 22 February 1933, Brooklyn, New York, USA.</p>
