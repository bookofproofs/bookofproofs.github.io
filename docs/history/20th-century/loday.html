<p><strong>Jean-Louis Loday</strong> wasa French mathematician whoo worked in the field of cyclic homology.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His father, Louis Loday, was mayor of Le Pouliguen at the time Jean-Louis was born, holding this position from 1945 to 1969.</li>
<li>Loday was awarded his agrégation de mathématiques in 1969 and he went to the University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg where he undertook research for his doctorate.</li>
<li>Loday, who was Karoubi's first doctoral student, was awarded his Ph.D. in 1975 for his thesis K-théorie algébrique et représentations de groupes Ⓣ(Algebraic K-theory and group representations).</li>
<li>The 1973 publication was in the proceedings of the Conference "Classical algebraic K-theory and connections with arithmetic" which Loday attended in Seattle in the United States.</li>
<li>It was at the University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg that Loday spent his whole career.</li>
<li>Another topic that Loday worked on during the 1980s was cyclic homology, some of the work being undertaken jointly with Daniel Quillen.</li>
<li>Loday published the 450-page text Cyclic homology in 1992.</li>
<li>In the 1990s, Loday also worked on operads, a topic that he continued to study for the rest of his life.</li>
<li>We should mention that Loday also published under the pseudonym Guillaume William Zinbiel (Zinbiel is Leibniz written backwards).</li>
<li>Loday was a joint editor of these proceedings (under the name Jean-Louis Loday) of the International Conference held at the Chern Institute of Mathematics at Nankai University, China, in July 2010.</li>
<li>The piece is a lovely illustration of Loday's humour.</li>
<li>Loday died in a tragic boating accident, falling from his boat off Les Sables-d'Olonne.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 12 January 1946, Le Pouliguen, Pays de la Loire, France. Died 6 June 2012, Les Sables-d'Olonne, France.</p>
