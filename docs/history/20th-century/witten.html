<p><strong>Edward Witten</strong> is an American mathematician who won a Fields Medal for his work on quantum field theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Witten studied at Brandeis University and received his B.A. in 1971.</li>
<li>After completing his doctorate, Witten went to Harvard where he was postdoctoral fellow during session 1976-77 and then a Junior Fellow from 1977 to 1980.</li>
<li>In September 1980 Witten was appointed professor of Physics at Princeton.</li>
<li>Basically Witten is a mathematical physicist and he has a wealth of important publications which are properly in physics.</li>
<li>In his study of these areas of theoretical physics, Witten has achieved a level of mathematics which has led him to be awarded the highest honour that a mathematician can receive, namely a Fields Medal.</li>
<li>The Proceedings of the Congress contains two articles describing Witten's mathematical work which led to the award.</li>
<li>The first major contribution which led to Witten's Fields Medal was his simpler proof of the positive mass conjecture which had led to a Fields Medal for Yau in 1982.</li>
<li>This became the centrepiece of many of Witten's subsequent works...</li>
<li>Witten explains that "supersymmetric quantum mechanics" is just Hodge-de Rham theory.</li>
<li>It is a measure of Witten's mastery of the field that he has been able to make intelligent and skilful use of this difficult point of view in much of his subsequent work.</li>
<li>Another piece of new mathematics stemmed from Witten's papers on global gravitational anomalies.</li>
<li>In recent years, Witten focused his attention on topological quantum field theories.</li>
<li>Witten described these in terms of the invariants of Donaldson and Floer (extending the earlier ideas of Atiyah) and generalised the Jones knot polynomial ...</li>
<li>This is the case with Witten's work.</li>
<li>Witten has received an amazingly long list of awards, in addition to the Fields Medal, which shows the exceptionally high regard in which his contributions are held.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 26 August 1951, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.</p>
