<p><strong>François Bruhat</strong> was a French mathematician who worked on algebraic groups.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>François attended the Lycée Henri IV in Paris, going on to prepare for university entry at the Lycée Saint-Louis, also in Paris.</li>
<li>Bruhat was among the first to understand the importance of distributions, as introduced by Laurent Schwartz, in the theory of Lie groups and their representations and his doctoral thesis was devoted to these topics.</li>
<li>This paper considered induced representations which Bruhat then applied in his next paper Représentations induites des groupes de Lie semi-simples complexes Ⓣ(Induced representations of complex semi-simple Lie groups) (1954) to a complex semi-simple Lie group none of whose simple factor groups is one of the exceptional simple Lie groups.</li>
<li>In a major 108 page paper Sur les représentations induites des groupes de Lie Ⓣ(On induced representations of Lie groups) (1956) Bruhat gave a new theory in which he dealt with more restricted groups but was able to handle more general representations of them.</li>
<li>After spending three years at the National Centre for Scientific Research, Bruhat was appointed as Maître de Conférences at the Faculty of Science in Nancy in 1955.</li>
<li>Bruhat published two papers which resulted from a collaboration with Henri Cartan in 1957.</li>
<li>Bruhat continued his study of real analytic manifolds in a collaboration with Whitney.</li>
<li>A course of lecture given by Bruhat in India in 1958 were published as Lectures on Lie groups and representations of locally compact groups  and reissued in 1968.</li>
<li>In 1959 Bruhat lectured on Lie groups and Lie algebras at Recife in Brazil and his lecture notes were published as Algébres de Lie et groupes de Lie : Résumé des eleçons  in the same year.</li>
<li>By this time Bruhat had an appointment in Paris, having been appointed to the Faculty of Science there in 1961.</li>
<li>Together with Jacques Tits, Bruhat developed the theory of simple algebraic groups over local fields.</li>
<li>Finally we should mention that Bruhat was a member of Bourbaki being a third generation member along with Armand Borel, Alexandre Grothendieck, Pierre Cartier, Serge Lang, and John Tate.</li>
<li>Among the honours that Bruhat received were that he was made an Officer of the Légion d'Honneur and the national order of merit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 8 April 1929, Paris, France. Died 17 July 2007, Paris, France.</p>
