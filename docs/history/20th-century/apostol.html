<h1>Person: Apostol, Tom</h1>

<p><strong>Tom Apostol</strong> was an American mathematician who specialised in analytic number theory and wrote one of the best-known books on analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Emmanouil Apostolopoulos was a Greek whose two brothers had emigrated to the United States to work in the mines in Montana.</li>
<li>By this time he had decided that his Greek name was not right in America, so he called himself Mike Apostol.</li>
<li>Tom, the subject of this biography, was the eldest of their four children who were all born in this house in Helper.</li>
<li>Apostol's parents spoke Greek at home, essential at first since his father spoke little English.</li>
<li>The years of the Depression were hard times and, to help out the family finances, Apostol's mother took in laundry.</li>
<li>Apostol and his three siblings all had to help out picking up and delivering the laundry.</li>
<li>Some of this work was not done for money but, for example, she did laundry in exchange for piano lessons for Apostol and his eldest sister.</li>
<li>Helper was growing larger and, just as Apostol finished sixth grade, they opened a new Junior High School.</li>
<li>Grade 7 mathematics was arithmetic with business applications which Apostol did not enjoy, learning nothing new.</li>
<li>Apostol's mother wanted him to have the opportunity to study at university and, having made the occasional visit to Salt Lake City to visit relatives, she suggested that the family move there which would let Apostol attend the University of Utah while living at home.</li>
<li>Apostol's father was reluctant to leave Helper but they made a visit to Salt Lake City and found a shop for sale which was both a shoe repair business and a dry cleaning business.</li>
<li>Apostol's mother said she would run the dry cleaning business and, after much persuasion, Apostol's father agreed.</li>
<li>They moved there and Apostol spent one year at the South High School in Salt Lake City, helping out in the family business after school, before entering the University of Utah.</li>
<li>At this stage Apostol's favourite subject was chemistry, but he had broad interests.</li>
<li>At this stage Apostol had an excellent chemistry teacher who had just graduated from the University of Washington, Seattle, so he decided that he would like to transfer there.</li>
<li>Apostol also took Zuckerman's number theory course, Clyde Myron Cramlet's differential equations course, Thomas McFarlane's complex variable course, and Roy Martin Winger's projective geometry course.</li>
<li>For his Master's Degree in mathematics, Apostol was advised by Zuckerman.</li>
<li>Apostol wrote a Master's thesis on magic squares extending work by Derrick Norman Lehmer.</li>
<li>Although Apostol would have liked to remain at the University of Washington and study for a Ph.D. with Zuckerman, he was advised to go to the University of California, Berkeley, and study with Derrick Henry Lehmer, Derrick Norman Lehmer's son.</li>
<li>In 1946 Apostol met Jane when the two were both working for the Adlai Stevenson presidential campaign.</li>
<li>Jane and her husband divorced and she married Apostol in 1949.</li>
<li>For his first year at Berkeley, 1946-47, Apostol was supported by a special scholarship for students from Utah while in his second year of research he was employed as a teaching assistant.</li>
<li>Although MIT was a good place, Apostol was quite keen to get back to California.</li>
<li>Apostol began publishing papers in 1950.</li>
<li>To many mathematicians, Apostol is best known as a writer of high quality textbooks.</li>
<li>Only after the year did the question of who would write the book arise and, since Apostol had the experience and was keen to do it, he became the obvious choice.</li>
<li>The book began as a series of notes that Apostol produced, following the ideas they had already discussed, for delivering the first year course, and then the second year course.</li>
<li>Apostol's other famous two-volume work is on analytic number theory.</li>
<li>Around the time that Apostol was working on his analytic number theory volumes, his wife was beginning a career as a highly successful author of articles and books on local history.</li>
<li>In 1974 Jane Apostol began publishing research articles, mostly on South Pasadena local history.</li>
<li>All her research articles were republished in the 2012 book Jane Apostol: Collected Works, edited by Tom Apostol.</li>
<li>There is one other project that Apostol undertook which we must mention.</li>
<li>Apostol received many awards for his outstanding contributions, especially for his mathematical exposition.</li>
<li>Also in 2010 the Mathematical Association of America inducted both Tom and Jane Apostol into their Icosahedron Society, which recognises those who have shown extraordinary generosity to the Association.</li>
<li>When the American Mathematical Society instituted the class of "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society" in 2012, Apostol was one of the inaugural class.</li>
<li>Apostol retired in 1992 but continued to live in Pasadena with his wife.</li>
<li>Tom Apostol was a great human being and mathematician, and an inspiration to many.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 20 August 1923, Helper, Carbon County, Utah, USA. Died 8 May 2016, Pasadena, California, USA.</p>
