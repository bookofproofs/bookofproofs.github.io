<p><strong>Cheryl Praeger</strong> is an Australian mathematician who has applied the ideas of symmetry to a wide variety of mathematical problems.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After leaving school Praeger enrolled in the University of Queensland and completed her four year B.Sc. degree in 1969.</li>
<li>Between her third and fourth years Praeger spent eight weeks at the Australian National University.</li>
<li>After completing her undergraduate course Praeger was offered a scholarship to undertake research at the Australian National University but she was also offered a Commonwealth Scholarship to study at the University of Oxford in England.</li>
<li>At Oxford, Praeger was in St Anne's College and assigned Peter Neumann (son of Bernhard Neumann and Hanna Neumann) as a supervisor for her research.</li>
<li>At ANU Praeger lived at University House and there she met a statistics research student John Henstridge.</li>
<li>In 1982 Praeger was promoted to Senior Lecturer, then to Professor of Mathematics less than a year later.</li>
<li>Praeger has one of the most stunning publication records of any mathematician.</li>
<li>Examples of papers in which Praeger looked at groups acting on structures are Symmetric graphs and a characterization of the odd graphs (1980) which investigates graphs with large groups of automorphisms.</li>
<li>Another topic to which Praeger had made major contributions is Computational Group Theory.</li>
<li>Praeger was immediately interested and she began an important line of research which has made major contributions to Computational Group Theory.</li>
<li>One of Praeger's most popular lecture topics at a lower level is on mathematics and weaving.</li>
<li>Praeger has received many honours for her mathematical contributions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 September 1948, Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia.</p>
