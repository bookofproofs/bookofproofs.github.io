<p><strong>Gilbert Baumslag</strong> had a long career as one of the leading researchers on infinite group theory. In the last part of his career he used his skill in group theory applying it to cryptography.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gilbert was born in Johannesburg and attended schools in that city.</li>
<li>Ismail Mohamed was a student on the same course as Gilbert and he had taught himself group theory despite it not being part of the course at Wits.</li>
<li>He persuaded the university to put on an honours group theory course which Gilbert took.</li>
<li>We explain below how, in 1989, Gilbert supported efforts to free Ismail Mohamed from prison.</li>
<li>Baumslag was awarded a bachelor's degree by the University of the Witwatersrand in 1953 and he continued to study for a master's degree which he was awarded in 1955.</li>
<li>Baumslag was accepted by the University of Manchester to study for a Ph.D. and he sailed from Durban, South Africa, on the ship the Stirling Castle, arriving in Southampton, England, on 16 September 1955.</li>
<li>When Baumslag arrived in Manchester he was immediately introduced to a fellow Ph.D. student of B H Neumann, namely Jim Wiegold.</li>
<li>While Baumslag was undertaking research at Manchester, Joachim Neubüser spent a postdoctoral year 1957-58 there.</li>
<li>While studying at Manchester, Baumslag returned to South Africa in the summer of 1956, sailing from Southampton to Cape Town on the Carnarvon Castle on 7 June, returning on the ship the Capetown Castle from Cape Town to Southampton arriving on 5 October 1956.</li>
<li>We note that Baumslag's fellow postgraduate students Ian D Macdonald and Mike Newman graduated with  PhDs in 1960; Ian Macdonald with the thesis On Groups with Conditions like Finiteness of Conjugacy Classes and Mike Newman with the thesis On Groups All of Whose Proper Homomorphic Images are Nilpotent.</li>
<li>They were travelling to Princeton where Baumslag had been appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics.</li>
<li>After a year, Baumslag was promoted to associate professor.</li>
<li>Baumslag became an American citizen on 2 July 1980.</li>
<li>All accepted our invitation and Gilbert chose to give his course of four lectures on A survey of groups with a single defining relation.</li>
<li>Like Gilbert Baumslag, he studied at the University of the Witwatersrand, obtaining a B.Sc. and an M.Sc. He obtained a scholarship to study for a Ph.D. at the University of London which he was awarded in 1960.</li>
<li>Gilbert, however, told me about his attempts to help people who were being discriminated against.</li>
<li>In 1989 Baumslag organised a year long conference on combinatorial group theory at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California.</li>
<li>In 1991 Baumslag published the book Topics in combinatorial group theory.</li>
<li>The New York Group Theory Seminar was started by Wilhelm Magnus in around 1955 but after he retired in 1987 Baumslag took over running the seminar.</li>
<li>Later in his career, Baumslag became interested in the interaction between group theory and computer science.</li>
<li>Gilbert Baumslag's work on cryptography led to him publishing papers on the topic, the first three of which all appeared in 2006: Cryptosystems using linear groups; A proposed public key cryptosystem using the modular group; and Designing key transport protocols using combinatorial group theory.</li>
<li>The remaining two authors dedicate the paper to the memory of Gilbert and to all the work that he inspired.</li>
<li>In 1985, at Groups St Andrews, Gilbert Baumslag gave a short course on one-relator groups which provided a look at the subject up to that point.</li>
<li>We look at the solution by Wise of Baumslag's residual finiteness conjecture and discuss a new Baumslag conjecture on virtually free-by-cyclic groups.</li>
<li>We examine various amalgam decompositions of one-relator groups and the Baumslag-Shalen conjectures.</li>
<li>Another project Baumslag was working on at the time of his death was the book A course in mathematical cryptography co-authored with Ben Fine, Martin Kreuzer and Gerhard Rosenberger.</li>
<li>Gilbert was one of the foremost researchers in the world in infinite group theory and developed many computational techniques for finitely presented groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 30 April 1933, Johannesburg, South Africa. Died 20 October 2014, New York City, New York, USA.</p>
