<p><strong>Wang Yuan</strong> ass a Chinese mathematician best known for his contributions to the Goldbach conjecture.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His father, Wang Maoqing, was a county magistrate.</li>
<li>Wang Yuan spent the first seven years of his childhood in Lanhsi which at that time was in an area benefiting from modernization programs, but things changed in 1937 when war broke out between China and Japan.</li>
<li>This is where Wang Yuan's family moved in 1937, leaving Chekiang province before the Japanese occupied much of it which they did by 1938.</li>

<li>Wang Yuan enrolled in the National Second Middle School in Ho-ch'uan (also called Ho-yang, Hechuan, or Heyang), still in Szechwan province, However, in 1946 his family moved to Nanking (also called Nan-ching or Nanjing) the capital of Kiangsu province where he attended the middle school attached to the Social Education College.</li>
<li>Wang Yuan fell in love with analytic number theory and gave a series of lectures to the graduate seminar based on Ingham's book The distribution of prime numbers.</li>
<li>Wang Yuan graduated in 1952 and was assigned a position by the government in the Institute of Mathematics at the Academia Sinica in Nanking.</li>
<li>Chern had acted as director there from 1946 to 1949 but had returned to the United States three years before Wang Yuan started to work there.</li>
<li>Wang Yuan was assigned to the number theory section where he worked under Professor Hua Loo Keng, the director of the Institute.</li>
<li>Most of Wang Yuan's research has been in the area of number theory.</li>
<li>In 1957 Wang Yuan published four papers: On sieve methods and some of their applications; On some properties of integral valued polynomials; On the representation of large even number as a sum of two almost-primes; and On sieve methods and some of the related problems.</li>
<li>Wang Yuan continued to improve his results on the Goldbach conjecture.</li>
<li>Wang Yuan was harassed and put through critical interrogation.</li>
<li>In 1978  Wang Yuan was promoted to professor at the Institute of Mathematics at the Academia Sinica and elected to membership of the Academia Sinica in 1980.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 April 1930, Lanxi, Zhejiang province, China. Died 14 May 2021, Beijing, China.</p>
