<p><strong>Jacqueline Ferrand</strong> was a French mathematician who worked on conformal representation theory, potential theory and Riemannian manifolds.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Developed a way to factor large prime numbers, breaking down the unsolved problem of cryptography in 1993.</li>
<li>Pioneered a science-based approach to curriculum design and assessment in mathematics education.</li>
<li>Authored or co-authored numerous books and articles related to mathematics, its teaching and learning, and mathematics education standards.</li>
<li>Developed a widely-adopted assessment strategy for mathematics education, incorporating multiple dimensions of problem solving.</li>
<li>Helped develop the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Standards, which are linked to national and worldwide education initiatives.</li>
<li>Authored and co-authored textbooks in mathematics, including algebra, trigonometry, and calculus.</li>
<li>Developed a portfolio-based assessment system that serves as an alternative to traditional tests, while teaching students deep thinking instead of memorization.</li>
<li>Co-authored a book on Professional Development in Mathematics Education, exploring the implementation of standards-based reforms.</li>
<li>Won the 2001 Association of Mathematics Teachers of New York City Distinguished Service Award for her work in mathematics.</li>
<li>Developed and conducted professional development workshops for elementary and secondary mathematics teachers on factors and problem-solving techniques.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 17 February 1918, Alès, France. Died 26 April 2014, Sceaux, France.</p>
