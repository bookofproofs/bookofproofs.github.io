<h1>Person: Borok, Valentina Mikhailovna</h1>

<p><strong>Valentina Borok</strong> was a Ukranian mathematician who worked in partial differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Her father, Michail Borok, had a PhD in chemistry and was an expert in material science.</li>
<li>Because of her mother's position, Valentina had a (relatively) privileged early childhood.</li>
<li>From that time on, Valentina fully shared the hardships of the majority of the population of Ukraine, including the very difficult years of evacuation during World War II.</li>
<li>In 1949, on the advice of her high school teachers, Valentina decided to study mathematics and was admitted as a mathematics student to Kiev State University.</li>
<li>In her second year of undergraduate studies, Valentina (along with Yakov) started research under the supervision of Georgii Shilov, and quickly established herself as a serious scientist.</li>
<li>In 1954, Valentina graduated from Kiev University and moved (following G E Shilov) to the graduate school at Moscow State University, where she received a PhD in 1957 for a thesis On Systems of Linear Partial Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients.</li>
<li>From 1960 to 1994 Valentina Borok worked at Kharkov State University.</li>
<li>In the early 1960s Valentina worked on fundamental solutions and stability for partial differential equations well-posed in the sense of Petrovskii.</li>
<li>Valentina's work during that time was mostly joint with Yakov Zhitomirskii.</li>
<li>Starting in the late 1960s, Valentina began a series of papers that lay the foundations for the theory of local and non-local boundary value problems in infinite layers for systems of partial differential equations.</li>
<li>In the early 1970s Valentina Borok founded a school on the general theory of partial differential equations in Kharkov.</li>
<li>The work of Valentina Borok and her school on boundary value problems in layers forms an important chapter in the general theory of partial differential equations.</li>
<li>During her lifetime, Valentina published some 80 papers in top Russian and Ukrainian journals.</li>
<li>Valentina continued working with them informally and encouraging them to pursue their research.</li>
<li>Valentina was a true mother figure to all of her students, and was very much involved in, and always ready to help with, various aspects of their lives.</li>
<li>Valentina Mikhailovna was considered THE teacher of rigorous analysis in Kharkov State University.</li>
<li>Valentina Borok was a brilliant lecturer and an extremely dedicated teacher to her undergraduates.</li>
<li>In 1994, a grave illness forced Valentina to urgently retire and emigrate to Israel, as the necessary medical treatment was unavailable in Ukraine.</li>
<li>Valentina Borok was actively involved in raising and educating her five grandchildren at all stages of their growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 9 July 1931, Kharkov, Ukraine. Died 4 February 2004, Haifa, Israel.</p>
