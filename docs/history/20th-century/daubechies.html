<h1>Person: Daubechies, Ingrid</h1>

<p><strong>Ingrid Daubechies</strong> is a Belgium mathematician and physicist who has done important work on wavelets in image compression. She is on the Board of Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education, an organisation which helps women get advanced degrees in mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ingrid's father encouraged her to take an interest in science while she was studying at school.</li>
<li>After her school education in Belgium, Daubechies entered the Free University Brussels to read for a degree in physics.</li>
<li>Daubechies, however, is one of the few who progressed in the opposite direction, starting off by training in physics.</li>
<li>From the time that she was awarded a Bachelor's degree, Daubechies became a Research Assistant in the Department for Theoretical Physics at the Free University Brussels.</li>
<li>In 1981 Daubechies went to the United States, although she continued to hold her Research Assistant position at the Free University Brussels, spending two years there undertaking postdoctoral work.</li>
<li>In 1987 Daubechies returned to the United States to take up the post of Technical Staff Member at the Mathematics Research Center of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey.</li>
<li>In addition to the events we have mentioned, the year 1987 was an important one for Daubechies from a mathematical point of view.</li>
<li>In about 1985 Daubechies, in collaboration with Yves Meyer and Alex Grossmann, introduced a discrete approach which enabled functions to be reconstructed from a discrete set of values.</li>
<li>It was a breakthrough by Daubechies in 1987, when she constructed compactly supported continuous wavelets, which led to many important applications.</li>
<li>Although she still remained on the staff at the Bell Laboratories, Daubechies took leave to take university posts.</li>
<li>In January 1992 Daubechies gave a lecture Wavelets making waves in mathematics and engineering to a joint AMS-MAA meeting in Baltimore, Maryland.</li>
<li>In this video of Ingrid Daubechies' lecture on wavelets, the reverse is true.</li>
<li>Daubechies was a fellow of the John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation from 1992 to 1997 and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Science in 1993.</li>
<li>In the following year Daubechies left Bell Laboratories and took up her present position of Professor in the Mathematics Department and the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton University.</li>
<li>Daubechies was awarded an honorary degree by the Université Polytechnique Fédérale, Lausanne, Switzerland (2001), the Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France (2005), the Universita degli Studi di Genova, Genoa, Italy (2006), the Universiteit Hasselt, Belgium (2008) and Oxford University (2013).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 17 August 1954, Houthalen, Belgium.</p>
