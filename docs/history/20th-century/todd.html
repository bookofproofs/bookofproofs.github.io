<h1>Person: Todd, John Arthur</h1>

<p><strong>John Todd</strong> graduated from Cambridge and stayed on to do research under Baker. After a period at Manchester and Princeton he returned to Cambridge where he spent the rest of his career. He worked on invariant theory, group theory and canonical systems.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His mother was Agnes Todd (born in Bingley, Yorkshire about 1878).</li>
<li>John Todd was educated at Liverpool Collegiate School and, having sat the scholarship examination for Cambridge, he was awarded an entrance scholarship to Trinity College.</li>
<li>After graduation Todd remained at Trinity to study for his doctorate in geometry under H F Baker's supervision.</li>
<li>After an impressive prize winning record Todd hoped for a Research Fellowship at Trinity but he failed in three attempts, on one occasion losing out to Coxeter who won the Fellowship.</li>
<li>Disappointed at his failure to win the Fellowship, Todd left Cambridge and accepted Mordell's offer of an assistant lectureship at the University of Manchester in 1931.</li>
<li>An important year for Todd's mathematical development was the session 1933-34 which he spent at Princeton on a Rockefeller Scholarship.</li>
<li>Lefschetz proved the major influence on Todd during this year in the United States, and this broadened Todd's geometrical interests beyond the classical approach he had learnt under Baker.</li>
<li>In until 1937 Todd was appointed a lecturer at Cambridge.</li>
<li>Todd and Hodge began to change the geometry at Cambridge to areas that were then of great interest internationally.</li>
<li>Sadly, by the time peace had returned and progress could recommence, Todd was no longer a young reformer.</li>
<li>In 1948 Todd had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and, given his long association with Trinity College, it seemed inconceivable that he would not be elected a Fellow of the College.</li>
<li>Despite strong backing by mathematicians in the College, Todd failed to on a number of occasions to be elected.</li>
<li>By 1958 disillusioned with his treatment by Trinity, Todd went to Downing College.</li>
<li>Every well-equipped College should have a John Todd and we were privileged to have had him and to have enjoyed his company.</li>
<li>Todd was a superb technician and manipulator of formulae but he also brought to bear a keen appreciation of the underlying geometry.</li>
<li>Todd generalised the arithmetic genus and the invariants of the canonical system on an algebraic variety to a system of invariants of every codimension.</li>
<li>This work is the origin of the Todd genus and Todd polynomials which were named after him.</li>
<li>Todd polynomials, and certain other closely related polynomials, are much studied today and have played a major role in the study and classification of manifolds.</li>
<li>In group theory Todd provided, certainly according to Coxeter, the main contribution to their joint work on the Todd-Coxeter procedure which they published in 1936.</li>
<li>The Todd-Coxeter procedure became the most fundamental idea in the development of computational group theory yet the authors found difficulty in getting their paper published.</li>
<li>It was at a British Mathematical Colloquium (Todd attended the Colloquium for each one of its first 25 years) where Todd talked on Mathieu groups, a subject to which he made considerable contributions.</li>
<li>Some young research students in the audience heckled Todd, presumably they considered his mathematics old fashioned.</li>
<li>After Todd retired, to the surprise of his colleagues, he married.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 August 1908, Liverpool, England. Died 22 December 1994, Croydon, England.</p>
