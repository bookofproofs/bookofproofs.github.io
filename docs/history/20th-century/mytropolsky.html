<p><strong>Yurii Alekseevich Mitropolskiy</strong> was a Ukrainian mathematician known for his contributions to dynamical systems and nonlinear oscillations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The University was evacuated from Kiev before the German troops reached the city and Mitropolskii was sent to the front.</li>
<li>Kazakh Al-Farabi State University was very new when Mitropolskii studied there, the University being founded in 1934.</li>
<li>Mitropolskii graduated from the Kazakh University in 1942 after studying there for six months.</li>
<li>Mitropolskii retains vivid memories of wartime, and he still remembers his comrades in arms and even details of the army life quite well.</li>
<li>From 1951 Mitropolskii taught in the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics at Kiev University, where he was named as professor in 1954, and continued teaching there when made Director of the Institute of Mathematics in 1958.</li>
<li>Anatoly Samoilenko was a student of Mitropolskii's who obtained his Ph.D. in 1963.</li>
<li>Following this, he worked with Mitropolskii on many joint mathematical projects and, when Mitropolskii retired from the directorship of the Institute in 1988, Samoilenko took over the directorship.</li>
<li>In 1955 Mitropolskii and Bogolyubov published a monograph on asymptotic methods in nonlinear oscillations.</li>
<li>The method developed by the authors and presented in this and later editions of the monograph have come to be known as the KBM method (Krylov-Bogolyubov-Mitropolskii).</li>
<li>This book was the first of many books written by Mitropolskii, the majority co-authored with his former doctoral students.</li>
<li>This list of works will already have given the impression that Mitropolskii had many outstanding research students.</li>
<li>As remarkable is the fact that 500 students at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukraine obtained a Ph.D. during the years that Mitropolskii was the director.</li>
<li>Mitropolskii was elected to the Academy of Sciences of the Ukraine in 1961, to the Bologna Academy of Sciences (1971), and to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1984.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 January 1917, Charnyshivka, Shyshats'kyi, Poltava gubernia, Ukraine. Died 14 June 2008, Kyiv, Ukraine.</p>
