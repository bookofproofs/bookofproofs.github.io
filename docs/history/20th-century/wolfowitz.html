<h1>Person: Wolfowitz, Jacob</h1>

<p><strong>Jacob Wolfowitz</strong> worked on nonparametric statistical inference with Wald and also collaborated on sequential analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jacob attended High School in New York and, having graduated, entered the College of the City of New York.</li>
<li>While Wolfowitz was in the middle of his undergraduate course the Great Depression began.</li>
<li>When Wolfowitz graduated in 1931 there was little prospects of good employment so he spent the next ten years teaching mathematics in a number of different high schools while he worked towards his doctorate.</li>
<li>In 1934 Wolfowitz married Lillian Dundes; they had one daughter, born in 1941 and a son Paul, born in 1943.</li>
<li>Paul Wolfowitz became the Deputy Secretary of Defense (sic) for the USA in March 2001.</li>
<li>In fact the first paper which Wolfowitz wrote was a joint one with Wald.</li>
<li>Wolfowitz's earliest interest was nonparametric inference and the joint paper we just mentioned presents ways of calculating confidence intervals which are not necessarily of fixed width, on a distribution function FFF based on the empiric independent identically distributed observations on FFF.</li>
<li>It is in a paper by Wolfowitz in 1942 that the word 'nonparametric' appears for the first time.</li>
<li>Wolfowitz obtained his doctorate from New York University in 1942 and that year joined the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University.</li>
<li>Wald and Wolfowitz were both attached to the Statistical Research Group at Columbia and they led the research project to develop a theory for sequential analysis.</li>
<li>Wolfowitz produced work on sequential estimators of a Bernoulli parameter, and results on the efficiency of certain sequential estimators.</li>
<li>At the end of the war Wolfowitz left the Columbia research group and took up a position as associate professor at University of North Carolina.</li>
<li>We have mentioned Wolfowitz's work on nonparametric inference and his work on sequential analysis.</li>
<li>Wolfowitz looked at many aspects of the maximum likelihood method.</li>
<li>Information theory, which had been started by Shannon, was another area to which Wolfowitz made important contributions.</li>
<li>It contains the core of the ideas of Wolfowitz's papers and of research influenced by him, which already means that the main stream of present research in this theory is covered.</li>
<li>Wolfowitz received many honours for his outstanding contributions to statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 March 1910, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 16 July 1981, Tampa, Florida, USA.</p>
