<p><strong>Nathan Divinsky</strong> was a Canadian algebraist who was also enthusiastic about chess.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Divinsky won the Manitoba Chess Championship in 1946 and was awarded an M.S. from Chicago in 1947 after submitting a thesis Burnside's problem.</li>
<li>Albert, like Divinsky, had Russian parents, and was one of the leading experts on algebras.</li>
<li>It is not surprising, therefore, that Divinsky would write a thesis on algebras: he submitted his thesis Power-Associativity and Crossed Extension Algebras to the University of Chicago and was awarded his Ph.D. in 1950.</li>
<li>In 1959 Divinsky took over the magazine Canadian Chess Chat.</li>
<li>During the 1950s and 1960s Divinsky published papers on ring theory.</li>
<li>In 1964, Divinsky was professor of mathematics at the University of British Columbia when he met Kim Campbell who was awarded a bachelor's degree in political science from the university in that year.</li>
<li>Divinsky was still playing chess at the highest level at this time and represented Canada in the 1966 Chess Olympiad in Havana.</li>
<li>One friend, Fritz Bowers, says of Divinsky, "Tuzie's very reactionary and elitist.</li>
<li>If they want to do that, let them do that but to finance it and to spend the limited energy you have on some idiot Divinsky to get into grade 7 instead of quitting at grade 6 instead of doing something for a kid who has enormous talent and can contribute something to the world ...</li>
<li>After returning to Canada in 1973, Divinsky then spent a year in Oregon.</li>
<li>In 1979, in partnership with three others, Divinsky began the reconstruction of the Arrow Transfer warehouse on Granville Island, Vancouver, as the Bridges Restaurant.</li>
<li>In that same year Divinsky left the Vancouver School Board, which he had served on since 1974 having chairman from 1978 to 1980.</li>
<li>Divinsky and his wife were divorced in 1983 but Kim Campbell went on the have a highly successful political career becoming the first woman prime minister of Canada in 1993.</li>
<li>Although Divinsky continued to publish the occasional mathematics paper during the 1970s and 1980s, he began to apply mathematical techniques to a study of the strength of various chess champions.</li>
<li>Before this book was published, however, Divinsky had become a celebrity on British television.</li>
<li>In the early 1980s, Divinsky visited the University of St Andrews, Scotland, and addressed our Pure Mathematics Seminar.</li>
<li>Divinsky, however, seemed to have frequent contact with Fischer and described his mental state in detail.</li>
<li>Finally, let us record that Divinsky married for a third time; he was survived by his wife Marilyn Goldstone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 October 1925, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Died 17 June 2012, Vancouver, Canada View two larger pictures.</p>
