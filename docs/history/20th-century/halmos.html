<p><strong>Paul Halmos</strong> was a Hungarian-American mathematician who made fundamental advances in the areas of logic, probability, statistics, operator theory and functional analysis. He is best known for some of his text-books and for his collection of mathematicians' photographs.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sándor and Paula were married in 1903 and they had three children, George (born about 1909), John (born about 1911) and Paul (the subject of this biography).</li>
<li>Paul's mother, Paula, died when Paul was six months old.</li>
<li>Paul's father was a successful physician in Budapest who had the rather remarkable foresight to realise the problems that were going to befall Europe.</li>
<li>So in 1924 Paul's father emigrated to the United States, leaving Paul and his two elder brothers in Budapest.</li>
<li>In the United States, Sándor Halmos worked for a year as an intern in a hospital in Omaha before moving to Chicago where he set up his own practice.</li>
<li>After five years in the United States, Paul's father, known in America as Alexander Charles Halmos, became a naturalised American citizen and, at that time, brought Paul from Hungary to join him in Chicago.</li>
<li>The information that Paul came to the United States in 1929 after his father became an American citizen comes from his own account of his life but the 1930 Census states that Paul Halmos emigrated to the United States in 1924.</li>
<li>Somewhat more puzzling is the fact that the 1930 Census form gives N/A (not available) for the year in which Paul's two older brothers entered the United States.</li>
<li>According to Paul they came to join their father before he did.</li>
<li>Once Alexander Halmos had established himself in Chicago he had remarried.</li>
<li>At the time of the 1930 Census, the family was living in Fullerton Avenue, Chicago, Cook, Illinois in a house that Alexander Halmos owned.</li>
<li>They had two servants, Paul Tschampel, born in Germany around 1898, and his wife Tillie Tschampel, born around 1902 in what later became Czechoslovakia.</li>
<li>Paul Halmos attended school in Budapest up to the age of thirteen.</li>
<li>Halmos says that there was some confusion since in Hungary four years of primary schooling were followed by eight years of secondary schooling.</li>
<li>It was not until the end of the academic year 1935-36 that Halmos made the move from philosophy to mathematics.</li>
<li>In February 1939 Halmos was successful in obtaining a post at Reed College in Oregon.</li>
<li>After six months Halmos was offered a fellowship, and in his second year at Princeton he became von Neumann's assistant.</li>
<li>They wrote one joint paper while Halmos was his assistant.</li>
<li>A debt that Halmos owes to von Neumann is that one of his lecture courses inspired Halmos's first book.</li>
<li>In 1942 Halmos published Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces which was to bring him instant fame as an outstanding writer of mathematics.</li>
<li>After leaving the Institute for Advanced Study, Halmos was appointed to Syracuse University, New York.</li>
<li>In the summer of 1955 the University of Chicago held a functional analysis meeting with George Mackey, Irving Segal, Irving Kaplansky and Paul Halmos as lecturers.</li>
<li>Any picture of Paul that omits Ginger is grossly incomplete.</li>
<li>In the first place, she's crucial to keeping the entropy of the Halmos household improbably small and in keeping Paul and the cats hale and hearty.</li>
<li>She's the ecological Halmos who fishes floundering lizards from the pool and worries about wetlands.</li>
<li>Paul frequently, and not without cause, frets about her safety.</li>
<li>In 1965 Halmos was one of three plenary speakers at the British Mathematical Colloquium in Dundee, Scotland (the other two were Claude Chevalley and Arthur Erdélyi).</li>
<li>Halmos gave the lecture Some recent progress in Hilbert space.</li>
<li>Halmos is known for both his outstanding contributions to operator theory, ergodic theory, functional analysis, in particular Hilbert spaces, and for his series of exceptionally well written textbooks.</li>
<li>Halmos has received many other awards for his writing and teaching.</li>
<li>Paul has a number of papers and theorems that anyone would be proud to call his own.</li>
<li>Over the years Paul has demonstrated an uncanny ability to extract crucial properties from a given mathematical entity and lay it open before his colleagues in such a manner that there is a universal inclination to look and explore further.</li>
<li>Halmos was a frequent visitor to Scotland.</li>
<li>Halmos spent part of his 1973 sabbatical leave in Edinburgh and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</li>
<li>Together with his wife, Halmos contributed $4,000,000 for the rebuilding of the Carriage House Conference Center in Washington D.C. in 2002.</li>
<li>He donated funds to support the Mathematical Association of America's Euler Prize and its Halmos-Ford Prize for expository writing.</li>
<li>Paul and Virginia Halmos also donated funds to the American Mathematical Society to set up a J L Doob Prize for outstanding expository mathematical writing.</li>
<li>Halmos died in Los Gatos, California at the age of ninety after contracting pneumonia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 March 1916, Budapest, Hungary. Died 2 October 2006, Los Gatos, California, USA.</p>
