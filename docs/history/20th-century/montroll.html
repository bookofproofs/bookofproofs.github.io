<p><strong>Elliott Montroll</strong> was an American scientist and mathematician who worked in a variety of applied mathematical and statistical areas.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adolph was an artist who dealt in furs and together with his wife Esther provided a loving home in which Elliott grew up.</li>
<li>They taught Elliott to read and write before he entered school for the first time at the age of five.</li>
<li>It was clear that given his passion for chemistry that was the subject Montroll would study at university.</li>
<li>Montroll was now in the unusual position of being able to work in mathematics, physics or chemistry departments.</li>
<li>During 1942-43 Montroll was an instructor in physics at Princeton University and in 1943 he married Shirley Abrams; they had ten children, five boys and five girls.</li>
<li>In 1943 Montroll was appointed as Head of the Mathematics Research Group at the Kellex Corporation in New York.</li>
<li>During his time at Maryland, Montroll published Topics in statistical mechanics of interacting particles  which was 86 pages of mimeographed notes of a lecture series, written jointly with G F Newell.</li>
<li>At the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability 1954-1955, Montroll gave a paper Theory of the vibration of simple cubic lattices with nearest neighbor interactions  in which described vibrations of a cubic lattice with 1, 2, 3, and nnn dimensions where nnn is large.</li>
<li>Montroll was not someone who was happy to remain in one place for a long time and by 1960, having been at the University of Maryland for nine years, he felt it was time to move on.</li>
<li>Montroll's work led to him receiving many honours and prizes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 May 1916, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 3 December 1983, Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA.</p>
