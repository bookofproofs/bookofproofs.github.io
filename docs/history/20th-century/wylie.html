<p><strong>Shaun Wylie</strong> was a British mathematician who made important contributions to code-breaking in World War II. He wrote an important text-book on algebraic topology.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shaun was the youngest of his parents' sons.</li>
<li>Shaun was brought up in Oxford in a home often filled by American scholars who were Rhodes Scholars at the University of Oxford.</li>
<li>(One of the founders was a Mr George and this led to the name 'Dragon School'.) From the Dragon School, Wylie won a scholarship to Winchester College, one of the best independent schools in England.</li>
<li>The school is situated in Winchester, south west of London, and there Wylie received an outstanding secondary education.</li>
<li>Wylie, however, loved mathematics and the College arranged it so that he could study both subjects.</li>
<li>Wylie was able to offer both classics and mathematics for the scholarship examinations.</li>
<li>Wylie was awarded a Ph.D. in 1937 for his thesis Duality and Intersection in General Complexes.</li>
<li>For the year 1937-38 Wylie undertook post-doctoral research at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.</li>
<li>At Princeton, Wylie had met a fellow British student Alan Turing who was there during 1936-38.</li>
<li>In December 1940 he wrote to Wylie and invited him to work at Bletchley Park.</li>
<li>In February 1941 Wylie began to work with Turing in Hut 8 on the problem of decoding the German Enigma device.</li>
<li>except for Turing, no one made a bigger contribution to the success of Hut 8 than Wylie; he was easily the best all-rounder in the section, astonishingly quick and resourceful.</li>
<li>In late 1943 Wylie moved from work on decoding the German Navy Enigma messages to attacking the more demanding messages sent by Lorenz machines.</li>
<li>Wylie joined the section in F Block which had been built close to Hut 11 in early 1943.</li>
<li>When the war ended Wylie took up his academic career again.</li>
<li>Mathematics is not perhaps the most hilarious of subjects, but in Shaun's hands - and voice - it was pretty close.</li>
<li>In 1958 Wylie returned to intelligence work when he took up an appointment as chief mathematician at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham.</li>
<li>But we should mention a few of Wylie's other interests.</li>
<li>Wylie was an expert setter of crosswords and he set the crosswords in the Listener for many years.</li>
<li>He used the nom-de-plume of Petti and the reader would need to have abilities like those of Wylie to even understand why.</li>
<li>There is an old (15th  century) Scottish word wyliecoat which means a petticoat (an underskirt worn by women).</li>
<li>Now the link Wylie - wyliecoat - petticoat - Petti become clear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 17 January 1913, Oxford, England. Died 2 October 2009, Cambridge, England.</p>
