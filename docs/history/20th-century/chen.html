<p><strong>Kuo-Tsai Chen</strong> was a Chinese-born mathematician who worked in algebraic topology and analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chen graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1946.</li>
<li>Chen moved to Shanghai where he was employed as an assistant at the Mathematics institute of the Academia Sinica.</li>
<li>After working at the Academia Sinica for one year, Chen was advised to go to the United States to gain a doctorate.</li>
<li>However Eilenberg had accepted an appointment at Columbia University in New York so Chen followed his supervisor there.</li>
<li>Chen supported himself by taking two appointments while in New York, the first appointment was as a mathematics instructor at the National Bible Institute which he held from 1948 to 1950.</li>
<li>In the first course he gave in Hong Kong, Chester Chen, as he had become known, met a charming sophomore, Julia Tse-Yee Fong, who became his bride in 1953.</li>
<li>After leaving Hong Kong in 1958, Chen went to Brazil where he was appointed as an Associate Professor at the Instituto Tecnologico de Aeronautica in São Jose dos Campos.</li>
<li>His work is intimately related to the theory of minimal models as developed by Dennis Sullivan, whose own work was in part inspired by the research of Chen.</li>
<li>An outstanding and original mathematician, Chen's work falls naturally into three periods: his early work on group theory and links in the three sphere; his subsequent work on formal differential equations, which gradually developed into his most powerful and important work; and his work on iterated integrals and homotopy theory, which occupied him for the last twenty years of his life.</li>
<li>The goal of Chen's iterated integrals program, which is a de Rham theory for path spaces, was to study the interaction of topology and analysis through path integration.</li>
<li>Chen was advisor to six doctoral students at the University of Illinois and these graduated between 1970 and 1980.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 July 1923, Chekiang (now Zhejiang), China. Died August 1987, Urbana, USA.</p>
