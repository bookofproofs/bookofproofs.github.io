<p><strong>Jean-Pierre Kahane</strong> was a French mathematician who specialised in harmonic analysis , chaos theory and Brownian motion.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ernest Kahane was born in Piatra Neamt, Romania, and became a university professor of biochemistry in France.</li>
<li>Ernest Kahane was the son of Albert Kahane (1872-1963) and Pépi Struhl (1879-1948).</li>
<li>Jean-Pierre was the oldest of his parents three children, all sons.</li>
<li>His two brothers were André Bernard Kahan (1929-) and Roger Kahane (1932-2013).</li>
<li>Let us record here the following information about Jean-Pierre's brothers.</li>
<li>He is a member of the French Communist Party and a leading player of the game Go. Roger Kahane, born 20 December 1932 in Bois-Colombes, studied science but turned to film studies.</li>
<li>Kahane attended the Lycée Henry-IV in the Latin Quarter on the left bank of the river Seine in Paris.</li>
<li>On his 15th birthday, 11 December 1941, Kahane was arrested at his parents' home in a raid by German soldiers.</li>
<li>Kahane was taken to the Royallieu-Compiègne internment camp where Jews and communists were housed, separated by barbed wire.</li>
<li>One might have expected this to lead to serious consequences for Kahane but, perhaps because of his young age, he was released on 18 December.</li>
<li>In 1946, Kahane entered the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) and later that year he joined the branch of the Communist Party at the ENS.</li>
<li>We note that in fact the organisation only adopted this name in 1956 and, when Kahane joined, it was the Union de la jeunesse républicaine de France (UJRF).</li>
<li>Kahane performed exceptionally well in his mathematical studies and graduated in 1949 ranked first in the mathematics aggregation.</li>
<li>Kahane joined the Syndicat National de l'Ensignement Secondaire (SNES) in 1947.</li>
<li>On 11 July 1951, Kahane married Agnès Kaczander (1927-2014), the daughter of the engineer Maxime Kaczander of Hungarian origin, who was a communist student.</li>
<li>Jean-Pierre and Agnès Kahane had three daughters, Geneviève (born 1953), Françoise (born 1955) and Catherine (born 1960).</li>
<li>In 1954 Kahane submitted his thèse de doctorat, Sur quelques problèmes d'unicité et de prolongement, relatifs aux fonctions approchables par des sommes d'exponentielles Ⓣ(On some problems of uniqueness and extension, relating to functions approachable by sums of exponentials), to the Faculty of Science in Paris.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate, Kahane was appointed as an assistant lecturer at the Faculty of Sciences of Montpellier, being promoted to professor in 1958.</li>
<li>When he went to Montpellier, he accompanied his father Ernest Kahane who had been appointed to set up the teaching of biological chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences there.</li>
<li>Both Ernest and Jean-Pierre Kahane had common commitments: both were members of the French Communist Party.</li>
<li>They were also members of the "Franco-Chinese Friendships" and the Rationalist Union of Montpellier which was chaired by Ernest Kahane.</li>
<li>Jean-Pierre Kahane travelled in Eastern Europe during the period of the Cold War, visiting Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Romania.</li>
<li>Kahane was a strong supporter and attended Audin's in abstentia defence.</li>
<li>In 1961, the Communist Federation of Herault created a "New University" in Montpellier, housed Rue des Étuves, presided over by Jacques Roux, and which began with 110 communist sympathisers including Kahane and his father.</li>
<li>Kahane, however, was about to leave Montpellier for, in 1961, he was appointed Professor at the Faculty of Sciences of Paris Sud at Orsay.</li>
<li>On 29 July 1961 Kahane flew from Paris to New York, USA, to spend four weeks at Stanford University departng on 26 August.</li>
<li>Michel Chaillou, the Secretary General, invited Kahane to join the office of the union and Kahane served as the next General Secretary 1961-62 and again 1963-64.</li>
<li>MathSciNew lists nearly 300 publications by Kahane.</li>
<li>Kahane was a member of the Organising Committee of this Congress.</li>
<li>But Jean-Pierre Kahane will also remain an outstanding character for his action in the service of the community and his political commitment to "change the world" as he said himself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 December 1926, Paris, France. Died 21 June 2017, Paris, France.</p>
