<p><strong>Gamal Ismail</strong> is an Egyptian mathematician who became Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University College of Women for Art, Science and Education at Ain Shams University in Cairo in 1995.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After being awarded a Master of Science Degree, Ismail was appointed as an assistant lecturer in mathematics at Ain Shams University in 1976.</li>
<li>Ismail was awarded a Ph.D. in 1985 for her thesis Accuracy of the multi-step methods for solving differential equations.</li>
<li>No papers by Ismail appear to have been published for ten years after the award of her thesis, but in 1995 she was promoted to associate professor and appointed as manager of the Computer Unit at the Women's College of Ain Shams University.</li>
<li>Further papers by Ismail followed: A new higher order effective P-C methods for stiff systems (1998); Stability of nonequidistant variable order multistep methods for stiff systems (2000); A numerical technique for the 3-D Poisson equation (2003), Efficient numerical solution of 3D incompressible viscous Navier-Stokes equations (2004) and A new approach to construct linear multistep formulae for solving stiff ODEs (2005).</li>
<li>Also in 2005 Ismail published Modified technique for solving advance-delay differential systems in the journal Mathematical and computer modelling.</li>
<li>After this unfortunate publication, sadly Ismail does not appear to have published any further papers.</li>
<li>Let us end this biography by noting that Ismail is a member of the Egyptian Mathematics Society and gives her other interests as reading, listening to music, tennis and travel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 October 1950, Zagazig, El Sharkia, Egypt.</p>
