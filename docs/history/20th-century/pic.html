<p><strong>Gheorghe Pic</strong> was a Czech mathematician who worked in algebra.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gheorghe attended both primary and secondary school in Blaj, about 40 km west of Medias.</li>
<li>Cluj (known also by its German name, Klausenburg, and its Hungarian name, Kolozsvár) had, with the rest of Transylvania, been incorporated into Romania in 1919, just five years before Pic went to study there.</li>
<li>(The Hungarian university in Cluj moved first to Budapest, then to Szeged.) Pic obtained his first degree in 1928 from the Romanian King Ferdinand University of Cluj, then continued to study for his 'capability examination' (essentially equivalent to a Master's degree) in mathematics and physics in 1930.</li>
<li>Following this Pic went to Rome to study for his doctorate.</li>
<li>After returning to Romania after his two years of studying in Rome, Pic had to do his military service.</li>
<li>Pic remained at the university in Cluj until 1952.</li>
<li>Pic went to Bucharest in 1952 where he worked in the Institute of Civil Engineering, which was headed by N Teodorescu, and also in the Department of Algebra at the University of Bucharest, which was headed by Grigore Moisil.</li>
<li>Pic headed the Department of Mathematics at Babeș-Bolyai University until his death in 1984.</li>
<li>The influence of Pic on the University of Cluj was very marked.</li>
<li>Finally let us look at the algebra textbook Treatise on modern algebra  which Pic published in Romanian in 1977, written jointly with Ioan Purdea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 March 1907, Czakova ?, Upper Silesia (now Czech Republic). Died 23 September 1984, Cluj, Romania.</p>
