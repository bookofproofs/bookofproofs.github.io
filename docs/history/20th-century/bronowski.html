<p><strong>Jacob Bronowski</strong> was a Polish-born mathematician and historian. He is best known for developing a humanistic approach to science. He made frequent TV appearances.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Things were not easy for Bruno, as Bronowski was known, when he arrived in England since he spoke no English.</li>
<li>Bronowski won a mathematics scholarship to Jesus College, Cambridge, and there he began his mathematical studies.</li>
<li>However at Cambridge Bronowski's interests were much wider than mathematics and he continued with his love of literature editing a literary magazine Experiment with another mathematics student.</li>
<li>Bronowski worked on a poetry project with Laura Riding but the two fell out.</li>
<li>Bronowski then returned to Cambridge where he received his doctorate in mathematics for a thesis which looked at problems in geometry and topology.</li>
<li>Bronowski went to Japan in 1945 with the British Chiefs of Staff Mission to study the effects of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki.</li>
<li>After this visit Bronowski wrote his famous report The Effects of Atomic Bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</li>
<li>After his war work ended Bronowski did not return to being a mathematics lecturer.</li>
<li>He headed the research into smokeless fuels and one early form of such fuel was called "Bronowski's Bricks".</li>
<li>The 1950s saw a change in Bronowski's interests.</li>
<li>It was because of Bronowski's skills as a mathematician that he was approached to look at a problem in palaeontology.</li>
<li>About the same time Bronowski began his career as a broadcaster, perhaps the part of his life for which he is most widely remembered.</li>
<li>from which the great debate on 'two cultures' sprang - one in which Bronowski never accepted the idea of a separation between the scientific and the humanistic aspirations of man.</li>
<li>Through his new interests in biology, Bronowski became involved in the setting up of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies at La Jolla, near San Diego, California.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 January 1908, Łódź, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 22 August 1974, East Hampton, New York, USA.</p>
