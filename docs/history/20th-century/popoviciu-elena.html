<h1>Person: Popoviciu (2), Elena Moldovan</h1>
<p><img alt="Popoviciu_Elena.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Popoviciu_Elena.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Elena Popoviciu</strong> was a Romanian mathematician who worked in functional analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>She wrote papers both under the name of Elena Moldovan and the name Elena Popoviciu.</li>
<li>We will use both the names Elena Moldovan and Elena Popoviciu throughout this biography, trying our best to use the correct name for the time to which we refer.</li>
<li>After graduating from high school, Elena began her studies at the University of Cluj.</li>
<li>It was the Babeș University of Cluj that Elena Moldovan entered and she was awarded a bachelor's degree in mathematics in the summer of 1947.</li>
<li>Elena Moldovan studied for a Ph.D. in Mathematics.</li>
<li>She began research advised by the academician Grigore Calugăreănu but, after a while, fascinated by the remarkable personality of Tiberiu Popoviciu, her research topic moved to convex function theory and interpolation function theory.</li>
<li>From that time on her research was supervised by the academician Tiberiu Popoviciu.</li>
<li>As a mathematical concept, Elena Popoviciu used the term 'behaviour' for the first time in 1965, on the occasion of a conference held at the Babeș-Bolyai University of Cluj, without publishing it.</li>
<li>The entire didactical activity of Elena Popoviciu took place at the Faculty of Mathematics of the University of Cluj.</li>
<li>From 1969, Elena Popoviciu was appointed a full professor in the Mathematical Analysis Chair of the Babeș-Bolyai University of Cluj.</li>
<li>Starting with 1974, Elena Popoviciu became a Ph.D. supervisor and, in total throughout her career, she supervised 23 doctoral students.</li>
<li>Elena Popoviciu founded, in 1960, the research Seminar on Best Approximation and Mathematical Programming and, in 1974, the Interdisciplinary Research Laboratory.</li>
<li>Elena Popoviciu, a mathematician with broad national and international recognition.</li>
<li>Elena Popoviciu was one of the main contributors to the school of Mathematical Analysis in Cluj, mentor to many generations of students and PhD coordinator.</li>
<li>For many years she directed the Seminar "Tiberiu Popoviciu" on Functional Equations, Approximation and Convexity.</li>
<li>Elena Popoviciu was also very much involved in the editorial work of the following journals: Revue d'Analyse Numérique et de Théorie de l'Approximation and Annals of the Tiberiu Popoviciu Seminar of Functional Equations, Approximation and Convexity.</li>
<li>Five years later, on 30 September 2004, a Scientific Session was organised at the Babeș-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca to celebrate Elena Popoviciu's eightieth birthday.</li>
<li>In 1992 she wrote Hommage à l'occasion d'un important anniversaire Ⓣ(Tribute to an important anniversary) in which she discussed some results about convexity obtained by Tiberiu Popoviciu and his students.</li>
<li>Elena Popoviciu died in June 2009 at Cluj-Napoca.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 26 August 1924, Cluj, Romania. Died 24 June 2009, Cluj, Romania.</p>
