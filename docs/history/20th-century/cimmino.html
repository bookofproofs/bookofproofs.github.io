<h1>Person: Cimmino, Gianfranco Luigi Giuseppe</h1>

<p><strong>Gianfranco Cimmino</strong>  was an Italian mathematician who worked in mathematical analysis, numerical analysis and the theory of elliptic partial differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gianfranco's mother Olimpia was from an aristocratic family, the Gibellini Tornielli Boniperti, from Novara in the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy.</li>
<li>Gianfranco, born on Thursday 12 March 1908, was baptized with the name of Gianfranco Luigi Giuseppe but only used the given name Gianfranco.</li>
<li>In 1923, when Cimmino was fifteen years old, he graduated from high school with the classical certificate.</li>
<li>Cimmino was only nineteen years old when he graduated with his thesis on approximate methods of solution for the heat equation in 2-dimensions, but he was appointed as an assistant to Picone who held the chair of analytical geometry at the University of Naples.</li>
<li>In Naples, Cimmino was a member of an impressive team led by Picone.</li>
<li>Picone left Naples in 1932, together with Miranda, but Cimmino remained there until 1938.</li>
<li>After Picone left, Cimmino became a lecturer in charge of the courses of Higher Analysis between 1932 and 1935.</li>
<li>In particular, Cimmino was the first mathematician to study the Dirichlet problem with generalized boundary conditions.</li>
<li>While in Naples, Cimmino entered the competition for the chair of Mathematical Analysis at the University of Cagliari, in Sardinia.</li>
<li>Now, also in 1940, various members of the family adopted the name Cimmino Gibellini Tornielli Boniperti, combining his father's surname with his mother's family name.</li>
<li>We have seen that Cimmino made contributions to partial differential equations of elliptic type and to computing approximate solutions to systems of linear equations.</li>
<li>Indeed, one of his last reviews for the 'Zentralblatt', appeared in 1988, concerned a paper on the use of Cimmino's method in radiation therapy planning.</li>
<li>The story of Cimmino's method is interesting for several reasons.</li>
<li>It is also interesting to observe that Cimmino's impact on his main research area, the theory of partial differential equations, while non-negligible, has not been as great and as lasting as his work in numerical mathematics.</li>
<li>The reasons for this are complex, but may be due at least in part to the state of relative isolation in which Cimmino (as well as other members of the Neapolitan mathematical school) conducted his research, publishing his most important papers in Italian and in journals of rather limited circulation.</li>
<li>Cimmino published seven books, most of which were based on notes from his lecture courses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 12 March 1908, Naples, Italy. Died 30 May 1989, Bologna, Italy.</p>
