<p><strong>Jack Kiefer</strong> was an American mathematical statistician who worked in the optimal design of experiments and other topics in mathematical statistics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After a break of three years he returned to MIT in the spring of 1946 but it was not clear at this stage in which area Kiefer wanted to make a career.</li>
<li>The theatre was one of Kiefer's passions and he had the opportunity at MIT to become involved in writing, directing and producing plays.</li>
<li>By the way, Jack was really torn between show biz and statistics.</li>
<li>After graduating Kiefer attended a summer school at Berkeley where courses of lectures were given by Michel Loève and Abraham Wald.</li>
<li>Kiefer moved to Cornell as an instructor in the Department of Mathematics and continued working for his doctorate with Wolfowitz.</li>
<li>After Kiefer was awarded his doctorate in 1952 he was promoted at Cornell from an instructor to as assistant professor.</li>
<li>Jack aspired at one time to become a proficient pianist.</li>
<li>In July 1973 Kiefer was elected the first Horace White Professor at Cornell University, a position he held until 1979 when he retired and joined the faculty at the University of California at Berkeley.</li>
<li>Kiefer's main research area was the optimal design of experiments, and about half his 100 publications dealt with that topic.</li>
<li>A paper Sequential minimax search for a maximum which Kiefer published in the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society in 1953 was based on his master's thesis.</li>
<li>Let us note a few other examples of Kiefer's work.</li>
<li>In this paper Kiefer generalised the notions of a balanced incomplete block design and a Youden square, to the balanced block design and generalized Youden square.</li>
<li>Another important paper Optimum designs in regression problems, which Kiefer wrote in collaboration with Wolfowitz, appeared in 1959.</li>
<li>In 1980 Kiefer went to China as part of Berkeley's China Exchange Program.</li>
<li>Kiefer received many honours.</li>
<li>Jack was unbelievably humble, especially for a man of his stature.</li>
<li>Jack was very critical.</li>
<li>Kiefer's suffered for many years from an arthritic hip condition which by 1971 saw him severely disabled.</li>
<li>Jack's friends at Cornell felt similarly.</li>
<li>In 1987, six years after his death, Kiefer's Introduction to statistical inference was published.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25, Jan 1924, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Died 10, Aug 1981, Berkeley, California, USA.</p>
