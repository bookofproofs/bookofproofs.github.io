<h1>Person: Garnir, Henri Georges</h1>
<p><img alt="Garnir.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Garnir.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Henri Garnir</strong> was a Belgian mathematician whose fields of research were broad, including algebra and mathematical analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It was in Seraing that Garnir attended high school.</li>
<li>Garnir obtained his bachelor's degree in physical science in 1943 and a bachelor's degree in mathematical science in the following year.</li>
<li>Florent J Bureau supervised Garnir's studies for this mathematics degree and he continued to supervise Garnir's doctoral studies, most of which were carried out after Belgium had been freed by the Allies.</li>
<li>Garnir published a number of papers relating to his research during this period.</li>
<li>In 1946 Garnir published four articles: Sur la détermination des matrices satisfaisant à un système de relations de la théorie du méson Ⓣ(On the determination of matrices satisfying a system of relations in the theory of mesons); (with J Toussaint) Sur la théorie des valences dirigées Ⓣ(On the theory of directed valences); and the two-part article Une question de théorie des groupes et son application à un problème de vibrations posé par la chimie théorique Ⓣ(Group theory and its application to a vibration problem posed by theoretical chemistry).</li>
<li>In 1948 Garnir married Noëlly Pierre who was a school teacher; they had two children, Dominique (who became a medical doctor) and Henri-Pierre (who became a university lecturer in physics).</li>
<li>In year following his marriage, Garnir spent four months undertaking research in Paris.</li>
<li>Garnir was made Chef de travaux at Liège in 1950.</li>
<li>As the above quote indicates, Garnir's research interests did not remain in the area of applications of group theory.</li>
<li>Garnir's research in this area had been strongly influenced by his visit to Laurent Schwartz in Paris.</li>
<li>In the later part of his career, Garnir became interested in the propagation of singularities of solutions of boundary value problems for evolution partial differential equations.</li>
<li>Mention of the later part of Garnir's career means that we should indicate how his career developed at the University of Liège.</li>
<li>With M De Wilde and J Schmets, Garnir published the three-volume text Analyse fonctionnelle Ⓣ(Functional Analysis).</li>
<li>Essentially, Garnir was a man whose charisma, stability and true goodness were immensely beneficial to all who had the luck to have known him.</li>
<li>Garnir was in good health and in the middle of many mathematical projects when he was struck by a heart attack from which he died.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 13 September 1921, Jemeppe sur Meuse, near Liège, Belgium. Died 18 November 1985, Liège, Belgium.</p>
