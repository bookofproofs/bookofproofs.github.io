<p><strong>Doris Schattschneider</strong> is an American mathematician who became professor of mathematics at the Moravian College. She was the first female editor of <em>Mathematics Magazine</em> and won many awards for her excellence in expository writing.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In this biography we will call her Doris up to the time of her marriage and  Schattschneider from that time onwards.</li>
<li>It was there that Doris began her schooling which she enjoyed.</li>
<li>Doris attended Public School 41 and New Dorp High School in New Dorp, Staten Island.</li>
<li>The examinations covered core subjects, one of which was mathematics, and it was mathematics that Doris helped her friends to score well in.</li>
<li>After graduating from the University of Rochester, Doris Schattschneider studied at Yale University.</li>
<li>Schattschneider spent a year teaching at Northwestern University, in Evanston, Illinois and then taught for three years at University of Illinois's Chicago Circle campus, before being appointed to Moravian College, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the autumn of 1968.</li>
<li>Doris Schattschneider taught at Moravian College for the rest of her career.</li>
<li>Doris was interested in both geometry and art and this led naturally to the study of tiling problems and the work of the Dutch artist M C Escher.</li>
<li>We gain further insight into Schattschneider's work by looking at reviews of her books.</li>
<li>Schattschneider attended many conferences on topics related to her interests and, not surprisingly, she attended the Escher Centennial Congress in June 1998.</li>
<li>Doris thought that it was rare to find Arabic mosaics or motifs in Ravello.</li>
<li>Let us mention one other conference that Schattschneider attended, namely "Renaissance Banff: Mathematics, Music, Art, Culture" held 30 July to 3 August, 2005, in Banff, Canada.</li>
<li>Schattschneider wrote an article 'Math and Art in the Mountains' for the Mathematical Intelligencer 28 (3) (2006) describing the conference, summarising the talks given at it, as well as describing the conference outings.</li>
<li>This piece clearly shows Schattschneider's love of travel and her love of walking in mountains.</li>
<li>"Doris is well-respected and highly effective in the classroom," states the award nomination, "In a recent evaluation of all professors at Moravian, conducted by students and published in the campus newspaper, Doris scored an overall score of 3.66 out of 4.0, one of the highest on campus.</li>
<li>In 1993 the Board of Governors of the Mathematical Association of America renamed the award to honour Deborah and Franklin Tepper Haimo and in that year made the award to Doris W Schattschneider, Moravian College.</li>
<li>It was not only for teaching that Schattschneider received awards; she also received awards for her papers.</li>
<li>It was Schattschneider's article Tiling the plane with congruent pentagons (1978) for which she received the award.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 October 1939, Staten Island, New York City, New York, USA.</p>
