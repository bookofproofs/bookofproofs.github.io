<p><strong>Charles Fefferman</strong> is an American mathematician who won a Fields Medal for work on partial differential equations and Fourier analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Arthur Fefferman was born in Brooklyn, New York, and was awarded a Master's Degree in economics from Columbia University in 1941.</li>
<li>Arthur Fefferman studied for a doctorate in economics which he was awarded in 1950 from the New School for Social Research (now New School University).</li>
<li>Arthur Fefferman had enjoyed and excelled in mathematics at high school but had been told that it was not necessary for an economist and had not taken even a calculus course at university.</li>
<li>He got a phone call from the Feffermans.</li>
<li>So Mrs Fefferman drove Charlie from Silver Spring to College Park in their trusty Dodge.</li>
<li>Charles was soon making a remarkable impression at the University of Maryland.</li>
<li>After two weeks in John Horvath's calculus class it was clear that the material was far too elementary for Fefferman and he was put into John Brace's honours calculus course.</li>
<li>At the University of Maryland, Fefferman took lots of mathematics and physics courses.</li>
<li>Fefferman realised that he was receiving very special treatment with so many of the professors giving him personal tuition.</li>
<li>After graduating from the University of Maryland, Fefferman undertook postgraduate work at Princeton University supervised by Elias Stein.</li>
<li>While a graduate student at Princeton, Fefferman did have interests outside mathematics.</li>
<li>It is worth pointing out that Fefferman also supported George McGovern's campaign as the Democratic candidate for the 1972 presidential election.</li>
<li>Fefferman lectured at Princeton for the years 1969-70.</li>
<li>In 1973 Fefferman returned to Princeton and, in October 1974, he was introduced to Julie Anne Albert.</li>
<li>Fefferman contributed several innovations that revised the study of multidimensional complex analysis by finding correct generalisations of classical low-dimensional results.</li>
<li>Fefferman was awarded the Bergman Prize in 1992.</li>
<li>In addition to the awards mentioned above, Fefferman had received many honours.</li>
<li>In 2009 Fefferman was made an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>Fefferman continues to work at Princeton and from 1999 to 2002 he was Chair of the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 April 1949, Washington, D.C., USA.</p>
