<h1>Person: Shoda, Kenjiro</h1>

<p><strong>Kenjiro Shoda</strong> was a Japanese mathematician who worked in algebra.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shoda, after showing great talents at middle school, attended the Eighth National Senior High School in Nagoya.</li>
<li>After graduating from the Eighth High School, Shoda entered Tokyo Imperial University (the title 'Imperial' would soon be dropped from the name of all Japanese universities) and there he was taught by Takagi.</li>
<li>When Shoda was in his final undergraduate year, his studies were supervised by Takagi and he inspired Shoda to work on algebra.</li>
<li>Shoda graduated from the Department of Mathematics at Tokyo University in 1925 and began his graduate studies under Takagi's supervision.</li>
<li>After a year in Berlin, Shoda went to Göttingen where he joined Emmy Noether's school, attending her lectures on hypercomplex systems and representation theory.</li>
<li>There, near Noether, he witnessed the remarkable process of creation of great mathematical ideas and theory, and youthful Shoda buried himself in enthusiastic pursuit of mathematics in a wonderful creative atmosphere generated by the many young, able mathematicians who had come from all over the world to Göttingen, attracted by Emmy Noether.</li>
<li>Shoda returned to Japan in 1929 and almost immediately began to write his algebra book.</li>
<li>This fine work, published in 1932, must have been a significant factor in Shoda being appointed as professor in the Faculty of Science at Osaka University in 1933.</li>
<li>Shoda, however, managed to continue to undertake research and in 1946 he was elected the first Chairman of the Mathematical Society of Japan.</li>
<li>In 1949 Shoda was awarded the Japan Academy of Science Prize in recognition of his fine achievements.</li>
<li>In 1955 Shoda was appointed as President of Osaka University, a post he held for six years.</li>
<li>After he retired from Osaka University, Shoda continued to work for a better educational system in Japan taking on many roles where he was able to use his long experience to give advice to many education Committees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 February 1902, Tatebayashi, Gunma Prefecture, Japan. Died 20 March 1977, Ashikaga, Japan.</p>
