<p><strong>Henri Cabannes</strong> was a French mathematician who worked on the mechanics of fluids and vibrating ropes.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jean Cabannes specialised in optics and was trained in the laboratory of the physicist Charles Fabry (1867-1945) in Marseille.</li>
<li>Henri was one of his parents' four children.</li>
<li>It was in Montpellier that Henri Cabannes began his schooling.</li>
<li>The family had moved to Paris in 1937 when Jean Cabannes was appointed as a professor in the Faculty of Science in Paris.</li>
<li>Henri entered the École Polytechnique in 1941 while he was still a pupil in the special preparatory Mathematics class at the lycée Saint-Louis.</li>
<li>Cabannes, being born in 1923, was not affected by this but, nevertheless, he decided to interrupt his studies at the École Normale Supérieure and try to reach England or North Africa.</li>
<li>The war ended in May 1945 and by July Cabannes was back in France.</li>
<li>In addition to this remarkable publication record, Cabannes had married Madeleine Lebon.</li>
<li>Henri and Madeleine were both Roman Catholics and met at the Catholic youth gatherings.</li>
<li>Henri and Madeleine Cabannes had five children, Jean-Pierre, Jean-Paul, André, Hélène, and Benoît.</li>
<li>Cabannes's doctoral thesis was examined by Henri Villat, Joseph Pérès and Georges Valiron.</li>
<li>In 1952 Cabannes was promoted to Professor of Rational Mechanics at the Faculty of Science in Marseille and in the following year he became a member of the council of the French Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>We said above that we would give more details of the Cabannes' children.</li>
<li>Cabannes spent 9 months as a Visiting Professor at Laval University, Quebec, Canada during 1956-57.</li>
<li>The three children André, Hélène, and Benoît were born while Cabannes was still working at the Faculty of Science in Marseille.</li>
<li>Henri was rather glad of that; he said, "Five is good." Madeleine was helped by a very nice girl living at their home, but her baby, the little Hélène and Jean-Paul did not let her be idle.</li>
<li>In 1960 the Cabannes family moved from Marseille to Paris when he was appointed Professor of General Mechanics at the Faculty of Sciences of Paris.</li>
<li>We have details of what Cabannes taught since he published Cours de mécanique générale Ⓣ(General mechanics course) in 1962.</li>
<li>In 1966 Cabannes published the collection of exercises Problèmes de mécanique générale Ⓣ(General mechanical problems) and in the same year published a second edition of Cours de mécanique générale Ⓣ(General mechanics course.).</li>
<li>Cabannes was appointed as Professor of General Mechanics at the Pierre and Marie Curie University (Paris 6) in 1969.</li>
<li>Cabannes made a second trip to the University of California at Berkeley in 1980 and delivered a set of lectures on the discrete Boltzmann equation as part of a graduate course in the Mechanical Engineering Department.</li>
<li>Throughout his career, Cabannes received many honours.</li>
<li>In 2002 Cabannes was interviewed by the Romanian "Magazin Istoric" and asked "At present, what do you recommend to young Europeans?".</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 January 1923, Montpellier, Hérault, France. Died 30 May 2016, Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer, Var, France.</p>
