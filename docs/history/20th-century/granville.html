<p><strong>Evelyn Boyd Granville</strong> was only the second African-American woman to receive a PhD in mathematics from an American University. She worked in computing.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The name Granville, by which she is now known, is the name she took after her second marriage but, for the sake of simplicity, we shall refer to her during this article as Granville even from her childhood days.</li>
<li>Evelyn Boyd Granville's father was William Boyd who had various jobs including that of a janitor, chauffeur, and a messenger.</li>
<li>Evelyn's mother was Julia Boyd; she had been a secretary before her marriage but gave up work to bring up her family.</li>
<li>The Great Depression began in 1929 when Granville was five years old, and by 1932 one quarter of the workers in the United States were unemployed.</li>
<li>Granville's father worked selling vegetables from a lorry during the Great Depression and, although the family were poor, they always had food and a home.</li>
<li>William and Julia Boyd separated while Granville was still young and, together with her elder sister who was about eighteen months older, she was brought up in the African American community in Washington, D.C by her mother.</li>
<li>Julia Boyd's sister also played a big part in Granville's upbringing and, being more academically inclined that Granville's mother, she strongly influenced and encouraged Granville in that direction.</li>
<li>After separating from William Boyd, Julia returned to work to support her family earning a living as a maid.</li>
<li>Granville attended elementary school, junior high school, and high school in Washington D.C. She was happy at school and was an outstanding pupil.</li>
<li>It was an academically oriented school for black students which aimed to send their pupils to the top universities and there Granville was strongly encouraged by two of her mathematics teachers Ulysses Basset and Mary Cromwell.</li>
<li>In fact both Granville's mother and aunt gave her $500 to finance her studies for a year before she won the scholarships which helped fund the remainder of her time at Smith College.</li>
<li>Granville graduated with distinction in 1945 and was awarded a scholarship from the Smith Student Aid Society of Smith College to undertake studies for her doctorate.</li>
<li>After completing her Ph.D. from Yale, Granville spent a postdoctoral year at the New York University Institute of Mathematics working on differential equations with Fritz John.</li>
<li>In December 1955 Granville left the National Bureau of Standards and she began work for IBM in January of the following year.</li>
<li>In November 1960 Granville married (but still did not take the name of Granville which was her second husband's name) and moved to Los Angeles where she continued her work on orbit calculations for the space programme at the Space Technology Laboratories.</li>
<li>In the 1967 Granville's marriage broke up and she returned to the academic world, accepting a teaching post at California State University in Los Angeles.</li>
<li>Granville had married Edward V Granville in 1970, and of course only at that time did she take the name "Granville" which we have used throughout this article.</li>
<li>Still Granville did not want to leave the academic world and she taught at the University of Texas at Tyler, where she held the Sam A Lindsey Chair, and retired in 1997.</li>
<li>Granville gave her views on the current problems of teaching mathematics in American schools in a lecture at Yale University.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 May 1924, Washington D.C., USA.</p>
