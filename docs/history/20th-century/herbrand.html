<p><strong>Jacques Herbrand</strong> was a French mathematician who died young but made contributions to mathematical logic.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>However, Herbrand had already made major breakthroughs in the topic while an undergraduate so his success in the area was well established.</li>
<li>In October of the same year Herbrand joined the army for his military service.</li>
<li>After his spell in the army, Herbrand was awarded a Rockefeller fellowship to allow him to study at various places in Europe.</li>
<li>From Berlin, Herbrand went to Hamburg where he spent the month of June working with Artin.</li>
<li>After leaving Göttingen, Herbrand decided on a holiday in the Alps before his intended return to France.</li>
<li>See the newspaper reports of the accident in the article Herbrand's accident.</li>
<li>It is incredible how much Herbrand achieved in the short time he had to undertake mathematical research.</li>
<li>He made contributions to mathematical logic where Herbrand's theorem on the theory of quantifiers appears in his doctoral thesis.</li>
<li>Herbrand's theorem establishes a link between quantification theory and sentential logic which is important in that it gives a method to test a formula in quantification theory by successively testing formulas for sentential validity.</li>
<li>Since testing for sentential validity is a mechanical process, Herbrand's theorem is today of major importance in software developed for theorem proving by computer.</li>
<li>Herbrand also worked on field theory considering abelian extensions of algebraic number fields.</li>
<li>In the few months on which he worked on this topic, Herbrand published ten papers.</li>
<li>Herbrand also generalised some of the results by these workers in class field theory as well as proving some important new theorems of his own.</li>
<li>For more information about Chevalley writings on Herbrand's thought see the article Chevalley on Herbrand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 12 February 1908, Paris, France. Died 27 July 1931, La Bérarde, Isère, France.</p>
