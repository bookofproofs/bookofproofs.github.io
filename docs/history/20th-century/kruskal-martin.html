<p><strong>Martin Kruskal</strong> was an American mathematician and physicist who worked in plasma physics as well as soliton equations, asymptotic analysis, and surreal numbers.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Martin attended Fieldston High School in Riverdale, New York, and after graduating entered the University of Chicago.</li>
<li>He soon persuaded Kruskal that he should undertake research at his new Institute and managed to obtain a position for him as Assistant Instructor in the Mathematics Department.</li>
<li>Kruskal became an assistant in 1946 and, after studying for his M.S. was awarded the degree in 1948.</li>
<li>In 1959, while continuing to hold his post in Project Matterhorn, Kruskal was also appointed as a lecturer in astronomy at Princeton.</li>
<li>The award of a National Science Foundation Senior Fellowship saw Kruskal spend 1959-60 at the Max Planck Institute in Munich.</li>
<li>In 1961 Kruskal was promoted to Professor of Astronomy at Princeton but continued his position within Project Matterhorn until 1964.</li>
<li>Continuing his different roles at Princeton, Kruskal was appointed as director of the Applied Mathematics programme in 1968, a role he held for 20 years.</li>
<li>Kruskal's later work studied soliton equations, asymptotic analysis, and surreal numbers.</li>
<li>Analysing asymptotic series also led Kruskal to become interested in surreal numbers, generalisations of real numbers introduced by John Conway.</li>
<li>Kruskal's important paper (written jointly with Clifford S Gardner, John M Greene and Robert M Miura) Korteweg-de Vries equation and generalizations.</li>
<li>The prize was awarded jointly to Kruskal and Gardner for the above mentioned Korteweg-de Vries paper.</li>
<li>This was certainly not the first honour that Kruskal had received.</li>
<li>In 1997 Kruskal was elected to the Royal Society of London, in 2000 he received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland, and in 2001 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 28 September 1925, New York City, New York, USA. Died 26 December 2006, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.</p>
