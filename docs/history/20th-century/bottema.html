<p><strong>Oene Bottema</strong> was a Dutch mathematician who studied geometry and mechanics, specifically kinematics .</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rinze Bottema had a position with the railways and was subsequently station manager at a few village stations in the north of the country.</li>
<li>After attending elementary school, Bottema entered the Rijks Hogere Burgerschool in Groningen.</li>
<li>Bottema was one of the first to benefit from this change, and in 1918 he entered the Department of Mathematics and Physics of the University of Groningen.</li>
<li>One of Bottema's professors at Groningen was Julius Wolff (1882-1945) who, after studying for a doctorate advised by Diederik Korteweg, had spent ten years as a school teacher, then was appointed professor of differential calculus, theory of functions and higher algebra at Groningen in 1917.</li>
<li>Bottema was also taught by Johan Antony Barrau (1873-1953) who had also been advised by Korteweg for his doctorate.</li>
<li>Another of Bottema's teachers, who only arrived in Groningen in 1923, was the number theorist Johannes Gaultherus van der Corput (1890-1975).</li>
<li>Bottema was taught theoretical physics by Frits Zernike (1888-1966), an outstanding scientist who was awarded a Nobel Prize for physics in 1953.</li>
<li>Bottema graduated from the University of Groningen in 1924 and began a career as a secondary school mathematics teacher.</li>
<li>After the award of his degree in mathematics, Bottema was appointed as a teacher at the Hogere Burgerschool in Hengelo.</li>
<li>During his teaching at Hengelo, Bottema came into contact with Willem Van der Woude (1876-1974) from Leiden, who acted as a commissioner at his school.</li>
<li>Bottema had published a paper while still an undergraduate, namely Opmerking aangaande het artikel van N.</li>
<li>Bottema was keen to work towards his doctorate and, advised by Van der Woude, he undertook research while continuing to work full time as a mathematics teacher.</li>
<li>In 1927 Bottema was awarded a doctorate for his thesis De figuur van vier kruisende rechte lijnen Ⓣ(The figure consisting of four mutually skew lines).</li>
<li>In the thesis Bottema studies such Voss-quadruples and other special quadruples of skew lines.</li>
<li>In his thesis Bottema's elegant style in mathematics is already present.</li>
<li>The award of a doctorate did not mean that Bottema gave up being a school teacher.</li>
<li>Although Bottema taught in schools from 1924 to 1941, he also taught some university courses as a docent.</li>
<li>Femmina, known as Femmy, was more than one year younger than Oene Bottema.</li>
<li>In 1938 Bottema published his first book, De elementaire meetkunde van het platte vlak Ⓣ(The elementary geometry of the plane).</li>
<li>In 1941 Bottema left his position as director of the Rijks Hogere Burgerschool in Deventer when he was appointed as professor at the Technical University in Delft.</li>
<li>To avoid any bad feeling that might arise, the university decided to appoint Bottema to the chair which W A Versluys had held until 1935 but which had never been filled.</li>
<li>Bottema published around 200 papers during his career, but he also made contributions to high school mathematics.</li>
<li>In this way, Bottema, while still a teacher, came into contact with Van der Woude.</li>
<li>It is the latter in which Bottema was involved, possibly since the 1940s.</li>
<li>Bottema was perfect for this work and thus certainly exerted his influence on secondary education.</li>
<li>H D Kloosterman was chair of this committee with Haantjes as its secretary and Bottema as one of the three other members.</li>
<li>Bottema retired in 1971 at the age of 70.</li>
<li>She became totally dependent on Bottema who took care of her in the most loving way.</li>
<li>After retiring, Bottema continued to produce research papers, the last appearing in 2001 nearly 10 years after his death.</li>
<li>Bottema received many honours for his contributions.</li>
<li>Bottema admired Wordsworth, who in Book V of 'The Prelude' uses the stone and the shell to represent respectively geometrical truth and poetry.</li>
<li>For Bottema the unshakable argument of geometry and the inspiration of poetry were the two indispensable guides in life.</li>
<li>As a mathematician, an administrator and a human being, Bottema always attempted to create a good balance between content and form.</li>
<li>Bottema had learned his lesson too well and in addition to the question he gave the answer (that de Bruijn had written for the sake of completeness).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 December 1901, Groningen, Netherlands. Died 30 November 1992, Delft, Netherlands.</p>
