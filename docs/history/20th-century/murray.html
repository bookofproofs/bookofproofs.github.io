<p><strong>James Murray</strong> is a Scottish mathematician who is best known for his authoritative and extensive work  <em>Mathematical Biology</em>.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>He spent three years at Dumfries Academy where the head of the mathematics department, Mr Ross, told him he would never make it as a mathematician! However James said that Mr Ross was an excellent mathematics teacher.</li>
<li>This was the result of Mr Ross's opinion of Murray's mathematical abilities.</li>
<li>In 1950-51 Murray entered the Junior Honours class in mathematics.</li>
<li>In 1953 Murray graduated from the University of St Andrews when he was awarded a B.Sc. with 1st  class Honours in Mathematics.</li>
<li>It was not all work for Murray at university, however, for he won the University of St Andrews' first blue in table tennis and was captain of the university's billiard team.</li>
<li>So, after taking his first degree, Murray remained at St Andrews to study for a Ph.D. having been awarded a Carnegie Research Scholarship.</li>
<li>His thesis advisor was Ron Mitchell and he suggested to Murray a topic in boundary layer fluid dynamics.</li>
<li>This was Murray's PhD problem.</li>
<li>In 1954 Mitchell and Murray submitted the paper Two Dimensional Flow with Constant Shear Past Cylinders with Various Cross Sections to Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Physik.</li>
<li>Having completed the work for his Ph.D. Murray was appointed as a Lecturer in Applied Mathematics, at King's College, Durham University in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1955.</li>
<li>After spending a year at King's College in Newcastle, Murray, who had always wanted to go to the United States, went to Harvard University where he spent 1956-57 as a postdoctoral student supported by a Sir James Caird Travelling Scholarship.</li>
<li>Murray had continued to work on fluid dynamics and had published papers such as Non-uniform shear flow past cylinders (1957), The flow of a conducting fluid past a magnetized cylinder (1960), The boundary layer on a flat plate in a stream with uniform shear (1961), Strong cylindrical shock waves in magnetogasdynamics (1961), On the mathematics of fluidization.</li>
<li>It was while he was at the University of Michigan that Murray became interested in mathematical biology.</li>
<li>In 1967 Murray was appointed as Professor of Mathematics at New York University but, after two years he returned to England where he was made a fellow and tutor at Corpus Christi College of the University of Oxford.</li>
<li>From 1966 until 1973 Murray published papers both on fluid dynamics and on mathematical biology.</li>
<li>After 1974 all of Murray's publications (around 200 from 1974 up to 2015) are on mathematical biology.</li>
<li>Murray gave the Introductory Remarks at the 'Theories of biological pattern formation', a Royal Society of London conference held on 25 and 26 March 1981.</li>
<li>Murray has published three single authored books Asymptotic Analysis (1974), Lectures on Nonlinear Differential Equation Models in Biology (1977), Mathematical biology (1989), and, in addition, one multi-author work The mathematics of marriage: dynamic nonlinear models (2002), with John M Gottman, Catherine C Swanson, Rebecca Tyson and Kristin R Swanson.</li>
<li>At Oxford, Murray was a Reader in Mathematics from 1972 to 1986, and Professor of Mathematical Biology from 1986.</li>
<li>In 1992 Murray retired both from his chair of Mathematical Biology and from the Directorship of the Centre for Mathematical Biology.</li>
<li>However, from 1987 Murray had, in addition to the Oxford positions, held appointments at the University of Washington in the United States.</li>
<li>In 2010, now in his eightieth year, Murray became a Senior Scholar in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton University and a Visiting Professor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton.</li>
<li>During his long career, Murray has held numerous positions as Visiting Professor.</li>
<li>For his outstanding contributions to mathematical biology, Murray has received many honours and awards.</li>
<li>The University of Washington created a donor endowed chair in perpetuity: the James D Murray Chair of Applied Mathematics in Neuropathology in 2006.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 2 January 1931, Moffat, Scotland.</p>
