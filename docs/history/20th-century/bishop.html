<p><strong>Errett Bishop</strong> was an American mathematician who worked in analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>He died in 1933 when his son Errett was five years old.</li>
<li>Despite dying before he could personally influence Errett towards mathematics, in fact he did have a very substantial influence since when Errett was a young boy he began to study the mathematics the textbooks which had belonged to his father.</li>
<li>The family remained in the same family home in Newton after Albert's death and his books remained to excite young Errett.</li>
<li>It is clear that Errett was a child prodigy but it was remarkable that he had a sister, Mary, who was two years younger than he was an was also a mathematical prodigy.</li>
<li>Errett did not find High School at all challenging and when he was sixteen, wanting to progress with his education in a way that was not happening at school, he applied and was accepted for a special scholarship program at the University of Chicago.</li>
<li>Starting his university studies in 1944, Bishop graduated with a B.S. from Chicago in 1947 and continued to study for his Master's degree which was awarded in 1947.</li>
<li>Bishop was joined in Chicago by his younger sister Mary who, as he had been, was accepted for the special scholarship program at the University of Chicago.</li>
<li>Bishop had been taught by Paul Halmos when he was studying for his B.S. and it was Halmos who supervised his doctoral studies.</li>
<li>However Bishop spent 1950-52 in the U.S. army.</li>
<li>After completing his basic army training Bishop was sent to undertake mathematical research at the National Bureau of Standards.</li>
<li>Returning to Chicago in 1952 Bishop submitted his doctoral thesis Spectral Theory for Operations on Banach Spaces in 1954.</li>
<li>Having submitted his thesis, Bishop was appointed as an instructor in mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley.</li>
<li>Bishop's work is so wide ranging that it is difficult to give an overview in a biography such as this.</li>
<li>Let us look at the book Selected papers which was published in 1986 and reprints some of Bishop's most significant contributions.</li>
<li>Here Bishop worked on uniform algebras (commutative Banach algebras with unit whose norms are the spectral norms) proving results such as antisymmetric decomposition of a uniform algebra, the Bishop-DeLeeuw theorem, and the proof of existence of Jensen measures.</li>
<li>In 1965 Bishop wrote an excellent survey Uniform algebras examining the interaction between the theory of uniform algebras and that of several complex variables.</li>
<li>An examples of a paper by Bishop on this topic is Spectral theory for operators on a Banach space (1957).</li>
<li>He introduced the condition now called the Bishop condition which turned out to be very useful in the theory of decomposable operators.</li>
<li>Examples of Bishop's papers in this area are Analyticity in certain Banach spaces (1962).</li>
<li>Bishop become interested in foundational issues around 1964, about the time he was at the Miller Institute.</li>
<li>Many other areas of mathematics were given the constructive treatment by Bishop.</li>
<li>In the following year Bishop published Schizophrenia in contemporary mathematics which gave his principles of constructivism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 July 1928, Newton, Kansas, USA. Died 14 April 1983, San Diego, California, USA.</p>
