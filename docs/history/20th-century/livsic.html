<p><strong>Moshe Livsic</strong> was a Ukrainian-born mathematician who worked in functional analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The family were Jewish and Livsic brought up in a very religious household.</li>
<li>Livsic graduated from school in 1931 and, with a school friend, planned his future studies.</li>
<li>However to be successful in the physical sciences Livsic and his friend would first have to become knowledgeable in mathematics.</li>
<li>Livsic began studies at Odessa technical College aimed at his becoming a radio technician but, in 1933, he entered the Department of Physics and Mathematics at Odessa State University.</li>
<li>Livsic took part in the functional analysis seminar and studied analytic functions.</li>
<li>After working at Kirovograd, Livsic returned to Odessa to teach at the Hydrometerological Institute which was a minor institution.</li>
<li>From 1957 until 1962 Livsic was head of mathematics at Kharkov Mining Institute, joining Akhiezer at Kharkov State University in 1962.</li>
<li>His recent breakthroughs in the theory of characteristic functions for several commuting operators indicate that in spite of his seventy years, mathematically Moshe is still a young man.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 July 1917, Pokotilova (near Uman), Ukraine. Died 30 March 2007, Be’er Scheva, Israel.</p>
