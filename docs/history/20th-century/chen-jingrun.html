<p><strong>Chen Jingrun</strong> was a Chinese mathematician who made outstanding advances in the study of Goldbach's Conjecture, proving that every sufficiently large integer can be represented as the sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Regarded by mathematicians as one of the four great astronomers of the twentieth century, Chen Jingrun solved a large number of extraordinary mathematical problems during his lifetime. </li>
<li>He provided a proof of the Goldbach Conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than two can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. </li>
<li>Chen also formulated various numerical methods, such as the Chen-Tao theorem, the Chen-Laporte theorem, and the Chen-Stein theorem.</li>
<li>He is also credited with being the first to provide a proof for the twin prime conjecture, which states that there are infinitely many prime numbers in the form of 6n ± 1.</li>
<li>Chen Jingrun's most renowned achievement is his proof of the even Goldbach Conjecture, which was finally accepted by the International Mathematical community after many years of attempts by numerous mathematicians from all over the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 22 May1933, Fuzhou, Fujian province, China. Died 19 March 1996, Beijing, China.</p>
