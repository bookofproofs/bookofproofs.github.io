<h1>Person: Polozii, Georgii Nikolaevich</h1>
<p><img alt="avatar.png" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/avatar.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Georgii Polozii</strong> was a Russian mathematician who mostly worked in pure mathematics such as complex analysis, approximation theory and numerical analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>For example, Polozii is often written Polozhii or Polozhiy.</li>
<li>His patronymic name Nikolaevich appears in various spelling, but perhaps the most confusing is Mikolaevich meaning that often his name appears as G N Polozii or G M Polozii.</li>
<li>In fact some of his mathematical papers have the author's name as G N Polozii, while others have G M Polozii.</li>
<li>Georgii Nikolaevich's paternal grandfather had been forced to move to the village of Kapustin Yar on the Astrakhan steppes after the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878.</li>
<li>Georgii Nikolaevich's father, one of eighteen children, became a telegraph operator on the Trans-Siberian railway.</li>
<li>At the time that his son Georgii Nikolaevich was born, he was working at the 37th junction of the Trans-Baikal railway, a part of the Trans-Siberian railway built between 1895 and 1905.</li>
<li>Nikola Andriyovych and Olena Hryhorivna had five children, four girls and one son, Georgii Nikolaevich, the subject of this biography.</li>
<li>When Georgii Nikolaevich was ten years old, in 1924, the Polozii family moved to the village of Nizhny Baskunchak (Lower Baskunchak) in the Astrakhan region, where some of their relatives lived.</li>
<li>Nizhny Baskunchak is a small rural village on the west shore of the saline Lake Baskunchak and Georgii Nikolaevich attended school there.</li>
<li>Polozii would have wished to continue immediately to university studies but this was not allowed at that time before obtaining work experience.</li>
<li>He was taught by Georgy Petrovich Boev who had a huge influence on Polozii's development as a teacher, mathematician and scientist.</li>
<li>While still an undergraduate, Polozii showed his ability to do scientific and mathematical analysis so, after he graduated in 1937 with the highest honours, he was appointed as an assistant at the Department of Mathematics of the Saratov Highway Institute.</li>
<li>These notes were never published, but the connection that was made between Polozii, M V Keldysh and P Ya Kochina proved highly significant and, eventually, M V Keldysh would become Polozii's advisor for his doctoral dissertation.</li>
<li>Polozii was appointed as an assistant at the Department of Mathematical Analysis of Saratov State University, where he became actively engaged in research.</li>
<li>On 1 February 1940, Polozii went to the front as a volunteer but, following the Moscow Peace Treaty in March 1940, fighting ended and a few months later, on 11 November 1940, Polozii returned to Saratov State University.</li>
<li>Two days later, on 24 June 1941, Polozii again volunteered for the front to fight in what became known as the Great Patriotic War.</li>
<li>Polozii, now disabled, was faced with difficult decisions.</li>
<li>With Boev's support, on 6 April 1944 Polozii was appointed as an assistant in the Department of Mathematical Analysis of Saratov State University.</li>
<li>In 1946 Polozii defended his doctoral dissertation Integral Representations of Continuously Differentiable Functions of a Complex Variable (Russian) in which he had begun to develop a new approach to generalised analytic functions.</li>
<li>in our list of Polozii's papers.</li>
<li>They are all discussed in Polozii's book The Method of Summary Representation for Numerical Solution of Problems of Mathematical Physics (Pergamon Press, 1965).</li>
<li>on our list of Polozii's books where we give its preface, introduction and extracts from some reviews.</li>
<li>In 1949 Polozii was appointed to the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv as an associate professor of mathematical analysis.</li>
<li>From November 1952 to February 1953 Polozii served as dean of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics at the University of Kyiv.</li>
<li>Although Polozii was Head of the Department of Mathematical Physics, he was not a professor; that would only be possible after he had obtained a doctorate.</li>
<li>This problem attracted the attention of many who work on elasticity, but the complete solution has only been obtained in the work of G N Polozii.</li>
<li>there is a group of problems associated with the mathematical theorem of G N Polozii, on the motion of boundary points.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate, Polozii received the title 'Professor of Mathematical Physics' in 1954.</li>
<li>Polozii was chosen as the first permanent head of the new Department taking up the post in 1958.</li>
<li>We have already seen Polozii's major pure mathematical contributions but let us summarise his contribution: the theory of functions of a complex variable, approximation theory, and numerical analysis.</li>
<li>Between 1962 and 1966 Polozii developed the theory for a new class of (p,q)(p, q)(p,q) analytic functions.</li>
<li>In approximation theory Polozii worked mainly with the aim of developing effective methods to solve boundary value problems which arise in mathematical physics.</li>
<li>For the boundary value problems of the equations of mathematical physics there is a model which established these processes; this was created by G M Polozii and his students and followers.</li>
<li>Georgii Nikolaevich himself developed only the theoretical foundations of the method of summary images, and his students were engaged in the practical implementation of these developments and its further improvement.</li>
<li>Among the many honours given to Polozii, let us mention his election as a corresponding member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in 1967 and several USSR medals and awards, for example in 1959 and 1964.</li>
<li>Over the last years of his life, Polozii worked to create a Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics.</li>
<li>The conference 'Differential Equations, Computational Mathematics, Function Theory and Mathematical Methods of Mechanics' was held at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Kyiv University on 23-24 April 2014 to celebrate the centenary of Polozii's birth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 April 1914, Transbaikal, Russia. Died 26 November 1968, Kyiv, Ukraine.</p>
