<p><strong>Richard Feynman</strong> was a Nobel prize winner famous for his unusual life style and for his popular books and lectures on mathematics and physics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It meant that a sadness fell over the household which must have greatly affected the young Richard.</li>
<li>Richard, or Ritty as his friends called him, learnt a great deal of science from Encyclopaedia Britannica and taught himself elementary mathematics before he encountered it at school.</li>
<li>At school Feynman approached mathematics in a highly unconventional way.</li>
<li>His mathematics lecturers presented him with the view that one did mathematics for its own sake so Feynman changed courses, taking electrical engineering.</li>
<li>It is interesting to think that had Feynman taken the mathematics course at Cambridge which Hoyle took around the same time, he would have found it exactly what he wanted.</li>
<li>The physics course that Feynman took at MIT was not the standard one.</li>
<li>There was no course on quantum mechanics, a topic that Feynman was very keen to study, so together with a fellow undergraduate, T A Welton, he began to read the available texts in the spring of 1936.</li>
<li>By 1937 Feynman was reading Dirac's The principles of quantum mechanics and seeing how his highly original ideas fitted into Dirac's approach.</li>
<li>Dirac became the scientist who Feynman most respected throughout his life.</li>
<li>We mentioned above that Feynman went home for his vacations.</li>
<li>Despite the personal recommendation that Harry Smyth at Princeton received from Slater, it was not obvious that Feynman would be accepted.</li>
<li>After further letters from Slater, Feynman was accepted by Princeton.</li>
<li>In retrospect, Feynman thought that Pauli must have seen difficulties at once, for after Feynman had spent a long time working on it, he too thought that it was not satisfactory.</li>
<li>that the mathematical machinery emerging from the Wheeler-Feynman collaboration was beyond Wheeler's own ability).</li>
<li>Feynman seemed to possess a frightening ease with the substance behind the equations, like Einstein at the same age, like the Soviet physicist Lev Landau - but few others.</li>
<li>Feynman worked on the atomic bomb project at Princeton University (1941-42) and then at Los Alamos (1943-45).</li>
<li>Feynman began work on the Manhattan project at Princeton developing a theory of how to separate Uranium 235 from Uranium 238, while his thesis supervisor Wheeler went to Chicago to work with Fermi on the first nuclear reactor.</li>
<li>Wigner, in Wheeler's absence, advised Feynman to write up his thesis and after Wheeler and Wigner examined the work he received his doctorate in June 1942.</li>
<li>Feynman had a difficult personal problem at this time.</li>
<li>Shortly after his marriage Feynman went to the newly constructed Los Alamos site to work on the atomic bomb project.</li>
<li>In 1950 Feynman accepted a position as professor of theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.</li>
<li>He remained at Cal tech for the rest of his career, being appointed Richard Chace Tolman Professor of Theoretical Physics there in 1959.</li>
<li>Feynman's main contribution was to quantum mechanics, following on from the work of his doctoral thesis.</li>
<li>He introduced diagrams (now called Feynman diagrams) that are graphic analogues of the mathematical expressions needed to describe the behaviour of systems of interacting particles.</li>
<li>Feynman's books include many outstanding ones which evolved out of lecture courses.</li>
<li>For example Quantum Electrodynamics (1961) and The Theory of Fundamental Processes (1961), The Feynman Lectures on Physics (1963-65) (3 volumes), The Character of Physical Law (1965) and QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter (1985).</li>
<li>For Feynman the essence of scientific imagination was a powerful and almost painful rule.</li>
<li>Feynman received many honours for his work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 May 1918, New York City, USA. Died 15 February 1988, Los Angeles, California, USA.</p>
