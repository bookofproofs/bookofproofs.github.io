<h1>Person: Littlewood (2), Dudley</h1>

<p><strong>Dudley Ernest Littlewood</strong> was a British mathematician known for his work in group representation theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>He entered Trinity College where his undergraduate tutor was J E Littlewood (who was not related to Dudley).</li>
<li>Littlewood was a very successful mathematics undergraduate being awarded College prizes and the Yeats prize.</li>
<li>Littlewood's first appointment was as a school teacher, but, in 1928, he found a post as a temporary part-time lecturer at University College Swansea.</li>
<li>Although his research flourished in Swansea, Littlewood was keen to return to Cambridge and, when the chance came in 1947, he accepted a post as university lecturer.</li>
<li>Littlewood's family were not happy with the move to Cambridge but he did not remain there long for in 1948 he was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the University College of North Wales, Bangor.</li>
<li>Until Littlewood's appointment to Swansea he had no definite research interests.</li>
<li>Another reason was certainly the work of Hilbert, but Littlewood tried to remedy the "tensor reason" in a series of papers on tensors and invariant theory.</li>
<li>Littlewood's main work, however, began in 1934 after Richardson had suggested that Littlewood study papers by Frobenius and Schur.</li>
<li>Above all, this paper is renowned for its statement of a rule for multiplying S-functions, now universally called the Littlewood-Richardson rule (this had to wait a further thirty-five years for a rigorous proof).</li>
<li>This marks the beginning of Littlewood's investigation of group characters, in particular the characters of the symmetric group.</li>
<li>Littlewood had a great love for the works of Frobenius, Schur and Weyl - these were mathematicians who produced the kind of usable formulae which he could and did appreciate.</li>
<li>In 1970 Littlewood retired from the chair at Bangor, but he continued to live at Llandudno on the North Wales coast.</li>
<li>Around the time of his 76th  birthday, Littlewood fell and broke a leg.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 September 1903, London, England. Died 6 October 1979, Llandudno, Wales.</p>
