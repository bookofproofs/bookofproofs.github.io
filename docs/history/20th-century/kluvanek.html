<p><strong>Igor Kluvánek</strong> was Slovakian mathematician who worked in applied mathematics, functional analysis and operator theory. He spent part of his career in Australia before returning to Slovakia.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Igor studied at the gymnasium at Rimavská Sobota.</li>
<li>After graduating from the Gymnasium, Kluvánek entered the Slovak Polytechnic University, Bratislava, where he studied for a degree in electrical engineering.</li>
<li>We should also note that 1953 was the year in which the Slovak Academy of Sciences was set up in Bratislava and Kluvánek began undertaking research for his C.Sc. degree from the Academy.</li>
<li>Pavol stood modestly in a corner and Igor addressed us in his typical manner.</li>
<li>In 1956 Kluvánek was promoted to the equivalent of a Senior Lecturer at the Slovak Polytechnic University.</li>
<li>Kluvánek was a practicing Roman Catholic and this was seen as incompatible with his role as a teacher.</li>
<li>However, although the authorities discriminated against Kluvánek because of his religion, as they did against others in a similar position, the situation was tolerated.</li>
<li>Pavol Josef Safarik University was founded in Košice in 1959 and, in 1963, Kluvánek was appointed to the Department of Mathematical Analysis at the new University.</li>
<li>However, this was far from the end of Kluvánek's problems.</li>
<li>In 1975, in collaboration with Greg Knowles, Kluvánek published the monograph Vector measures and control systems.</li>
<li>In 1988 Kluvánek published the monograph Integration structures.</li>
<li>To illustrate Kluvánek's views on teaching mathematics, let us quote from his paper What is wrong with calculus?</li>
<li>In 1989, with major changes taking place in Czechoslovakia, Kluvánek returned to Košice.</li>
<li>Kluvánek, as someone who had been persecuted by the Communist regime, became something of a star in the new Czechoslovakia.</li>
<li>In ordinary conversation, Igor had a great enthusiasm for ideas, discussion and debate, which he often conveyed with a characteristic emphasis, frequently combined with humour.</li>
<li>Socially, Igor could be charming and entertaining, and show an interest in people's lives and concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 27 January 1931, Košice, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia). Died 24 July 1993, Bratislava, Slovakia.</p>
