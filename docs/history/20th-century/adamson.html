<p><strong>Iain Adamson</strong> was a Scottish mathematician who worked in algebra and published several widely appreciated text-books.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Iain's secondary education was at Morgan Academy in Dundee and, in 1945, he graduated as Dux of the Academy.</li>
<li>After graduating from the University of St Andrews, Adamson went to Princeton University in the United States where he undertook research in algebra supervised by Emil Artin.</li>
<li>Also in 1967, Queen's College became the new University of Dundee and Iain automatically changed from being employed by the University of St Andrews to being a lecturer in the University of Dundee.</li>
<li>We will look at other aspects of Adamson's life later in this biography, but first we want to look at his greatest mathematical contribution which was as a writer of textbooks.</li>
<li>Adamson's first textbook was Introduction to field theory (1964).</li>
<li>Adamson's next book Rings, modules and algebras (1971) was again in his own specialist area of algebra.</li>
<li>Adamson turned to analysis for his next textbook Elementary mathematical analysis (1975).</li>
<li>From the information given above of Adamson's three papers on teaching elementary analysis, we could guess that his approach in this book would be innovative; indeed it is.</li>
<li>Perhaps the two most successfully innovative textbooks by Adamson are A general topology workbook (1996), and A set theory workbook (1998).</li>
<li>Also in 1996, Adamson published Data structures and algorithms.</li>
<li>We promised to return to what we can only describe as "another side" of Adamson's life.</li>
<li>When the University of Dundee asked if members of staff would consider early retirement with part-time re-engagement, Adamson accepted the offer.</li>
<li>Iain quickly became a well known and well respected Minister, especially in regard to pastoral care where his willingness to be a listener rather than a speaker endeared him to people with problems.</li>
<li>In 2001 Iain and Robin Adamson decided to go to Australia and take up permanent residence in Nedlands.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 17 June 1928, Dundee, Scotland. Died 9 June 2010, Nedlands, WA, Australia.</p>
