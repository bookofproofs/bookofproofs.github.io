<p><strong>Ambros Speiser</strong> was a Swiss engineer and mathematician who led the development of the first Swiss computer.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Speiser entered the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH) in 1944 where he studied electrical engineering.</li>
<li>Speiser completed his electrical engineering degree at ETH in 1948, specialising in low-voltage technology.</li>
<li>He then became one of two assistants to Stiefel at the new Institute for Applied Mathematics which was founded in the year Speiser graduated.</li>
<li>Stiefel decided that the Institute for Applied Mathematics at ETH should build its own electronic computer, so he sent Heinz Rutishauser and Ambros Speiser on a fact finding visit to the United States in January 1949.</li>
<li>Rutishauser and Speiser spent most of 1949 at Harvard with Howard Aiken and at Princeton with John von Neumann.</li>
<li>Returning to the ETH in December 1949, Speiser discovered that plans had changed since Stiefel had managed to persuade the ETH to rent the use of Konrad Zuse's Z4.</li>
<li>Since becoming Stiefel's assistant, Speiser had been working on his doctorate under Stiefel's supervision.</li>
<li>There followed a series of four papers by Stiefel, Rutishauser and Speiser, Programmgesteuerte digitale Rechengeräte (elektronische Rechenmaschinen) Ⓣ(Program-controlled digital computing devices (electronic calculators))  appearing in 1950 and 1951.</li>
<li>In 1952 Speiser habilitated at ERH and was appointed as a privatdozent.</li>
<li>Speiser had been actively working on the project to build a digital computer at ETH from the time he spent the year 1949 in the United States with Rutishauser.</li>
<li>Although much work was done with the Z4 at ETH, in parallel Speiser and Rutishauser were working on the construction of ETH's own computer ERMETH (Elektronische Rechenmaschine an der ETH).</li>
<li>Speiser was the chief engineer for the project and ERMETH became operational in 1955.</li>
<li>They decided that their first choice of director was Speiser, but at this stage he was unaware of this decision.</li>
<li>Speiser was appointed Director of the IBM research laboratory in Zürich in 1956.</li>
<li>In the same year Speiser was appointed as Professor at ETH.</li>
<li>Speiser received a number of honours for his contributions including election as president of the International Federation for Information Processing from 1965 to 1968.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 13 November 1922, Basel, Switzerland. Died 10 May 2003, Aarau, Switzerland.</p>
