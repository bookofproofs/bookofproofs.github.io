<h1>Person: Cam, Lucien Marie Le</h1>

<p><strong>Lucien Le Cam</strong> was a French mathematician and statistician who moved to America and produced important resuls in asymptotic theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>More than this, Le Cam's mother could not run the farm on her own.</li>
<li>Despite the generous act by the priests in funding Le Cam's education, it was disrupted by the war.</li>
<li>Le Cam's favourite subject at the high school had been chemistry and he took chemistry books with him to the seminary.</li>
<li>Le Cam was still trying to get into university; the École Polytechnique  was his first choice with the École Normale Supérieure as second choice.</li>
<li>Rather than wait to try again in the following June, Le Cam began to take courses at the University of Paris.</li>
<li>Asking Darmois for advice on getting a job, Le Cam was advised that Électricité de France were looking for statisticians.</li>
<li>However, one of the examiners thought (incorrectly) that the proof was wrong and Le Cam was given a bare pass.</li>
<li>Let us record at this point that Lucien and Louise Le Cam had three children: Denis, Steven, and Linda.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate, Le Cam was appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics and Junior Research Statistician at the University of California, Berkeley.</li>
<li>Let us now look at some of the books that Le Cam has published, all in the area of modern asymptotic theory of statistical inference of which he is one of the founders.</li>
<li>Although Le Cam made deep highly mathematical contributions to statistics, we should not give the impression that all his work was of this type.</li>
<li>Le Cam's extraordinary knowledge of cancer quickly gained the respect of the attending physicians and some of the people at the Mayo Clinic.</li>
<li>Le Cam was honoured for his many contributions in several different ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 November 1924, Croze, Creuse, France. Died 25 April 2000, Berkeley, California, USA.</p>
