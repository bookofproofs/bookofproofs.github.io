<p><strong>Vladimir Drinfeld</strong> is a Ukranian-born American mathematician best known for his work in algebraic geometry over finite fields.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gershon Ikhelevich Drinfeld (29 February 1908-18 August 2000) was educated at Kiev University and was head of the Mathematics Department at Kharkov University from 1944 to 1962.</li>
<li>Gershon Drinfeld also played a major role in the Kharkov Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>Drinfeld completed his postgraduate studies in 1977 and he defended his "candidate" thesis in 1978 at Moscow University.</li>
<li>The "candidate" thesis is the Russian equivalent of the British or American Ph.D. However, despite being extraordinarily talented, it was difficult for Drinfeld to obtain a position in Moscow.</li>
<li>Since the address which appeared in Drinfeld's passport was not Moscow, he could not get a job there.</li>
<li>Drinfeld gave an important lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berkeley in 1986.</li>
<li>Entitled Quantum groups, the talk reviewed the results obtained by Drinfeld and M Jimbo on Hopf algebras (quantum groups).</li>
<li>In 1988 Drinfeld defended his "doctor" thesis at Steklov Institute, Moscow.</li>
<li>Drinfeld's main achievements are his proof of the Langlands conjecture for GL(2)GL(2)GL(2) over a functional field; and his work in quantum group theory.</li>
<li>Although he only proved a special case of the Langlands conjecture, Drinfeld has introduced important new ideas in his solution and made a real breakthrough.</li>
<li>Drinfeld and Manin worked on the construction of instantons using ideas from algebraic geometry.</li>
<li>Drinfeld's work on Langlands conjectures, quantum groups, p-adic uniformizations etc.</li>
<li>In 1992 Drinfeld was elected a member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.</li>
<li>Alexander A Beilinson, also a student of Manin's, was appointed to the University of Chicago in 1998, just a short time before Drinfeld.</li>
<li>Beilinson and Drinfeld had known each other for many years and had already collaborated on two papers before becoming colleagues in Chicago: Affine Kac-Moody algebras and polydifferentials (1994) and Quantization of Hitchin's fibration and Langlands' program (1996).</li>
<li>One of Drinfeld's most recent articles is Infinite-dimensional vector bundles in algebraic geometry: an introduction.</li>
<li>Drinfeld was named Harry Pratt Judson Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago on 1 March 2001.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 February 1954, Kharkov, Ukraine.</p>
