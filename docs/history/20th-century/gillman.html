<p><strong>Leonard Gillman</strong> was an American mathematician who was also a classical pianist. He worked in set theory and game theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Joseph Gillman had come to the United States at the age of eighteen, having spent the years of his life up to that time in the Ukraine.</li>
<li>Leonard's mother Etta was born in Cleveland to parents who were immigrants from Poland.</li>
<li>Leonard had a younger brother, Robert David Gillman, known as Bobby, who was born in Cleveland in 1918.</li>
<li>In 1922, when Leonard was five, the family moved to Pittsburgh where his father Joseph taught at the university while working on his Ph.D. thesis in economics "Rent Levels in Pittsburgh".</li>
<li>In the autumn of 1923 Leonard, extremely talented musically, began taking piano lessons.</li>
<li>In 1926, when Leonard was nine, the family moved to New York where he spent two years in a state school.</li>
<li>Leonard's parents both took degrees from Columbia University, his mother Etta being awarded a Master's Degree in psychology while his father Joseph was awarded a Ph.D. in economics.</li>
<li>After two years at the state school, Leonard entered The Walden School, a small progressive school on West 68th  Street in Manhattan.</li>
<li>He was in the same class as Reba Marcus, whom he married nine years later, and Ellis Kolchin who, like Gillman, became a mathematics professor.</li>
<li>Gillman had always loved mathematics in addition to his passion for music.</li>
<li>Gillman and Kolchin, who were close friends, approached their teacher in their final year at High School (1932-33) and told him they wanted to study more mathematics than the school was offering.</li>
<li>After graduating from High School in 1933, Gillman sat the scholarship examination for the Graduate School of the Juilliard School of Music in New York.</li>
<li>In the spring of 1934, in addition to his studies at the Juilliard School, Gillman began to take courses at Columbia University.</li>
<li>It was not only mathematics that Gillman studied at Columbia, for he also took more French courses, as well as courses on Psychology, German, English Composition and History.</li>
<li>In December 1938 Gillman married Reba Marcus who had graduated from Bennington College where she had majored in music.</li>
<li>At first they made their home with Gillman's parents but soon were able to move into an apartment of their own near Columbia University.</li>
<li>Leonard and Reba Gillman's first child, Jonathan, was born in the autumn of 1942.</li>
<li>Gillman spent a second year (1959-60) at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton supported by an NSF Senior Post-Doctoral Fellowship.</li>
<li>The Mathematical Association of America published Gillman's booklet You'll Need Math (1967), aimed at high school students, and his booklet Writing mathematics well: a manual for authors (1987).</li>
<li>During his career, Gillman received several honours for his contributions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 8 January 1917, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Died 7 April 2009, Austin, Texas, USA.</p>
