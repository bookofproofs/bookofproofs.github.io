<p><strong>Rafael Artzy</strong> was an Israeli mathematician, born in what was then Germany and is now Russia. He worked in geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Let us refer to him, however, as Artzy throughout this biography.</li>
<li>Artzy attended schools in Königsberg, graduating in 1930.</li>
<li>After arriving in Jerusalem, Artzy began studying at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and he was awarded the degree of Master of Arts in 1934.</li>
<li>The Haganah movement was a Jewish paramilitary organisation which, by the time Artzy arrived in Jerusalem, had begun to acquire foreign arms and also to create their own in workshops.</li>
<li>Despite these hindrances to Artzy's research efforts, he was awarded his doctorate in 1945 from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem for his thesis Minimum nets in abstract webs written in Hebrew with an English summary.</li>
<li>In 1951 Artzy was appointed to an assistantship at Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa.</li>
<li>Artzy sailed from Haifa on 2 August 1956 on the ship 'Israel' arriving in New York on 16 August.</li>
<li>Artzy only held the position at the University of North Carolina for a year before moving to Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey where he was appointed as a full professor holding that position from 1961 to 1965.</li>
<li>Professor Artzy was the department's second chairman, and later became a dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences.</li>
<li>In the early 1970's, Professor Artzy organized the first International Geometry Conference in Haifa, and kept the tradition of holding a conference once every four years, until the late 1990's, a task which he taught me how to efficiently organize, sometimes in a rather unconventional way.</li>
<li>Artzy, as well as an organiser of the conference, was an editor of the Proceedings along with Izu Vaisman.</li>
<li>Artzy wrote two important books, namely Linear Geometry (1965) and Geometry.</li>
<li>Elly Artzy died in 2010.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 July 1912, Königsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 22 August 2006, Haifa, Israel.</p>
