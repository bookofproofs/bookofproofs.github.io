<p><strong>Yakov Grigorevich Sinai </strong>is a Russian mathematician known for his work on dynamical systems.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>However the family had strong mathematical connections since Yakov Grigorevich's grandfather (Nadezda Kagan's father) was Benjamin Fedorovich Kagan, the Head of the Department of Differential Geometry at Moscow State University where he founded an important School of Differential Geometry.</li>
<li>He retired from his chair at Moscow State University in 1952, the year in which his grandson Yakov Grigorevich entered the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics.</li>
<li>Sinai's first advisor at Moscow State University was Nikolai Guryevich Chetaev who was an expert on analytical mechanics, particularly on stability of motion.</li>
<li>Sinai quickly became interested in the dynamical systems on which Chetaev worked.</li>
<li>The problem which Dynkin suggested that Sinai work on, led to his first paper On the distribution of the first positive sum for a sequence of independent random variables (Russian) (1957).</li>
<li>In 1957 Sinai was awarded his first degree from Moscow State University and began to undertake research for his Master's Degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.) working with Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov.</li>
<li>Sinai's papers published around the time he was working for his Master's Degree include: On the concept of entropy for a dynamic system (Russian) (1959); Flows with finite entropy (1959) (Russian); The central limit theorem for geodesic flows on manifolds of constant negative curvature (1960) (Russian); and Dynamical systems and stationary Markov processes (1960) (Russian).</li>
<li>Already, in the first of these 1959 papers, Sinai gives theorems which make it possible to calculate the entropy for a large variety of dynamical systems.</li>
<li>Sinai was the first to come up with a mathematical foundation for determining the number that defines the complexity of a given dynamical system.</li>
<li>His mathematical system is called Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.</li>
<li>The high quality and importance of Sinai's papers led to him being invited to lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm in 1962.</li>
<li>In 1971, following Sergei Petrovich Novikov's advice, Sinai accepted a position as Senior Researcher at the L D Landau Institute of Theoretical Physics of the USSR Academy of Sciences.</li>
<li>Sinai continued to teach at Moscow State University but he did not become a professor there until 1981.</li>
<li>Sinai suffered much for his support of Volpin.</li>
<li>Sinai was able to accept the invitation, however, to deliver one of the plenary lectures at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Kyoto in 1990; he spoke on Hyperbolic Billiards.</li>
<li>We have already looked the deep contribution made by which Sinai early in his career.</li>
<li>Sinai's work centres round the grand aim of deriving the basic physical laws which describe the behaviour of many particle systems as a direct consequence of simple rules governing the interaction of individual particles.</li>
<li>The idea of applying the Kolmogorov theory of entropy to smooth dynamical systems was Sinai's.</li>
<li>Sinai laid the foundations of the theory of billiards, for which he has more recently also constructed Markov partitions, and of the motion of a hard sphere gas.</li>
<li>In recent years, Sinai has made important contributions to KAM theory using renormalisation methods.</li>
<li>Sinai has received many major awards, prizes and honours for his remarkable contributions.</li>
<li>Statistical mechanics is one of the most active and rewarding areas of modern mathematics, and Yakov Sinai is its recognized leader today.</li>
<li>Many mathematical societies and academies have elected Sinai to membership or honorary membership: the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1983); the USSR Academy of Sciences (1991); the London Mathematical Society (1992); the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1993); the United States National Academy of Sciences (1999); the Brazilian Academy of Sciences (2000); the Academia Europaea (2008); and the Royal Society of London (2009).</li>
<li>Sinai has also been invited to give many prestigious lectures or lecture courses including: Loeb Lecturer, Harvard University (1978); Plenary Speaker at the International Congress on Mathematical Physics in Berlin (1981); Plenary Speaker at the International Congress on Mathematical Physics in Marseilles (1986); Distinguished Lecturer, Israel (1989); Solomon Lefschetz Lectures, Mexico (1990); Plenary Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians, Kyoto (1990); Landau Lectures, Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1993); Plenary Speaker at the First Latin American Congress in Mathematics (2000); Plenary Speaker at the American Mathematical Society Meeting "Challenges in Mathematics" (2000); Andreevski Lectures, Berlin, Germany (2001); Bowen Lectures, University of California at Berkeley (2001); Leonidas Alaoglu Memorial Lecture, California Institute of Technology (2002); Joseph Fels Ritt Lectures, Columbia University (2004); Leonardo da Vinci Lecture, Milan, Italy (2006); Galileo Chair, Pisa, Italy (2006); John T Lewis Lecture Series, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and the Hamilton Mathematics Institute, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland (2007); and Milton Brockett Porter Lecture Series, Rice University, Houston, Texas (2007).</li>
<li>Yakov Grigorievich Sinai is married to Elen B Vul who is a mathematician and physicist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 September 1935, Moscow, Russia.</p>
