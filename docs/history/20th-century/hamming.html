<p><strong>Richard Hamming</strong> was an American mathematician and computer scientist, best known for the so-called  <em>Hamming code</em>.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a paper published in Acta Mathematica in 1936, Trjitzinsky studied linear differential systems with two point boundary conditions of a particular type and Hamming extended this work in his thesis.</li>
<li>In particular, Hamming investigated the Green's function and also the characteristic solutions for which he obtained asymptotic expressions.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate, Hamming married Wanda Little on 5 September 1942.</li>
<li>However by the time that Hamming was recruited to the project it was being undertaken at Los Alamos.</li>
<li>In addition to Shannon and Tukey, some other young mathematicians had joined the Mathematical Research Department at Bell Labs just before Hamming.</li>
<li>These included Donald Percy Ling (1912-1981) and Brockway McMillan (1915-) who had been at Los Alamos at the same time as Hamming.</li>
<li>Hamming is best known for his work on error-detecting and error-correcting codes.</li>
<li>Hamming codes, Hamming distance and Hamming metric are standard terms used today in coding theory but they are also used in many other areas of mathematics.</li>
<li>How did Hamming come to do this work?</li>
<li>In fact it was in 1947 when Hamming set computers at Bell Labs to work on a particular problem over the weekend.</li>
<li>Hamming thought out a way not only to determine if a single error had occurred but also, by adding extra parity checks, to detect where it had occurred.</li>
<li>Work in codes is related to packing problems and the error-correcting codes discovered by Hamming led to the solution of a packing problem for matrices over finite fields.</li>
<li>In 1956 Hamming worked on the early computer, the IBM 650.</li>
<li>Hamming also worked on numerical analysis, integrating differential equations, and the Hamming spectral window which is much used in computation for smoothing data before Fourier analysing it.</li>
<li>Hamming has received many awards for his pioneering work.</li>
<li>The IEEE named a medal "The Richard W.</li>
<li>In 1996, in Munich, Hamming received the prestigious $130,000 Eduard Rheim Award for Achievement in Technology for his work on error correcting codes.</li>
<li>In 1997 Hamming retired from teaching at the Naval Postgraduate School and was made Distinguished Professor Emeritus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 February 1915, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Died 7 January 1998, Monterey, California, USA.</p>
