<p><strong>Hyman Bass</strong> is an American mathematician, known for work in algebra and in mathematics education.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>They had a large family with Hyman being the seventh of his parents eight children.</li>
<li>It consisted of four girls, including Madeleine and Sylvia, all older than Hyman, and four boys, Leon and Manuel being older than Hyman, with Isaac the youngest in the family.</li>
<li>His older brothers and sisters were old enough to serve in the war and this was to have a major influence on Hyman.</li>
<li>The family, including Hyman, moved to Los Angeles at this time.</li>
<li>When the time was approaching for Bass to begin university studies he asked his brother Manuel for advice.</li>
<li>Bass won a scholarship to enable him to attend, then entered Princeton thinking that he would probably major in physics.</li>
<li>One of the courses in which Bass enrolled in his first year of study was a calculus course lectured by Emil Artin and tutored by Serge Lang and John Tate.</li>
<li>Bass graduated from Princeton with a B.A. in 1955 and then went to the University of Chicago as an NSF graduate fellow to study for his Masters Degree.</li>
<li>Inspired by Irving Kaplansky, after the award of an M.S. in 1956, Bass undertook work for his doctorate under his supervision.</li>
<li>Bass gave explicit descriptions of the finite monadic algebras in his first paper, showing they were in one-one correspondence to finite sets of positive integers.</li>
<li>The natural route for Bass to take at this stage would have been to take up a fellowship at the Institute for Advanced Study and concentrate solely on research.</li>
<li>However Samuel Eilenberg was at Columbia University in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, New York and he persuaded Bass to take a teaching job there.</li>
<li>Bass produced a series of papers during his first years at Columbia, for example Finitistic dimension and a homological generalization of semiprimary  rings (1960), Projective modules over algebras (1961), Injective dimension in noetherian rings (1962), and Torsion free and projective modules (1962).</li>
<li>Bass spent the year 1963-64 as an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the College de France.</li>
<li>Bass served as Associate Professor and Chair at Barnard during 1964-65.</li>
<li>During his period as professor, Bass was a Guggenheim Fellow at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques in Paris during the year 1968-69, then served as Chair of the Department of Mathematics at Columbia University from 1975 to 1979.</li>
<li>We have mentioned some areas of Bass's work above, but let us note that he himself gives his research interests as algebraic K-theory; number theory; group theory (geometric methods); and algebraic geometry.</li>
<li>To many people, Bass is best known for his classic text Algebraic K-theory published in 1968.</li>
<li>For this outstanding book Bass was awarded the Van Amringe Prize from Columbia University in the year following its publication.</li>
<li>Bass has visited many leading institutions around the world, spending varying periods of time.</li>
<li>Although Bass was interested in mathematical education throughout his career, this interest took a different turn in 1991 when he was invited to join the Mathematical Sciences Education Board at the National Academy of Sciences.</li>
<li>Finally we mention that Bass has served the American Mathematical Society in many roles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 October 1932, Houston, Texas, USA.</p>
