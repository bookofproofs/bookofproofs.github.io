<p><strong>Alan Baker</strong> was an English mathematician, known for his work in number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>He moved on to Trinity College Cambridge where he was awarded an M.A. Continuing his research at Cambridge advised by Harold Davenport, Baker began publishing papers.</li>
<li>From 1964 to 1968 Baker was a research fellow at Cambridge, then becoming Director of Studies in Mathematics, a post which he held from 1968 until 1974 when he was appointed Professor of Pure Mathematics.</li>
<li>Baker was awarded a Fields Medal in 1970 at the International Congress at Nice.</li>
<li>Among the relevant profound contributions are those of Alan Baker, Wolfgang M Schmidt, and Vladimir Gennadievich Sprindzuk.</li>
<li>Among these, Baker's have had the heaviest impact on other problems in mathematics.</li>
<li>Baker however went further and produced results which, at least in principle, could lead to a complete solution of this type of problem.</li>
<li>Among Baker's famous books are: Transcendental number theory (1975), Transcendence theory : advances and applications (1977), A concise introduction to the theory of numbers (1984), (with Gisbert Wüstholz) Logarithmic forms and Diophantine geometry (2007), and A Comprehensive Course in Number Theory (2012).</li>
<li>However, this book gives the necessary intuitive background to study the original journal articles of Baker, Masser, Wüstholz and others on the above-listed subjects.</li>
<li>Baker also edited the important New advances in transcendence theory (1988) and wrote the important survey with Gisbert Wüstholz entitled Number theory, transcendence and Diophantine geometry in the next millennium.</li>
<li>In 1999 a conference was organised in Zürich to celebrate Baker's 60th  birthday.</li>
<li>Most of the lectures given at the meetings were published in A Panorama in Number Theory or The View from Baker's Garden (2002).</li>
<li>The London Mathematical Society was represented by its President, Professor Martin Taylor, and it sent greetings to Alan Baker on the occasion of his 60th  birthday.</li>
<li>Baker has received many honours for his mathematical contributions in addition to the 1970 Fields medal.</li>
<li>Outside of mathematics, Baker lists his interests as travel, photography and the theatre.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 August 1939, London, England. Died 4 February 2018, Cambridge, England.</p>
