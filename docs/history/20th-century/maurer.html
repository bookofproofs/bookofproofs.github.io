<p><strong>Gyula Maurer</strong> was a Hungarian mathematician (born in what is now Romania) who worked in group theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gyula was born in Târnăveni, a town in Transylvania.</li>
<li>Maurer's family were ethnic Hungarians and he grew up as a native Hungarian speaker.</li>
<li>Maurer attended secondary school in Cluj (known also by its German name, Klausenburg, and its Hungarian name Kolozsvár) and in Cristuru Secuiesc (Hungarian name Székelykeresztúr) in eastern Transylvania.</li>
<li>Maurer graduated from Bethlen College in 1945.</li>
<li>In 1946 Maurer began his university studies at Bolyai University in Cluj.</li>
<li>There is a quite complicated story of the Hungarian and Romanian universities in Cluj (and even the name of the city of Cluj, which was renamed Cluj-Napoca in the Ceausescu era) and we now give a short history of the Bolyai University that Maurer entered.</li>
<li>Maurer studied mathematics and physics at Bolyai University and his lecturers soon realised that their student was extremely talented.</li>
<li>Maurer graduated in 1949 and was appointed as a teaching assistant at Bolyai University.</li>
<li>Maurer married Eva Nyilas; they had two children, Gyula (born 1951) and Adám József (born 1954).</li>
<li>Maurer taught algebra courses and in the academic year 1954-55 be gave his course to students of the Hungarian Bolyai University and the students of the Romanian Babeș University.</li>
<li>Maurer had been employed as a teaching assistant at first but later he was promoted to assistant professor.</li>
<li>At this time Maurer lost his job at Bolyai University.</li>
<li>Again this process was not achieved without opposition from some but after the new Babeș-Bolyai University was created, Maurer was appointed in 1960.</li>
<li>Maurer had been appointed to Bolyai University in 1949 without ever having obtained his doctorate but, after he was appointed to the new Babeș-Bolyai University, he worked towards that degree.</li>
<li>His thesis advisor was Grigore C Moisil (1906-1973), from the University of Bucharest, and, in 1967, Maurer was awarded the degree for his thesis Algebraische Strukturen, auf denen Topologien vermittels von Präordnungsrelationen eingeführt sind Ⓣ(Algebraic structures on which topologies are introduced by means of preorder relations).</li>
<li>In 1984 his sons Gyula Maurer and Adám József Maurer moved from Romania to Hungary.</li>
<li>When Maurer retired in the following year from his position at Babeș-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca he followed his sons to Hungary and took up a position at the University of Miskolc (University of Heavy Industry in Miskolc), where he was appointed full professor and director of the Institute of Mathematics.</li>
<li>Undeterred by the political problems, Maurer pressed ahead with his idea, supported by Hans Sachs from the University of Mining and Metallurgy of Leoben in Austria.</li>
<li>Maurer and Sachs became the first editors of the journal which has produced two issues per years since it was founded.</li>
<li>Maurer died in Maglód, near Budapest, and after being cremated, on 28 January 2012 the urn containing his ashes was buried in the family grave at the Central Házsongárdi Cemetery in Cluj-Napoca.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 January 1927, Târnăveni, Romania. Died 8 January 2012, Maglód, near Budapest, Hungary.</p>
