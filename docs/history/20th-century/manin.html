<p><strong>Yuri Ivanovich Manin</strong> was a Soviet  mathematician, known for work in algebraic geometry and diophantine geometry. He also wrote on mathematical logic, computing and theoretical physics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 1963 Manin submitted his habilitation thesis to the Steklov Mathematical Institute and two years later, in 1965, he was appointed Professor of Algebra at Moscow State University.</li>
<li>Manin presented a paper Rational surfaces and Galois cohomology  in which he gave a survey of results, mainly due to himself, on classifying rational algebraic surfaces.</li>
<li>The breadth of Manin's contributions have been remarkable.</li>
<li>Let us look now at some of the books that Manin has published.</li>
<li>In 1984 Manin published Linear algebra and geometry in Russian, it was translated into English in 1997.</li>
<li>Manin, in collaboration with A A Panchishkin, published Introduction to number theory in Russian in 1990 (English translation 1995, with a second edition in 2005).</li>
<li>Other books by Manin include Cubic forms: algebra, geometry, arithmetic (Russian) (1972), A course in mathematical logic (1977), Computable and noncomputable (Russian) (1980), Quantum groups and noncommutative geometry (1988), Topics in noncommutative geometry (1991), Frobenius manifolds, quantum cohomology, and moduli spaces (1999).</li>
<li>In our list above we have not mentioned Manin's fascinating book Mathematics and physics (1981).</li>
<li>Manin has received, and continues to receive, many hoours for his outstanding mathematicl contributions.</li>
<li>Three issues of the Moscow Mathematical Journal  where dedicated to Manin for his 65th  birthday.</li>
<li>Manin has published research and expository papers in literature, linguistics, glotto-genesis, mythology, semiotics, physics, history of culture, and philosophy of science.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 16 February 1937, Simferopol, Crimean Autonomous Soviet Republic (now Ukraine -- occupied by Russia). Died 8 January 2023.</p>
