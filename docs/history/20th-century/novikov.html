<p><strong>Petr Sergeevich Novikov</strong> is a Russian mathematician known for his work on combinatorial problems in group theory including the word problem for groups and the Burnside problem.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>However, even before Novikov entered university, the Russian nation had been plunged into civil war.</li>
<li>In the spring of 1920, with the civil war still raging, Novikov joined the Red Army.</li>
<li>Novikov graduated in 1929 and then taught at the Moscow Chemical Technology Institute until he joined the Department of Real Function Theory at the Steklov Institute in 1934.</li>
<li>Novikov headed the Department of Analysis at Moscow State Teachers Training Institute from 1944.</li>
<li>In 1957 Novikov set up a new department at the Steklov Institute, namely the Department of Mathematical Logic, and he was appointed as the first head of that department.</li>
<li>Novikov showed, in 1952, that the word problem for groups is insoluble.</li>
<li>The problem was first posed by Dehn in 1912 and Novikov was able to show that no such algorithm exists in general.</li>
<li>Novikov was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1957 for this outstanding piece of work.</li>
<li>In fact Boone published another proof of this result in 1957, the same year that Novikov received his prize.</li>
<li>The word problem was not the only problem of major importance in combinatorial group theory which Novikov solved.</li>
<li>Although in 1959 Novikov announced that for every n&gt;71n &gt; 71n&gt;71 there exists a finitely generated infinite group with every element of order dividing nnn, his proof was not quite correct.</li>
<li>Novikov's argument of 1959 was correct in general terms but the details were not, and in putting the arguments right it was found that one required larger values of nnn.</li>
<li>In 1968 Novikov and Adian jointly published a proof B(d,n)B(d, n)B(d,n) is infinite for every d&gt;1d &gt; 1d&gt;1 and every n&gt;4380n &gt; 4380n&gt;4380.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 August 1901, Moscow, Russia. Died 9 January 1975, Moscow, Russia.</p>
