<p><strong>Charles Coulson</strong>'s main area of interest was molecular physical chemistry, but he contributed to many other areas.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His father was Alfred Coulson who became Principal of Dudley Technical College and went on to become an inspector of technical colleges.</li>
<li>Annie and Alfred Coulson had two children, twin sons Charles and John.</li>
<li>The family were Methodists and Charles and his brother were brought up in a very religious home; Charles' whole attitude to life was dominated by his Christian upbringing.</li>
<li>Charles was educated in Dudley up to the age of ten at which time his father joined the technical college inspectorate for south-west England and the family moved to Bristol.</li>
<li>Shortly after their marriage the couple moved to Dundee where Coulson was appointed as senior lecturer in mathematics at Queen's College, part of the University of St Andrews.</li>
<li>As a devout Methodist, Coulson was a conscientious objector during World War II.</li>
<li>In 1941 Coulson published Waves.</li>
<li>Clearly D E Rutherford, who taught applied mathematics at St Andrews, had assisted Coulson who expresses his thanks to him in the Preface.</li>
<li>In 1945 Coulson was appointed as a lecturer in mathematics at University College, Oxford, where he was also a fellow at the Physical Chemistry Laboratory.</li>
<li>Coulson thanks E T Copson in the Preface of the book for his help in preparing the text.</li>
<li>Coulson left his chair in London in 1952 when he was appointed Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford where he was also made a fellow of Wadham College.</li>
<li>In 1970 Coulson underwent an operation for cancer of the prostate.</li>
<li>In fact Coulson was elected President of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications in 1972 and held this position until his death.</li>
<li>Coulson was a talented expositor and this is demonstrated in all his works such as Waves and Electricity which we made special mention of above, and also his best-selling work Valence published in 1952.</li>
<li>Many honours were thrust on Coulson for his outstanding contributions to mathematics and chemistry.</li>
<li>However, one must not think that, because Coulson undertook such a massive amount of scientific work, he would have no time for other activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 13 December 1910, Dudley, near Birmingham, England. Died 7 January 1974, Oxford, England.</p>
