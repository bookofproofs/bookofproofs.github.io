<p><strong>Anna Stafford Henriques</strong> was an American mathematician who became one of the first two women to undertake research at the Institute for Advanced Study. She worked at several universities concentrating on teaching.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>This school, which opened in 1909, was in Union Boulevard and Anna graduated from the school in 1922.</li>
<li>However, Stafford was keen to continue her mathematical education in addition to her job as a high school teacher so, every summer between 1927 and 1931 she attended graduate school at the University of Chicago.</li>
<li>While studying for her Master's Degree Stafford had attended a topology lecture given by Raymond Wilder and realised that this was the topic that interested her.</li>
<li>Mayme Logsdon knew little about topology but she had agreed to advise Stafford so the two studied topology together using a handwritten Italian topology text.</li>
<li>Stafford was not unhappy to see that the notes were in Italian since her ability with languages was high and she simply learnt Italian before reading the notes.</li>
<li>After the award of her Ph.D. in August 1933, Stafford was formally accepted by the Institute for Advanced Study and spent two years there.</li>
<li>While singing in a local choir in Salt Lake City, she met Douglas Emmanuel Henriques.</li>
<li>My best mathematics teacher was Anna Henriques, who taught me college algebra and analytic geometry.</li>
<li>In 1941, before her marriage, Stafford had been promoted to assistant professor.</li>
<li>The Mathematics Club at the University of Utah had ceased to function so, in 1946, Henriques brought the club back to life.</li>
<li>Douglas Henriques had worked in Utah for around twenty years but, in 1956, his work for the US Department of the Interior meant that he had to move to New Mexico.</li>
<li>In 1958, in addition to her position at St Michael's College, Henriques took on a second position as a lecturer in mathematics at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.</li>
<li>In 1962 Henriques was promoted to professor at St Michael's College and, at that time, resigned from her second position at the University of New Mexico.</li>
<li>Henriques taught there until she retired in 1971.</li>
<li>Douglas and Anna Henriques, both being retired, now had the freedom to travel widely around every continent and they made full use of the opportunity.</li>
<li>When in her 90s, Henriques was living in the Goodwin House retirement home in Bailey's Crossroads in Virginia.</li>
<li>In addition to her love of mathematics and astronomy, and for bowling and travelling which we have already mentioned, Henriques loved to climb mountains and go hiking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 20 August 1905, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Died 28 November 2004, Baileys Crossroads, Virginia, USA.</p>
