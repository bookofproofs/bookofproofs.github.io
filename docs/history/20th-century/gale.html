<h1>Person: Gale, David</h1>

<p><strong>David Gale</strong> was an American mathematician and economist who worked in  mathematical economics, game theory, and convex analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Developed the Gale-Shapley algorithm for matching in two-sided markets, notably in the field of matching medical students to hospitals.</li>
<li>Researched and wrote extensively on the game of matching pennies, and his work clarified the mathematics behind the difference between cooperative and non-cooperative games.</li>
<li>Discovered the relationship between the Gale-solitary game and linear programming to bridge economic theory with models of social choice.</li>
<li>Developed the stable roommates problem and its associated solution algorithm, which provided a major optimization tool for industries.</li>
<li>First introduced the concept of a differential game and its mathematical solution, as well as co-founded the field of potential games theory. </li>
<li>Established the theory of voting games, which provided a mathematical framework for analyzing fair and effective voting mechanisms. </li>
<li>Established the Shapley value to measure the effectiveness of different voting systems, which is used in computational social choice. </li>
<li>Inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Econometric Society for his contributions to mathematics.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 13 December 1921, Manhattan, New York, USA. Died 7 March 2008, Berkeley, California, USA.</p>
