<p><strong>Hans-Joachim Bremermann</strong> was a German-born American mathematician and biophysicist who worked on computer science and the mathematical theory of evolution.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It was only when life began to return to some sort of normality after the war that Hans-Joachim was able to show his real abilities.</li>
<li>Bremermann's doctoral studies were undertaken at the University of Münster.</li>
<li>Naturally Bremermann too learned complex analysis and went on to make significant contributions to the field ...</li>
<li>In 1951 Bremermann completed his Staatsexamen in mathematics and physics.</li>
<li>In the year following the award of his doctorate Bremermann remained at Münster and taught there as an assistant.</li>
<li>The year 1957 saw Bremermann move into a new area of research when he collaborated with the physicists R Oehme and J G Taylor applying his expertise in complex analysis to work on quantum field theory.</li>
<li>In 1959 Bremermann accepted an appointment as associate professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.</li>
<li>Let us now look briefly at Bremermann's research.</li>
<li>Bremermann's thesis proved a special case of this result and subsequently he proved that the result is true in a further special case.</li>
<li>In 1954 in Über die Aquivalenz der pseudokonvexen Gebiete und der Holomorphiegebiete im Raum von n komplexen Veränderlichen Ⓣ(On the equivalence of pseudoconvex regions and domains of holomorphy in the space of n complex variables) Bremermann proved the general theorem obtaining Oka's result for nnn complex variables where n≥2n ≥ 2n≥2.</li>
<li>In 1961, in collaboration with L Durand, Bremermann produced a concrete approach to the representation of distributions by boundary values of analytic functions.</li>
<li>In 1965 Bremermann published a book Distributions, complex variables, and Fourier transforms which gave an introduction to the theory of Schwartz distributions using the approach he had developed in his earlier work.</li>
<li>Although he lived in the United States from 1952, it was not until 1965 that Bremermann became a naturalised American citizen.</li>
<li>By the 1960s Bremermann's interests had turned towards the theory of computation and evolutionary biology.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 September 1926, Bremen, Germany. Died 21 February 1996, Berkeley, California, USA.</p>
