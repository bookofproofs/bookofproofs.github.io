<p><strong>László Kalmár</strong> worked on mathematical logic and theoretical computer science. He was ackowledged as the leader of Hungarian mathematical logic.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Zsigmond Kalmár was a bailiff on an estate in Transdanubia in northwestern Hungary, the estate being located about 30 km from Lake Balaton.</li>
<li>Zsigmond Kalmár died while László was a young boy and Rósa Kalmár then moved to Budapest with László.</li>
<li>Kalmár began his secondary schooling in Budapest during World War I.</li>
<li>However, while still at secondary school Kalmár's mother also died so by the time he entered the University of Budapest in 1922 he was an orphan.</li>
<li>As a student at the University of Budapest Kalmár had teachers who were leading mathematicians so he received teaching which brought him to the cutting edge of research.</li>
<li>Kalmár would later provide important help to Péter in her career.</li>
<li>Kalmár graduated in 1927 and the direction of his work was influenced when he visited Göttingen in 1929.</li>
<li>At Szeged Kalmár acted at first as a research assistant to both Haar and Riesz.</li>
<li>In 1933 Kalmár married Erzsébet Arvay and they had four children.</li>
<li>Kalmár was appointed a full professor at Szeged in 1947.</li>
<li>Kalmár was also involved in theoretical computer science and promoted the development of computer science and the use of computers in Hungary.</li>
<li>For his outstanding contributions to mathematics and computer science Kalmár received many honours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 27 March 1905, Edde (N of Kaposvar), Hungary. Died 2 August 1976, Mátraháza, Hungary.</p>
