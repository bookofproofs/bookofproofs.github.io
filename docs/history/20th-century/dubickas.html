<p><strong>Artūras Dubickas</strong> is a Lithuanian mathematician who proved important results in number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Artūras Dubickas was born in 1964 in Tauragė, a city in western Lithuania, not far from the Baltic Sea.</li>
<li>In 1982 Dubickas graduated from Secondary School with a Gold Medal and in September of that year matriculated at Vilnius University Mathematics Department.</li>
<li>In two years Dubickas attended his first mathematical conference in Minsk, Belarus: Constructive Methods and Algorithms in Number Theory.</li>
<li>Hence most of Dubickas's fellow classmates started working in various businesses and banks, due to higher salary (they could earn 10-20 times more than doing scientific research).</li>
<li>Dubickas's first appointment was as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Probability Theory and Number Theory, a position he took up in December 1990.</li>
<li>In total Dubickas has published about 200 papers, and he is still publishing papers regularly.</li>
<li>The papers published by Dubickas cover a broad area, however three most common topics are Diophantine approximation, heights of algebraic numbers and distribution modulo one.</li>
<li>Outstanding mathematical achievements of Dubickas were noticed by the scientific community, and as a result he was awarded the Rector's Prize for Outstanding Scientific Achievements three times (in 2002, 2006 and 2013).</li>
<li>Besides being an active scientist, Dubickas is involved in organizing Olympiads for young mathematicians.</li>
<li>In addition to this, Dubickas is also a team leader of Vilnius University at the Vojtech Jarnik Mathematical Competition for students.</li>
<li>Dubickas strongly believes that it is important to encourage young mathematicians to test and apply their problem solving skills, strive for the best education and, later on, maybe contribute to the mathematical community.</li>
<li>In total Dubickas has been a scientific advisor for seven students (between 2008 and 2013), all of whom defended their PhD theses.</li>
<li>Three dissertations written by Dubickas's students were selected as the best dissertations of the year in a competition organized by Lithuanian Society of Young Researchers (Paulius Drungilas, Heights of Algebraic Numbers, in 2008, Jonas Jankauskas, Heights of Polynomials, in 2012 and A Novikas, Composite Numbers in the Sequences of Integers, in 2012).</li>
<li>Overall, Dubickas is actively involved in the mathematical community and does not only partake in scientific, but also editorial and organizational work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 27 November 1964, Tauragė, Lithuania.</p>
