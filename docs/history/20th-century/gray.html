<p><strong>Mary Gray</strong> is an American mathematician, statistician, and lawyer. She has written on mathematics, education, computer science, statistics and academic freedom.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In fact Mary was part of an extended family since her father's brother had married her mother's sister and they had one child, a son who was one year older than Mary.</li>
<li>Three of Mary's grandparents had been born in Nebraska, while the fourth had emigrated to Nebraska from Germany.</li>
<li>Mary's parents encouraged her to learn when she was young.</li>
<li>They taught her history and Mary's father was asking her mental arithmetic questions when she was five.</li>
<li>At this stage Wheat's mother took a job working in Hastings College cafeteria to help support the family and, after graduating from high school, Wheat became a student at Hastings College.</li>
<li>Her talent for mathematics had already been recognised but it was Standley who suggested to Wheat that she go on to postgraduate work.</li>
<li>Wheat graduated from Hastings College in 1959 having taken mathematics and physics as major subjects.</li>
<li>Returning to the United States after a year, Wheat began graduate studies at the University of Kansas.</li>
<li>After graduating, she married Alfred Gray, also a mathematician, whom she had met while at the University of Kansas.</li>
<li>Her husband was appointed to the University of California at Berkeley while Mary Gray taught a course at Berkeley during the summer and then was appointed to the California State University at Hayward.</li>
<li>In the following year Mary and her husband moved.</li>
<li>He was appointed to the University of Maryland and she was appointed to the American University in Washington.</li>
<li>Gray has done much to support the role of women mathematicians.</li>
<li>It was a role which Gray undertook with determination.</li>
<li>Gray, who had read the by-laws, correctly explained that this was not specified but was told that members did not attend because of a gentleman's agreement.</li>
<li>She then said, "I'm not a gentleman, I'm staying." Later Gray was elected to the Council and in 1976 was elected the second female vice president (the first was Charlotte Scott seventy years earlier).</li>
<li>A good example of Gray's views is given in the article Gender and mathematics: mythology and misogyny  which she published in 1996 as a chapter in the book Towards gender equity in mathematics education (Kluwer Acad.</li>
<li>In addition to her mathematics, through the 1970s Gray studied law, receiving a law degree with distinction from Washington College of Law in 1979.</li>
<li>Of the awards which Gray has received we mention two in particular.</li>
<li>During this same period, Mary was working to insure broader membership participation in the established mathematical societies.</li>
<li>In 1976, Mary became the second woman Vice President of the Society (nominated by petition) and the first in seventy years.</li>
<li>On an even broader front, Mary has been active on Committee W, the Committee on Women of the American Association of University Professors, serving as its chair from 1973 until 1978 and again since 1986.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 April 1939, Hastings, Nebraska, USA.</p>
