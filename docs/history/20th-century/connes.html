<p><strong>Alain Connes</strong> is a French mathematician and theoretical physicist who works in operator algebras and noncommutative geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After graduating, Connes became a researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.</li>
<li>Connes spent the academic year 1974-75 at Queen's University in Ontario Canada.</li>
<li>Connes still holds this professorship.</li>
<li>In 1981 Connes returned to the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, this time as its director of research.</li>
<li>Connes currently holds both the position in the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques and the one in the Collège de France.</li>
<li>One of the first major international distinctions for Connes was an invitation to give one of the invited lectures at the International Congress in Helsinki in 1978.</li>
<li>Four years later the award of a Fields Medal to Connes was announced at a meeting of the General Assembly of the International Mathematical Union in Warsaw in early August 1982.</li>
<li>Lectures on the work of Connes which led to his receiving the Medal were made at the 1983 International Congress.</li>
<li>After describing these contributions, Araki also notes other work of Connes such as his applications of operator algebras to differential geometry and his work on non-commutative integration theory which he published in 1979.</li>
<li>Connes' recent work has been on noncommutative geometry and he published a major text on the topic in 1994.</li>
<li>the incredible power of Alain Connes and the richness of his contributions.</li>
<li>Connes has received many awards for his work.</li>
<li>Connes continues to hold the Léon Motchane Chair at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques and the Chair of Analysis and Geometry in the Collège de France.</li>
<li>In addition to these awards we note that Connes has been given honorary doctorates by Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada (1979), the University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy (1997), and the University of Oslo, Norway (1999).</li>
