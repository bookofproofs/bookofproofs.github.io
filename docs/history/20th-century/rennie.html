<h1>Person: Rennie, Basil Cameron</h1>

<p><strong>Basil Rennie</strong> was an English mathematician who moved to Australia and worked on topics in both pure and applied mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>He attended University College School, an excellent school which was founded as part of University College, London about 100 years before Basil studied there.</li>
<li>Rennie's lecture notes taken while attending this course still exist.</li>
<li>Rennie graduated with an MA from Cambridge in 1941.</li>
<li>Rennie took a job with Rolls Royce Aero Engine division, then moved to the Austin Motor Works.</li>
<li>Given the engineering background from which Rennie had come it is perhaps surprising that his research topic was lattice theory.</li>
<li>Soon after he arrived in Adelaide, Rennie met Barbara Andrews who was a secretary in the Department of Engineering.</li>
<li>We should recount how Rennie came to use the name David Cameron for some of his papers.</li>
<li>First we should note that Rennie never looked to enhance his reputation - nothing could have been further from the way he looked at life.</li>
<li>Elliott made some substantial suggestions and Rennie wanted to include him as an author of the paper.</li>
<li>However Elliott did not feel that he should become a joint author but, as a compromise suggested that the paper be published under the pseudonym David Cameron, thus taking one of his names and one of Rennie's names.</li>
<li>This Rennie accepted and continued to publish various articles under this name.</li>
<li>To understand the range of Rennie's interests, let us look at a few papers he published during the period 1959-63.</li>
<li>In 1962 Rennie left the University of Adelaide and accepted a professorship in the Air Force Academy at Point Cook, Victoria.</li>
<li>Rennie held the chair of mathematics at this University until he retired in 1986.</li>
<li>One of Rennie's most important contributions to Australian mathematics was when he set up the James Cook Mathematical Notes.</li>
<li>Easily the most famous was Paul Erdős, who came to Townsville to see Basil on many occasions.</li>
<li>These were all written by Basil Rennie.</li>
<li>After Rennie died the Notes ceased publication.</li>
<li>After he retired, Rennie continued to publish on a wide variety of topics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 December 1920, London, England. Died 15 November 1996, Adelaide, Australia.</p>
