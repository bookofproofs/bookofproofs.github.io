<h1>Person: Tinbergen, Jan</h1>

<p><strong>Jan Tinbergen</strong> was a Dutch economist who was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Economics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jan's other two siblings were Jacomiena (born 1905) and Dik (born 1909).</li>
<li>Jan attended primary school gaining a certificate stating he was "a most excellent pupil".</li>
<li>These schools allowed entry to the university system after passing additional examinations in Latin and Greek and this Tinbergen did.</li>
<li>In fact some of Tinbergen's first publications were articles he wrote for the socialist newspaper Het Volk in which he examined the effects of the economic depression of 1920-22 on unemployment and how the lives of the poor had been affected.</li>
<li>After completing his undergraduate degree at Leiden, Tinbergen continued to study at Leiden for his doctorate under Ehrenfest's supervision.</li>
<li>Tinbergen was assigned to an administrative position at Rotterdam State prison where he was to serve for fifteen months.</li>
<li>Tinbergen submitted his thesis Minimumproblemen in de natuurkunde en de ekonomie Ⓣ(Minimum problems in physics and in economics) in 1929.</li>
<li>The importance of this work of Tinbergen was that it was one of the first examples of a new idea in mathematics, namely mathematical modelling.</li>
<li>Of course mathematical physics had been studied throughout the history of mathematics but Tinbergen's work saw a new path for the applications of mathematics, where the applications could be to a wide variety of areas.</li>
<li>Tinbergen, who had only just finished his dissertation and entered the staff of statisticians, was given charge of this new unit.</li>
<li>Clearly influenced by the German business cycle research institutes in Berlin and Frankfurt, Tinbergen gradually tried to develop an empirical approach to dynamic problems in economics.</li>
<li>This plan was based on Tinbergen's mathematically based principles of economics.</li>
<li>In his contribution to the debate Tinbergen projected a 'quantitative stylising of the Dutch economy' to isolate the important factors and their effects by means of a set of definitions and equations.</li>
<li>In the late 1930s Tinbergen worked as a scientific advisor for the League of Nations.</li>
<li>Tinbergen was given two years leave of absence from the Central Bureau of Statistics in which to undertake this work.</li>
<li>It is a pity that Tinbergen's work received such shabby critical treatment by Keynes (in 1939), but being the kind person that he was, he expressed no ill will towards Keynes.</li>
<li>Tinbergen's reply to Keynes was in his paper On a Method of Statistical Research.</li>
<li>Tinbergen later developed other econometric models, in particular he constructed an econometric model of the USA.</li>
<li>That man is Jan Tinbergen.</li>
<li>Jan Tinbergen is an unassuming man, who does not trumpet his achievements to the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 12 April 1903, The Hague, The Netherlands. Died 9 June 1994, The Hague, The Netherlands.</p>
