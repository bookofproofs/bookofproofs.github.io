<p><strong>Gladys Mackenzie</strong> graduated from the University of Edinburgh and became an assistant in the Natural Philosophy department. She moved to Newnham College Cambridge and late to Bristol University and Queen Elizabeth College London. She published papers on X-ray spectroscopy.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gladys attended Craigmount School, Edinburgh, from 1913 to 1919 and, in passing, we note a news item which tell us that in 1914 she took part in "a fancy dress frolic for children under twelve dressed as a Normandy Peasant." She sat the Scottish Leaving Certificate Examinations and obtained passes at Higher level in English, French, Latin, and Mathematics, having obtained a pass in Lower mathematics in the previous year.</li>
<li>In 1919 Mackenzie matriculated in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Edinburgh giving Church of Scotland as her Religious Denomination.</li>
<li>After working in Edinburgh for two years, Mackenzie was appointed to a Lectureship in Physics at Newnham College, Cambridge in 1926.</li>
<li>Miss Mackenzie graduated with First-Class Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy as recently as 1924.</li>
<li>Miss Mackenzie is an M.A. and B.Sc. of Edinburgh University, and she was a demonstrator in the Physics Laboratory of Edinburgh University at the time of her appointment.</li>
<li>Gladys Mackenzie joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in March 1925.</li>
<li>On 14 March 1929 Mackenzie married Wallace Russell Harper, Ph.D. who was also a physicist; they had one son.</li>
<li>Gladys Harper, now her married name, was a Bristol University Carnegie Research Scholar in 1929-30, then a Research Fellow from 1930 to 1933.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 2 May 1903, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 22 February 1989, North York, Ontario, Canada.</p>
