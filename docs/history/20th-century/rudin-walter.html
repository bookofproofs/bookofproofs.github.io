<p><strong>Walter Rudin</strong> was an Austrian-born American mathematician who worked in complex and harmonic analysis and is also known for his mathematical analysis textbooks.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>He was knighted in 1869 and chose the title von Rudin.</li>
<li>Aron Pollak von Rudin's son, Alfred, took over the match business.</li>
<li>He married Sara Lise Levi and the third of their children, Robert (born 7 January 1891) was Walter's father.</li>
<li>Robert Pollak von Rudin served in the war then, on 1 July 1920, he married Natalie Adlersberg (known as Natasza).</li>
<li>Walter was born in Vienna, the eldest of his parents' two children, having a younger sister Vera born 31 May 1925.</li>
<li>Walter did not attend kindergarten but, at age six, entered the Volksschule in Vienna.</li>
<li>Immediately, Walter's parents sent Walter and his sister Vera to Switzerland to continue their schooling.</li>
<li>After about six months, Walter's parents managed to get out of Austria and reach Switzerland.</li>
<li>Walter's father had a friend in Paris, an engineer named M Givelet, and he helped arrange work for Robert as well as visas for the whole family.</li>
<li>After being moved camps, Walter was given call-up papers for the French Army and sent to Pontivy.</li>
<li>The French told Walter that he should run off which he did and managed to reach Saint Jean-de-Luz in the south west of France.</li>
<li>Rudin spent the war years in England.</li>
<li>Walter Rubin was able to join the rest of his family in the United States towards the end of 1945 after the war ended.</li>
<li>Rudin was awarded a B.A. by Duke University in 1947 and undertook research for his doctorate advised by John Jay Gergen, who had been a student of Griffith Conrad Evans and Szolem Mandelbrojt.</li>
<li>Rudin was awarded his doctorate in 1949 for his thesis Uniqueness Theory for Laplace Series.</li>
<li>Rudin published two papers directly based on his thesis.</li>
<li>During this year at Duke University, Rudin met Mary Ellen Estill who had received a Ph.D. from the University of Texas in 1949 and was then appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics at Duke University.</li>
<li>Rudin attended the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Cambridge, Massachusetts 30 August to 6 September 1950.</li>
<li>Rudin was applying for positions in the spring of 1952 which was not easy since academic jobs were scarce.</li>
<li>Mary Ellen and Walter Rudin had four children: Catherine, Eleanor, Robert and Charles.</li>
<li>Rudin was appointed as a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1959.</li>
<li>As we have seen, Rudin's early work was on trigonometric series and holomorphic functions of one complex variable.</li>
<li>Let us look briefly at the other books which Rudin published.</li>
<li>In the late 1960s, Rudin's interests turned towards questions in the theory of several complex variables.</li>
<li>At the NSF regional conference from 1-5 June 1970, held at the University of Missouri, St Louis, Rudin gave a series of lecture which were published as Lectures on the edge-of-the-wedge theorem (1971).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 2 May 1921, Vienna, Austria. Died 20 May 2010, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.</p>
