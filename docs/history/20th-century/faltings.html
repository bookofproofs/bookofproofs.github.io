<p><strong>Gerd Faltings</strong> is a German mathematician whose work in algebraic geometry led to important results in number theory, including helping with the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Following the award of his doctorate, Faltings went to the United States where he spent a year doing postdoctoral work as a research fellow at Harvard University in 1978-79.</li>
<li>In 1979 Faltings returned to Germany, taking up an appointment as professor of mathematics at the University of Wuppertal.</li>
<li>In 1985 Faltings was appointed to the faculty at Princeton.</li>
<li>Faltings proved conjectures by Mordell, Shafarevich and Tate during 1983.</li>
<li>In 1986 Faltings received the highest honour that a young mathematician can receive when he was awarded a Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Berkeley.</li>
<li>At the Congress B Mazur gave an address describing the work by Faltings which had led to the award.</li>
<li>Faltings has been closely linked with the work leading to the final proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles.</li>
<li>However, Faltings was the natural person that Wiles turned to when he wanted an opinion on the correctness of his repair of his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in 1994.</li>
<li>In 1994 Faltings left Princeton when appointed a Scientific Member of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 28 July 1954, Gelsenkirchen-Buer, Germany.</p>
