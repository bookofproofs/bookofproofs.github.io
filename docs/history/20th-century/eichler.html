<p><strong>Martin Eichler</strong> was a German matnematician who worked in number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Martin's parents gave him his early education before he entered the Gymnasium in Gütersloh in 1923.</li>
<li>Eichler was awarded his doctorate in 1936.</li>
<li>Following the award of his doctorate, Eichler was appointed as an assistant in the Mathematical Seminar at the University of Halle.</li>
<li>Eichler was dismissed from his assistantship for political reasons but fortunately Hasse found him a temporary position as an editor for a new version of the Enzyklopädie der Mathematischen Wissenschaften Ⓣ(Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences).</li>
<li>After Eichler worked on this for a while, Hasse managed to arrange a position for him as an assistant at Göttingen.</li>
<li>It now appeared that, after a difficult period, Eichler's mathematical career was back on track thanks mainly to the efforts of Hasse.</li>
<li>Eichler was sent to Peenemünde to work at the Heeresversuchsanstalt, an extensive rocket development and test site which had been set up in 1937.</li>
<li>During this period Eichler also worked at the Technical University of Darmstadt.</li>
<li>After the war ended Eichler was eventually able to return to his university position as Göttingen which he did in 1947.</li>
<li>Eichler wrote Alexander Ostrowski.</li>
<li>Eichler's early papers include Über die Einheiten der Divisionsalgebren Ⓣ(On the units of division algebras) (1937), Einheitentheorie der einfachen Algebren Ⓣ(Theory of units of simple algebras) (1938), Über die Idealklassenzahl total definiter Quaternionenalgebren Ⓣ(On the ideal class number of totally definite quaternionic algebras) (1938).</li>
<li>Later books by Eichler include: Einführung in die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen und Funktionen Ⓣ(Introduction to the theory of algebraic numbers and functions) (1963) translated into English as Introduction to the theory of algebraic numbers and functions (1966); Projective varieties and modular forms (1971); and (coauthored with Don Zagier) The theory of Jacobi forms (1985).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 March 1912, Pinnow, Germany. Died 7 October 1992, Basel, Switzerland.</p>
