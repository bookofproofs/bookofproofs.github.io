<p><strong>David Blackwell</strong> was an American statistician and mathematician who worked in game theory, probability theory, information theory and Bayesian statistics. He was the first African-American member of the US National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Grover Blackwell worked for the Illinois Central Railroad and his job consisted of looking after the locomotives while Mabel looked after the family bringing up David, his two brothers and one sister.</li>
<li>As an African American David might well have attended one of the two racially segregated elementary schools in Centralia but, in his own words, he was fortunate to attend an integrated school.</li>
<li>In 1935, at age 16, Blackwell entered the University of Illinois.</li>
<li>University was not to be an easy time for Blackwell, however, for he soon realised that his father was having to borrow money to finance his studies.</li>
<li>After graduating Blackwell continued to study at the University of Illinois for his Master's degree which was awarded in 1939 and then for his doctorate supervised by Joseph Doob.</li>
<li>This was awarded in 1941, when Blackwell was still only 22 years old, for a thesis on Markov chains.</li>
<li>At this point Blackwell received a prestigious one year appointment as Rosenwald Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.</li>
<li>This, however, led to problems over the fact that Blackwell was a black African American.</li>
<li>The standard practice was to have Fellows of the Institute become honorary Faculty members of Princeton University but, in Blackwell's case, this caused a problem.</li>
<li>Fortunately at the time Blackwell was not fully aware of the problems his appointment was causing.</li>
<li>While at the Institute, Blackwell started to look for academic appointments.</li>
<li>Neyman strongly support his appointment but others had far too strong prejudices to allow Blackwell to be appointed.</li>
<li>In the year of his appointment Blackwell married Ann Madison.</li>
<li>By this time Blackwell's interests had turned towards statistics and in 1956 he became Chairman of the Department of Statistics.</li>
<li>It was a lecture in 1945 by Abe Girshick of the Department of Agriculture on sequential analysis which sparked Blackwell's interest in statistics.</li>
<li>Blackwell's interest in the theory of games had been heightened during three summers between 1948 and 1950 when he worked at the RAND Corporation.</li>
<li>The Cold War did much to promote interest in this type of game, and Blackwell soon became a leading expert.</li>
<li>In 1954 Blackwell was invited to address the International Congress of Mathematicians in Amsterdam.</li>
<li>Blackwell remained at the University of California until he retired in 1989.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 April 1919, Centralia, Illinois, USA. Died 8 July 2010, Berkeley, California, USA.</p>
