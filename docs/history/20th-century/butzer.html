<p><strong>Paul Butzer</strong> is a German mathematician working in approximation theory and harmonic analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anton and Wihelmine Butzer married in 1925 and moved to Mülheim an der Ruhr where Anton worked as an engineer.</li>
<li>In fact Anton Butzer took drastic steps to avoid his family becoming swept up in the Nazi wave.</li>
<li>He joined Loewy's engineering firm in London but, fearing that Paul and his younger brother Karl (about 30 months old at that time) would suffer for their father's actions, they had been sent to Gemmenich, a town in Belgium just across the border from Aachen.</li>
<li>Once their parents were settled, Paul and Karl were able to join them and, by the autumn of 1937, Paul was studying at the Jesuit Wimbledon College.</li>
<li>After a six week internment on the Isle of Man in 1940, along with his mother and brother, Butzer was able to continue schooling until the family were sent to New York where Loewy's engineering firm were opening a new branch.</li>
<li>Butzer's father got a position with a company in Montreal and in February 1941 he entered Loyola High School.</li>
<li>Butzer received an M.A. in 1949, being awarded the Sir Joseph Flavelle Prize the best performance.</li>
<li>As this time Lorentz was writing his book Berstein polynomials so work in this area was a natural choice as a topic for Butzer.</li>
<li>In 1951 Butzer was awarded a Ph.D. for his thesis On Bernstein Polynomials in which he studied classical Bernstein polynomials and their variant for integrable functions, namely Kantorovich polynomials.</li>
<li>In 1962 he was offered a chair at Groningen, in the Netherlands, but this prompted RWTH to also offer Butzer a chair.</li>
<li>Work in approximation theory continued, with topics such as best trigonometric approximation (extending the Jackson-Bernstein theory), and best approximation by algebraic polynomials, an area where some of Paul's finest results are to be found.</li>
<li>Paul's interest in probability theory led him in another direction, beginning in about 1975, to study the central limit theorem and the rates associated with its basic convergence theorem.</li>
<li>This problem was, of course, well-suited to Paul's expertise in approximation theory and Fourier analysis.</li>
<li>Let us turn to Paul's involvement with signal theory, which began in about 1970 when he became interested in dyadic analysis, particularly the problem of defining a satisfactory derivative in that setting.</li>
<li>A few years later, Paul's interests in the sampling theory of band-limited, and of not-necessarily band-limited, functions were awakened by a group of engineers at Aachen; applications of the theory have never been far from his thinking in this area.</li>
<li>Let us look briefly at the books that Butzer has published, with the help of some of his students.</li>
<li>Two years later Butzer published (with Rolf J Nessel) Fourier analysis and approximation.</li>
<li>Butzer and Nessel and the publishers have been very concerned to ease the problems of the student and are to be commended.</li>
<li>In 1981 Butzer edited, in collaboration with F Fehér, E B Christoffel: The Influence of His Work on Mathematics and the Physical Sciences.</li>
<li>As well as editing the book, Butzer contributed an excellent article on the life and work of Christoffel.</li>
<li>Similarly, in 1993 Butzer edited, in collaboration with Dietrich Lohrmann, Science in Western and Eastern Civilization in Carolingian Times.</li>
<li>Finally we note that Butzer has received many honours for his outstanding contributions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 April 1928, Mülheim an der Ruhr, Ruhr, Germany.</p>
