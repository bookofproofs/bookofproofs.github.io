<p><strong>Ernst Carl Gerlach Stueckelberg</strong> was a Swiss mathematician and physicist. Although he made important advances never received the recognition for his achievements which many felt that he clearly deserved.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>He was baptised Johann Melchior Ernst Karl Gerlach Stückelberg but in later life he gave his name as Ernst Carl Gerlach Stückelberg.</li>
<li>A chapel to commemorate this stood from the 14th  century but in 1879-80 a new chapel was built (which still stands) and decorated with four marvellous frescos showing scenes of Tell's life painted by Ernst Stückelberg.</li>
<li>Then Ernst Stueckelberg's full name became Johann Melchior Ernst Karl Gerlach Stückelberg von Breidenbach zu Breidenstein und Melsbach.</li>
<li>Stueckelberg was brought up and educated in Basel where he attended the Humanistic Gymnasium, a 16th  century secondary school in the Cathedral Square of Basel.</li>
<li>In 1930, only a few years after Stueckelberg graduated from the school, it changed its name to Gymnasium am Münsterplatz.</li>
<li>Stueckelberg worked in the Institute which had been set up for Sommerfeld, with rooms for seminars, rooms for assistants, and laboratories for experimental work.</li>
<li>It was only after completing his doctoral thesis that Stueckelberg moved from experimental physics to theoretical physics.</li>
<li>Philip Morse met Stueckelberg at this time.</li>
<li>His full name was Ernst Carl Gerlach Melchior Stueckelberg von Breidenbach zu Breidenstein.</li>
<li>These casual lectures started both Ernst and me off in new research directions.</li>
<li>In 1930 Stueckelberg was appointed as a research associate and assistant professor at Princeton.</li>
<li>There Stueckelberg and Morse worked together on high energy collisions.</li>
<li>In the spring Stueckelberg, together with Morse, moved to England to spend time at Cambridge.</li>
<li>Stueckelberg submitted his habilitation thesis to the University of Zürich and gained the right to become a lecturer.</li>
<li>In September 1934 Stueckelberg submitted the paper Relativistisch invariante Störungstheorie des Diracschen Elektrons Ⓣ(The relativistically invariant perturbation theory of the direct electron) to Annalen der Physik.</li>
<li>Stueckelberg was appointed to succeed him in the following year.</li>
<li>The "modernity" of this contribution is striking and characteristic of Stueckelberg's original turn of mind.</li>
<li>He then quoted Stueckelberg's 1934 paper as giving an example of such a covariant theory.</li>
<li>This was not Stueckelberg's only contribution to the renormalization programme, however, for in the early 1940s he wrote a long paper outlining a complete and correct description of the renormalization procedure for quantum electrodynamics.</li>
<li>He then set about filling in all the details but Schwinger and Feynman published their version first and Stueckelberg received no recognition for his remarkable contributions.</li>
<li>After receiving the Nobel Prize, Feynman lectured at CERN to an audience which included Stueckelberg.</li>
<li>Stueckelberg continued to hold the chair at Geneva until he retired in 1975.</li>
<li>Although the problems continued to recur, Stueckelberg was able to carry out his duties.</li>
<li>Although Stueckelberg never received the recognition for his achievement which many felt that he so clearly deserved, he did receive a number of significant honours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 February 1905, Basel, Switzerland. Died 4 September 1984, Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
