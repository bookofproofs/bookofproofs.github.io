<p><strong>Marcel-Paul Schützenberger</strong> was a French mathematician and medical doctor. He worked in the fields of formal language, combinatorics and semigroup theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Unravelled fundamental connections between algebra and topology in the theory of algebraic structures, which has been described as having transformed algebraic logic and algebraic linguistics.</li>
<li>Developed a mathematical concept for game theory that significantly enriched the field.</li>
<li>Proved the Schützenberger characteristic theorem, which laid the foundations for the development of commutative algebraic geometry.</li>
<li>Showed that there was a duality between certain algebraic objects, in which he proposed an axis of symmetry between them.</li>
<li>Demonstrated the intrinsic algebraic structure of random walks, a finding that has proven invaluable in the study of genetic algorithms in computer science.</li>
<li>Made notable contributions to the theory of word problems, which led to the development of a method to decide whether or not such problems can be solved algorithmically.</li>
<li>Conducted extensive research into the theory of regular expressions, which is used in the development of computer programs.</li>
<li>Identified a link between algebra and graph theory, which has become an important tool in the study of computer networks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 24 October 1920, Paris, France. Died 29 July 1996, Paris, France.</p>
