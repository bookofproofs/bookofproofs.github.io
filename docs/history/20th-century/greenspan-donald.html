<p><strong>Donald Greenspan</strong> was expert in numerical analysis and computational modelling who wrote many books, many of which took a different approach to teaching applied mathematics using numerical methods instead of the differential and integral calculus.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Greenspan was educated in Brooklyn where after his primary education, his secondary education was at the Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York.</li>
<li>Returning to discuss Greenspan's research at the University of Maryland, we note that his thesis advisor was Stanley B Jackson.</li>
<li>In 1955 Greenspan and Jackson published the joint paper Hyperbolic analytic geometry.</li>
<li>Greenspan published another article in 1955, namely Methods of matrix inversion in the American Mathematical Monthly.</li>
<li>After graduating, Greenspan was employed at the Mathematics Research Center, U.S. Army, University of Wisconsin, Madison and also in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.</li>
<li>Greenspan's second book Introduction to partial differential equations (1961) received mixed reviews.</li>
<li>In 1978 Greenspan moved to the University of Texas at Arlington.</li>
<li>Invariably, the number of students wanting to take his classes would exceed the number of chairs in the classroom, but Greenspan would attempt to accommodate the extra students by bringing in armchairs and placing them in the aisles.</li>
<li>Bonita, known as Bonnie, was 23 years younger than Greenspan.</li>
<li>He was preceded in death by his parents, Louis and Jessie Greenspan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 January 1928, Brooklyn, New York, USA. Died 2 May 2010, Arlington, Texas, USA.</p>
