<p><strong>Raoul Bott</strong> was a Hungarian-born mathematician who made fundamental contributions to topology and differential geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bott's step parents were under no illusions about where things were heading during 1938 and they sent the fifteen year old boy to a boarding school in England where he might be safer.</li>
<li>In the autumn of 1941 Bott entered McGill University in Montreal where he took what for him was a natural course.</li>
<li>After four months Bott left the army and signed up for a one year Master's course at McGill University, still on electrical engineering but by now he was moving in interest towards mathematics.</li>
<li>Bott did not fancy taking three more years to qualify in mathematics before starting a Master's degree in mathematics which is what he would have had to have done had he followed his initial choice to stay at McGill.</li>
<li>This seemed a good way to proceed, but the regulations for Bott to take a Master's degree in mathematics at Carnegie Tech again required him to have a first degree in mathematics.</li>
<li>Richard Duffin became Bott's supervisor and the first problem they solved was one which Bott suggested himself.</li>
<li>Solving this problem led to a joint Bott-Duffin paper containing what is now known as the Bott-Duffin theorem.</li>
<li>Bott was awarded a PhD for his thesis Electrical Network Theory in 1947 and he remained at Carnegie Tech undertaking research until 1949.</li>
<li>Bott's career was greatly influenced by Weyl who was impressed with the results that Bott was producing and invited him to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1949.</li>
<li>Bott spent two years at Princeton where he was greatly influenced by Weyl, Steenrod, Specker, Reidemeister, and Morse.</li>
<li>Bott also attended lectures by Kodaira and de Rham on harmonic forms.</li>
<li>From 1951 to 1959 Bott was on the faculty of the University of Michigan although during that time he did spend 1955-57 back at the Institute for Advanced Study.</li>
<li>It was at Michigan that Bott supervised his first doctoral student, Stephen Smale.</li>
<li>Few people have supervised the doctoral studies of two people who went on to be awarded a Fields Medal but Bott has that distinction.</li>
<li>Let me mention a personal memory of Bott from the late 1960s.</li>
<li>Bott leapt to his feet insisting firmly "I'll fix them - I'm an electrician!".</li>
<li>A second attempt by "electrician Bott" failed in a similar way.</li>
<li>To get an idea of the range of mathematics in which Bott made advances we look briefly at the contents of his collected papers.</li>
<li>Included is the famous Bott periodicity theorem (1956) and the Morse-Bott functions, an important generalization of Morse functions which Bott introduced in the course of this work.</li>
<li>Volume 2 contains Bott's papers on differential operators.</li>
<li>M Atiyah's very warm notes on his joint work and friendship with Bott are included in the volume ...</li>
<li>Many papers in this volume represent R Bott, a teacher and expositor at his best.</li>
<li>The comments regarding Bott as a teacher made in the quote above represent widely held views.</li>
<li>Other honours which were bestowed on Bott included honorary doctorates from the University of Notre Dame (1980), McGill University (1987), Carnegie Mellon University (1989), and the University of Leicester (1995).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 September 1923, Budapest, Hungary. Died 20 December 2005, San Diego, USA.</p>
