<h1>Person: Motzkin, Theodore Samuel</h1>

<p><strong>Theodore Samuel Motzkin</strong> was a German-born American mathematician best known for his work on linear programming.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Born in Russia into a Jewish family, Leo Motzkin went to Berlin when he was thirteen years old to study mathematics.</li>
<li>After starting work on his doctoral thesis, Leo Motzkin left mathematics to work for the Zionist movement.</li>
<li>Theodore Motzkin showed remarkable talents for mathematics as a child growing up in Berlin, and he began his university education when only fifteen years old.</li>
<li>For his doctoral work Motzkin went to Basel where he studied with Ostrowski writing his dissertation on linear inequalities.</li>
<li>Ostrowski was in many ways more of a collaborator of Motzkin's than a supervisor.</li>
<li>Motzkin already had several publications before his thesis on linear programming was completed in 1934.</li>
<li>Motzkin's first publication, however, was not on linear programming but rather on power series.</li>
<li>It was written as a partial solution to a problem which had been posed by Ostrowski and it gave Motzkin particular pleasure when he returned to the problem many years later and was able to give a complete solution.</li>
<li>Both linear programming and power series were themes which ran through Motzkin's research throughout his life but he was an extremely broad mathematician and there were many other themes.</li>
<li>In 1935 Motzkin was appointed to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</li>
<li>As was characteristic of Motzkin throughout his life, he maintained a remarkable mathematical output, writing several papers in Hebrew and helping to create Hebrew mathematical terminology.</li>
<li>We spoke of many different themes running through Motzkin's research and one of these was combinatorial analysis.</li>
<li>Dvoretzky and Motzkin give a new proof of great simplicity and elegance.</li>
<li>Motzkin emigrated to the United States in 1948 and there he spent two years at Harvard and Boston College.</li>
<li>In many publications on this topic Motzkin examined a wide variety of different ideas, including new measure of closeness of approximation.</li>
<li>Other themes which run through Motzkin's work is geometric problems, some involving Ramsey theory, and he wrote many papers on graph theory.</li>
<li>Some of Motzkin's most beautiful and important work made its first appearance here.</li>
</ul>
