<p><strong>Vitaly Fedorchuk</strong> was a Russian mathematician who worked various areas of topology.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>However, given that Vitaly Vasilyevich Fedorchuk worked for Smersh and the K.G.B. it is quite believable that his son's existence would be kept a secret.</li>
<li>Fedorchuk began research while an undergraduate and published On w-mappings of paracompact spaces (Russian) in 1963.</li>
<li>While undertaking research, Fedorchuk published Ordered sets and the product of topological spaces (Russian) (1966) and Ordered spaces (Russian) (1967).</li>
<li>This paper only contained announcements of the results and Fedorchuk published the proofs in his paper Perfect irreducible mappings and generalized proximities (Russian) (1968).</li>
<li>Fedorchuk worked at Moscow State University and in 1977 he defended his doctoral thesis (equivalent in standard to the habilitation or D.Sc.) Inverse spectra of topological spaces and some problems of general topology related to dimension and cardinal functions.</li>
<li>Fedorchuk's constructions and concepts have become important tools of research.</li>
<li>Fedorchuk is the author of 173 scientific papers and books on various aspects of dimension theory, uniform topology, extensors, the theory of covariant functors, the theory of infinite-dimensional spaces and manifolds.</li>
<li>Fedorchuk wrote a survey of the basic notions and theorems of the theory of metric spaces (presented in Section 2) and topological spaces (presented in Sections 4 and 5), as well as a survey of dimension theory (presented in Section 6).</li>
<li>The rest of the book was written by Pasynkov as an introduction to Fedorchuk's sections.</li>
<li>Van Mill received an email from Fedorchuk in the spring of 1999 asking if he could send him a proof of an assertion that appeared in the 1941 book Dimension Theory by Witold Hurewicz and Henry Wallman.</li>
<li>After attempting a proof and having failed, van Mill replied to Fedorchuk explaining he had tried but failed to prove the assertion.</li>
<li>Fedorchuk wrote back saying he was in a similar position.</li>
<li>After further exchanges of emails in which they told each other about finding the same assertion in several books and papers but always without a proof, Fedorchuk asked van Mill if he could arrange for him to visit Amsterdam where they could work together on the problem.</li>
<li>On 11 May 1999 Vitaly spoke at the topology seminar at the University of Amsterdam on dimension theory.</li>
<li>In 2006, Vitaly Vitalievich Fedorchuk was awarded the title of Honorary Professor at Moscow State University.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 November 1942, Moscow, Russia. Died 9 December 2012, Moscow, Russia.</p>
