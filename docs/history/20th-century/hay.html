<h1>Person: Hay, Louise Schmir</h1>
<p><img alt="Hay.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Hay.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Louise Szmir Hay</strong> was a French-born American mathematician who worked on recursively enumerable sets and computational complexity theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The reader may well ask at this point - who is Louise Szmir?</li>
<li>Is this not a biography of Louise Schmir Hay?</li>
<li>However, she was not known by the name of Larson, all her mathematical publications being under the name of Louise Hay.</li>
<li>Money was still tight while at College but Louise was able to earn money during the summer vacation, and again the Westinghouse prize helped her to find useful summer jobs.</li>
<li>At Cornell Hay's thesis was supervised by J Barkley Rosser.</li>
<li>Being apart again did not really seem an option to Hay who terminated her studies at Cornell early, writing up what she had at that point for a Master's Degree.</li>
<li>Hay was awarded an M.A. in 1959, then also managed to get a job at Oberlin.</li>
<li>It was not that good a programme, for Hay found a counter-example to one of the results she had been told to prove.</li>
<li>In 1968 she was appointed as an Associate Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and in the same year her marriage with John Hay ended.</li>
<li>Hay spent the rest of her career in Chicago at the University of Illinois.</li>
<li>We still have to give a brief account of some of Hay's mathematics.</li>
<li>From 1980 until 1988 Hay became Head of the Mathematics Department.</li>
<li>The annual presentation of this award is intended to highlight the importance of mathematics education and to evoke the memory of all that Hay exemplified as a teacher, scholar, administrator, and human being.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 June 1935, Metz, France. Died 28 October 1989, Oak Park, Illinois, USA.</p>
