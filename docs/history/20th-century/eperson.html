<p><strong>Donald Eperson</strong> was an English schooteacher and clergyman who produced works on recreational mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Joseph William Eperson died in 1966 in Devon, England.</li>
<li>From the preparatory school, Eperson entered selective independent St Paul's School, London, in 1916.</li>
<li>Eperson graduated with a First Class degree from Oxford in 1927 and, in the same year, was appointed as a mathematics master at Sherborne School, Dorset, one of the best schools in England.</li>
<li>Eperson had a number of pupils at Sherborne who would become famous, the best known being Alan Turing.</li>
<li>However, Eperson deserves much credit for his ability to handle a pupil as talented yet unconventional as Turing.</li>
<li>In fact, inspired by Eperson, Turing borrowed three books by Lewis Carroll from the School library in November 1930: The Game of Logic, Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass.</li>
<li>In 1933 Eperson addressed the Annual General Meeting of the Mathematical Association, delivering his talk Lewis Carroll - mathematician.</li>
<li>After he was ordained, Eperson acted as an assistant chaplain to Sherborne School in addition to his mathematics duties.</li>
<li>Eperson also produced works on places of interest such as The Church of St Mary, Charminster (1944).</li>
<li>Bishop Otter College was a teacher training college, so Eperson was now having to show teachers how to teach mathematics.</li>
<li>In 1964, when he reached the age of 60, Eperson retired from Bishop Otter College where he had, for some years, been a Principal Lecturer and Dean of Chapel.</li>
<li>In 1988, when he was eighty four years old, Eperson published a book entitled Patterns in Mathematics which ran to five editions.</li>
<li>It was published in the Spring issue of The Carrollian, the journal of The Lewis Carroll Society, at around the time of Eperson's death.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 22 July 1904, Gunnersbury, Middlesex, England. Died 13 May 2001, Worthing, West Sussex, England.</p>
