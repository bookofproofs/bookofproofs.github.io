<p><strong>Wilhelm Ljunggren</strong> was a Norwegian mathematician who specialised in number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wilhelm attended secondary school in Oslo, graduating in 1925.</li>
<li>Ljunggren won the prize in his final year at secondary school.</li>
<li>Ljunggren graduated in 1931 and Thoralf Skolem, who was a student of Axel Thue, had advised him during the research for his Master's thesis.</li>
<li>Skolem moved to the Christian Michelsen's Institute in Bergen as a Research Associate in 1930 and so Ljunggren, who wished to keep in contact with Skolem, accepted a position as a secondary school teacher in Bergen.</li>
<li>Ljunggren undertook research in number theory during the years he taught at the secondary school in Bergen and he submitted his doctoral thesis to the University of Oslo in 1937.</li>
<li>Ljunggren followed Skolem to Oslo, for in 1938 he became a teacher at the Hegedehaugen School.</li>
<li>The University of Bergen was founded in 1946 and, three years later, Ljunggren was appointed as professor of mathematics there.</li>
<li>Although Ljunggren quickly built up a strong teaching department in Bergen he took the opportunity to return to Oslo in 1956 when he was offered the chair of mathematics there.</li>
<li>By this time Skolem was retiring and Ljunggren took over the responsibilities of keeping Oslo as a leading institution for mathematics.</li>
<li>Ljunggren taught part-time at the Technical Institute to help his friend build its reputation.</li>
<li>Almost all of Ljunggren's research was on Diophantine equations.</li>
<li>One of Ljunggren's main interests was Diophantine equations of degree 4.</li>
<li>In the paper Ljunggren found bounds for the number of integer solutions for some special equations of this type.</li>
<li>Here is one further example of the results obtained by Ljunggren.</li>
<li>On the other hand, Ljunggren submitted also many problems, addressed to university students as well as high-school pupils.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 October 1905, Oslo, Norway. Died 25 January 1973, Oslo, Norway.</p>
