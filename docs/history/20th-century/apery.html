<p><strong>Roger Apéry</strong> was a French mathematician best known for proving that ζ(3) is an irrational number.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Roger, the subject of this biography, was their only child.</li>
<li>The Apéry family spent the first four years of Roger's life in Rouen then, in 1920, they moved to Lille where Georges worked as an engineer.</li>
<li>Roger attended the lycée Faidherbe in Lille and he was such a bright child that by 1926 he was two grades ahead of children of his age.</li>
<li>It was in 1926 that the family moved again, this time going to Paris where Roger continued his education at the lycée Ledru-Rollin.</li>
<li>The Apéry family had moved into very basic accommodation in Paris with the intention of improving their position as soon as their finances allowed them to better themselves.</li>
<li>It was not to be, however, for the economic downturn in France led to Georges Apéry loosing his position as an engineer.</li>
<li>Roger, however, continued to show his brilliance, moving to the famous lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris.</li>
<li>Because their home was not suitable for anyone to study in, Roger boarded with the monks of the École Bossuet (named after Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, a Roman Catholic bishop known for his literary works).</li>
<li>Apéry was given a punishment detention, and from this time on he developed a dislike of priests and the Church.</li>
<li>Apéry was a Concours Général laureate in 1932, coming third in mathematics in the whole of France in the junior competition.</li>
<li>Riots followed outside the Chamber of Deputies on 6 February and Apéry, who was already deeply politically aware, took a strong stand for radical socialism opposed to the right-wing demonstrators.</li>
<li>This was to have consequences for his academic career for, despite a brilliant performance in mathematics, Apéry was not ranked sufficiently highly to gain entry to the École Normale Supérieure in 1935.</li>
<li>This prompted Apéry, who was still an undergraduate, to resign from the Radical Party in protest.</li>
<li>Apéry would continue as a staunch socialist but outside the mainstream parties.</li>
<li>The other candidate who came first equal with Apéry was Jacqueline Ferrand, better known by the name she adopted after her marriage, Jacqueline Lelong-Ferrand.</li>
<li>Those two were by Roger Apéry and Jacqueline Ferrand.</li>
<li>Apéry was already undertaking research and published Sur les sextiques à 8 rebroussements Ⓣ(On sextics with 8 cusps) (1939).</li>
<li>Apéry was drafted into the French army on 16 September 1939.</li>
<li>In February 1940 Apéry was promoted to sublieutenant in the 145th  Artillery and sent to Nancy.</li>
<li>The Germans overcame the French at Nancy and, on 20 June, Apéry was captured and became a prisoner-of-war.</li>
<li>Apéry, however, was held as a prisoner in Germany where, through the Red Cross, he was able to receive a number of mathematical articles sent by Francesco Severi.</li>
<li>Since he was suffering from pleurisy, Apéry was sent back to France for health reasons on 11 June 1941.</li>
<li>Apéry was discharged on 23 August 1941 and Georges Bruhat, director of the École Normale Supérieure and father of François Bruhat, offered him a research fellowship at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.</li>
<li>Apéry was very active in the French Resistance being director of the Front National, a resistance movement at the École Normale Supérieure, as well as forging identity papers in his room and undertaking other highly dangerous activities.</li>
<li>In August 1944 the Gestapo searched the École Normale Supérieure and Apéry, realising what was happening, burnt the incriminating papers he had been forging in his room.</li>
<li>Returning to Apéry's career, he was invited to give the prestigious Cours Peccot at the Collège de France in 1948; he spoke on "Algebraic geometry and ideals".</li>
<li>Apéry became a staunch supporter of Pierre Mendès-France, the radical socialist who was premier of France in 1954.</li>
<li>Mendès-France opposed both the Communists and the followers of Charles de Gaulle, and Apéry gave him his full support.</li>
<li>In 1958 Apéry became president of the Calvados district of the Parti républicain radical.</li>
<li>It rapidly collapsed and, from that time on, Apéry decided to leave politics.</li>
<li>In 1969 de Gaulle was defeated and Apéry resigned from the Radical Party feeling that the French Republic was no longer threatened.</li>
<li>Let us now look at Apéry's mathematical contributions.</li>
<li>For a variety of reasons, mathematicians doubted that Apéry's proof would be correct when it was first announced.</li>
<li>The problem had long been an open question, yet Apéry's proof only used methods which had been available for 200 years.</li>
<li>Another possible factor is that it appears that Apéry was not popular with his colleagues.</li>
<li>We came away convinced that Professor Apéry had indeed found a quite miraculous and magnificent demonstration of the irrationality of ζ(3).</li>
<li>(Apéry rather tartly pointed out to me in Helsinki that he regarded this more a compliment than a criticism of his method).</li>
<li>Apéry then made some remarks on the status of the French language, and alluded to the underlying motivation for his astonishing proof.</li>
<li>It is some measure of Apéry's achievement that these questions have been considered by mathematicians of the top rank over the past few centuries without much success being achieved.</li>
<li>Apéry's incredible proof appears to be a mixture of miracles and mysteries.</li>
<li>Most startling of all though should be the fact that Apéry's proof has no aspect that would not have been accessible to a mathematician of 200 years ago.</li>
<li>It was not long before the full validity of Apéry's work was confirmed and the sceptics were forced to eat their words.</li>
<li>Apéry was honoured by being made a Knight of the Légion d'Honneur in December 1970.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 November 1916, Rouen, France. Died 18 December 1994, Caen, France.</p>
