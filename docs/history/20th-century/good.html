<p><strong>Irving John Good</strong> was an English mathematician who worked at Bletchley Park and at GCHQ and later went on to work with computers and statistics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His parents were Morris Edward Good (1885-1958) (also known by the Yiddish name Moshe Oved) and Sophia Polikoff.</li>
<li>Morris Good was born in Poland at a time when it was part of the Russian Empire, He learnt the trade of a watchmaker before emigrating to England at the age of seventeen.</li>
<li>Jack Good showed remarkable mathematical talents when he was still a child.</li>
<li>Good entered Jesus College, Cambridge where he attended lectures by A E Ingham, J C Burkill, F P White and G H Hardy.</li>
<li>He played a lot of chess, particularly with John Francis O'Donovan who played board one for Ireland.</li>
<li>Good won the Cambridgeshire Chess Championship in 1939.</li>
<li>One of those who interviewed him for the position at Bletchley was Hugh Alexander, who had twice been British Chess Champion and who Good knew, having played chess with him.</li>
<li>At first Good worked in Hut 8 headed by Alan Turing but after a year Turing moved to a different area and Hugh Alexander became head of Hut 8.</li>
<li>In 1943 Good moved to the "Newmanry", working under Max Newman.</li>
<li>The main users at first were Newman, Michie and Good, and some months later about twenty mathematicians.</li>
<li>Good was a main user and produced more than half the theory for the use of the Colossi.</li>
<li>After the war ended, Good was appointed as a lecturer in Pure Mathematics at the University of Manchester working for Max Newman who had been appointed as professor.</li>
<li>While at Manchester, Good was also involved in the project to develop an electronic computer.</li>
<li>One reason for Good leaving Manchester was that his book Probability and the Weighing of Evidence had been rejected by a publisher.</li>
<li>Good worked at GCHQ from 1948 until 1959.</li>
<li>In 1959 Good resigned from his position at GCHQ when offered a chair at the University of Chicago.</li>
<li>We mention two further books: (jointly with David B Osteyee) Information, weight of evidence, the singularity between probability measures and signal detection (1974) and Good thinking.</li>
<li>This last mentioned book collects together many of Good's more philosophical and less mathematical papers.</li>
<li>Good retired and was made Professor Emeritus in July 1994.</li>
<li>Good died of natural causes at the age of 92.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 9 December 1916, London, England. Died 5 April 2009, Radford, Virginia, USA.</p>
