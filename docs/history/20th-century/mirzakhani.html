<h1>Person: Mirzakhani, Maryam</h1>

<p><strong>Maryam Mirzakhani</strong> was an Iranian mathematician who worked in America and was the first woman to be awarded a Fields Medal. She worked in the geometry of Riemann surfaces.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maryam had a great imagination and, when she was eight years old, she would make up stories about a girl who achieved great things, such as becoming mayor or travelling the world.</li>
<li>About the time the war ended, Maryam completed her studies at elementary school and sat an examination for the Farzanegan middle school for girls in Tehran.</li>
<li>Roya Beheshti was, like Maryam, born in 1977.</li>
<li>Maryam thought at this time that she would like to become an author and write such books.</li>
<li>Both Maryam and her friend Roya Beheshti progressed from Farzanegan middle school to Farzanegan high school.</li>
<li>They both found a copy of six Mathematical Olympiad problems and Maryam managed to do three of them.</li>
<li>Both Maryam Mirzakhani and her friend Roya Beheshti made the Iranian Mathematical Olympiad team in 1994.</li>
<li>The international competition was held that year in Hong Kong and Mirzakhani scored 41 out of 42 and was awarded a gold medal.</li>
<li>Again in 1995 Mirzakhani was a member of the Iranian Mathematical Olympiad team.</li>
<li>This time the international competition was held in Toronto, Canada, and Mirzakhani scored 42 out of 42 and was again awarded a gold medal.</li>
<li>In 1995 Mirzakhani began her study of mathematics at Sharif University of Technology funded with an IPM fellowship.</li>
<li>Mirzakhani published papers while an undergraduate.</li>
<li>Mirzakhani was one of these students.</li>
<li>Seven students and two bus drivers died in the crash but Mirzakhani survived.</li>
<li>Mirzakhani looked at what happens to the "prime number theorem for geodesics" when one considers only the closed geodesics that are simple, meaning that they do not intersect themselves.</li>
<li>Harvard University awarded Mirzakhani a Merit fellowship in 2003.</li>
<li>Mirzakhani's Clay Research Fellowship ran until 2008 when she left Princeton and was appointed as Professor of Mathematics at Stanford University.</li>
<li>It was in 2006 that Mirzakhani began a collaboration with Alex Eskin of the University of Chicago.</li>
<li>However, Mirzakhani et al have proved that complex geodesics and their closures in moduli space are in fact surprisingly regular, rather than irregular or fractal.</li>
<li>Eskin and Mirzakhani published Counting closed geodesics in moduli space in 2011.</li>
<li>In 2014 Mirzakhani became the first woman to be awarded a Fields Medal.</li>
<li>Mirzakhani won many honours during her short lifetime in addition to those we have already mentioned.</li>
<li>Even before she was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014, Mirzakhani had been diagnosed with breast cancer.</li>
<li>Maryam was a brilliant mathematical theorist, and also a humble person who accepted honours only with the hope that it might encourage others to follow her path.</li>
<li>Maryam embodied what being a mathematician or scientist is all about: the attempt to solve a problem that hadn't been solved before, or to understand something that hadn't been understood before.</li>
<li>Maryam had one of the great intellects of our time, and she was a wonderful person.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 12 May 1977, Tehran, Iran. Died 14 July 2017, California, USA.</p>
