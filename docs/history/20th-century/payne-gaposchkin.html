<p><strong>Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin</strong> was a British mathematician and astronomer who did important work for her Ph.D. at Radcliffe College of Harvard University. She showed that stars were composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium but, although completely correct, it was rejected by astronomers at the time.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>She changed her name to Payne-Gaposchkin when she married Sergi Gaposchkin.</li>
<li>For simplicity, we will use name Payne-Gaposchkin throughout this biography.</li>
<li>Edward Payne died when Cecilia was four years old.</li>
<li>Cecilia had a brother Humfry Payne (1902-1936) who became an archaeologist, and a sister Leonora Florence Mary Payne (1904-1996).</li>
<li>When she was six years old, Cecilia began to attend a local school in Wendover which had just opened across the street from where she lived.</li>
<li>Cecilia was very musical and was a gifted pianist but music did not play a part in her school education.</li>
<li>When Cecilia was twelve years old the family moved to London, mainly so that her brother Humfry could receive an education which would prepare him for attending an independent school.</li>
<li>From a very young age Payne-Gaposchkin had wanted to be a scientist, being at this time most interested in botany, but with no help from her school she turned to the books in her own home.</li>
<li>A new science teacher, Dorothy Dalglish, saw that Payne-Gaposchkin wanted to learn more science than was in the few lessons given to second year pupils so she lent her physics books and took her to museums.</li>
<li>With a mother who had been born in Germany, Payne-Gaposchkin felt very uncomfortable.</li>
<li>The music master was Gustav Holst, the famous composer, and he had Payne-Gaposchkin join the school orchestra, taught her to conduct, and urged her to become a musician.</li>
<li>Although the combination was unusual, Payne-Gaposchkin was allowed to study botany, physics and chemistry.</li>
<li>The event which turned Payne-Gaposchkin to astronomy was a lecture by Arthur Eddington.</li>
<li>In 1931 Payne-Gaposchkin became a US citizen, however tragic events in 1932-33 changed her life.</li>
<li>He arrived in the United States in November 1933 and in March 1934 Cecilia Payne and Sergei Gaposchkin were married.</li>
<li>From 1935 Payne-Gaposchkin began to produce joint papers with her husband and the first book which they jointly authors was Variable stars (1938).</li>
<li>In 1943 she published The Scholar and the World which gives a fascinating account of the way that Payne-Gaposchkin saw the world and how astronomy fitted into it.</li>
<li>Eventually Payne-Gaposchkin obtained a position more appropriate to her contributions.</li>
<li>Payne-Gaposchkin received many honours.</li>
<li>Payne-Gaposchkin and her husband travelled a lot in the 1970s.</li>
<li>It was republished in Katherine Haramundanis (ed.), Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin: An Autobiography and Other Recollections (Cambridge University Press, 1984).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 10 May 1900, Wendover, England. Died 7 December 1979, Tewksbury, Massachusetts, USA.</p>
