<h1>Person: Morawetz, Cathleen Synge</h1>

<p><strong>Cathleen Morawetz</strong> was a Canadian mathematician who worked on the  partial differential equations governing fluid flow, particularly those of mixed type occurring in transonic flow.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cathleen won a scholarship and entered the University of Toronto to study mathematics.</li>
<li>She strongly encouraged Cathleen continue her study of mathematics.</li>
<li>However, strongly encouraged by Cecilia Krieger to study for her doctorate, Morawetz went to New York University to undertake research.</li>
<li>During this period Morawetz applied for US citizenship and she was granted this in 1950.</li>
<li>In 1978 Morawetz became the associate director of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences a position which she held until 1984 when she was appointed Director of the Courant Institute.</li>
<li>Morawetz's predictions have been confirmed subsequently through both actual experiments and careful numerical simulation which indicate the appearance of shock waves in the flow past the purturbed profile.</li>
<li>In the 1960s Morawetz worked on the scattering of sound waves and electromagnetic waves striking objects.</li>
<li>Morawetz showed that, for a medium with constant light speed outside a reflecting star-shaped object, high frequency waves are, asymptotically, streams of particles moving along the rays.</li>
<li>In 1998 Morawetz was awarded the National Medal of Science.</li>
<li>The list of honours which Morawetz has received certainly does not stop at those already mentioned above.</li>
<li>In 2001 Morawetz was made an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 May 1923, Toronto, Canada. Died 8 August 2017, New York City, New York, USA.</p>
