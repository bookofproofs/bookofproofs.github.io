<h1>Person: Oka, Kiyoshi</h1>

<p><strong>Kiyoshi Oka</strong> was a Japanese mathematician who worked in the theory of several complex variables.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>1929 was a very significant year for Oka for in that year he took sabbatical leave and went to the University of Paris.</li>
<li>Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University.</li>
<li>In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940.</li>
<li>After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama.</li>
<li>Oka was appointed professor at the Nara University for Women in 1949, a post he held until 1964.</li>
<li>By giving a list of the open problems in the area, this work played an important role in deciding the direction of Oka's research.</li>
<li>This is why, even today, it is worth collecting his work as a tribute to its creator, Kiyoshi Oka.</li>
<li>Oka was also interested in Japanese poetry and Zen philosophy.</li>
<li>Oka received a number of important honours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 April 1901, Osaka, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. Died 1 March 1978, Nara, Japan.</p>
