<p><strong>Jean Dieudonné</strong> was a French mathematician who worked in a wide variety of mathematical areas including general topology, topological vector spaces, algebraic geometry, invariant theory and the classical groups. He was a founder member of Bourbaki and also wrote on the history of mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Pioneered the use of abstract algebra in studying the structure of algebraic groups and Lie groups. </li>
<li>Developed the theory of rings, fields, and algebras. </li>
<li>Developed the theory of direct sums of structures and studied the structure of their automorphisms. </li>
<li>Advanced the structure theory of semi-simple algebras and Lie algebras. </li>
<li>Worked on the classification and representation theory of semi-simple algebras. </li>
<li>Established the concept of "smoothness”, which is now firmly associated with homological algebra and differential topology. </li>
<li>Advanced the notion of abstract homology, which led to the formalism of natural homology and cohomology. </li>
<li>Developed the theory of infinite dimensional manifolds, which is immensely important for differential topology.</li>
<li>Developed the algebraic notion of singular spaces.</li>
<li>Pioneered and advanced the theory of sheaf and cohomology theory. </li>
<li>Applied the theory of sheaves to algebra and topology. </li>
<li>Explored the concept of reflexivity, which has significant implications in mathematics and physics.</li>
<li>Was an early advocate of category theory.</li>
<li>Advanced the theory of spectral sequences.</li>
<li>Developed the notion of ​​adjoint functors with its application to the theory of adjoint quasifunctors. </li>
<li>Was essential in the advancement of functional analysis. </li>
<li>Developed the theory of Hopf algebras.</li>
<li>Contributed to the development of algebraic geometry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 1 July 1906, Lille, France. Died 29 November 1992, Paris, France.</p>
