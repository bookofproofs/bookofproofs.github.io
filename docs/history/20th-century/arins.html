<p><strong>Eizens Arins</strong> was a Russian-born mathematician who worked in the theory of functions, theoretical computer science, and cybernetics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Arins' parents were Latvian workers but were in exile in Siberia at the time of his birth.</li>
<li>Arins attended secondary school in Daugavpils (German Dünaburg, Russian Dvinsk) which is a city in southeastern Latvia on the Western Daugava River.</li>
<li>In 1929 Arins graduated from the school in Daugavpils and he entered the University of Latvia in Riga in 1930.</li>
<li>During this extremely difficult period the University of Latvia continued to operate and Arins continued his undergraduate studies.</li>
<li>Despite the take-over of the country by Germany, the University of Latvia remained open and in September 1941 Arins graduated.</li>
<li>In December of that year Arins began lecturing in the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Latvia.</li>
<li>Arins had graduated at a time when the country had been under German rule, and the Soviet authorities now refused to recognise his degree, He had to graduate again under the new regime which he did in 1946.</li>
<li>Arins then continued his postgraduate studies at Moscow State University where his doctorate was supervised by L V Keldysh.</li>
<li>Under her supervision Arins wrote a thesis on partially continuous functions on products of topological spaces which he defended in 1954.</li>
<li>In 1959 the University of Latvia established a Computing Centre with Arins as the founder, first director, and organiser.</li>
<li>Arins showed great organisational skills in developing the Computing Centre and soon he was joined by Grinbergs who contributed in a major way to the work of the Centre.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 16 May 1911, Krasnoyarsk, Krasnoyarsk kray, Russia. Died 13 February 1987, Riga, Latvia.</p>
