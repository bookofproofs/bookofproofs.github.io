<p><strong>Aryeh Dvoretzky</strong> was a Ukrainian-born Israeli mathematician who worked in functional analysis, statistics and probability.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aryeh was born in Khorol, a town roughly half way between Kiev and Kharkov, and he spent the first six years of his life there before his family emigrated to Palestine in 1922.</li>
<li>The principal of the school was Dr Arthur Biram who developed the school greatly during the years that Dvoretzky was a pupil.</li>
<li>After graduating from the Hebrew Reali School, Dvoretzky entered the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</li>
<li>This university, which opened in 1925, had only awarded its first degrees a few years before Dvoretzky began his studies there.</li>
<li>Dvoretzky was awarded his Master's Degree by the Hebrew University in 1937 and continued to undertake research there for his doctorate advised by Fekete.</li>
<li>In 1940 Dvoretzky married Sarah Schneerson (1915-1972), who was also born in the Ukraine.</li>
<li>Aryeh and Sarah Dvoretzky had two children, a daughter Gina and a son Gideon who was killed on the Egyptian front in the Yom Kippur War of 1973.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate in 1941, Dvoretzky was appointed to the teaching staff of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</li>
<li>Dvoretzky made many research visits abroad, mainly to the United States but also to the Collège de France.</li>
<li>Let us now look briefly at Dvoretzky's mathematical contributions.</li>
<li>His best known fundamental result in this field is the Dvoretzky theorem, which was related by Vitali Milman to Paul Lévy's measure concentration phenomena and served as a starting point to modern Banach space theory.</li>
<li>At the same time, Dvoretzky was producing work on probability.</li>
<li>Throughout the years, Dvoretzky cooperated with Erdős, Jacob Wolfowitz, Abraham Wald, Herbert Robbins and Y S Chow in producing elegant and fundamental work in probability theory.</li>
<li>We should say a little more about the Dvoretzky theorem.</li>
<li>In 1950 Dvoretzky published a joint paper with Ambrose Rogers entitled Absolute and Unconditional Convergence in Normed Linear Spaces.</li>
<li>One such proof appeared in Grothendieck's 1956 paper Sur certaines classes de suites dans les espaces de Banach et le théorème de Dvoretzky-Rogers Ⓣ(On certain classes of sequences in Banach spaces and the Dvoretzky-Rogers theorem) which also contained a number of important conjectures.</li>
<li>In 1959 Dvoretzky proved the conjecture by Grothendieck which today is known as Dvoretzky's theorem.</li>
<li>Dvoretzky's theorem initiated an avalanche of work on finite-dimensional normed spaces, guided by the heuristic principle: "All convex bodies behave like ellipsoids, and ever more so as the dimension increases." This principle runs completely counter to one's initial experience.</li>
<li>Later Dvoretzky wrote a number of single-author papers on Brownian motion including On the oscillation of the Brownian motion process (1963) and Polygons on two-dimensional Brownian paths (1986).</li>
<li>Dvoretzky received many honours for his contributions.</li>
<li>In 2009, the Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University established an annual lecture series in memory of Dvoretzky.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 May 1916, Khorol, Ukraine. Died 8 May 2008, Jerusalem, Israel.</p>
