<p><strong>Patrick Brendan Kennedy</strong> was an Irish mathematician who worked in complex analysis. As a young man he was an outstanding chess player.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 1937 when Paddy was eight years old, after a year in Ballylongford, he did manage to achieve the transfer to Cork and, in 1941, Paddy entered the North Monastery secondary school in Cork.</li>
<li>In 1946, while at the North Monastery School, Kennedy won the Honan Scholarship to University College Cork.</li>
<li>Kennedy entered University College Cork in 1946 aiming at a science degree.</li>
<li>In the year he graduated, Kennedy took part in the Irish Chess Championship which was held in Galway.</li>
<li>Kennedy won each of the 7 rounds achieving the maximum score of 7/7.</li>
<li>After graduating with a B.Sc. from Cork, Kennedy continued to study there for his Master's Degree.</li>
<li>In 1951 Kennedy completed his M.Sc. studies and was examined by Vicenzo Consolato Antonino Ferraro (1902-1974) who, at that time, was professor of applied mathematics at the University College of the South West at Exeter (now the University of Exeter).</li>
<li>Ferraro was particularly impressed by Kennedy's work in analysis and recommended that he study for a Ph.D. with Walter Hayman at Exeter.</li>
<li>Kennedy was awarded an M.Sc. with First Class Honours from the National University of Ireland, and was awarded the Travelling Studentship in Mathematical Sciences of the National University of Ireland.</li>
<li>Hayman had been appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics at Exeter in 1947 and Kennedy became his first research student.</li>
<li>Paddy was a wonderful conversationalist and tremendous good company.</li>
<li>Kennedy's first paper was On a conjecture of Heins which he submitted to the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society on 12 September 1953.</li>
<li>Kennedy promises a further paper giving an example of a class of integral functions which shows these positive results are best possible and provides a counter-example to Heins' conjecture.</li>
<li>Kennedy was appointed as an assistant lecturer in mathematics at Aberystwyth in autumn 1953.</li>
<li>Some of Kennedy's papers listed below also acknowledge the same source of support.</li>
<li>Paddy Barry was a research student at Cork advised by Kennedy.</li>
<li>Kennedy was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Cork in 1956.</li>
<li>Kennedy was the first professor of mathematics, appointed before the university opened.</li>
<li>In 1965 Kennedy was appointed as External Examiner in Mathematics for the National University of Ireland.</li>
<li>On the night of 8 June 1966, Kennedy took his own life in a hotel in Nottingham.</li>
<li>We should say a little more about Kennedy's chess career.</li>
<li>At the time of his death Kennedy was writing a book on the applications of subharmonic functions to function theory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 20 July 1929, Clarecastle, County Clare, Ireland. Died 8 June 1966, Nottingham, England.</p>
