<p><strong>Hermann Arthur Jahn</strong> was an English scientist who worked  on quantum mechanics and group theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Friedrich Jahn was born in Germany but emigrated to England in 1890 where he married Marion May Curtiss (born 4 May 1876 in Gainsbrough) in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, in October 1897.</li>
<li>Their children were Hermann Edgar Jahn (born 1900), Roland Alfred Jahn (born 1905), Hermann Arthur Jahn (the subject of this biography), and Elfrida Marion Jahn (born 1910).</li>
<li>Hermann Jahn was born in Colchester but spent his youth in Lincoln.</li>
<li>One such relates to Marion May Jahn and we record it here.</li>
<li>After leaving the City School in 1925, Jahn entered University College, London where he read chemistry.</li>
<li>Jahn received his doctorate for his thesis Rotation und Schwingung des Methanmoleküls (The rotation and oscillation of the methane molecule).</li>
<li>This work was immediately recognised as being very important, and Jahn's name along with Teller's became enshrined in the literature.</li>
<li>Similarly, the second of these papers, with Jahn as the only author, uses irreducible representations of symmetric groups in the proof of the results.</li>
<li>During the Second World War, Jahn worked at the Royal Aircraft Establishment where the work was primarily on aircraft engine problems.</li>
<li>Jahn, who was an expert on vibrations in molecules, now worked on vibrational problems in aircraft.</li>
<li>Jahn was employed at the Royal Aircraft Establishment from 1941 to 1946.</li>
<li>She met Jahn when he was studying for his doctorate in Leipzig.</li>
<li>She then got a teaching position in Wembley and, in 1943, she married Jahn.</li>
<li>Jahn then spent the two years 1946-48 working in the Department of Mathematical Physics in the University of Birmingham.</li>
<li>In 1947 Jahn considered working for the Atomic Energy Research Establishment situated near Harwell.</li>
<li>But Jahn was a realist.</li>
<li>Peierls was head of the Department of Mathematical Physics in the University of Birmingham where Jahn was working at the time he went to be interviewed by Fuchs.</li>
<li>Jahn did not take a job at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment but, in 1948, was appointed to the first Chair in Applied Mathematics at University College, Southampton.</li>
<li>At Southampton one of Jahn's first research students was James Philip Elliott (1929-2008).</li>
<li>He then went on to study for a Ph.D. at Southampton advised by Jahn.</li>
<li>Jahn and Elliott explored the application of Racah's tensor operator techniques to nuclear structure and applied group theoretic techniques to the understanding of atomic nuclei.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 31 May 1907, Colchester, England. Died 24 October 1979, Southampton, England.</p>
