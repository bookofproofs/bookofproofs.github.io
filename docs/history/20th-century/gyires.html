<p><strong>Béla Gyires</strong> was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in the theory of matrices, probability theory and mathematical statistics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>At the time Béla was born, Zagreb was in Croatia-Slavonia, an autonomous kingdom within the Hungarian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</li>
<li>The Gyires family's move to Debrecen, therefore, meant that they were again in Hungary.</li>
<li>In Debrecen, Béla Gyires attended the Piarist Gymnasium, graduating in 1928.</li>
<li>It was at this school that Gyires first developed a love for mathematics.</li>
<li>After graduating in 1928, Gyires entered the Péter Pázmány University of Budapest where he studied for his first degree, mainly taking courses in mathematics and physics.</li>
<li>Gyires was awarded his first degree in 1933 which qualified him for a career as a high school teacher.</li>
<li>Jordán had been made a professor in the year that Gyires graduated with his first degree and he is recognised as the founder of the Hungarian School of Probability.</li>
<li>Gyires, like Jordán who influenced him so strongly, had broad interests but made his most important contributions to the theory of probability and to mathematical statistics.</li>
<li>Gyires was awarded his doctorate from that university in 1941 and, in that year, published the paper A korlátolt pontosságú szorzás hibahatárai Ⓣ(The margin of error in limited precision multiplication)  which was his Ph.D. thesis.</li>
<li>We mentioned above that Gyires worked as a school teacher while undertaking research for his doctorate.</li>
<li>They had two children, Klara Gyires (born 1946) who became a pharmacologist and professor at Semmelweis University in Budapest, and Tibor Béla Gyires (born 1948) who became a mathematician and computer scientist.</li>
<li>In 1943 Gyires moved to Kassa, a town now known as Košice in Slovakia.</li>
<li>Gyires taught at the College of Commerce there until 1945.</li>
<li>In 1946 Gyires habilitated in linear algebra and analysis.</li>
<li>Professor Béla Gyires was an excellent lecturer, he had always a lot of students and many of them became teachers in secondary schools, university teachers and professors.</li>
<li>In 1993, when he was 84 years of age, Gyires published the book Linear approximations in convex metric spaces and the application in the mixture theory of probability theory.</li>
<li>Gyires received many honours.</li>
<li>Gyires officially retired in 1979 but continued to teach and only in 1994, when he was 85 years old, was he made professor emeritus.</li>
<li>Also the University of Debrecen makes the Gyires Béla Award for outstanding academic performance in the field of probability theory and applied mathematics.</li>
<li>The award was set up on the initiative of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Béla Gyires' two children, Klara Gyires and Tibor Gyires, in 2003.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 March 1909, Zagreb, Croatia. Died 26 August 2001, Budapest, Hungary.</p>
