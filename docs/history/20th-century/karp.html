<p><strong>Carol Karp</strong> was an American mathematical logician whose research was closely linked to algebra. She made a reputation both as a teacher and researcher, and she was undertaking important work on infinitary logic and recursion theory when she died at the age of 46.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Carol had a brother Wallace Earl Vander Velde (born in 1929).</li>
<li>Carol also had a brother Myron Dale Vander Velde (born 11 March 1939), known as Mike, who was awarded a degree in electrical engineering from Michigan State University in 1966.</li>
<li>Having given some information about Carol's parents and her brothers, let us return to her biography.</li>
<li>When she was eleven, the family moved to Alliance, Ohio, where Carol attended Alliance High School.</li>
<li>We can see that Carol was a very successful student at Alliance High School from information in Red and Blue, the Alliance High School student newspaper.</li>
<li>Carol graduated from Alliance High School in 1944.</li>
<li>Around the same time Carol moved to Michigan too, enrolling for a Master's degree at Michigan State College (now Michigan State University) in East Lansing.</li>
<li>On 21 June 1952 she married Arthur Louis Karp in Los Angeles, California.</li>
<li>Arthur Karp (1930-2020) had been born in the Bronx, New York City on 20 June 1930.</li>
<li>After her marriage to Arthur Karp, Carol was known as Carol Karp.</li>
<li>However Karp was teaching several years before the award of her Ph.D. having accepted a position as instructor at New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in 1953.</li>
<li>Karp spent a year at the College in Las Cruces, New Mexico.</li>
<li>On her return from Japan, Karp accepted a post as an instructor at the University of Maryland.</li>
<li>Before she submitted her thesis, Karp published four abstracts in Volume 5 of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>Soon after the award of her doctorate Karp was promoted, in 1960, to assistant professor at the University of Maryland.</li>
<li>Basically Karp wanted to return to Gödel's original proof-theoretic definitions of recursive sets but of course using more liberal notions of proof so as to obtain generalisations of recursion theory.</li>
<li>Carol Karp was in the habit of doing most of her own research work during the summer months.</li>
<li>It was both as a teacher and researcher that Karp made her reputation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 10 August 1926, Forest Grove, Ottawa County, Michigan, USA. Died 20 August 1972, Arlington, Virginia, USA.</p>
