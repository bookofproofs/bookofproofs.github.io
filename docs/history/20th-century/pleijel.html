<p><strong>Åke Pleijel</strong> was a Swedish mathematician who worked on differential equations and potential theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pleijel graduated from the high school in Östermalm, Stockholm on 11 May 1932 and enrolled at Stockholm University on 23 May 32.</li>
<li>After graduating with his first degree, Pleijel began undertaking research advised by Torsten Carleman.</li>
<li>Pleijel extended his investigations on the asymptotic behaviour of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for certain oscillation problems to a number of other areas, including strained plates.</li>
<li>Let us record at this point that Agneta Christina Pleijel became an author, poet, playwright, journalist and literary critic; Sonja Carolina Pleijel studied at Lund University and became a TV producer, director and screenwriter.</li>
<li>On 14 September 1940 Pleijel was appointed as a docent in mathematics and an assistant in the mathematics library at the University of Stockholm, a position he held until he was appointed as a docent at Lund University on 25 April 1941.</li>
<li>While at Princeton, Pleijel worked with Subbaramiah Minakshisundaram (1913-1968), an Indian mathematician with an expertise in parabolic partial differential equations.</li>
<li>In fact, the paper contains the famous zeta function, now called the Minakshisundaram-Pleijel zeta function, which is a zeta function encoding the eigenvalues of the Laplacian of a compact Riemannian manifold.</li>
<li>Back in Sweden, Pleijel took up his appointment as professor of mathematics at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm on 1 January 1949, where he succeeded Johannes Malmquist, who had retired in 1948.</li>
<li>Pleijel had actually been appointed to this position on 22 October 1948 while he was at Princeton.</li>
<li>The 1959 International Handbook of Universities lists Lund University with Åke Pleijel as Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences with a staff of 102.</li>
<li>This decision was endorsed by the Swedish Mathematical Society on 30 November 1958 and a joint invitation was issued to the mathematicians of the world, signed by the chairmen of the National Committee and the Society, A Pleijel and G Borg.</li>
<li>O Frostman and A Pleijel were entrusted with the initial preparations for the congress together with H Cramer, at that time Chancellor of the Universities of Sweden, and Lars Gårding, all of whom later constituted the Organising Committee.</li>
<li>From 1965 to 1967 Pleijel went to Ethiopia as a representative of UNESCO.</li>
<li>Pleijel authored several textbooks for Ethiopians and, perhaps most importantly, he managed to interest some young Ethiopians in mathematical research.</li>
<li>On 30 June 1967, Pleijel was appointed as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Uppsala.</li>
<li>At the University of Uppsala, Pleijel was dean of the Faculty of Mathematical and Natural Sciences from the autumn term of 1971 to the spring term of 1973.</li>
<li>In this area, a collaboration developed with the University of Edinburgh, in which several of Pleijel's co-workers in Uppsala participated.</li>
<li>One sign of great appreciation from the Scottish partner was the election of Pleijel as member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</li>
<li>Pleijel published around 50 papers on topics such as: Differential equations, operational calculus; Ordinary differential equations; Partial differential equations, and Potential theory.</li>
<li>Several of the mathematical concepts that Pleijel introduced are now known by his name and have been the subject of many papers.</li>
<li>These include, in addition to the Minakshisundaram-Pleijel zeta function we mentioned above, the "Pleijel's nodal domain theorem", the "Pleijel's constant", "Pleijel's estimate", the "Pleijel inequality", and the "Pleijel identity".</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 10 August 1913, Johannes parish, Stockholm, Sweden. Died 24 September 1989, Västerled parish, Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
