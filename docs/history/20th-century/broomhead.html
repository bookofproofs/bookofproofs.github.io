<p><strong>David Broomhead</strong> was an English mathematician who specialised in dynamical systems.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Returning from Uganda, Broomhead matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, in 1970.</li>
<li>He published the two-volume book Molecular Quantum Mechanics in 1970, so Broomhead's project was very much in line with his current interests.</li>
<li>One important event in Broomhead's life which occurred while he was at Merton College, Oxford, was meeting Eleanor J Harries who was also studying chemistry.</li>
<li>They were later married and had one son, Nathan Thomas Broomhead.</li>
<li>After completing his thesis, David Broomhead spent a year as a postdoctoral student at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell in Oxfordshire.</li>
<li>While at the University of Kyoto, Broomhead wrote the paper The Self Interaction and Mutual Interaction of Limit Cycles.</li>
<li>Returning to England, Broomhead took up a postdoctoral position working with George Rowlands in the Physics Department at the University of Warwick in 1980.</li>
<li>Dave also made fruitful connections to the Dynamical Systems group in Warwick's Department of Mathematics including Robert MacKay, David Rand and Christopher Zeeman.</li>
<li>Broomhead left the university environment in 1983 when he took up a position in the scientific civil service.</li>
<li>In 1995 Broomhead was appointed as professor of applied mathematics at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST).</li>
<li>In 2004 UMIST merged with the University of Manchester so Broomhead became a professor in the University of Manchester.</li>
<li>In August 2002 Broomhead became the editor of Mathematics Today, a publication of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA).</li>
<li>Among the honours and awards Broomhead received, we mention the John Benjamin Memorial Prize which he was awarded (jointly with David Lowe and D A R (Andrew) Web) in 1989.</li>
<li>Broomhead died suddenly at the age of 63.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 13 November 1950, Leeds, England. Died 24 July 2014, London, England.</p>
