<p><strong>Jacob ben Tibbon</strong> was a French Jewish medical doctor who translated Arabic versions of Greek mathematics into Hebrew.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The ibn Tibbon family were famed over several generations so we begin by looking at the ancestors of the subject of this biography.</li>
<li>We begin with Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon (1120-1190) who was the great-grandfather of Jacob ben Tibbon.</li>
<li>The Almohads expelled the Jews from Muslim Spain in 1148, and Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon together with many other learned refugees, went to the south of France.</li>
<li>His son, Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon, was born in Lunel and continued his father's work of translating although he, like his father, was a medical doctor.</li>
<li>Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon's son, Moses ben Samuel ibn Tibbon, was born in Marseilles.</li>
<li>Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon, the subject of this biography, was the son of Machir ben Judah ibn Tibbon, Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon's brother.</li>
<li>Jacob was educated in Lunel and then studied medicine in the medical faculty of the University of Montpellier.</li>
<li>Jacob ben Tibbon is himself known as a translator as well as a mathematician and an astronomer.</li>
<li>Now Tibbon was much more than a translator, for he was a fine mathematician and astronomer writing original works in addition to the translations.</li>
<li>For example, he wrote Jacob's Quadrant  in which he describes a quadrant of his own invention.</li>
<li>Jacob ben Tibbon also wrote Luhot (Tables) a book of astronomical tables giving ascensions of certain stars at Paris.</li>
<li>The Italian astronomer Andalo di Negro wrote Canones Super Almanach Profatii  in 1323 which dealt with Jacob ben Tibbon's tables in Luhot .</li>
<li>Another work by Jacob ben Tibbon was Almanach Perpetuum  which, as the title indicates, was a work on the almanac.</li>
<li>At the time Tibbon wrote the work both the Toledan Tables of Arzachel and the newer Alfonsine Tables created for King Alfonso X of Castile were in use.</li>
<li>Tibbon appears to state that he used the Toledan Tables but Pierre Duhem criticised him for using 'old' tables instead of the latest available to him.</li>
<li>Tibbon's work was used by Copernicus in forming his theories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1236, Marseilles, Spain (now France). Died 1305, Montpellier, France.</p>
