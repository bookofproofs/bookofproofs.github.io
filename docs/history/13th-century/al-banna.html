<h1>Person: Al-Banna</h1>

<p><strong>Ibn al-Banna</strong> was an Islamic mathematician who wrote a large number of works including an introduction to <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/euclidean-geometry/elements-euclid/elements-euclid.html" title="Geometry / Euclidean Geometry / Elements Euclid / Chapter: Euclid&amp;#x27;s “Elements”">Euclid's Elements</a>, an algebra text and various works on astronomy.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is a little unclear whether al-Banna was born in the city of Marrakesh or whether it was the region of Marrakesh which was named Morocco by Europeans.</li>
<li>There is a claim that al-Banna was born in Granada in Spain and moved to North Africa for his education.</li>
<li>The strong link between Granada and Morocco may account for the confusion as to which country al-Banna was a native.</li>
<li>Morocco was certainly the country that al-Banna was educated in, learning the leading mathematical skills of the period.</li>
<li>At the university in Fez Al-Banna taught all branches of mathematics, which at this time included arithmetic, algebra, geometry and astronomy.</li>
<li>Many students studied under al-Banna in this thriving academic community.</li>
<li>One difficulty with the works on mathematics is knowing how much of the material which al-Banna presents is original and how much is simply his version of work by earlier Arab mathematicians which has been lost.</li>
<li>We should certainly say that al-Banna does not claim any originality and, indeed, the style of his writing would suggest that he is collecting together ideas that he has learnt from other mathematicians.</li>
<li>Perhaps al-Banna's most famous work is Talkhis amal al-hisab (Summary of arithmetical operations) and the Raf al-Hijab which is al-Banna's own commentary on the Talkhis amal al-hisab.</li>
<li>We refer the reader to the biography of al-Qalasadi where we present arguments to show that neither al-Banna nor al-Qalasadi were the inventors of mathematical notation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 December 1256, Marrakesh, Morocco. Died 13 July 1321, Marrakesh, Morocco.</p>
