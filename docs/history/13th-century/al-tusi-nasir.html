<h1>Person: Al-Tusi (2), Nasir al-Din</h1>
<p><img alt="Al-Tusi_Nasir.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Al-Tusi_Nasir.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Nasir al-Tusi</strong> was an Islamic astronomer and mathematician who joined the Mongols who conquered Baghdad. He made important contributions to astronomy and wrote many commentaries on Greek texts.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Al-Tusi was known by a number of different names during his lifetime such as Muhaqqiq-i Tusi, Khwaja-yi Tusi and Khwaja Nasir.</li>
<li>Al-Tusi was born in Tus, which lies close to Meshed in northeastern Iran high up in the valley of the Kashaf River.</li>
<li>This was a period in which there would be little peace and tranquillity for great scholars to pursue their works, and al-Tusi was inevitably drawn into the conflict engulfing his country.</li>
<li>The Twelfth Imam was the main sect of Shi'ite Muslims and the school where al-Tusi was educated was mainly a religious establishment.</li>
<li>In 1214, when al-Tusi was 13 years old, Genghis Khan, who was the leader of the Mongols, turned away from his conquests in China and began his rapid advance towards the west.</li>
<li>It would not be too long before al-Tusi would see the effects of these conquests on his own regions, but before that happened he was able to study more advanced topics.</li>
<li>From Tus, al-Tusi went to Nishapur which is 75 km west of Tus.</li>
<li>Nishapur was a good choice for al-Tusi to complete his education since it was an important centre of learning.</li>
<li>There al-Tusi studied philosophy, medicine and mathematics.</li>
<li>In particular he was taught mathematics by Kamal al-Din ibn Yunus, who himself had been a pupil of Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi.</li>
<li>While in Nishapur al-Tusi began to acquire a reputation as an outstanding scholar and became well known throughout the area.</li>
<li>There was, amid the frequent fighting in the region, peaceful havens which attracted al-Tusi.</li>
<li>When invited by the Isma'ili ruler Nasir ad-Din 'Abd ar-Rahim to join the service of the Assassins, al-Tusi accepted and became a highly regarded member of the Isma'ili Court.</li>
<li>However, al-Tusi did some of his best work while moving round the different strongholds, and during this period he wrote important works on logic, philosophy, mathematics and astronomy.</li>
<li>The first of these works, Akhlaq-i nasiri, was written in 1232.</li>
<li>It was a work on ethics which al-Tusi dedicated to the Isma'ili ruler Nasir ad-Din 'Abd ar-Rahim.</li>
<li>In 1256 al-Tusi was in the castle of Alamut when it was attacked by the forces of the Mongol leader Hulegu, a grandson of Genghis Khan, who was at that time set on extending Mongol power in Islamic areas.</li>
<li>Some claim that al-Tusi betrayed the defences of Alamut to the invading Mongols.</li>
<li>Certainly Hulegu's forces destroyed Alamut and, Hulegu himself being himself interested in science, he treated al-Tusi with great respect.</li>
<li>It may be that indeed al-Tusi felt that he was being held in Alamut against his will, for certainly he seemed enthusiastic in joining the victorious Mongols who appointed him as their scientific advisor.</li>
<li>Certainly al-Tusi had made the right move as far as his own safety was concerned, and he would also profit scientifically by his change of allegiance.</li>
<li>Hulegu was very pleased with his conquest of Baghdad and also pleased that such an eminent scholar as al-Tusi had joined him.</li>
<li>So, when al-Tusi presented Hulegu with plans for the construction of a fine Observatory, Hulegu was happy to agree.</li>
<li>It had various instruments such as a 4 metre wall quadrant made from copper and an azimuth quadrant which was the invention of Al-Tusi himself.</li>
<li>Al-Tusi also designed other instruments for the Observatory which was far more than a centre for astronomy.</li>
<li>Al-Tusi put his Observatory to good use, making very accurate tables of planetary movements.</li>
<li>This was not the only important work which al-Tusi produced in astronomy.</li>
<li>It is fair to say that al-Tusi made the most significant development of Ptolemy's model of the planetary system up to the development of the heliocentric model in the time of Copernicus.</li>
<li>The aim of al-Tusi with this result was to remove all parts of Ptolemy's system that were not based on the principle of uniform circular motion.</li>
<li>Among numerous other contributions to astronomy, al-Tusi calculated the value of 51' for the precession of the equinoxes.</li>
<li>In logic al-Tusi followed the teachings of ibn Sina.</li>
<li>Al-Tusi wrote many commentaries on Greek texts.</li>
<li>In the latter work al-Tusi discussed objections raised by earlier mathematicians to comparing lengths of straight lines and of curved lines.</li>
<li>Al-Tusi argues that comparisons are legitimate, despite the objections that, being different entities, they are incomparable.</li>
<li>As in the Zij-i Ilkhahi al-Tusi gave tables of sines with entries calculated to three sexagesimal places for each half degree of the argument.</li>
<li>One of al-Tusi's most important mathematical contributions was the creation of trigonometry as a mathematical discipline in its own right rather than as just a tool for astronomical applications.</li>
<li>In Treatise on the quadrilateral al-Tusi gave the first extant exposition of the whole system of plane and spherical trigonometry.</li>
<li>This work by al-Tusi is almost certainly not original but rather it is his version of methods developed by al-Karaji's school.</li>
<li>In the manuscript al-Tusi determined the coefficients of the expansion of a binomial to any power giving the binomial formula and the Pascal triangle relations between binomial coefficients.</li>
<li>We should mention briefly other fields in which al-Tusi contributed.</li>
<li>Much more important were al-Tusi's contributions to philosophy and ethics.</li>
<li>Al-Tusi had a number of pupils, one of the better known being Nizam al-a'Raj who also wrote a commentary on the Almagest Ⓣ(The major thesis: from the Arabic 'al-majisti' -- the Arabic translation of the Greek 'Mathematike Syntaxis' later translated into Latin as 'Magna Syntaxis').</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 February 1201, Tus, Khorasan (now Iran). Died 26 June 1274, Kadhimain (near Baghdad now in Iraq).</p>
