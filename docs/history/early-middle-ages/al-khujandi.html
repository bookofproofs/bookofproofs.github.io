<h1>Person: Al-Khujandi, Abu Mahmud Hamid ibn al-Khidr</h1>
<p><img alt="avatar.png" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/avatar.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Al-Khujandi</strong> was an Islamic astronomer and mathematician. He made accurate astronomical observations and may have made some advances in trigonometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>From al-Tusi's comments we can be fairly certain that al-Khujandi came from the city of Khujand.</li>
<li>Al-Tusi says that al-Khujandi was one of the rulers of the Mongol tribe in that region so he must have come from the nobility.</li>
<li>Al-Khujandi was supported in his scientific work for most of his life by members of the Buyid dynasty.</li>
<li>Al-Khujandi received patronage from Fakhr ad-Dawlah who ruled from 976 to 997.</li>
<li>It was Fakhr ad-Dawlah who supported al-Khujandi in his major project to construct a huge mural sextant for his observatory at Rayy, which is near modern Tehran.</li>
<li>Al-Khujandi's mural sextant was his own invention and it did break new ground in having a scale which indicated seconds, a level of accuracy never before attempted.</li>
<li>During the year 994 al-Khujandi used the very large instrument to observe a series of meridian transits of the sun near the solstices.</li>
<li>There is, however, an error in al-Khujandi's value for the obliquity of the ecliptic; it is about two minutes too low.</li>
<li>The error was discussed by al-Biruni in his Tahdid where he claimed that the aperture of the sextant settled about one span in the course of al-Khujandi's observations due to the weight of the instrument.</li>
<li>However, al-Khujandi's latitude for Rayy, 35° 34' 38.45", despite being calculated using his erroneous value for the obliquity of the ecliptic, is accurate to the nearest minute of arc.</li>
<li>It remains for us to discuss the claim that al-Khujandi discovered the sine theorem.</li>
<li>The claim was made by al-Tusi who gives al-Khujandi's proof of the result for spherical triangles in his Shakl al-qatta.</li>
<li>Although there is no reason to doubt al-Tusi that the proof he gives does indeed come from al-Khujandi there is quite a few reason to believe that one of Abu'l-Wafa or Abu Nasr Mansur was the original discoverer.</li>
<li>Both Abu'l-Wafa and Abu Nasr Mansur claim to have discovered the sine theorem while, as far as we are aware, al-Khujandi makes no such claim.</li>
<li>Also al-Khujandi was more of a designer of astronomical instruments and an astronomical observer than he was theoretician.</li>
<li>We should make one final comment on the mathematical contributions of al-Khujandi.</li>
<li>that what Abu Muhammad al-Khujandi advanced - may God have mercy on him - in his demonstration that the sum of two cubic numbers is not a cube, is defective and incorrect.</li>
<li>It is certainly interesting that al-Khujandi, despite his practical rather than theoretical achievements, should be interested in this number theory result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 940, Khujand, Tajikistan. Died 1000.</p>
