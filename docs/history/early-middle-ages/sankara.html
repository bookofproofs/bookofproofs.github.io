<h1>Person: Narayana, Sankara</h1>

<p><strong>Sankara Narayana</strong> was an Indian astronomer and mathematician. He wrote a commentary on the work of Bhaskara I.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Laghubhaskariya vivarana was written by Sankara Narayana in 869 AD for the author writes in the text that it is written in the Shaka year 791 which translates to a date AD by adding 78.</li>
<li>Perhaps the most unusual feature of the Laghubhaskariya vivarana is the use of katapayadi numeration as well as the place-value Sanskrit numerals which Sankara Narayana frequently uses.</li>
<li>Sankara Narayana is the first author known to use katapayadi numeration with this name but he did not invent it for it appears to be identical to a system invented earlier which was called varnasamjna.</li>
<li>The numeration system varnasamjna was almost certainly invented by the astronomer Haridatta, and it was explained by him in a text which many historians believe was written in 684 but this would contradict what Sankara Narayana himself writes.</li>
<li>First we should explain ideas behind Sankara Narayana's katapayadi numeration.</li>
<li>Very unusually for an Indian text, Sankara Narayana expresses his thanks to those who have gone before him and developed the ideas about which he is writing.</li>
<li>This in itself is not so unusual but the surprise here is that Sankara Narayana claims to give the list in chronological order.</li>
<li>However, putting Haridatta after Govindasvami would seem an unlikely mistake for Sankara Narayana to make if Haridatta really did write his text in 684 since Sankara Narayana was himself a disciple of Govindasvami.</li>
<li>If the dating given by Sankara Narayana is correct then katapayadi numeration had been invented only a few years before he wrote his text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 840, India. Died about 900, India.</p>
