<h1>Person: Al-Mahani, Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Isa</h1>
<p><img alt="avatar.png" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/avatar.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Al-Mahani</strong> was an Islamic mathematician who tried to solve some of Archimedes' problems on cutting up spheres.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>We do know a little about al-Mahani's work in astronomy from Ibn Yunus's astronomical handbook al-Zij al-Hakimi al-kabir.</li>
<li>In this work Ibn Yunus quotes from writings by al-Mahani, which have since been lost, which describe observations which al-Mahani made between the years 853 and 866.</li>
<li>At least we have accurate dating of al-Mahani's life from this source.</li>
<li>It gives a full account of the Arabic literature which was available in the 10th  century and in particular mentions al-Mahani, not for his work in astronomy, but rather for his work in geometry and arithmetic.</li>
<li>However the work which al-Mahani did in mathematics may well have been motivated by various problems of an astronomical nature.</li>
<li>We know that some of al-Mahani's work in algebra was motivated by trying to solve problems due to Archimedes.</li>
<li>It was Omar Khayyam, giving an important historical description of algebra, who puts al-Mahani's work into context.</li>
<li>It would be too easy to say that since al-Mahani has proposed a method of solution which he could not carry through then his work was of little value.</li>
<li>However, this, as Omar Khayyam is well aware, is not so at all and the fact that al-Mahani conceived the idea of reducing problems such as duplicating the cube to problems in algebra was an important step forward.</li>
<li>A number of works by al-Mahani have survived, in particular commentaries which he wrote on parts of Euclid's Elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 820, Mahan, Kerman, Persia (now Iran). Died 880, Baghdad, Iraq.</p>
