<h1>Person: Alhazen, Abu Ali Al-Hasan ibn Al-Haytham</h1>

<p><strong>Al-Haytham</strong> is also known as <strong>Alhazen</strong>. He was an Islamic mathematician who wrote early works on optics as well as geometry and number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>We shall discuss this problem, and ibn al-Haytham's other work, after giving some biographical details.</li>
<li>In contrast to our lack of knowledge of the lives of many of the Arabic mathematicians, we have quite a number of details of ibn al-Haytham's life.</li>
<li>It is worth commenting that an autobiography written by ibn al-Haytham in 1027 survives, but it says nothing of the events his life and concentrates on his intellectual development.</li>
<li>Since the main events that we know of in ibn al-Haytham's life involve his time in Egypt, we should set the scene regarding that country.</li>
<li>These events were happening while ibn al-Haytham was a young boy growing up in Basra.</li>
<li>We know little of ibn al-Haytham's years in Basra.</li>
<li>However, ibn al-Haytham became increasingly unhappy with his deep studies of religion and made a decision to devote himself entirely to a study of science which he found most clearly described in the writings of Aristotle.</li>
<li>Having made this decision, ibn al-Haytham kept to it for the rest of his life devoting all his energies to mathematics, physics, and other sciences.</li>
<li>Ibn al-Haytham went to Egypt some considerable time after he made the decision to give up his job as a minister and to devote himself to science, for he had made his reputation as a famous scientist while still in Basra.</li>
<li>We do know that al-Hakim was Caliph when ibn al-Haytham reached Egypt.</li>
<li>Al-Hakim, despite being a cruel leader who murdered his enemies, was a patron of the sciences employing top quality scientists such as the astronomer ibn Yunus.</li>
<li>Our knowledge of ibn al-Haytham's interaction with al-Hakim comes from a number of sources, the most important of which is the writings of al-Qifti.</li>
<li>We are told that al-Hakim learnt of a proposal by ibn al-Haytham to regulate the flow of water down the Nile.</li>
<li>He requested that ibn al-Haytham come to Egypt to carry out his proposal and al-Hakim appointed him to head an engineering team which would undertake the task.</li>
<li>However, as the team travelled further and further up the Nile, ibn al-Haytham realised that his idea to regulate the flow of water with large constructions would not work.</li>
<li>Ibn al-Haytham returned with his engineering team and reported to al-Hakim that they could not achieve their aim.</li>
<li>Al-Hakim, disappointed with ibn al-Haytham's scientific abilities, appointed him to an administrative post.</li>
<li>At first ibn al-Haytham accepted this but soon realised that al-Hakim was a dangerous man whom he could not trust.</li>
<li>It appears that ibn al-Haytham pretended to be mad and as a result was confined to his house until after al-Hakim's death in 1021.</li>
<li>According to al-Qifti, ibn al-Haytham lived for the rest of his life near the Azhar Mosque in Cairo writing mathematics texts, teaching and making money by copying texts.</li>
<li>Since the Fatimids founded the University of Al-Azhar based on this mosque in 970, ibn al-Haytham must have been associated with this centre of learning.</li>
<li>A different report says that after failing in his mission to regulate the Nile, ibn al-Haytham fled from Egypt to Syria where he spent the rest of his life.</li>
<li>This however seems unlikely for other reports certainly make it certain that ibn al-Haytham was in Egypt in 1038.</li>
<li>One further complication is the title of a work ibn al-Haytham wrote in 1027 which is entitled Ibn al-Haytham's answer to a geometrical question addressed to him in Baghdad.</li>
<li>Yet another version has ibn al-Haytham pretending to be mad while still in Basra.</li>
<li>Ibn al-Haytham's writings are too extensive for us to be able to cover even a reasonable amount.</li>
<li>A seven volume work on optics, Kitab al-Manazir, is considered by many to be ibn al-Haytham's most important contribution.</li>
<li>The previous major work on optics had been Ptolemy's Almagest Ⓣ(The major thesis: from the Arabic 'al-majisti' -- the Arabic translation of the Greek 'Mathematike Syntaxis' later translated into Latin as 'Magna Syntaxis') and although ibn al-Haytham's work did not have an influence to equal that of Ptolemy's, nevertheless it must be regarded as the next major contribution to the field.</li>
<li>The work begins with an introduction in which ibn al-Haytham says that he will begin "the inquiry into the principles and premises".</li>
<li>Although we have quoted the problem for spherical mirrors, ibn al-Haytham also considered cylindrical and conical mirrors.</li>
<li>Ibn al-Haytham's study of refraction led him to propose that the atmosphere had a finite depth of about 15 km.</li>
<li>Abu al-Qasim ibn Madan was an astronomer who proposed questions to ibn al-Haytham, raising doubts about some of Ptolemy's explanations of physical phenomena.</li>
<li>Ibn al-Haytham wrote a treatise Solution of doubts in which he gives his answers to these questions.</li>
<li>There are strange contrasts in ibn al-Haytham's work relating to Ptolemy.</li>
<li>In Al-Shukuk ala Batlamyus (Doubts concerning Ptolemy), ibn al-Haytham is critical of Ptolemy's ideas yet in a popular work the Configuration, intended for the layman, ibn al-Haytham completely accepts Ptolemy's views without question.</li>
<li>One of the mathematical problems which ibn al-Haytham attacked was the problem of squaring the circle.</li>
<li>Whether ibn al-Haytham suspected that the problem was insoluble or whether he only realised that he could not solve it, in an interesting question which will never be answered.</li>
<li>In Opuscula ibn al-Haytham considers the solution of a system of congruences.</li>
<li>Here ibn al-Haytham gives a general method of solution which, in the special case, gives the solution (7 - 1)! + 1.</li>
<li>Ibn al-Haytham's second method gives all the solutions to systems of congruences of the type stated (which of course is a special case of the Chinese Remainder Theorem).</li>
<li>Another contribution by ibn al-Haytham to number theory was his work on perfect numbers.</li>
<li>Ibn al-Haytham's main purpose in Analysis and synthesis is to study the methods mathematicians use to solve problems.</li>
<li>The ancient Greeks used analysis to solve geometric problems but ibn al-Haytham sees it as a more general mathematical method which can be applied to other problems such as those in algebra.</li>
<li>In this work ibn al-Haytham realises that analysis was not an algorithm which could automatically be applied using given rules but he realises that the method requires intuition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 965, (possibly) Basra, Persia (now Iraq). Died 1040, (possibly) Cairo, Egypt.</p>
