<h1>Person: Hunayn Ibn Ishaq</h1>

<p><strong>Hunayn ibn Ishaq</strong> was a Nestorian Christian mathematician who is most important as a translator, making Greek works available to the Islamic mathematicians.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His son Ishaq ibn Hunayn, strongly influenced by his father, is famed for his Arabic translation of Euclid's Elements.</li>
<li>Hunayn's father was Ishaq, a pharmacist from Hira.</li>
<li>The family were from a group who had belonged to the Syrian Nestorian Christian Church before the rise of Islam, and Hunayn was brought up as a Christian.</li>
<li>Hunayn became skilled in languages as a young man, in particular learning Arabic at Basra and also learning Syriac.</li>
<li>To continue his education Hunayn went to Baghdad to study medicine under the leading teacher of the time.</li>
<li>However, after falling out with this teacher, Hunayn left Baghdad and, probably during a period in Alexandria, became an expert in the Greek language.</li>
<li>Hunayn returned to Baghdad and established contact with the teacher with whom he had fallen out.</li>
<li>Let us go back to a time before Hunayn was born and describe the events which would lead to a remarkeble period of scholarship.</li>
<li>The first steps began to be taken which would allow Greek knowledge to spread through the Islamic empire, a process in which Hunayn was to play a major role.</li>
<li>Harun al-Rashid died in 809, the year after Hunayn's birth, and there was an armed conflict between his two sons.</li>
<li>It is thought that Hunayn, being more skilled in the Greek language than any of the other scholars in Baghdad, was on this expedition.</li>
<li>There they worked with Hunayn and later also with Thabit ibn Qurra.</li>
<li>Hunayn became a close friend of Muhammad Banu Musa although relations between some of the scholars was not good due to rivalry.</li>
<li>Caliph al-Wathiq was succeeded as Caliph in 847 by al-Mutawakkil who appointed Hunayn to the post of chief physician at his court, a position he held for the rest of his life.</li>
<li>Under both these Caliphs internal arguments and rivalry arose between the scholars in the House of Wisdom and Hunayn was most certainly involved in this rivalry.</li>
<li>The rivalry could certainly become serious and at one point Hunayn had his library confiscated and he was imprisoned.</li>
<li>Hunayn is important for the many excellent translations of Greek texts which he made into Arabic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 808, Al-Hirah (now in Iraq). Died 873, Baghdad (now in Iraq).</p>
