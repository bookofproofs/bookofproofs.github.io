<h1>Person: Al-Battani, Abu Abdallah Mohammad ibn Jabir</h1>

<p><strong>Al-Battani</strong> or <strong>Albategnius</strong> was an Islamic astronomer and mathematician. He made important accurate measurements of the stars, moon and planets. His measurements and methods were used by later astronomers.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His full name was Abu Abdallah Mohammad ibn Jabir ibn Sinan al-Raqqi al-Harrani al-Sabi al-Battani.</li>
<li>Al-Battani was born in Harran, called Carrhae in earlier times by the Romans, which lies on the Balikh River, 38 km southeast of Urfa.</li>
<li>Thabit was also born in Harran and would have still have been living there at the time that al-Battani was born.</li>
<li>Al-Battani, unlike Thabit, was not a believer in the Sabian religion, however, for "Abu Abdallah Mohammad" indicates that he was certainly a Muslim.</li>
<li>Al-Battani made his remarkably accurate astronomical observations at Antioch and ar-Raqqah in Syria.</li>
<li>The town of ar-Raqqah, where most of al-Battani's observations were made, became prosperous when Harun al-Rashid, who became the fifth Caliph of the Abbasid dynasty on 14 September 786, built several palaces there.</li>
<li>The town had been renamed al-Rashid at that time but, by the time al-Battani began observing there, it had reverted to the name of ar-Raqqah.</li>
<li>Other information about al-Battani contained in the Fihrist is that he observed between the years 877 and 918 and that his star catalogue is based on the year 880.</li>
<li>Al-Battani reached Baghdad and put his arguments but died on the return journey to ar-Raqqah.</li>
<li>The Fihrist also quotes a number of works by al-Battani.</li>
<li>Al-Battani's Kitab al-Zij is by far his most important work and we should examine briefly the topics which it covered.</li>
<li>Chapter 4 contains data from al-Battani's own observations.</li>
<li>The motions of the sun, moon and five planets are discussed in chapters 27 to 31, where the theory given is that of Ptolemy but for al-Battani the theory appears less important than the practical aspects.</li>
<li>After giving results to allow data given for one era to be converted to another era, al-Battani then gives 16 chapters which explain how his tables are to be read.</li>
<li>What are the main achievements of al-Battani's Zij?</li>
<li>Rather than using geometrical methods, as Ptolemy had done, al-Battani used trigonometrical methods which were an important advance.</li>
<li>Al-Battani showed that the farthest distance of the Sun from the Earth varies and, as a result, annular eclipses of the Sun are possible as well as total eclipses.</li>
<li>This was despite the fact that al-Battani could deduce a value for the distance from his own observations that differed greatly from Ptolemy's.</li>
<li>Al-Battani is important in the development of science for a number of reasons, but one of these must be the large influence his work had on scientists such as Tycho Brahe, Kepler, Galileo and Copernicus.</li>
<li>The author suggests that al-Battani obtained much more accurate results simply because his observations were made from a more southerly latitude.</li>
<li>For al-Battani refraction had little effect on his meridian observations at the winter solstice because, at his more southerly site of ar-Raqqah, the sun was higher in the sky.</li>
<li>Al-Battani's Kitab al-Zij was translated into Latin as De motu stellarum Ⓣ(On the motion of the stars)  by Plato of Tivoli.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 850, Harran (near Urfa), Mesopotamia (now Turkey). Died 929, Qasr al-Jiss, Iraq.</p>
