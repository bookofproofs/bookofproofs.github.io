<h1>Person: Sridhara</h1>

<p><strong>Sridhara</strong> was an Indian mathematician who wrote on practical applications of algebra and was one of the first to give a formula for solving quadratic equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>However, there has been much dispute over his date and in different works the dates of the life of Sridhara have been placed from the seventh century to the eleventh century.</li>
<li>We do know that Sridhara was a Hindu but little else is known.</li>
<li>Some historians give Bengal as the place of his birth while other historians believe that Sridhara was born in southern India.</li>
<li>Sridhara is known as the author of two mathematical treatises, namely the Trisatika (sometimes called the Patiganitasara ) and the Patiganita.</li>
<li>We give details below of Sridhara's rule for solving quadratic equations as given by Bhaskara II.</li>
<li>There is another mathematical treatise Ganitapancavimsi which some historians believe was written by Sridhara.</li>
<li>Through the whole book Sridhara gives methods to solve problems in terse rules in verse form which was the typical style of Indian texts at this time.</li>
<li>Indeed there is no suggestion that Sridhara realised that proofs are in any way necessary.</li>
<li>Often after stating a rule Sridhara gives one or more numerical examples, but he does not give solutions to these example nor does he even give answers in this work.</li>
<li>After giving the rules for computing with natural numbers, Sridhara gives rules for operating with rational fractions.</li>
<li>Sridhara was one of the first mathematicians to give a rule to solve a quadratic equation.</li>
<li>There is no suggestion that Sridhara took two values when he took the square root.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 870, possibly Bengal, India. Died about 930, India.</p>
