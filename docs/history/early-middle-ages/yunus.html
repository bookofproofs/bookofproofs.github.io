<h1>Person: Ibn Yunus, Abu&amp;amp;#x27;l-Hasan Ali Ibn Abd al-Rahman</h1>

<p><strong>Ibn Yunus</strong> was an Islamic mathematician known for his astronomical observations and for his many trigonometrical and astronomical tables.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>As the name indicates, his great-grandfather was called Yunus, his grandfather was Ahmad, and his father Abd al-Rahman.</li>
<li>We know little of ibn Yunus's childhood but we do know that he grew up in a period of military conquest in Egypt.</li>
<li>Ibn Yunus was closely connected with the Fatimids and two Caliphs supported his scientific work.</li>
<li>Al-Aziz became Caliph in 975 on the death of his father al-Mu'izz and, two years later, ibn Yunus began to make astronomical observations.</li>
<li>Although there is uncertainty about the instruments that ibn Yunus used, it is claimed by early writers that al-Aziz provided ibn Yunus with at least some instruments.</li>
<li>Famed for his astronomical observations, ibn Yunus was also an astrologer but he is most famous for his many trigonometrical and astronomical tables.</li>
<li>Of course it was very reasonable for a Caliph to support the type of astronomical work that ibn Yunus was undertaking.</li>
<li>Perhaps al-Aziz would have given better support to ibn Yunus if he had not been so involved in military and political ventures in northern Syria trying to expand the Fatimid empire.</li>
<li>For most of his 20 year reign he worked towards this aim while ibn Yunus toiled on his astronomical work.</li>
<li>Certainly al-Hakim supported ibn Yunus in his astronomical work, although it is hard to determine the strength of that support.</li>
<li>Perhaps al-Hakim's interest in astrology meant that he favoured ibn Yunus who is reported by his biographers to have devoted considerable amounts of time to making astrological predictions.</li>
<li>Ibn Yunus and al-Hakim were both eccentrics, although al-Hakim's eccentricities were more damaging, while ibn Yunus's sound rather typical of someone totally absorbed in academic pursuits.</li>
<li>On the other hand al-Hakim ordered the sacking of the city al-Fustat, the city in which ibn Yunus sometimes observed from his great-grandfather's house.</li>
<li>However, probably because of his interest in astrology, al-Hakim kept some astronomical instruments in his house overlooking Cairo and we know that on at least one occasion ibn Yunus observed Venus from al-Hakim's house.</li>
<li>Ibn Yunus's major work, an astronomical handbook, was al-Zij al-Hakimi al-kabir.</li>
<li>'Al-kabir' means 'large' which is apt and 'al-Hakimi' means that the work is dedicated to Caliph al-Hakim who certainly supported ibn Yunus.</li>
<li>There are lists of observations made by Yunus and also observations made by his predecessors.</li>
<li>We can confirm, using modern knowledge of the positions of the planets, that ibn Yunus was exactly right in his description and that the distance of one third of a degree that he gives is again exactly right.</li>
<li>We gathered to observe this eclipse at al-Qarafa, in the Mosque of Ibn Nasr al Maghribi.</li>
<li>Ibn Yunus gives tables to convert dates between these calendars.</li>
<li>Many other tables have been attriributed to ibn Yunus.</li>
<li>The author notes that ibn Yunus used data for these tables that he had collected for the Hakimi Zij.</li>
<li>The high degree of accuracy displayed by these tables suggests to D A King that ibn Yunus used systems of nonlinear interpolation.</li>
<li>Perhaps it is worth mentioning that, contrary to claims which are often made, there is no evidence to suggest that ibn Yunus used a pendulum for time measurements.</li>
<li>Ibn Yunus predicted the date of his own death to be in seven days time when he was in good health.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 950, Egypt. Died 1009, Fustat, Egypt.</p>
