<h1>Person: Banu Musa Brothers</h1>

<p>The <strong>Bana Musa brothers</strong> were Islamic mathematicians whose work is almost indistinguishable.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The three links above give details specific to each of the brothers but most of the information about them is on this page.</li>
<li>It is quite impossible to write separate biographies of the three brother, who are usually known as the Banu Musa, and we shall not attempt to do so.</li>
<li>The Banu Musa brothers were among the first group of mathematicians to begin to carry forward the mathematical developments begun by the ancient Greeks.</li>
<li>Harun al-Rashid became the fifth Caliph of the Abbasid dynasty on 14 September 786, not long after Musa ibn Shakir, the father of the Banu Musa brothers, was born.</li>
<li>An example of this change is seen in the life of Musa ibn Shakir, the father of the Banu Musa brothers, who was a robber in his youth but turned to science, becoming highly proficient in astronomy.</li>
<li>Even before this time Musa ibn Shakir had become a close friend of al-Ma'mun and when Musa ibn Shakir died, al-Ma'mun became the guardian of the Banu Musa brothers.</li>
<li>The brothers were given the best education in Baghdad, studying geometry, mechanics, music, mathematics and astronomy.</li>
<li>Al-Ma'mun recruited the most talented men for the House of Wisdom and appointed the Banu Musa brothers whose talents he had quickly come to appreciate.</li>
<li>Hunayn ibn Ishaq and later Thabit ibn Qurra also worked in the House of Wisdom with the Banu Musa brothers.</li>
<li>Under both these Caliphs internal arguments and rivalry arose between the scholars in the House of Wisdom and the Banu Musa brothers were certainly involved in this rivalry.</li>
<li>became enemies of the famous philosopher al-Kindi and caused him to lose favour with al-Mutawakkil, who ordered him to be beaten and allowed the brothers to confiscate his library.</li>
<li>We now turn to the important mathematical contributions made by the Banu Musa brothers.</li>
<li>The most studied treatise written by the Banu Musa is Kitab marifat masakhat al-ashkal Ⓣ(The Book of the Measurement of Plane and Spherical Figures).</li>
<li>This work became well known through the translation into Latin by Gherard of Cremona entitled Liber trium fratum de geometria Ⓣ(The geometry book of the three brothers).</li>
<li>There are many similarities in the methods employed by the Banu Musa and those employed by Archimedes.</li>
<li>The Banu Musa apply the method of exhaustion invented by Eudoxus and used so effectively by Archimedes.</li>
<li>As used by the Banu Musa the "method of exhaustion" loses most of its subtlety and power.</li>
<li>In another aspect, however, the Banu Musa made a definite step forward.</li>
<li>The Banu Musa's concept of number is broader than that of the Greeks.</li>
<li>The Banu Musa also introduce geometrical proofs which involve thinking of the geometric objects as moving.</li>
<li>In astronomy the brothers made many contributions.</li>
<li>Observations of the star Regulus were made by the three brothers from their house on a bridge in Baghdad in 840-41, 847-48, and 850-51.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 800, Baghdad, (now in Iraq). Died 860, Iraq.</p>
