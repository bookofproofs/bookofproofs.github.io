<h1>Person: Al-Quhi, Abu Sahl Waijan ibn Rustam</h1>

<p><strong>Al-Quhi</strong> was an Islamic mathematician who was a leading figure in the revival and continuation of Greek geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>We can deduce from al-Quhi's name that he came from the village of Quh in Tabaristan.</li>
<li>A great patron of science and the arts, 'Adud ad-Dawlah supported a number of mathematicians at his court in Baghdad, including al-Quhi, Abu'l-Wafa and al-Sijzi.</li>
<li>These observations of the winter and summer solstices were made by al-Quhi, al-Sijzi and other scientists in Shiraz during 969/970.</li>
<li>He continued to support mathematics and astronomy so al-Quhi remained at the court in Baghdad working for the new Caliph.</li>
<li>Sharaf ad-Dawlah required al-Quhi to make observations of the seven planets and in order to do this al-Quhi had an observatory built in the garden of the palace in Baghdad.</li>
<li>The instruments in the observatory were built to al-Quhi's own design and installed once the building was complete.</li>
<li>Al-Quhi was made director of the observatory and it was officially opened in June 988.</li>
<li>We mention later in this article correspondence between al-Quhi and al-Sabi.</li>
<li>Our description of al-Quhi's life has highlighted his work in astronomy.</li>
<li>The geometric problems that al-Quhi studied usually led to quadratic or cubic equations.</li>
<li>If a solution exists, al-Quhi showed that it will have coordinates which lie on a particular rectangular hyperbola that he has constructed.</li>
<li>Of course, al-Quhi does not express the mathematics in these modern terms but rather in the usual classical geometry of ancient Greek mathematics.</li>
<li>Next al-Quhi introduces the "cone of the surface" which, after many deductions, leads to showing that the solution has coordinates lying on a parabola.</li>
<li>In another treatise On the construction of an equilateral pentagon in a known square al-Quhi solves the problem given in the title again using the intersection of two conic sections, this time two hyperbolas.</li>
<li>The other, which requires the solution of a quartic equation, is the one presented by al-Quhi.</li>
<li>Indeed al-Quhi did consider the problem of constructing astrolabes in On the construction of the astrolabe.</li>
<li>There are a number of difficult mapping problems solved by al-Quhi in this work.</li>
<li>Despite the appearance of the work being of practical use in constructing an astrolabe, it would appear that al-Quhi was more interested in the mathematics for its own sake than he was in giving a practical manual.</li>
<li>Finally we should mention the correspondence between al-Quhi and al-Sabi which we mentioned above.</li>
<li>Perhaps the most interesting parts of the correspondence are six theorems given by al-Quhi concerning the centres of gravity of various figures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 940, Tabaristan (now Mazanderan), Persia (now Iran). Died about 1000.</p>
