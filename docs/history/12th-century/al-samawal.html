<h1>Person: Al-Samawal</h1>
<p><img alt="avatar.png" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/avatar.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Al-Samawal</strong> was an Islamic mathematician who was able to extend the arithmetic operations to handle polynomials. He used an early form of induction.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Abul-Abbas was born in Fez in Morocco and later moved to Baghdad where he was living at the time of al-Samawal's birth.</li>
<li>At about the same time as he began to study medicine, al-Samawal also began to study mathematics.</li>
<li>Baghdad at this time was not a great centre for mathematical learning, and al-Samawal had soon mastered all the mathematics which his teachers knew.</li>
<li>In order to take his mathematical studies further, al-Samawal had to study on his own.</li>
<li>His most famous treatise al-Bahir fi'l-jabr, meaning The brilliant in algebra, was written when al-Samawal was only nineteen years old.</li>
<li>Al-Samawal's predecessors had begun to develop what has been called by historians today the "arithmetisation of algebra".</li>
<li>This will strongly suggest to mathematicians today that al-Samawal was developing the study of polynomial rings and indeed this is a fair description of the work he was undertaking.</li>
<li>After defining polynomials, al-Samawal describes addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of polynomials.</li>
<li>Al-Samawal could not have described arithmetic operations on powers of the unknown without having developed an understanding of negative numbers.</li>
<li>Multiplication of negative numbers was also completely understood by al-Samawal.</li>
<li>In Book 2 of al-Bahir al-Samawal describes the theory of quadratic equations but, rather surprisingly, he gave geometric solutions to these equations despite algebraic methods having been fully described by al-Khwarizmi, al-Karaji, and others.</li>
<li>Also in this book is al-Samawal's description of the binomial theorem where the coefficients are given by the Pascal triangle.</li>
<li>The method is attributed by al-Samawal to al-Karaji and provides the only surviving account of this remarkable work.</li>
<li>Perhaps one of the most remarkable achievements appearing in Book 2 is al-Samawal's use of an early form of induction.</li>
<li>Al-Karaji had failed to solve this problem, which explains why al-Samawal was particularly pleased to solve it.</li>
<li>Of course such a system of 210 equations need not be consistent and al-Samawal gave the 504 conditions which are necessary for the system to be consistent.</li>
<li>After writing the al-Bahir al-Samawal travelled in many countries including Iraq, Syria, Kohistan (a mountainous area in Pakistan and Afghanistan) and Azerbaijan (northwestern of Iran).</li>
<li>We know from his own writings that he was in Maragheh in Azerbaijan on 8 November 1163, for on that date al-Samawal made a commitment to the faith of Islam.</li>
<li>This decision was not taken without a great deal of thought by al-Samawal.</li>
<li>We mentioned that al-Samawal was trained in medicine in his youth.</li>
<li>Several rulers, always keen to have the best possible doctors, became patients of al-Samawal.</li>
<li>The only medical work by al-Samawal which has survived is essentially a sex manual which includes many erotic stories.</li>
<li>The work exhibits the fact that al-Samawal was a good scientific observer in his descriptions of various diseases.</li>
<li>In particular al-Samawal shows that he is interested in the psychological aspects of disease.</li>
<li>Most of the works of al-Samawal have not survived, but he is reported to have written 85 books or articles.</li>
<li>Some other of al-Samawal's mathematical writings have survived but these are elementary works of relatively little importance.</li>
<li>Al-Samawal's elementary texts were clearly teaching books.</li>
<li>Another of al-Samawal's surviving works is The exposure of the errors of the astrologers which, as the title suggests, argues against the scientific value of astrology.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 1130, Baghdad, Iraq. Died about 1180, Maragha, Iran.</p>
