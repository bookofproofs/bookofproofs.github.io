<p><strong>Nicole Oresme</strong> was a French mathematician who invented coordinate geometry long before Descartes. He was the first to use a fractional exponent and also worked on infinite series.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Buridan had a major influence in interesting Oresme in natural philosophy and in encouraging him to question the ideas of Aristotle.</li>
<li>Oresme's name appears on the list of scholarship holders in theology at the College of Navarre at the University of Paris in the year 1348.</li>
<li>Not long after this Oresme became friendly with the dauphin Charles who went on to become Charles V of France in 1362.</li>
<li>The friendship between Charles and Oresme was one which continued throughout their lives.</li>
<li>Charles was in intellectual and religious man who enjoyed the company of scholars such as Oresme.</li>
<li>After six years as the Grand Master of the College of Navarre, Oresme left in 1362 to become canon of the Cathedral of Rouen.</li>
<li>In 1364 he became dean of the Cathedral of Rouen and, his friend Charles becoming King of France on 8 April of that year, Oresme was appointed as Charles' chaplain and councillor.</li>
<li>As a reward for this work Charles appointed Oresme bishop of Lisieux in 1377 and he was consecrated in the following year.</li>
<li>At a time when Aristotle's ideas were accepted almost without question, Oresme did indeed question them.</li>
<li>Oresme invented a type of coordinate geometry before Descartes, finding the logical equivalence between tabulating values and graphing them in De configurationibus qualitatum et motuum.</li>
<li>It is possible that Descartes was influenced by Oresme's work since it was reprinted several times over the 100 years following its first publication.</li>
<li>Oresme was the first to prove Merton's theorem, namely that the distance travelled in a fixed time by a body moving under uniform acceleration is the same as if the body moved at a uniform speed equal to its speed at the midpoint of the time period.</li>
<li>Another work by Oresme De proportionibus proportionum contains the first use of a fractional exponent, although, of course, not in modern notation.</li>
<li>Oresme also worked on infinite series and argued for an infinite void beyond the Earth.</li>
<li>None of these claims is, in fact, true, although each is based on discussion by Oresme of some penetration and originality ...</li>
<li>In Livre du ciel et du monde (1377) Oresme opposed the theory of a stationary Earth as proposed by Aristotle and in this work he proposed rotation of the Earth some 200 years before Copernicus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1323, Allemagne (west of Riez), France. Died 11 July 1382, Lisieux, France.</p>
