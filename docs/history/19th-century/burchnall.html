<p><strong>Joseph Langley Burchnall</strong> was an English mathematician who worked in the theory of differential operators.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It was a large family with Henry and his wife Ann Newport having four sons and two daughters - Joseph was their first child.</li>
<li>Around 1900, when Joseph was eight years of age, the family moved north-east when his father became a school master in the village of Butterwick, near Boston, in Lincolnshire.</li>
<li>Joseph was educated at Boston Grammar School, supported by a Holland County Council Scholarship, where he won the Parry Gold Medal in 1908.</li>
<li>It is not entirely clear that an academic career was Burchnall's first choice for, later in life, he told a friend that he would have liked to have joined the Civil Service but thought that with his disability life in London would be too difficult.</li>
<li>He played a large part in the discussions on reconstitution, and although the Durham Council's recommendations were not all implemented, it was due to Burchnall and a small group of others that the Durham Colleges emerged from this chastening period with so much of their character intact.</li>
<li>Almost half of Burchnall's mathematical papers were written with T W Chaundy, with whom he collaborated for 20 years.</li>
<li>This called for wise planning and control and Professor Burchnall was a leading figure at all stages.</li>
<li>Burchnall retired in 1959 and, although he continued his interest in mathematics in his retirement, he wrote no further research papers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 8 December 1892, Whichford, near Chipping Norton, Warwickshire, England. Died 29 April 1975, Southwold, Suffolk, England.</p>
