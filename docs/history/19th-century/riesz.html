<p><strong>Riesz</strong> was a founder of functional analysis and his work has many important applications in physics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Frigyes (or Frederic in German) Riesz studied at Budapest.</li>
<li>Riesz was a founder of functional analysis and his work has many important applications in physics.</li>
<li>In 1907 and 1909 Riesz produced representation theorems for functional on quadratic Lebesgue integrable functions and, in the second paper, in terms of a Stieltjes integral.</li>
<li>A satisfactory theory of series of orthonormal functions only became possible after the invention of the Lebesgue integral and this theory was largely the work of Riesz.</li>
<li>Riesz's work of 1910 marks the start of operator theory.</li>
<li>Riesz was appointed to a chair in Kolozsvár in Hungary in 1911.</li>
<li>In Szeged in 1922 Riesz set up the János Bolyai Mathematical Institute in a joint venture with Haar.</li>
<li>Riesz became editor of the newly founded journal of the Institute Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum which quickly became a major source of mathematics.</li>
<li>Riesz was to publish many papers in this journal, the first in 1922 being on Egorov's theorem on linear functionals.</li>
<li>In 1945 Riesz was appointed to the chair of mathematics in the University of Budapest.</li>
<li>Many of Riesz's fundamental findings in functional analysis were incorporated with those of Banach.</li>
<li>His theorem, now called the Riesz-Fischer theorem, which he proved in 1907, is fundamental in the Fourier analysis of Hilbert space.</li>
<li>Riesz made many contributions to other areas including ergodic theory where he gave an elementary proof of the mean ergodic theorem in 1938.</li>
<li>The more leisurely mastership of F Riesz's style, whether he writes in his native Hungarian, or in French or German, conveys such pleasure and is to the older mathematician a nostalgic remainder of what we are in danger to lose.</li>
<li>With it, and with all his other work, will live the memory of Frederic Riesz as a great and fertile mathematician for long in the history of our art.</li>
<li>Riesz received many honours for his work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 22 January 1880, Györ, Austria-Hungary (now Hungary). Died 28 February 1956, Budapest, Hungary.</p>
