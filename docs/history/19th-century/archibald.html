<p><strong>Raymond C Archibald</strong> studied in Canada, at Harvard and at Strasbourg. He spent most of his career at Brown University in Rhode Island. His main interests were in the History of Mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 1874 Abram Archibald and Mary Mellish were married and their son Raymond Archibald was born in the following year in Nova Scotia.</li>
<li>In 1883, when Raymond was seven years old, Abram died and two years later Mary returned to Mount Allison Ladies' Academy to take on the roles of preceptress and vice-principal of the College.</li>
<li>Raymond attended Mount Allison Academy from 1885 to 1889.</li>
<li>A few years after Archibald graduated, in 1903, Mount Allison College became Mount Allison University.</li>
<li>After graduating from Mount Allison, Archibald entered Harvard University in 1895.</li>
<li>Following this Archibald studied in Europe, attending the University of Berlin in session 1898-99 and then the University of Strasbourg in 1899-1900.</li>
<li>Archibald explained that the name cardioid was first used by de Castillon in a paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1741.</li>
<li>In 1903 Archibald published the paper The Cardioid and Tricuspid: Quartics with Three Cusps  on the work of his doctoral dissertation.</li>
<li>After completing his doctorate, Archibald returned to Canada in 1900 where he was appointed professor of Mathematics at Mount Allison Ladies' College in Sackville, New Brunswick.</li>
<li>Archibald served there for seven years, also acting as librarian, building the library from scratch to 12,000 volumes and writing  by hand 30,000 catalogue cards.</li>
<li>In 1905 he set up the Mary Mellish Archibald Memorial Library at Mount Allison and he continued to build the library throughout his life.</li>
<li>At this stage in his career Archibald made the decision that he could not keep his twin interests in music and mathematics both as part of his career and decided to concentrate on mathematics with music becoming a hobby.</li>
<li>Archibald had been a professor at Acadia University but now he accepted the position of Instructor at Brown.</li>
<li>C R Adams was taught by Archibald at Brown during 1915-16.</li>
<li>We should mention a number of projects which Archibald undertook.</li>
<li>We noted above the Mary Mellish Archibald Memorial Library which he founded at Mount Allison in 1905.</li>
<li>However, Archibald collected other material at Mount Allison which he added to on his summer visits.</li>
<li>records generated by Archibald in his activities as scholar, researcher, collector, historian of Mount Allison and by personal relationships with friends, family and fellow Allisonians.</li>
<li>Archibald became the first chairman of the editorial committee of the Journal.</li>
<li>Archibald was a delegate to the congress of universities of the British Empire in London in 1912.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 October 1875, Stewiacke, Colchester County, Nova Scotia, Canada. Died 26 July 1955, Sackville, New Brunswick, Canada.</p>
