<p><strong>Henry Moseley</strong> was an English churchman, mathematician, and scientist. He served as Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy and Astronomy at King's College, London. He then became of of the first H.M. inspectors of schools.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>William Moseley was a student at Hoxton Academy in London which was for dissenting divinity students.</li>
<li>Their first child, William Michael Robert Moseley, was born in Long Buckby on 25 January 1798; he became an architect.</li>
<li>Their second child was Henry Moseley, the subject of this biography.</li>
<li>The Moseley family remained in Hanley until 1814, so Henry was brought up in this town where he was a member of an ever increasing family.</li>
<li>Children born after Henry included Margaret (born 1802), Francis Xavier (born 1804), Eliza (born 1805), Harriot (born 1809), Louisa (born 1810), Andrew (born 1814), Joseph Newman (born 1816), Emma (born 1818), and George Willis (born 1820).</li>
<li>For example, the birth of Henry, the subject of this biography, is recorded as 19 July 1800 while, in later life, he seemed to believe his birth was on 9 July 1801.</li>
<li>Let us note that the Rev William Moseley published several books, some consisting of his sermons, such as Essays on the Evidences of Christianity (1797), A Memoir on the Importance and Practicality of Translating and Printing the Holy Scriptures in the Chinese language (Second Edition, 1801), Actual sin and future misery traced to their real causes; in which the Doctrine of Reprobation is examined (1805), and The New Token for Children (1805).</li>
<li>After leaving Hanley in 1814, the family probably spent time in Abbeville, Somme, France; certainly Henry attended school there.</li>
<li>By 1816 they were living in Hampshire Terrace, Southsea, Portsmouth, Hampshire when Joseph Newman Moseley was born.</li>
<li>Henry attended a naval school in Portsmouth and while there wrote the paper On measuring the Depth of the Cavities seen on the Surface of the Moon.</li>
<li>From the same address on 12 July 1819, Moseley sent the letter "On cohesion" to the Philosophical Magazine.</li>
<li>Moseley was admitted as a pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge on 21 August 1821.</li>
<li>He attended lectures by George Peacock and William Whewell, the latter being a particularly important influence on Moseley since he published the textbooks An Elementary Treatise on Mechanics (1819) and A Treatise on Dynamics (1823).</li>
<li>In the B.A. examinations of 1826, Hymers was Second Wrangler, Miller was Fifth Wrangler, and Moseley was Seventh Wrangler.</li>
<li>Following his degree from Cambridge, Moseley entered the Church of England.</li>
<li>Moseley was appointed Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy and Astronomy at King's College, London, on the 20 January 1831.</li>
<li>Now King's College, London had been founded in 1829 and required governors and professors to be members of the Church of England but the College was open to "nonconformists of all sorts to enter the college freely." This would seem to fit Moseley particularly well, being ordained in the Church of England but having a father, William Moseley, as a well-known nonconformist.</li>
<li>Few people publish a book giving the syllabus of the first university course they will teach before they actually teach it, but this is precisely what Moseley did, publishing Syllabus of a Course of Experimental Lectures on The Theory of Equilibrium in 1831.</li>
<li>to be delivered at The King's College, London, in the October Term of the year 1831 by Rev H Moseley, Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy.</li>
<li>On 23 April 1835, Moseley married Harriet Nottidge, the daughter of William and Mary Nottidge of Wandsworth Common, Surrey.</li>
<li>Henry and Harriet Moseley had daughters Harriet Mary Moseley, born 19 December 1836, and Emily Moseley, born in July 1839, and a son Henry Nottidge Moseley, born 14 November 1844.</li>
<li>Henry Nottidge Moseley became a leading naturalist and he sailed on the global scientific expedition of the HMS Challenger in 1872 to 1876.</li>
<li>Moseley was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London in February 1839.</li>
<li>In January 1844 Moseley resigned his professorship at St John's College.</li>
<li>Moseley also addressed the Metropolitan Association of Church Schoolmasters on 20 May 1854, delivering the address Faith in the Work of the Teacher.</li>
<li>Moseley was asked to be one of the jurors and he was pleased to accept.</li>
<li>We have already mentioned Moseley's election to the Royal Society in 1839.</li>
<li>At the time of the 1861 UK Census, Moseley was living at the Parsonage, Fernhill Road, Olveston, Gloucestershire with his wife, daughter Emily Moseley, son Henry Nottidge Moseley, and five servants: a cook, parlour maid, house maid, lady's maid, and kitchen maid.</li>
<li>During his time as Canon of Bristol Cathedral, Moseley continued to undertake research and publish articles.</li>
<li>Moseley died in Olveston, Gloucestershire and his wife went to live at Cecil Lodge, Stoke Bishop.</li>
<li>Let us note that Moseley's son Henry Nottidge Moseley (1844-1891) married  Amabel Gwyn Jeffreys (1852-1928) in 1881 and their son, Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley (1887-1915), one of five children, became a well-known physicist who developed the important law of X-ray spectra which provided a major step forward in atomic theory and provided experimental evidence supporting Niels Bohr's theory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 9 July 1801, Long Buckby, Northamptonshire, England. Died 20 January 1872, Olveston, Gloucestershire, England.</p>
