<p><strong>Eric Temple Bell</strong> was a Scottish-born mathematician best known for his history of mathematics book: <em>Men of Mathematics</em>.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>James was a fish-curer and fruit grower, a fact which E T Bell did not mention in his autobiographical writings.</li>
<li>Eric was the younger of his parents' two sons, the elder being James Redward Bell.</li>
<li>He also had a sister Enid Lyall Bell.</li>
<li>After the death of Bell's father on 4 January 1896, Eric returned to Britain with his mother, sister and older brother.</li>
<li>From 1898 Bell attended Bedford Modern School where excellent mathematics teaching gave him his life-long interest in the subject.</li>
<li>In 1902 Bell, but not the rest of his family, returned to the United States.</li>
<li>Bell realised that the boarding house he was living in was about to be destroyed by fire and, to save his precious books, he buried them in the garden.</li>
<li>This school, which had been established in 1893, was destroyed by fire in 1916, five years after Bell left.</li>
<li>In this work Bell further developed Eisenstein's extension of Gauss's determination of the regular polygons constructible with straight edge and compasses only.</li>
<li>Two years before he received his doctorate, at the end of 1910, Bell married Jessie Lillian Smith Brown who was a widow he had met at Yreka High School where she taught art and commercial subjects.</li>
<li>They had one son who they named Taine Temple Bell, born on 27 September 1917.</li>
<li>It was at the University of Washington that Bell gained a reputation as one of the leading mathematicians in the United States.</li>
<li>The American Mathematical Society awarded him their Bôcher Memorial Prize in 1924 for his memoir, Arithmetical paraphrases which had appeared in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society in 1921.</li>
<li>In 1922 one of Bell's students began to show remarkable abilities, this student being Howard Percy Robertson.</li>
<li>Having he graduated with his bachelor's degree in 1922, Robertson began studying for his master's degree and took Bell's course on mechanics.</li>
<li>Bell had found the theory of relativity particularly stimulating and gave a course that was taken by Robertson.</li>
<li>Bell confided in Hotelling that if he had not sunk fifteen years of his life into number theory, he would have loved to undertake research into relativity theory.</li>
<li>He did persuade Robertson that this was a fascinating topic and, with Bell's encouragement, he went on to make a name for himself in this and related areas.</li>
<li>In 1924 Bell was appointed to the Council of the American Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>The award of the Bôcher Prize, and his growing reputation, saw Bell receive offers of professorships from several universities including the University of Michigan, Bryn Mawr University, and Columbia University.</li>
<li>Bell neither accepted nor rejected these offers but tried to keep them open.</li>
<li>Chicago tried to entice him to accept a professorship there but in early 1926 the experimental physicist Robert A Millikan from the California Institute of Technology got permission from the University Council to do everything possible to attract Bell to Caltech.</li>
<li>Millikan had sought advice on Bell from L E Dickson, G D Birkhoff and Oswald Veblen beginning late in 1924, in particular asking if he was National Academy of Sciences standard.</li>
<li>After an initial approach from Millikan, Bell played off a good offer from Columbia University to get an improved offer from Caltech.</li>
<li>Dickson's prediction that Bell would soon be elected to the National Academy of Sciences proved correct: he was elected in 1927, three years before Bateman.</li>
<li>Also in 1927 Bell was invited to give the American Mathematical Society Colloquium Lecture.</li>
<li>Bell had the honour of being elected President of the Mathematical Association of America and he held the position during the years 1931-33.</li>
<li>As President, he published problems and reviews in the American Mathematical Monthly.</li>
<li>Bell wrote several popular books on the history of mathematics.</li>
<li>He also made contributions to analytic number theory, Diophantine analysis and numerical functions.</li>
<li>Two concepts which bear his name are the 'Bell numbers' and the 'Bell polynomials'.</li>
<li>Although he wrote 250 research papers, including the one which received the Bôcher Memorial Prize, Bell is best remembered for his popular books, and therefore as an historian of mathematics.</li>
<li>This original and scholarly book is an honour to American mathematics.</li>
<li>At this level Bell wrote books which included Men of Mathematics (1937) and Mathematics, Queen and Servant of Science (1951).</li>
<li>In addition to popular and high-level books, Bell also wrote many papers in which he gave his strong, often provocative, views on many subjects.</li>
<li>the excuse, Bell himself once wrote, being that if these popular novels made money, some publishers might be interested in more serious books.</li>
<li>Given the remarkable mathematical output of Bell, it is amazing that he was able to write two or three science fiction books each year.</li>
<li>He was helped by his wife who typed and edited the books from Bell's manuscripts.</li>
<li>All these juicy horrors are described in such hair-raising detail and with such devilish pleasure that Bell's books almost all land in the can't-put-it-down class - even for some of Bell's squeamish academic colleagues who never meant to take them up at all.</li>
<li>Although Bell (as John Taine) was known as one of the leading science fiction writers of his day, these books have not become classics and are today little read.</li>
<li>Most people knew that Bell and Taine were the same man but the editor of the Pasadena Star-News decided to make a joke of it by asking John Taine to review E T Bell's 1934 book The Magic of Numbers.</li>
<li>The Bell garden, in its heyday, was ablaze with flowers even at that time of year when the neighbors were trying to force up a couple of crocuses.</li>
<li>And even the Bell cats seemed somehow bigger and more prolific than most cats.</li>
<li>Bell spent the last year of his life in Watsonville hospital.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 February 1883, Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Died 21 December 1960, Watsonville, California, USA.</p>
