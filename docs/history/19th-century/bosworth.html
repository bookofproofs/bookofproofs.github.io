<p><strong>Anne Bosworth Focke</strong> was an American mathematician who became the first female doctoral student of David Hilbert. She was a professor of mathematics and physics at what is now the University of Rhode Island.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Let us note that Woonsocket, the town in which Anne was born, was only established one year before her birth when three villages combined to form the town.</li>
<li>It was in her home town of Woonsocket that Anne Bosworth attended school.</li>
<li>The year in which Bosworth joined the College was the first in which it had begun to teach courses beyond the secondary school level.</li>
<li>Bosworth's department consisted of just herself in 1892 but, in 1893, William Elisha Drake was appointed as Professor of Mechanical Engineering.</li>
<li>Bosworth wanted to study more advanced mathematics and, in the summer of 1894 and of 1896, she studied with Eliakim Hastings Moore and Oskar Bolza for a Master's Degree at the University of Chicago.</li>
<li>In April 1898, Bosworth was granted leave of absence so that she might attend lectures at the University of Göttingen in Germany.</li>
<li>Bosworth submitted her 57-page thesis Begründung einer vom Parallelenaxiome unabhängigen Streckenrechnung to the University of Göttingen and her oral examination took place on 31 July 1899.</li>
<li>Back at Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Bosworth again took up her role as Professor of Mathematics.</li>
<li>While in Göttingen he and Bosworth had met.</li>
<li>It is with regret that the institution loses Miss Bosworth from the faculty.</li>
<li>Alfred Bosworth Focke was born on 30 September 1906.</li>
<li>Anne Focke contacted pneumonia and died at the age of thirty-eight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 September 1868, Woonsocket, Rhode Island, USA. Died 15 May 1907, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.</p>
