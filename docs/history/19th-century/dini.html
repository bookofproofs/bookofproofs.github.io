<p><strong>Ulisse Dini</strong> was an Italian mathematician whose most important work was on the theory of functions of a real variable.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 1859, when Dini was thirteen years old, there was a war with Austria in which the French at first joined the Italians against the Austrians.</li>
<li>In 1865 Dini entered a competition for a scholarship to provide the necessary funds to allow a student to further their studies abroad.</li>
<li>This was a period of high mathematical activity for Dini and seven publications came out of the research he undertook during his time in Paris.</li>
<li>Dini returned to Pisa in 1866, and was appointed to a post in the University of Pisa.</li>
<li>Dini progressed quickly in his career at the University of Pisa, being appointed to Betti's chair of analysis and higher geometry in 1871.</li>
<li>With a period of consolidation for the newly unified Italy, local government became very significant and Dini was keen to do all he could in this important area.</li>
<li>Having served many times on the Pisa Council, Dini was elected to the national Italian parliament in 1880 as a representative from Pisa.</li>
<li>Dini's most important work in mathematics was on the theory of functions of a real variable.</li>
<li>Dini was one of the greatest masters of generalisation and constructing counterexamples.</li>
<li>Dini looked at infinite series and generalised results such as a theorem of Kummer and one of Riemann, the ideas for which had first emerged in work of Dirichlet.</li>
<li>He discovered a condition, now known as the Dini condition, ensuring the convergence of a Fourier series in terms of the convergence of a definite integral.</li>
<li>As well as trigonometric series, Dini studied results on potential theory.</li>
<li>Dini published a number of major texts throughout his career.</li>
<li>Dini's most famous student was Bianchi.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 November 1845, Pisa (now Italy). Died 28 October 1918, Pisa, Italy.</p>
