<p><strong>Charles Chree</strong> studied in Aberdeen and Cambridge. He became Superintendent of Kew Observatory and worked on terrestrial magnetism.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chree then went to Cambridge where he took both the Mathematical Tripos and the Natural Sciences Tripos.</li>
<li>During the eight years that he held the fellowship at Cambridge Chree published around 30 papers on the mathematical theory of elasticity.</li>
<li>Chree became F.R.S. in 1897; essentially for the outstanding results he had obtained on elasticity.</li>
<li>Chree was awarded the James Watt medal by the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1905 and the Hughes medal of the Royal Society in 1919.</li>
<li>We mentioned above Chree's association with the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>A number of papers written by Chree were read at meetings of the Society.</li>
<li>For example at the meeting on Friday 14 May 1886, A Y Fraser submitted a paper by Charles Chree on the vibrations of a spherical or cylindrical body surrounded by or containing fluid.</li>
<li>Again at the meeting on 11 February 1887, A Y Fraser submitted his paper on vortices by Chree who was at Cambridge.</li>
<li>Chree remained a member of the Society for the rest of his life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 May 1860, Lintrathen, Angus, Scotland. Died 12 August 1928, Worthing, Sussex, England.</p>
