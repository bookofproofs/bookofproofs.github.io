<p><strong>Ellen  Hayes</strong>  was an American mathematician and astronomer. She was one of the first female American professors.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>At age eight Ellen was sent to Centreville school.</li>
<li>After completing her own school education, Hayes taught in a country school while she put aside money from her wages to allow her to attend College.</li>
<li>Hayes' choice of Oberlin College was a fairly natural one.</li>
<li>It had been called by its present name of Oberlin College for more than twenty years before Hayes began her studies there.</li>
<li>After graduating Hayes taught for a year at Adrian College in Adrian, Lenawee county, southeast Michigan which had been founded in 1845.</li>
<li>This private women's college in Wellesley, Massachusetts, had only opened four years before Hayes was appointed there and it was remarkable for a women's college in the United States since it was the first to have scientific laboratories.</li>
<li>In 1887-88 Hayes observed at the Leander McCormick Observatory of the University of Virginia.</li>
<li>Hayes remained at Wellesley College from her first appointment in 1879 until her retirement in 1916.</li>
<li>It was a career that saw Hayes become professor and Head of the Mathematics Department in 1888.</li>
<li>In 1904 the Department of Applied Mathematics was extended and became the Department of Astronomy and Applied Mathematics, with Hayes still as its Head.</li>
<li>During her years at Wellesley College, Hayes wrote a number of fine textbooks: Lessons on Higher Algebra (1891); Elementary Trigonometry (1896); Algebra for High Schools and Colleges (1897); and Calculus with Applications, An Introduction to the Mathematical Treatment of Science (1900).</li>
<li>Getting views across required a sympathetic press and certainly the press were not sympathetic to Hayes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 September 1851, Granville, Ohio, USA. Died 27 October 1930, Wellesley, Massachusetts, USA.</p>
