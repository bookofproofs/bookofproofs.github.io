<p><strong>Euphemia Lofton Haynes</strong> was an American mathematician and educator. She was the first African-American woman to earn a PhD in mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>We note that Euphemia only became Euphemia Lofton Haynes after her marriage to Harold Appo Haynes in 1917 and that she seldom used the name Martha.</li>
<li>In 1886 William S Lofton had graduated from Spencerian Business College and, two years later, graduated from Howard University Dental College.</li>
<li>In 1890, when his daughter Euphemia was born, William and Lavinia Lofton were living at 1543 M Street, Northwest, Washington D.C. A little over two years later Euphemia's brother Joseph William Lofton (1893-1959) was born.</li>
<li>At the 1900 census Euphemia was nine years old.</li>
<li>She was living with her younger brother Joseph William Lofton and their mother Lavinia in the home of Lavinia's sister Anna E Swann and Anna's husband Benjamin S Swann at 1414 17th Street, Northwest.</li>
<li>As we noted above, by this time Lavinia and William S Lofton are divorced.</li>
<li>Lavinia now worked as a music teacher and sang alto in the choir at St Augustine's Church, Fifteenth Street, between L and M streets northwest in Washington D.C. At the time of the 1900 census, William Lofton was living with his mother Martha Tuplet at 1543 M Street, Washington D.C. William S Lofton remarried, his second wife being Anna Laura Duncan.</li>
<li>They had two daughters, Grace Willna Lofton and Anna Laura Lofton.</li>
<li>Euphemia then spent two years at the Washington Minor Normal School, graduating with distinction in 1909.</li>
<li>On 17 May 1917 Euphemia married Harold Appo Haynes.</li>
<li>Harold was born in Washington D.C. on 7 May 1889 and had been a close friend of Euphemia from childhood, graduating from M Street High School in 1906, one year before Euphemia.</li>
<li>Harold and Euphemia Haynes had no children.</li>
<li>Euphemia's father William S Lofton died in 1919 with Probate Date for his will 3 October 1918.</li>
<li>At the time of the 1920 Census, Euphemia and her husband were living at 1414 17th Street, Northwest.</li>
<li>In addition to Euphemia and her husband, also living in the same house are Euphemia's brother Joseph William Lofton and her mother Lavinia Lofton.</li>
<li>From these positions, Haynes was vocal in her advocacy for poor students and better schools, denouncing the system's segregation-tinged policies.</li>
<li>In 1930, Euphemia Haynes received a master's degree in education from the University of Chicago, her husband Harold gaining a master's degree in education from the same university in the same year.</li>
<li>Haynes remained head of the Mathematics Department until she retired in 1959.</li>
<li>Euphemia Haynes undertook research for a Ph.D. at the Catholic University of America.</li>
<li>Euphemia worked towards a mathematics doctorate with thesis advisor Aubrey Edward Landry.</li>
<li>In 1943 Haynes submitted her thesis The Determination of Sets of Independent Conditions Characterizing Certain Special Cases of Symmetric Correspondences and, after she was examined by a committee including Otto Joseph Ramler (1887-1985) and Joseph Nelson Rice (1890-1988), she was awarded a doctorate in 1943.</li>
<li>With the award of her doctorate Euphemia Haynes became the first African American woman to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics.</li>
<li>We note that her husband Harold Haynes was awarded a doctorate in education from New York University in 1946.</li>
<li>Harold retired in 1958 and Euphemia retired in 1959, although she continued to lecture occasionally at Howard University.</li>
<li>Both Harold and Euphemia played important roles in social and political organizations at both the national level and in the District of Columbia.</li>
<li>Euphemia's lifelong Catholicism often motivated her activism.</li>
<li>Euphemia remained active in professional educational organizations like the Catholic College Alumnae and Sigma Delta Epsilon as well.</li>
<li>by the 1950s, the Haynes' family moved solidly into the upper-middle class, owning a substantial number of rental properties throughout the District.</li>
<li>Dr Euphemia Haynes is perhaps most well known as a member of the District of Columbia Board of Education from 1960 to 1968.</li>
<li>While on the Board during the tumultuous 1960s, Dr. Haynes vigorously advocated for poor students and better schools with high academic standards.</li>
<li>Dr. Haynes opted not to run for election in 1968 and retired from board service.</li>
<li>Dr Harold Haynes died in 1978 at 89 years old.</li>
<li>Euphemia Haynes died of a heart attack, also at the age of 89.</li>
<li>The University named the chair she funded as the Euphemia Haynes Chair in the Department of Education.</li>
<li>The gift was willed to the university in a trust fund Mrs Haynes established for the support of a professorial chair in the School of Education.</li>
<li>Another honour followed her death when in 2004 the E L Haynes Public Charter School in Washington, DC was named for her.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 September 1890, Washington, D.C., USA. Died 25 July 1980, Washington, D.C., USA.</p>
