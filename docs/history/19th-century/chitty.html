<p><strong>Letitia Chitty</strong> began studying the mathematical tripos but, after war work during World War I, she studied the mechanical sciences tripos. She became a civil engineer, applying mathematical theory and carrying out experiments.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Herbert Chitty, born 13 January 1863 in Marylebone, London to Joseph William Chitty and Clara Jessie Pollock, became a barrister at law.</li>
<li>Herbert and Mabel Chitty had three children: Christopher Chitty (1893-1953); Letitia Chitty (1897-1982), the subject of this biography; and Patience Penelope Chitty (1904-1988).</li>
<li>Several of the references give five children and name two other girls, Jessie Elizabeth Chitty and Helen Louisa Chitty.</li>
<li>We cannot find any evidence for these two being Letitia's sisters, and certainly at the time of the 1911 census there are only three children in the family.</li>
<li>In 1907 Herbert Chitty, Letitia's father, became bursar of Winchester College but he had broad interests being also an antiquary and genealogist.</li>
<li>Letitia, therefore, grew up in a well-off family; at the time of the 1911 census the family were living at 51 Campden House Road, Kensington, a house with ten rooms, and they had three servants, a nurse, a cook and a house parlour maid.</li>
<li>Letitia was privately tutored and attended Kensington High School between 1903 and 1916.</li>
<li>Having gained from a strong mathematical education at Kensington High School, Chitty was admitted to Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1916 to study mathematics.</li>
<li>Chitty worked at the Admiralty Air Department with Alfred John Sutton Pippard (1891-1969) on a mathematical investigation of stress analysis for the experimental planes being built.</li>
<li>Chitty found the work she was doing at the Admiralty Air Department to be exciting and she was encouraged to continue to work in this area by Pippard and others.</li>
<li>Chitty worked as an assistant of Richard V Southwell for the Airship Stressing Panel which at that time was highly involved in the structure of the R 100 and R 101 airships, trying to make sure that the structural failure which had occurred with the R 38 was not repeated.</li>
<li>Pippard had been impressed with Chitty when they worked together at the Admiralty Air Department and he had invited her to be his assistant at Imperial College.</li>
<li>Also in 1934 Chitty was elected a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, the first woman to he awarded this honour.</li>
<li>The topics that Chitty worked on are perhaps best illustrated by listing some of the papers that she wrote jointly with Pippard over the next few years: The stresses in a disk wheel under loads applied to the rim (1936); The mechanics of the voussoir arch (1936); and On an experimental method for the solution of plane stress problems (1936).</li>
<li>Despite these extra duties, Chitty was still able to publish research papers during the war.</li>
<li>In 1946 Pippard proposed Chitty for membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers.</li>
<li>Twelve of Chitty's papers were included with the proposal and the fact that she had been awarded four Telford Premium Medals for papers co-authored with Pippard was noted.</li>
<li>It was the occasion on which Miss Chitty received the Telford Gold Medal.</li>
<li>In fact Chitty had retired from her lectureship at Imperial College in 1962.</li>
<li>From the description of Chitty's career we have given above, it might appear that she devoted her entire energies to mathematical theory and to experimentation in civil engineering.</li>
<li>She continued to attend the then annual University Teachers Christmas party for the children of staff on her own, long after her nieces and nephews had outgrown them: Letitia was still hugely entertained by the conjuring acts.</li>
<li>Chitty also achieved fame outside the academic world, being interviewed by Vogue Magazine in her later years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 July 1897, Kensington, London, England. Died 29 September 1982, Englefield Green, Surrey, England.</p>
