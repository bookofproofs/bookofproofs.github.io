<p><strong> Cornelius  Lanczos</strong> worked on relativity and mathematical physics and invented what is now called the Fast Fourier Transform.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lanczos attended a Jewish elementary school where he learn several foreign languages, then he entered the local Gymnasium which was a Catholic school run by the Cistercians.</li>
<li>There he had several inspiring teachers who were to make a great impression on Lanczos.</li>
<li>His physics teacher was Eötvös who first interested Lanczos in relativity.</li>
<li>After graduating in 1915, Lanczos was appointed an assistant at the Technical University of Budapest.</li>
<li>Lanczos received his doctorate in 1921 and, because of laws in Hungary against Jews, he went to Germany taking up a post at the University of Freiburg.</li>
<li>During the year 1928-29 Lanczos was Einstein's assistant in Berlin, returning to Frankfurt in 1929.</li>
<li>In 1931 Lanczos spent a year as a visiting professor at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.</li>
<li>During his time at Purdue, Lanczos published mathematical physics papers at first but in 1938 he published his first work in numerical analysis.</li>
<li>Lanczos continued to work on his first love of relativity and corresponded with Einstein both on a scientific level and as a friend.</li>
<li>A new young man was appointed as Head of Physics at Purdue and Lanczos felt his work there was no longer appreciated.</li>
<li>Lanczos spent the year of 1944 working for the Boeing Aircraft Company and, in 1946, he resigned his post in Purdue to take up a permanent appointment with Boeing.</li>
<li>Lanczos was therefore delighted to receive an offer from Schrödinger to head the Theoretical Physics Department at the Dublin Institute for Advance Study in Ireland.</li>
<li>Lanczos published over 120 papers and books in a career spanning over 40 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 2 February 1893, Székesfehérvár, Hungary. Died 25 June 1974, Budapest, Hungary.</p>
