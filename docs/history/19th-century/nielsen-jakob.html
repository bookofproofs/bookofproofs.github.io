<p><strong>Jakob Nielsen</strong> was a Danish mathematician best known for his work on automorphisms of surfaces.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His relations with his aunt deteriorated, however, and Nielsen left her home when he was fourteen and he continued at school but earned his living by tutoring.</li>
<li>Nielsen did not let this damage his education but continued to study on his own.</li>
<li>Among the teachers at Kiel who had a profound influence on him was Landsberg who suggested the topics which were to form Nielsen's doctoral thesis, although Landsberg died before the thesis was completed.</li>
<li>Nielsen spent the summer term of 1910 at the University of Berlin but returned to Kiel where Dehn was appointed in 1911.</li>
<li>Dehn greatly influenced Nielsen and introduced him to the newest ideas in topology and group theory.</li>
<li>After completing his doctorate Nielsen served in the German marines, continuing in military service in different parts of the world throughout World War I.</li>
<li>At the end of the war Nielsen returned from Turkey to Germany through Russia and Poland and he later published an account of his travels from a diary which he had kept.</li>
<li>Nielsen married Carola von Pieverling early in 1919.</li>
<li>Nielsen spent time in 1919 in Göttingen where he met Hecke.</li>
<li>When Hecke was appointed to Hamburg in 1919, Nielsen went as his assistant, but the following year Nielsen was appointed to a chair at Breslau.</li>
<li>This allowed Nielsen to become a colleague of Dehn who was a professor there.</li>
<li>In 1921 Nielsen, who was born in Schleswig, elected to became a Danish citizen and he resigned his chair in Breslau and returned to Denmark to teach in Copenhagen.</li>
<li>In 1919 Nielsen purchased a house on the island of Als on which he was born.</li>
<li>Nielsen wrote a new text on theoretical mechanics which was published in two volumes in 1933-34.</li>
<li>The text is not very easy, and Jacob Nielsen's lectures were rather demanding on the part of the students.</li>
<li>There were some fears for Nielsen's safety during World War II.</li>
<li>These fears were not realised and Nielsen was not targeted by the Nazis.</li>
<li>Nielsen taught a course on aerodynamics in 1941 and the course formed the basis of a third volume of his theoretical mechanics text published in 1952.</li>
<li>In 1951 Nielsen succeeded Harald Bohr as professor of mathematics at the University of Copenhagen.</li>
<li>It might seem a strange decision for Nielsen to resign this prestigious chair, but he was sixty-five years of age in 1955 and he felt that his international commitments were too much to allow him to do full justice to all his tasks.</li>
<li>Nielsen is well known for work in several areas.</li>
<li>Nielsen studied the mapping class group of a torus in his thesis of 1913.</li>
<li>Thus, for example, not many mathematicians will in the past have had access to Nielsen's doctoral dissertation, presented to the Universitat Kiel in 1913.</li>
<li>Other papers appeared in various Scandinavian periodicals or conference proceedings, many of them in Danish: the majority of them, and also many of Nielsen's papers in German, have for this collection been translated into English.</li>
<li>Among them is his fundamental paper, in the Matematisk Tidsskrift in 1921, on free groups, in which the Nielsen-Schreier theorem (or rather Nielsen's part of it) is proved for the first time: now there is no further excuse for misquoting this paper, as has happened repeatedly in the past.</li>
<li>There was however, some work by Nielsen which was not published in his collected works.</li>
<li>This piece of mathematics, now known as Fenchel-Nielsen theory, had a rather strange history.</li>
<li>Fenchel and Nielsen decided to write a monograph on the theory but neither were happy with the first draft of the manuscript which they produced.</li>
<li>They were working on a revision when Nielsen died in 1959 after an illness lasting about eight months.</li>
<li>Eventually Fenchel wrote a book Elementary geometry in hyperbolic space which was intended to put give an approach with would make presentation of Fenchel-Nielsen theory much clearer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 October 1890, Mjels, Als, Schleswig (now Denmark). Died 3 August 1959, Elsinore, Denmark.</p>
