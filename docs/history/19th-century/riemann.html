<p><strong>Bernhard Riemann</strong>'s ideas concerning geometry of space had a profound effect on the development of modern theoretical physics. He clarified the notion of integral by defining what we now call the Riemann integral.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>At this time a teacher from a local school named Schulz assisted in Bernhard's education.</li>
<li>In 1840 Bernhard entered directly into the third class at the Lyceum in Hannover.</li>
<li>Bernhard seems to have been a good, but not outstanding, pupil who worked hard at the classical subjects such as Hebrew and theology.</li>
<li>He showed a particular interest in mathematics and the director of the Gymnasium allowed Bernhard to study mathematics texts from his own library.</li>
<li>On one occasion he lent Bernhard Legendre's book on the theory of numbers and Bernhard read the 900 page book in six days.</li>
<li>In the spring of 1846 Riemann enrolled at the University of Göttingen.</li>
<li>This was granted, however, and Riemann then took courses in mathematics from Moritz Stern and Gauss.</li>
<li>It may be thought that Riemann was in just the right place to study mathematics at Göttingen, but at this time the University of Göttingen was a rather poor place for mathematics.</li>
<li>Gauss did lecture to Riemann but he was only giving elementary courses and there is no evidence that at this time he recognised Riemann's genius.</li>
<li>Riemann moved from Göttingen to Berlin University in the spring of 1847 to study under Steiner, Jacobi, Dirichlet and Eisenstein.</li>
<li>This was an important time for Riemann.</li>
<li>The main person to influence Riemann at this time, however, was Dirichlet.</li>
<li>His manner suited Riemann, who adopted it and worked according to Dirichlet's methods.</li>
<li>Riemann's work always was based on intuitive reasoning which fell a little below the rigour required to make the conclusions watertight.</li>
<li>It was during his time at the University of Berlin that Riemann worked out his general theory of complex variables that formed the basis of some of his most important work.</li>
<li>However it was not only Gauss who strongly influenced Riemann at this time.</li>
<li>Weber had returned to a chair of physics at Göttingen from Leipzig during the time that Riemann was in Berlin, and Riemann was his assistant for 18 months.</li>
<li>Through Weber and Listing, Riemann gained a strong background in theoretical physics and, from Listing, important ideas in topology which were to influence his ground breaking research.</li>
<li>Riemann's thesis studied the theory of complex variables and, in particular, what we now call Riemann surfaces.</li>
<li>However, Riemann's thesis is a strikingly original piece of work which examined geometric properties of analytic functions, conformal mappings and the connectivity of surfaces.</li>
<li>In proving some of the results in his thesis Riemann used a variational principle which he was later to call the Dirichlet Principle since he had learnt it from Dirichlet's lectures in Berlin.</li>
<li>Riemann's thesis, one of the most remarkable pieces of original work to appear in a doctoral thesis, was examined on 16 December 1851.</li>
<li>On Gauss's recommendation Riemann was appointed to a post in Göttingen and he worked for his Habilitation, the degree which would allow him to become a lecturer.</li>
<li>He gave the conditions of a function to have an integral, what we now call the condition of Riemann integrability.</li>
<li>To complete his Habilitation Riemann had to give a lecture.</li>
<li>Gauss had to choose one of the three for Riemann to deliver and, against Riemann's expectations, Gauss chose the lecture on geometry.</li>
<li>Riemann's lecture Über die Hypothesen welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen Ⓣ(On the hypotheses at the foundations of geometry), delivered on 10 June 1854, became a classic of mathematics.</li>
<li>There were two parts to Riemann's lecture.</li>
<li>In the first part he posed the problem of how to define an nnn-dimensional space and ended up giving a definition of what today we call a Riemannian space.</li>
<li>The main point of this part of Riemann's lecture was the definition of the curvature tensor.</li>
<li>The second part of Riemann's lecture posed deep questions about the relationship of geometry to the world we live in.</li>
<li>Returning to the faculty meeting, he spoke with the greatest praise and rare enthusiasm to Wilhelm Weber about the depth of the thoughts that Riemann had presented.</li>
<li>In the mathematical apparatus developed from Riemann's address, Einstein found the frame to fit his physical ideas, his cosmology, and cosmogony: and the spirit of Riemann's address was just what physics needed: the metric structure determined by data.</li>
<li>So this brilliant work entitled Riemann to begin to lecture.</li>
<li>Although only eight students attended the lectures, Riemann was completely happy.</li>
<li>At this time there was an attempt to get Riemann a personal chair but this failed.</li>
<li>One of the three was Dedekind who was able to make the beauty of Riemann's lectures available by publishing the material after Riemann's early death.</li>
<li>The abelian functions paper continued where his doctoral dissertation had left off and developed further the idea of Riemann surfaces and their topological properties.</li>
<li>He examined multi-valued functions as single valued over a special Riemann surface and solved general inversion problems which had been solved for elliptic integrals by Abel and Jacobi.</li>
<li>However Riemann was not the only mathematician working on such ideas.</li>
<li>when Weierstrass submitted a first treatment of general abelian functions to the Berlin Academy in 1857, Riemann's paper on the same theme appeared in Crelle's Journal, Volume 54.</li>
<li>The Dirichlet Principle which Riemann had used in his doctoral thesis was used by him again for the results of this 1857 paper.</li>
<li>Riemann had quite a different opinion.</li>
<li>We return at the end of this article to indicate how the problem of the use of Dirichlet's Principle in Riemann's work was sorted out.</li>
<li>In 1858 Betti, Casorati and Brioschi visited Göttingen and Riemann discussed with them his ideas in topology.</li>
<li>This gave Riemann particular pleasure and perhaps Betti in particular profited from his contacts with Riemann.</li>
<li>These contacts were renewed when Riemann visited Betti in Italy in 1863.</li>
<li>In 1859 Dirichlet died and Riemann was appointed to the chair of mathematics at Göttingen on 30 July.</li>
<li>A newly elected member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences had to report on their most recent research and Riemann sent a report on On the number of primes less than a given magnitude another of his great masterpieces which were to change the direction of mathematical research in a most significant way.</li>
<li>Riemann considered a very different question to the one Euler had considered, for he looked at the zeta function as a complex function rather than a real one.</li>
<li>This is the famous Riemann hypothesis which remains today one of the most important of the unsolved problems of mathematics.</li>
<li>Riemann studied the convergence of the series representation of the zeta function and found a functional equation for the zeta function.</li>
<li>Many of the results which Riemann obtained were later proved by Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin.</li>
<li>In the autumn of the year of his marriage Riemann caught a heavy cold which turned to tuberculosis.</li>
<li>Riemann tried to fight the illness by going to the warmer climate of Italy.</li>
<li>Having spent from August 1864 to October 1865 in northern Italy, Riemann returned to Göttingen for the winter of 1865-66, then returned to Selasca on the shores of Lake Maggiore on 16 June 1866.</li>
<li>Finally let us return to Weierstrass's criticism of Riemann's use of the Dirichlet's Principle.</li>
<li>This had the effect of making people doubt Riemann's methods.</li>
<li>During the rest of the century Riemann's results exerted a tremendous influence: his way of thinking but little.</li>
<li>Weierstrass firmly believed Riemann's results, despite his own discovery of the problem with the Dirichlet Principle.</li>
<li>He asked his student Hermann Schwarz to try to find other proofs of Riemann's existence theorems which did not use the Dirichlet Principle.</li>
<li>Klein, however, was fascinated by Riemann's geometric approach and he wrote a book in 1892 giving his version of Riemann's work yet written very much in the spirit of Riemann.</li>
<li>Probably many took offence at its lack of rigour: Klein was too much in Riemann's image to be convincing to people who would not believe the latter.</li>
<li>In 1901 Hilbert mended Riemann's approach by giving the correct form of Dirichlet's Principle needed to make Riemann's proofs rigorous.</li>
<li>The search for a rigorous proof had not been a waste of time, however, since many important algebraic ideas were discovered by Clebsch, Gordan, Brill and Max Noether while they tried to prove Riemann's results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 17 September 1826, Breselenz, Hanover (now Germany). Died 20 July 1866, Selasca, Italy.</p>
