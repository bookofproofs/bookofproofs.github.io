<p><strong>Giuseppe Vitali</strong> was an Italian mathematician who worked in various branches of analysis including measure theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His father, Domenico Vitali, worked for the railway company while his mother, Zenobia Casadio, was at home looking after the children.</li>
<li>Giuseppe's elementary school education, which he completed in 1886, was in Ravenna.</li>
<li>There he was taught mathematics by Giuseppe Nonni who quickly realised the great potential of his young pupil and advised Vitali's father to allow his son to pursue studies in mathematics.</li>
<li>After graduating from the Dante Alighieri High School, Vitali studied for two years at the University of Bologna, beginning in the autumn of 1895.</li>
<li>Vitali was awarded the scholarship and began his studies at Pisa in the autumn of 1897.</li>
<li>After the award of his teaching diploma, Vitali left university level mathematics to become a secondary school teacher.</li>
<li>Vitali, however, kept in contact with his mentors, and Arzelà in particular remained a constant point of reference for him, through exchange of letters and also meetings above all during the holiday periods (Vitali returned to Bologna during his teaching years in Voghera, and Arzelà, in his turn, spent long periods in Santo Stefano Magra in Liguria).</li>
<li>Vitali did enter competitions for chairs, for example in October 1910 he competed for the chair of algebraic analysis at Parma.</li>
<li>His political career at an end, Vitali returned to mathematics but he seems to have anticipated this since he had published six papers in the two years 1921 and 1922.</li>
<li>First Vitali was appointed to a chair in Modena.</li>
<li>In fact Vitali was only ranked as second choice by the referees (although Fubini and Levi-Civita had ranked him top), but the candidate who came top, Gustavo Sannia, did not accept the post when offered it.</li>
<li>Then, in December 1925, Vitali was appointed to the chair of mathematical analysis at the University of Padua.</li>
<li>Despite serious health problems, Vitali was able to make huge contributions to Padua during the five years that he worked there.</li>
<li>Vitali was keen to set up a journal as part of the work of the Seminario and the Rendiconti del Seminario Matematico dell'Università di Padova began publishing in 1930.</li>
<li>Vitali published a remarkable volume of mathematics over these years and was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Bologna in September 1928, giving the lecture Rapporti inattesi su alcuni rami della matematica Ⓣ(Unexpected reports on some branches of mathematics).</li>
<li>In 1930 Vitali moved to the chair of mathematics at the University of Bologna.</li>
<li>Vitali was extraordinarily generous and good to me.</li>
<li>In the complex field, Vitali managed to establish fundamental topological properties for the functional spaces of holomorphic functions, among which the theorem of compacity of a family of holomorphic functions (1903-1904).</li>
<li>One of the themes which ran through Vitali's research was his interest in the ideas of Lebesgue - we have seen many references to this above.</li>
<li>From 1926 Vitali developed a serious illness and, with a paralysed arm, he could no longer write.</li>
<li>Vitali was honoured with election to the Academy of Sciences of Turin in 1928, to the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in 1930, and to the Academy of Bologna in 1931.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 26 August 1875, Ravenna, Italy. Died 29 February 1932, Bologna, Italy.</p>
