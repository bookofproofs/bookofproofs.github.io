<p><strong>Lloyd Williams</strong> was an American mathematician most important for his role in founding the Canadian Mathematical Society.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>We should comment at this point on Lloyd's full name.</li>
<li>He was named after William Lloyd Garrison who helped lead the successful Abolitionist campaign against slavery in the United States.</li>
<li>The tutorial system at Oxford suited Williams.</li>
<li>Williams undertook research in mathematics at the University of Chicago attending each summer.</li>
<li>At Chicago, Williams thesis supervisor was L E Dickson and he suggested the topic for his student.</li>
<li>However it appears that he gave little further advice until he suggested in 1920 that Williams should submit.</li>
<li>There are two things for which Williams is particularly remembered.</li>
<li>In 1922 the African American Elbert Frank Cox entered Cornell to study for his doctorate under Williams' supervision.</li>
<li>Williams had strong beliefs regarding equality, being passionate in his hatred of racial discrimination.</li>
<li>It is perhaps hard today to understand just how ground breaking a move it was by Williams to supervise the doctorate of an African American student.</li>
<li>In 1924 Williams moved from Cornell to accept a position within the Mathematics Department of McGill University in Montreal, Canada.</li>
<li>Cox had still not competed his doctorate at this stage and with help from Williams he was awarded a Erastus Brooks Fellowship so that he could study at McGill University with his supervisor.</li>
<li>Williams felt that since Cox was the first person of his race in the world to be awarded a doctorate in mathematics it was necessary for him to have the recognition by a university outside the United States.</li>
<li>It was at McGill that Williams spent the rest of his working life, teaching there until 1954.</li>
<li>Although extremely kind, Williams had high standards as a teacher.</li>
<li>Williams favoured the term "Congress" which he gave French and English speaking Canadians equal status.</li>
<li>Williams worked hard from 1943 to provide a forum around which Canadian mathematical life could be centred.</li>
<li>Williams was much honoured for his contributions to the mathematical life of Canada.</li>
<li>When he retired from McGill in 1954, Williams joined the Board of the Canadian Friends Service Committee and was Chairman of the Committee from 1959 until 1963.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 October 1888, Friendship, near Labette, Kansas, USA. Died 31 January 1976, Pennsylvania, USA.</p>
