<p><strong>Adolf Kiefer</strong> was a Swiss mathematician who worked mainly in geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>He made significant advances in the field of applied mathematics, such as his invention of the Kiefer Transform and his work with projective linear systems.</li>
<li>He solved the famous Hilbert-Ohmsterberg boundary value problem (for which he received the 1967 Soviet Field Prize of the Academy of Sciences), and his research paper on the subject has become a fundamental reference in this area of mathematics.</li>
<li>He also developed several approximation theories, including the Taylor-Kiefer method in 1943.</li>
<li>His innovations have applications in numerous fields of mathematics such as numerical analysis, algebraic geometry, statistics, finite automata, nonlinear control theory and mathematical physics.</li>
<li>He was awarded a Doctorate from the Institute of Mathematics at Humboldt University in Berlin and became a professor at the University of Vienna in 1944.</li>
<li>He developed the Kiefer Convergence Theorem which gives algebraic criteria for deciding whether or not a numerical approximation algorithm converges to a solution of a given problem.</li>
<li>He is also credited with developing an early version of the Lax-Wendroff scheme, a numerical scheme for solving equations from hyperbolic partial differential equations.</li>
<li>Adolf Kiefer was a member of the German Mathematical Society and received several honors including the G. Ulrich Prize from the University of Vienna in 1948.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 22 June 1857, Selzach, Solothurn canton, Switzerland. Died 15 November 1929, Zürich, Switzerland.</p>
