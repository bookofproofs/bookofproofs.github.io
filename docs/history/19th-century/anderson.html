<h1>Person: Anderson, Oskar Johann Viktor</h1>

<p><strong>Oskar Anderson</strong> was a Ukranian-born German mathematician who was known for his work on mathematical statistics and econometrics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His name appears both as Oskar Nikolaevich Anderson and Oskar Johann Viktor Anderson.</li>
<li>Oskar attended Kazan Gymnasium (the same school Lobachevsky attended a century before) and graduated with the gold medal in 1906.</li>
<li>Anderson spent one year studying mathematics at the University of Kazan before going to St Petersburg where he studied economics at the Polytechnic Institute.</li>
<li>As well as teaching at this school, Anderson graduated with a law degree.</li>
<li>In 1917 Anderson left St Petersburg and moved to Kiev.</li>
<li>Slutsky was teaching in the Kiev Institute of Commerce when Anderson arrived and they would remain colleagues for three years.</li>
<li>Events in 1920 were to have a profound influence on Anderson's life.</li>
<li>Lenin approached Anderson and offered him a high position in the economic running of Russia.</li>
<li>Indeed this turbulence was to have a dramatic effect on Anderson's life.</li>
<li>But we have got ahead of the events that we were describing, so returning to the period after Anderson left Russia, he went to Budapest and in 1921 he became a school teacher there.</li>
<li>In 1933 Anderson was awarded a Rockefeller Scholarship which enabled him to travel to England and Germany.</li>
<li>In this book Anderson tried to present the latest statistical methods assuming only that his readers had covered school level mathematics.</li>
<li>Returning to Bulgaria in 1935 Anderson was appointed professor at the University of Sofia.</li>
<li>Anderson belongs to the so-called 'continental' school of statistics, and worked in the tradition of Lexis and Bortkiewicz.</li>
<li>Some of Anderson's endeavours were ahead of his time...</li>
<li>Sensibly estimating the difficulties inherent in economics as a science, Anderson was opposed to the use of "refined" statistical methods and to accepting preconditions regarding laws of distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 2 August 1887, Minsk, Russian Empire (now Belarus). Died 12 February 1960, Munich, Germany.</p>
