<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solomon and Sarah Loney were married in Tiverton, Devon in April 1859.</li>
<li>Let us note at this point that Sidney was born in Chevithorne, a small village about 5 km north east of Tiverton, Devon.</li>
<li>Solomon and Sarah Loney had a large family with seven children: Sidney Loney (the subject of this biography, born 1860, died 1939), Herbert Lionel Loney (born 1862, died 1953), Arthur William Loney (born 1863, died 1940), Ellen Susannah Loney (born 1868, died 1953), Charles Loney (born 1870), Camilla Loney (born 1873, died 1902), and Percy Ernest Loney (born 1876, died 1947).</li>
<li>Tonbridge School, founded in 1553, gave Loney an exceptionally high quality education.</li>
<li>Loney was in the Sixth Form at Tonbridge School 1876-8, and during that year was Head Boy of the School.</li>

<li>Sidney and Frances Loney had two daughters, Hilda Mary Luxton Loney (1886-1940) and Dorothy Frances Loney (1888-1974).</li>
<li>Let us return to describing Loney's career as Professor of Mathematics at Royal Holloway College.</li>
<li>In addition to his teaching and writing textbooks, Loney did an excellent job for the University of London.</li>
<li>In 1920 Loney retired from his position as Professor of Mathematics at Royal Holloway College but he continued to undertake work for the University as well as serving the local community.</li>
<li>Loney's wife, Frances Elizabeth Loney, died on 30 November 1934, leaving £908 to her husband Sidney Luxton Loney in her will.</li>
