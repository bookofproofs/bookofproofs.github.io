<p><strong>Sergei  Chaplygin</strong> was a Russian physicist and mathematician who did important work in hydrodynamics and aerodynamics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sergei Alekseevich has a great future.</li>
<li>In the autumn of that year, at age seventeen, Chaplygin packed a small suitcase and, with 200 rubles in his pocket, set off from Voronezh to Moscow to begin his university studies of mathematics.</li>
<li>At the University of Moscow Chaplygin studied in the Physics and Mathematics Faculty and, for the first two years, he concentrated exclusively on mathematics courses.</li>
<li>After Chaplygin graduated with his first degree in 1890, Zhukovsky persuaded him to continue to study for his university teacher's qualification.</li>
<li>In 1893 Chaplygin published On certain cases of the motion of a solid body in a fluid and the quality of this work was so outstanding that he was awarded the N D Brashman Prize for this contribution.</li>
<li>Chaplygin had begun teaching in Moscow in the year 1893.</li>
<li>After the award of his Master's Degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.), Chaplygin worked on two classic problems of theoretical mechanics.</li>
<li>Three decades later, however, Chaplygin's dissertation served as a starting point for many studies by aerodynamics specialists and provided the basis for the solution of problems of subsonic flows.</li>
<li>Chaplygin wrote his remarkable dissertation while he was on vacation at a resort in the Crimea.</li>
<li>Nevertheless it continued to operate as an excellent university, providing Chaplygin with a very good education.</li>
<li>Chaplygin was one of the professors who resigned in 1911 along with a number of his colleagues in mathematics such as Boleslav Kornelievich Mlodzeevskii (1858-1923), who was very active in the Moscow Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>Zhukovsky was the president of the Moscow Mathematical Society at this time which gave Chaplygin more reason to maintain a high level of involvement.</li>
<li>Chaplygin read papers on mechanics and on approximate methods in analysis to the Society.</li>
<li>This postulate - the so-called Chaplygin-Zhukovsky postulate - gives a complete solution to the problem of the forces exerted by a stream on a body passing through it.</li>
<li>This article includes the fundamentals of plane aerodynamics, particularly Chaplygin's celebrated formulas for calculating the pressures exerted by the stream of a fluid on an impeding body.</li>
<li>These formulas were applied by Chaplygin to the calculation of the stream pressure on various wing profiles for which he gives the construction.</li>
<li>Chaplygin's important paper Theory of cascaded airfoils (1914) presented the basic theory of circulation round cascades, the theory which is used in the design of propellers, turbines and other hydraulic devices.</li>
<li>Together with Zhukovsky, Chaplygin planned for the setting up of an aeronautical research centre in Moscow.</li>
<li>On the death of Zhukovsky in 1921, Chaplygin became Chairman of the Board, a position he held until 1930.</li>
<li>Lazar Aronovich Lyusternik became a research student in the Moscow Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics in 1922 where he was taught by Chaplygin.</li>
<li>But Chaplygin had not published this paper, since this theory did not have a mathematical basis.</li>
<li>Chaplygin took charge of the Novosibirsk branch of the Institute and rapidly organised the building of a wind tunnel and research laboratories.</li>
<li>Further honours were given to Chaplygin following his death.</li>
<li>Ranenburg, the town of his birth, was renamed Chaplygin in 1948.</li>
<li>A crater on the moon has been named for Chaplygin.</li>
<li>Finally let us mention that Chaplygin loved playing chess and spent many hours playing against friends in the staff club.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 April 1869, Ranenburg (now Chaplygin), Russia. Died 8 October 1942, Novosibirsk, USSR.</p>
