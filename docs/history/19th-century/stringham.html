<p><strong>Irving Stringham</strong> was an American mathematician who worked in geometry and became head of mathematics at Berkeley.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Henry and Eliza Stringham were married on 7 March 1823 in Brookfield, Brookfield County, Connecticut, and they had nine children: Amelia Maria Stringham (born 9 Apr 1824, Fairport, Monroe County, New York); Thomas Henry Stringham (born 29 Mar 1826, Rochester, Monroe County, New York); Ann Eliza Stringham (born 26 Apr 1828, Dansville, Livingston County, New York); Daniel Tomlinson Stringham (born 2 Nov 1830, Geneseo, Livingston County, New York); Cecelia Jane Stringham (born 5 Nov 1832, Franklinville, Cattaraugus, New York); Charles Augustus Stringham (born 22 Jan 1835, Lynden, Cattaraugus, New York); Theodore Lefoy Stringham (born 2 Feb 1839, Lynden, Cattaraugus, New York); Oliver Eugene Stringham (born 31 Jan 1844, Lynden, Cattaraugus, New York); and Washington Irving Stringham, the subject of this biography (born 10 Dec 1847, Delevan, Cattaraugus, New York).</li>
<li>Two of Irving Stringham's brothers served in the Northern army during the American Civil War.</li>
<li>Oliver Eugene Stringham was one of the two brothers and he was taken prisoner at the Battle of Gettysburg.</li>
<li>Stringham was brought up at Yorkshire Centre, in western New York, where he attended the village school.</li>
<li>In 1872, Stringham entered the second year of studies at Washburn College (as it was named by this time).</li>
<li>However, Stringham now aimed higher and was intent on studying at Harvard College.</li>
<li>During his undergraduate years, Stringham was a member of the Everett Athenaeum, a short-lived society for second year students with literary interests.</li>
<li>Stringham received honours in mathematics in his second year at Harvard College and earned the highest honours in mathematics when he graduated with an A.B. in 1877.</li>
<li>After graduating from Harvard College, Stringham was a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University in 1877-78 where he worked towards his doctorate.</li>
<li>It is interesting to see in what high esteem Stringham was held.</li>
<li>Stringham was awarded a Ph.D. in 1880 for his theses Regular Figures in n−n-n−dimensional Space.</li>
<li>Stringham gave two lectures in Klein's seminar on the work he had done for his Ph.D. thesis.</li>
<li>Discussion with Klein led to Stringham's paper Determination of the Finite Quaternion Groups which was published in the American Journal of Mathematics in 1881.</li>
<li>Stringham submitted the paper from Schwarzbach, Saxony, in September, 1881.</li>
<li>After spending the two academic years 1880-82 in Europe, Stringham would have liked to have remained for another year.</li>
<li>Gilman did not come up with a job at Johns Hopkins but, instead, arranged for Stringham to get a professorship at the University of California at Berkeley.</li>
<li>On 28 June 1888, Stringham married Martha Sherman Day in New Haven, Connecticut.</li>
<li>Martha and Irving Stringham had three children: Harriet Day Stringham (born 21 August 1889); Martha Sherman Stringham (born 5 March 1891); and Roland Irving Stringham (born 24 May 1892).</li>
<li>Stringham made several trips abroad, both before and after his marriage.</li>
<li>When Stringham was appointed as a professor and head of mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley he was 35 years old.</li>
<li>We mention two books that Stringham published while at Berkeley, namely Uniplanar Algebra, Vol.</li>
<li>1: Being of a Propaedeutic to the Higher Mathematical Analysis (1893) and Elementary Algebra for the Use of Schools and Colleges by Charles Smith, revised and adapted to American schools by Irving Stringham (1895).</li>
<li>We still have not looked at the mathematics for which Stringham was best known.</li>
<li>Stringham gave a number of addresses, both to school teachers and to International Mathematical Conferences.</li>
<li>During the last two weeks Professor Stringham had been confined to his bed at his home at 2250 Prospect street and Sunday afternoon was removed to the Alpha Bates local sanatorium for an operation.</li>
<li>This was the first new professorial appointment in mathematics following the appointment of Stringham.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 10 December 1847, Yorkshire Centre, now Delevan, Cattaraugus County, New York, USA. Died 5 October 1909, Berkeley, Alameda, California, USA.</p>
