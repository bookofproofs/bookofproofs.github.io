<p><strong>Harry Schmidt</strong> was a German mathematician who wrote on the application of mathematics to physics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Harry attended a private school in Hamburg from 1901 to 1904, then attended the Oberrealschule in Altona-Ottensen until 1907.</li>
<li>In the spring of 1913 Schmidt graduated from high school passing his final examination.</li>
<li>World events, however, were to have a major impact on Schmidt's university education.</li>
<li>The effect of the war on Schmidt was that, as a student with expertise in physics and chemistry, he was required to undertake war work.</li>
<li>In 1918 Schmidt began undertaking research at the University of Leipzig, working towards his doctoral thesis.</li>
<li>Schmidt published a number of important books between 1920 and 1922, in German, English and Italian.</li>
<li>In 1923 Schmidt was appointed as professor at the polytechnic institute in Koethen where he remained until 1937.</li>
<li>From August 1937 Schmidt was employed as a ordinary professor for mathematics in the service of the Reich, working at the aviation laboratory in Berlin-Adlershof.</li>
<li>Schmidt's home was destroyed in a bombing raid in August, before the Battle of Berlin which began in November and saw sixteen bombing raids over the winter of 1943-44.</li>
<li>For a while after his home was destroyed Schmidt lived with friends in Berlin but in December he found a house in Koethen (Anhalt).</li>
<li>Schmidt's employment at the aviation research laboratory came to an end.</li>
<li>While he was working at the laboratory Schmidt published, jointly with Kurt Schröder, a comprehensive report on the theory of laminar boundary layers deals with the basic conceptions and equations Laminare Grenzschichten.</li>
<li>Before the end of 1945 Schmidt was appointed as an ordinary professor to the Martin-Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg.</li>
<li>Although he had an appointment in Halle, Schmidt could not find accommodation there so remained living in his house in Koethen which is about 25 km north of Halle.</li>
<li>It was a difficult railway journey for Schmidt to have to make every day.</li>
<li>Sadly, after only a year living in his new home, Schmidt developed tuberculosis and taken to hospital on 6 April.</li>
<li>Schmidt then requested that he be allowed premature retirement, but the University of Halle refused his request.</li>
<li>After Schmidt died his colleagues completed the manuscript he was writing giving an introduction to vector and tensors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 June 1894, Hamburg, Germany. Died 7 September 1951, Halle, Germany.</p>
