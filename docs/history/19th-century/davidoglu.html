<p><strong>Anton Davidoglu</strong> was a Romanian mathematician who studied for his doctorate in Paris. He was the founder of the Academy of Advanced Commercial and Industrial Studies in Bucharest, and laid the foundations of mathematical education of economists in Romania.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cleante Davidoglu was a medical doctor who served the villages around Bârlad, a town in the east of Romania not far from the border with Moldova.</li>
<li>Anton had an older brother, named Cleante Davidoglu after his father.</li>
<li>Cleante Davidoglu Jr. (1871-1947) had a career in the military and became a famous Romanian major general during World War I.</li>
<li>The paternal grandfather of the two Davidoglu boys was a seller of salep, a flour made from orchids used to make winter drinks, their great-grandfather was a professional cavalrymen in the Ottoman army, and their great-great grandfather was an infantryman in the Ottoman army.</li>
<li>Anton Davidoglu had both his primary and secondary education in his hometown of Bârlad and, being an outstanding pupil, he decided to go Paris for his university education instead of continuing to study at one of the two Romanian universities.</li>
<li>Davidoglu graduated with a first degree in 1897 having impressed his teacher Hadamard.</li>
<li>Davidoglu then continued his studies at the École Normale Supérieure, undertaking research for his doctorate.</li>
<li>The differential equations that Davidoglu was studying in this thesis relate to the transverse vibrations of nonhomogeneous elastic bars.</li>
<li>Davidoglu was advised by Émile Picard and, as he says in the Introduction above, applied Picard's results.</li>
<li>Davidoglu left Paris after successfully defending his doctoral thesis, and returned to Romania.</li>
<li>His colleagues at the University of Bucharest  included David Emmanuel, Spiru Haret, O Gogu, and Dimitrie Petrescu; Davidoglu and all his colleagues taught the exceptional student Gheorghe Țițeica.</li>
<li>Davidoglu was appointed to serve as the first Rector of the new institution and became a founding member.</li>
<li>As well as acting as Rector, Davidoglu also served as a professor teaching financial mathematics and insurance.</li>
<li>This means that Davidoglu is considered today as the founder of the Romanian School of Financial and Actuarial Mathematics.</li>
<li>Davidoglu fled to Petrograd (now St Petersburg), in Russia, where he remained for the duration of the war.</li>
<li>As a teacher, Davidoglu was highly regarded and respected by his students although he had exceptionally high standards setting examinations that were exceedingly challenging.</li>
<li>Although Davidoglu did not publish any books directly, in fact two books were published based on lecture notes taken by students at courses he gave.</li>
<li>Rodolphe followed his professor Davidoglu in going to Paris to study for his doctorate which was awarded by the Sorbonne in 1930 for his thesis The principal solution of Poincaré's finite difference equation.</li>
<li>Rodolphe's notes of Davidoglu's course formed the basis of Davidoglu's book Curs de analiza infinitezimala Ⓣ(Course on infinitesimal analysis) published in 1931.</li>
<li>The second of Davidoglu's books was based on a course he gave at the Commercial Academy.</li>
<li>Anton Davidoglu became and remained a significant landmark in the development of the Romanian higher mathematical and economic education.</li>
<li>Founder of the Academy of Advanced Commercial and Industrial Studies in Bucharest, Anton Davidoglu laid the foundations of the mathematical education of economists.</li>
<li>Davidoglu retired from his positions at the Bucharest Faculty of Science and at the Commercial Academy on 1 January 1941.</li>
<li>In 1976 Romania issued a stamp in honour of Anton Davidoglu's 100th birthday.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 30 June 1876, Bârlad, Vaslui County, Romania. Died 27 May 1958, Bucharest, Romania.</p>
