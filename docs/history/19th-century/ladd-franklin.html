<p><strong>Christine Ladd-Franklin</strong> was an American psychologist, logician and mathematician who was one of the earliest women to work in American universities.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Christine was the eldest of Eliphalet and Augusta's three children, having a younger brother Henry and a younger sister Jane.</li>
<li>In order to understand how Christine Ladd had the will and determination to succeed at a time when the odds were stacked heavily against women, we should look briefly at her mother Augusta's views.</li>
<li>She wrote this after attending a women's rights lecture and, Christine as a young child, attended these lectures with her mother.</li>
<li>Until she was six years old Christine and her family lived in New York, then they moved to Windsor, Connecticut.</li>
<li>When Christine was twelve years old, however, her mother died.</li>
<li>Ladd-Franklin wrote up the results of her studies in a paper which was published in the first volume of the American Journal of Psychology in 1887.</li>
<li>Ladd-Franklin went to Göttingen with her husband and daughter Margaret and, although Göttingen would not admit women to lectures, she was able to persuade G E Muller, a leading expert on colour vision, to let her conduct experiments in his laboratory.</li>
<li>Muller went even further and often repeated for her lectures which he had given yet Ladd-Franklin was not permitted to attend.</li>
<li>Ladd-Franklin developed her own theory of colour vision while working in Germany and in 1892 she visited England and presented it to an International Congress of Psychology in London.</li>
<li>Back in the United States, Fabian Franklin resumed his teaching at Johns Hopkins and Ladd-Franklin asked to be allowed to lecture at the University.</li>
<li>When he obtained the post of associate editor of the New York Evening Post in 1910 Ladd-Franklin went to New York with her husband.</li>
<li>She was never admitted to these meetings, but times were slowly changing and, in 1926, Johns Hopkins University awarded Ladd-Franklin a Ph.D. for the dissertation she had completed in 1882.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 December 1847, Windsor, Connecticut, USA. Died 5 March 1930, New York City, New York, USA.</p>
