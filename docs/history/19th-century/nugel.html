<p><strong>Frieda Nugel </strong> was a German mathematician who was one of the first women to receive a doctorate in Germany.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nugel then began her studies at Berlin University, attending lectures in mathematics, physics and German.</li>
<li>It is worth looking for a moment at the mathematics department where Nugel was receiving her education.</li>
<li>Nugel attended lectures by Frobenius and Schur, who at the time was a dynamic young lecturer.</li>
<li>After three terms of study in Berlin, Nugel moved to the University of Munich where she spent one term attending lectures by Ferdinand Lindemann and Aurel Voss.</li>
<li>In receiving a doctorate in mathematics, Nugel became one of the first German women to receive such a degree.</li>
<li>Later in July Nugel passed the state examinations qualifying her to teach mathematics, physics and German in a Gymnasium.</li>
<li>Immediately after passing these examinations, Nugel was appointed as a teacher in the Augusta school on Cottbus.</li>
<li>There is one aspect of Frieda Hahn's life which we have not mentioned above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 June 1884, Cottbus, Brandenburg, Germany. Died 6 November 1966, Bad Godesberg, Bonn, Germany.</p>
