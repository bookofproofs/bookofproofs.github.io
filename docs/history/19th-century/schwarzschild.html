<h1>Person: Schwarzschild, Karl</h1>

<p><strong>Karl Schwarzschild</strong> was a German physicist and astronomer who investigated the mathematics which eventually led to the prediction of the existence of black holes.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The family was Jewish, with Karl's father being a well-off member of the business community in Frankfurt.</li>
<li>Karl was the oldest of his parents six children, having four younger brothers and one sister.</li>
<li>Karl's father was friendly with Professor J Epstein, who was professor at the Philanthropin Academy and had his own private observatory.</li>
<li>Professor Epstein has a son, Paul Epstein, who was two years older than Karl and the two boys became good friends.</li>
<li>They shared an interest in astronomy, and Karl learnt how to use a telescope and also learnt some advanced mathematics from his friend Paul Epstein.</li>
<li>It was in large part what he learnt through his friendship with Epstein which led to Schwarzschild mastering celestial mechanics by the age of sixteen.</li>
<li>Schwarzschild studied at the University of Strasbourg during the two years 1891-93 where he learnt a great deal of practical astronomy, then at the University of Munich where he obtained his doctorate.</li>
<li>Schwarzschild found great inspiration from Seeliger's teaching which influenced him throughout his life.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate, Schwarzschild was appointed as an assistant at the Von Kuffner Observatory in Ottakring which is a suburb of Vienna.</li>
<li>At a meeting of the German Astronomical Society in Heidelberg in 1900 Schwarzschild discussed the possibility that space was non-Euclidean.</li>
<li>Schwarzschild published on electrodynamics and geometrical optics during his time at Göttingen.</li>
<li>After his marriage, near the end of 1909, Schwarzschild left Göttingen to take up an appointment as director of the Astrophysical Observatory in Potsdam.</li>
<li>In 1913 Schwarzschild was elected to the Berlin Academy.</li>
<li>On the outbreak of war in August 1914 Schwarzschild volunteered for military service.</li>
<li>Schwarzschild's relativity papers give the first exact solution of Einstein's general gravitational equations, giving an understanding of the geometry of space near a point mass.</li>
<li>However, Schwarzschild himself makes clear that he believes that the theoretical solution is physically meaningless, so making it very clear that he did not believe in the physical reality of black holes.</li>
<li>In Schwarzschild's time there was no known treatment and, after being invalided home in March 1916, he died two months later.</li>
<li>Since Schwarzschild died at age 42 at the height of his achievements, it is not too surprising that he received relatively few honours in his lifetime.</li>
<li>After the reunification of Germany, the Institute was refounded in 1992 and renamed "Thüringer Landessternwarte 'Karl Schwarzschild' Tautenburg".</li>
<li>The German Astronomical Society established a special lectureship in his honour in 1959 and a Karl Schwarzschild Medal.</li>
<li>The first recipient was Martin Schwarzschild, his son.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 9 October 1873, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Died 11 May 1916, Potsdam, Germany.</p>
