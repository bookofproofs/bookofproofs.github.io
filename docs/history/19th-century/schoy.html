<p><strong>Carl Schoy</strong> was a German historian of mathematics specialising in Arabian mathematics and astronomy.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Schoy did not perform particularly well at the college.</li>
<li>Like many German students of this time, Schoy spent a semester at a different university and he chose to spend the winter semester of 1904 at the University of Heidelberg.</li>
<li>Schoy had a remarkable desire to study the widest range of subjects but his main effort was put into courses in mathematics and astronomy.</li>
<li>As well as teaching Schoy mathematics and science, these two professors gave him a deep interest in the history of mathematics.</li>
<li>Seeliger saw that Schoy was a bright young man and gave him excellent advice as well as teaching him the methods of modern astronomy.</li>
<li>He also arranged for Schoy to give private tuition at the Observatory and so enabled him to gain sufficient funds to carry on with his studies.</li>
<li>Schoy would have liked to have made a career in an observatory or in a geographical institute after his university studies but the situation in the country meant that such an appointment looked almost impossible.</li>
<li>Frieda Ettwig (1889-1962), who had entered the Realgymnasium in Essen in 1907, was one of Schoy's pupils.</li>
<li>Schoy worked as a teacher in the Realgymnasium in Essen over the following years but also continued research for his doctorate.</li>
<li>Schoy was awarded his doctorate, a Dr. Ing., in 1911 for his thesis Die geschichtliche Entwicklung der Polhöhenbestimmungen bei den älteren Völkern Ⓣ(The historical development of pole altitude rules among older people).</li>
<li>However, there were food shortages, and Schoy's health problems, which had begun when he was still in Munich, continued to get worse.</li>
<li>In the summer vacations the Schoys would travel south and spend some time in much more pleasant surroundings.</li>
<li>In the summer of 1917 Schoy took the opportunity to increase his expertise in the Arabic language.</li>
<li>Teaching at the university in the occupied city was almost impossible so Schoy still could not fulfil his dream of teaching university students.</li>
<li>Dr Schoy, who has already done a good deal in this direction for Arab mathematics, points out in the preface to his translation what can be gathered from this modest little treatise.</li>
<li>Let us give a little more information about the last years of Schoy's life.</li>
<li>On 1 October 1925, Schoy achieved his life long ambition when he took up an appointment as "Lehrauftrag fur Geschichte der exacten Naturwissenschaften im Orient" in the University of Frankfurt am Main.</li>
<li>Schoy combined all these qualities, that is, he had gradually combined them at the cost of long studies and in spite of ill health and increasing discomfort.</li>
<li>We all felt that Schoy, if he had been granted to live ten or twenty years longer, would have increased considerably our understanding of oriental mathematics and astronomy.</li>
<li>In his short life time, Schoy had done much very valuable work in uncovering the buried treasures of Arabian mathematics, including in particular many on astronomical and geographical subjects.</li>
<li>In his earlier years handicapped by poverty, and later by an insidious and incurable disease, Schoy's career compels our admiration for his never-failing courage and indomitable will, no less than for his scientific achievements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 April 1877, Bittelschiess, near Messkirch, Germany. Died 6 December 1925, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.</p>
