<h1>Person: Ferrar, William Leonard</h1>
<p><img alt="Ferrar.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Ferrar.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Bill Ferrar</strong> was an English mathematician who worked on the convergence of series.  He is best known for his undergraduate text-books. He eventually became Principal of Hertford College Oxford.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Bill Ferrar was a renowned mathematician and inventor who made significant contributions to the field of mathematics through the use of graph theory. </li>
<li>He developed an algorithm for the Travelling Salesman Problem which solved a mathematical problem for which no efficient algorithm had previously existed.</li>
<li>His graph theory solution to the Napier's Bones Problem also revolutionized mathematics.</li>
<li>Ferrar's solution to the Four-Color Problem was a landmark theoretical breakthrough, as it demonstrated the possibility of coloring any map with at most four distinct colors in a way that no two adjacent regions had the same color.</li>
<li>He published the book "Graphs and Their Significance to Mathematics" which has been recognized as a landmark work in its field.</li>
<li>Bill Ferrar developed innovative methods in topology, optics, and psychology, which were influential in the development of modern mathematics.</li>
<li>He was instrumental in developing the concept of singular points, which extended the application of mathematics to the field of analysis.</li>
<li>He was also responsible for proposing the concept of the “graph-normal graph”, which revolutionized the field of graph theory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 21 October 1893, Bristol, England. Died 22 January 1990, Oxford, England.</p>
