<p><strong>Jérôme Franel</strong>  was a Swiss mathematician who specialised in analytic number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Franel co-supervised (at least) four PhD students, three jointly with Hurwitz and one with Hermann Weyl.</li>
<li>Franel served as the Polytechnic's Director from 1905-1909.</li>
<li>On several occasions Franel acted as intermediary between the Polytechnic and secondary schools or the Gesellschaft ehemaliger Polytechniker.</li>
<li>As Director, Franel was heavily involved in organising the celebrations.</li>
<li>Franel was first and foremost a teacher and not a researcher.</li>
<li>Franel wrote a couple of papers on problems in geometry, but then turned to analysis and number theory.</li>
<li>Franel also regularly contributed to the French journal L'Intermédiaire des mathématiciens.</li>
<li>The German mathematician Edmund Landau, who held a professorship at the University of Göttingen at the time, then wrote a few papers on the same topic based on and expanding Franel's ideas.</li>
<li>Franel joined the organising committee of the first International Congress of Mathematicians in July 1896, where he was responsible for the French translations.</li>
<li>Franel did not give a talk himself, but he read out Poincaré's talk in the first general meeting, which he is remembered for.</li>
<li>Despite having been general secretary, Franel never had the chance to edit the congress proceedings in French.</li>
<li>Franel was a member of the organising committee of the 1932 ICM in Zürich again, but did not give a talk at the congress.</li>
<li>Franel was married and he had two daughters, Jeanne (born 1889) and Marie-Louise (born 1893).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 November 1859, Travers, Neuchâtel canton, Switzerland. Died 21 November 1939, Zürich, Switzerland.</p>
