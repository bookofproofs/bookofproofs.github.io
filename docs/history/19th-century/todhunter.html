<p><strong>Isaac Todhunter</strong> is best known for his textbooks and his writing on the history of mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Todhunter was sent to a school in Hastings but did not show any promise even being described as 'unusually backward'.</li>
<li>However, after being sent to a new school set by J B Austin from London, Isaac made excellent progress.</li>
<li>While taking his degree course Todhunter also worked as a mathematics teacher at a large school in Wimbledon.</li>
<li>Todhunter progressed from fellow to principal mathematical lecturer at St John's College where he resisted all attempts to reduce the central role of Euclid in mathematics courses.</li>
<li>In 1864 Todhunter resigned his fellowship at St John's College, which he was forced to do as he wished to marry.</li>
<li>Todhunter had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1862.</li>
<li>In 1874 Todhunter was elected as an honorary fellow of St John's College but he was taken ill in 1880 and, from that time on, his health deteriorated.</li>
<li>Todhunter is best known for his textbooks and his writing on the history of mathematics.</li>
<li>Todhunter received many awards for his contributions to mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 November 1820, Rye, Sussex, England. Died 1 March 1884, Cambridge, England.</p>
