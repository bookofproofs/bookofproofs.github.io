<p><strong>Thomas MacFarland Cherry</strong> was an Australian mathematician who was Professor of Mathematics  at the University of Melbourne for many years.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thomas was brought up in Glen Iris on the outskirts of Melbourne which at that time was almost in the country.</li>
<li>An indication of the rural nature of Glen Iris is that Thomas had to walk over 6 km each day to attend primary school.</li>
<li>In 1924 Cherry won the Smith prize for applied mathematics and was elected a fellow of Trinity College.</li>
<li>Cherry also spent one term teaching at the University of Edinburgh in 1927 substituting for Charles Galton Darwin (son of George Howard Darwin).</li>
<li>During his time as a fellow of Trinity College, Cherry spent time with his two main hobbies, mountaineering and scouting.</li>
<li>In fact Cherry had returned to Australia in March 1929 to take up a professorship at the University of Melbourne.</li>
<li>Let us look more closely at a few of Cherry's papers to give at least an indication of the topics on which he undertook research.</li>
<li>In the second part of the paper, published two years later, Cherry extended his results to cover the case where circulation is not zero.</li>
<li>In On expansions in eigenfunctions, particularly in Bessel functions (1949) Cherry gives a form of the integral theorems of Fourier, Hankel and Heinrich Weber which is applicable to functions which are exponentially large at infinity.</li>
<li>In early 1965 Cherry suffered a heart attack after a particularly difficult incident during his climbing.</li>
<li>Cherry received many distinctions for his contributions to mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 May 1898, Glen Iris, Melbourne, Australia. Died 21 November 1966, Melbourne, Australia.</p>
