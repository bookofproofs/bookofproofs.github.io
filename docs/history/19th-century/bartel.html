<p><strong>Kazimierz Bartel</strong> was a Polish mathematician who went on to become president of Poland up to the first World War.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In fact it became part of Austria when Poland was partitioned in 1772 and it was still a part of that country when Bartel was born there - so officially he was born in Lemberg.</li>
<li>Bartel was awarded his doctorate in 1911 and, three years later, he was made a professor at the Lemberg Polytechnic.</li>
<li>Bartel was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian army for the duration of World War I.</li>
<li>For Bartel, as for many Poles, the war was seen as a positive step which could lead to Poland regaining its sovereignty.</li>
<li>Bartel returned to his professorship at what was now called Lwów Polytechnic and in fact his book Descriptive geometry (Polish) was published around this time.</li>
<li>Bartel took a very active part in this defence of Lwów, commanding the railway troops in their battles with the Ukrainian army.</li>
<li>In 1919 Bartel gave up his professorship of mathematics at Lwów Polytechnic to assist in reforming Poland with a democratic constitution.</li>
<li>Bartel became a member of Poland's Sejm, its parliament, in 1922.</li>
<li>Pilsudski became Minister of Defence and Bartel was made Prime Minister of Poland.</li>
<li>From 1926 until 1930, Bartel was Prime Minister of Poland on five separate occasions.</li>
<li>As Prime Minister, Bartel was also keen to protect minorities in Poland.</li>
<li>During these years when Bartel was again an academic, he applied his knowledge and skills in geometry to a historical study of perspective in European painting.</li>
<li>This text of Bartel's is admirably straightforward in its methods.</li>
<li>After Bartel's death, a third edition was prepared by Antoni Plamitzer who only made minor changes to the text of the third edition.</li>
<li>In 1940 Bartel was appointed to Moscow and offered a seat in the Soviet parliament.</li>
<li>During the following night 36 other professors, Bartel's colleagues, were likewise arrested.</li>
<li>Bartel was not murdered with them.</li>
<li>Bartel was being held at Pelczynska street, and here it looks as if his treatment was reasonable.</li>
<li>Bartel received many honours and decorations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 March 1882, Lemberg, Austria-Hungarian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 26 July 1941, Lwów, Poland.</p>
