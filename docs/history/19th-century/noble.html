<p><strong>Charles Noble</strong> was an American mathematician best known for his work in the development of mathematical education.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Augustus Noble's parents were English and had sailed to the United States in 1820.</li>
<li>They settled in Baltimore, Maryland, and there Augustus Noble was born on 13 December 1823.</li>
<li>Augustus and Johanna Noble had six children, five sons and one daughter.</li>
<li>Charles had four brothers George (born about 1857), Edward (born about 1859), Frederick (born about 1860) and Walter (born about 1868).</li>
<li>As a young boy, Charles Noble lived on the ranch at Soquel but soon developed a dislike of farming.</li>
<li>Noble was able to complete his high school education in San Francisco and then he entered the University of California.</li>
<li>In 1893 Noble decided that he wanted to undertake research in mathematics for a doctorate.</li>
<li>Noble went to the University of Göttingen in 1893 and he undertook research there for three years advised by David Hilbert and Felix Klein.</li>
<li>On 13 March 1903 a marriage licence was issued for Charles A Noble, aged 21, of 2311 California Street, San Francisco and Florence N Coleman, aged 18, of 1834 California Street, San Francisco.</li>
<li>They had one son, also named Charles Albert Noble.</li>
<li>On 30 September 1905, Noble read his paper Note on loxodromes before the San Francisco Section of the American Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>Noble was very interested in school education and he inspected schools for the University of California.</li>
<li>At the time the earthquake struck, Noble was in Marin and Sonoma counties inspecting schools.</li>
<li>On 14 August 1907 Noble was in Zürich when he submitted his paper Singular points of a simple kind of differential equation of the second order to the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>In 1909 the Nobles asked the architect William Knowles to build a house for them at 2224 Piedmont Avenue, Berkeley.</li>
<li>During the rest of his working life, Noble had a short walk north from his home across Strawberry Creek and down South Drive to Wheeler Hall or other academic buildings.</li>
<li>Among the papers Noble published, after the ones we mentioned above, were Characteristics of two partial differential equations of order one (1911) and Retention of a salt solution in a tank of flowing water (1922).</li>
<li>Hedrick, like Noble, had studied in Germany and was fluent in German.</li>
<li>Noble and Hedrick translated Felix Klein's Elementary mathematics from an advanced standpoint: Arithmetic, algebra, analysis into English and published the book in 1932.</li>
<li>Noble acted as Chairman of the Mathematics Department, University of California, Berkeley, during 1933-1934.</li>
<li>Noble returned to teaching at the University to help out but donated his services without seeking recompense.</li>
<li>In 1947 Florence, Noble's wife, died.</li>
<li>In the 1950s Noble was fully retired but still had an office at 456 Wheeler Hall.</li>
<li>The picture of Charles Noble will be found in the group photograph of the charter members of the Faculty Club.</li>
<li>By that year, the adjacent houses - 2222 and 2234 Piedmont Avenue - were already being used as offices, so acquisition of the Noble home would have filled in the remaining gap in University property ownership of the buildings on the block.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 August 1867, Soquel, Santa Cruz, California, USA. Died 7 May 1962, Berkeley, California, USA.</p>
