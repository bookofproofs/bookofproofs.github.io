<p><strong>John Alison</strong> graduated from Edinburgh University and taught at George Watson's College in Edinburgh, He became head of the Glasgow United Free Church Training College and later returned to George Watson's as headmaster.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>John attended Gallatown Public School and from there he went to Edinburgh where he matriculated at the University and also studied at Moray House.</li>
<li>Alison was appointed as a Mathematics Master at The Edinburgh Academy in 1884.</li>
<li>Mr Alison is forty-one years of age.</li>
<li>M.A. For two years thereafter Mr Alison was assistant in the Practising School of Moray House Training College.</li>
<li>Mr Alison is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, was president of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, and was twice president of the Association of Teachers in Merchant Company Schools, Edinburgh.</li>
<li>There were ten applicants for the appointment which Mr Alison has just received.</li>
<li>After two years in Glasgow, Alison returned to Edinburgh in 1904 when he was appointed as Headmaster of George Watson's College.</li>
<li>Mr Alison, who is forty-four years of age, is not a stranger to the school, having been mathematical master in it until two years ago, when he was elected to the position which he has since filled in the United Free Church Training College, Glasgow.</li>
<li>Mr Alison is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, has been president of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, and twice president of the Association of Teachers in the Merchant Company Schools.</li>
<li>(Laughter.) Dr Alison was the most fitting ambassador they could possibly have to go abroad.</li>
<li>They knew that in Dr Alison they had one who would carry with him their best wishes to those abroad, and would do all he could to increase the tremendous friendship that always existed amongst Watsonians.</li>
<li>Dr Alison concluded by proposing the health of the next headmaster Mr George Robertson.</li>
<li>It is no mean tribute to Mr Alison's skill and zeal that under his administration Watson' s has remained true to the high ideal's of his great predecessor Dr Ogilvie, and has steadily grown in numbers, efficiency, and reputation.</li>
<li>Mr Alison's claim to University recognition is strengthened by the valuable work he has done on behalf of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, and the sustained interest he has shown in all movements for improving the training of teachers and fostering the corporate sense of the scholastic profession.</li>
<li>Alison was an early member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, joining in December 1884 at the beginning of the third session of the new Society.</li>
<li>John Alison was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 1 April 1889, his proposers being John Sturgeon Mackay, George Chrystal, Robert M Ferguson, Alexander Yule Fraser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 28 February 1861, Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland. Died 21 March 1952, Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
