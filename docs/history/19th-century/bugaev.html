<p><strong>Nicolai Vasilievich Bugaev</strong> was a Russian mathematician, born in Georgia, who worked mainly on analysis and number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It was not an easy life for the young Bugaev for he had to earn extra money giving tuition in order to make have enough money to live on.</li>
<li>In 1855 Bugaev entered the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at Moscow University.</li>
<li>At this point Bugaev was not concentrating on mathematics, although his courses had included a very strong background in mathematics.</li>
<li>After this Bugaev decided that he should study abroad to complete his education.</li>
<li>In 1866 Bugaev submitted his doctoral thesis on numerical identities associated with the number e.</li>
<li>A Russian doctoral thesis being essentially the equivalent of the German Habilitation thesis, then Bugaev's appointment as professor at Moscow University followed in 1867.</li>
<li>Bugaev gave proofs of theorems stated without proof by Liouville.</li>
<li>Sonin was another of Bugaev's pupils who went on to make a major contribution to mathematics.</li>
<li>Bugaev's most important work in number theory was based on an analogy between some operations in number theory and the operations such as differentiation and integration in analysis.</li>
<li>Bugaev built a systematic theory of discontinuous functions which he called arithmology.</li>
<li>Bugaev also published papers on the philosophy of mathematics such as Les mathématiques et la conception du monde au point de vue philosophie scientifique Ⓣ(Mathematics and the scientific worldview philosophy perspective) (1898) which he delivered at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Zürich in 1897.</li>
<li>In this work Bugaev describes mathematics as based on the theory of functions, with geometry and the theory of probability having a minor role.</li>
<li>The theorem relating convergence almost everywhere and uniform convergence by D F Egorov, one of Bugaev's pupils, in 1911 is seen as marking the beginning of the Moscow school of the theory of functions of a real variable.</li>
<li>Bugaev was one of the founders of the Moscow Mathematical Society, its vice president from 1886 and its president from 1891.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 September 1837, Dusheti (near Tiflis, now Tbilisi), Georgia. Died 11 June 1903, Moscow, Russia.</p>
