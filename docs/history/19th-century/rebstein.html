<p><strong>Jacob Rebstein</strong> was a Swiss mathematician primarily known for his pioneering work as a geometer and surveying expert.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rebstein grew up in his native village of Töss and attended primary school there.</li>
<li>Rebstein graduated from the Polytechnic in 1860, and went to study at the Collège de France in Paris for a year.</li>
<li>Rebstein mainly taught at the Polytechnic's School of Cultural Engineering, but also at the Engineering and Elective Departments.</li>
<li>Today Rebstein is primarily known for his pioneering work as a geometer and surveying expert.</li>
<li>Rebstein first heard about this method when visiting relatives in Baden and was instrumental in introducing it in Switzerland.</li>
<li>Rebstein was an expert in using the method of least squares and the theory of errors and applying them to cadastral techniques.</li>
<li>For many years Rebstein was a member of the examining board of the Swiss Concordat of Geometers.</li>
<li>Among Rebstein's publications his Lehrbuch über praktische Geometrie mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der Theodolitmessung Ⓣ(Textbook on Practical Geometry With Special Consideration of Theodolite Surveying) (1868) stands out, as most of his publications are surveying and actuarial reports.</li>
<li>Rebstein conducted many studies in his capacity as auditor of the Swiss Life Insurance and Pensions Service.</li>
<li>Rebstein was a very active member of the Polytechnic's alumni association, the Gesellschaft Ehemaliger Polytechniker (GEP) throughout his life and served as the association's president from 1881-1885.</li>
<li>Whilst "Dr" suggests a more junior colleague it is not impossible that this could refer to the Rebstein we just met, as the Swiss army regularly calls back old recruits for training exercises.</li>
<li>This suggests that there were two Rebsteins.</li>
<li>Like many of his colleagues at the Polytechnic (and on the organising committee), Rebstein was a keen hill walker and mountaineer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 May 1840, Töss, Zürich canton, Switzerland. Died 14 March 1907, Zürich, Switzerland.</p>
