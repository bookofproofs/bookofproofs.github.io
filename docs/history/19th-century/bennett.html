<p><strong>Geoffrey Bennett</strong> was an English mathematician with wide interests including number theory, combinatorics and history.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bennett  entered University College School, which had been founded in Gower Street in 1830 as part of University College, London, in 1883.</li>
<li>This was an outstanding school which by the time Bennett studied there was within University College itself.</li>
<li>Bennett had the distinction of being Senior Wrangler in Mathematical Tripos of 1890 but he did not come top in the examinations; Philippa Fawcett was the best student.</li>
<li>Bennett was the first Senior Wrangler to have a woman placed above him.</li>
<li>Bennett was awarded a First Class in the examination of 1891 and became the first Smith's Prizeman in the following year.</li>
<li>Bennett's first paper, entitled On the Residues of Powers of Numbers for any Composite Modulus, Real or Complex, was published in 1892 in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.</li>
<li>In it Bennett considers a skew hinged four-bar mechanism in three dimensional space.</li>
<li>This remarkable mechanism Bennett called a skew isogram.</li>
<li>In a subsequent 22 page paper The skew isogram mechanism which he published in 1914, Bennett presented many interesting properties of the skew isogram, some without proofs.</li>
<li>These proofs were not written down until Bernard Groeneveld's thesis Geometrical considerations on space kinematics in connection with Bennett's mechanism presented to the Technische Hogeschool te Delft in 1954.</li>
<li>In 1922 Bennett published The three-bar sextic curve.</li>
<li>Bennett was elected a Senior Fellow of Emmanuel College in 1899.</li>
<li>Another aspect of Bennett's mathematical work was as an historian.</li>
<li>Outside mathematics Bennett had many interests.</li>
<li>The university bicycle club had an annual road race of fifty miles, in which Bennett rode on three occasions, being successively third, second and first.</li>
<li>Sir G S W Epps, formerly a pupil of Bennett's, while gratefully recording his indebtedness to Bennett's teaching, tells of a machine devised by Bennett in which he lay flat along the frame (with a pad for his chest), using a mirror to see ahead.</li>
<li>A few more details help to complete a picture of Bennett.</li>
<li>Note also an article entitled Wari by Bennett in Robert Sutherland Rattray's book Religion &amp; Art in Ashanti published in 1927 in which he gives the rules and some strategies of the African game of owari.</li>
<li>Perhaps it is worth noting, as a partial defence of Bennett, that a Google Book Search for "G T Bennett" "Emmanuel College" yields around 200 hits.</li>
<li>Finally let us note that when Robert Macmillan went to Emmanuel College in 1941, he came to know Bennett for a short while (Bennett died while Macmillan was studying at the College).</li>
<li>Bennett was popularly known then as "Beaver" Bennett, because he had a formidable white beard in his old age.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 30 June 1868, Clerkenwell, Middlesex, England. Died 11 October 1943, Cambridge, England.</p>
