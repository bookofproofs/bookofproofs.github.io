<h1>Person: Veblen, Oswald</h1>

<p><strong>Veblen</strong> made important contributions to projective and differential geometry, and topology.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Veblen attended school in Iowa City before entering the University of Iowa in 1894, receiving his A.B. in 1898.</li>
<li>After a year spent as a laboratory assistant at the University of Iowa, Veblen spent a year at Harvard University where he was awarded a second B.A. in 1900, before going to the University of Chicago to undertake research.</li>
<li>Veblen first impressed Moore when he attended his seminar in 1901.</li>
<li>queries and remarks of members of this course, in particular Mr O Veblen, have been a source of much stimulus.</li>
<li>Veblen's doctoral dissertation, supervised by  Moore, was entitled A System of Axioms for Geometry  and he was awarded his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1903.</li>
<li>In it Veblen gave an axiom system based on point and order rather than on the traditional notions of point, line and plane.</li>
<li>During this period Veblen worked on putting his own thesis into a form for publication and A system of axioms for geometry  appeared as a 41 page paper in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society  in 1904.</li>
<li>Leaving Chicago, Veblen taught mathematics at Princeton University from 1905 to 1932.</li>
<li>Two years after his marriage, in 1910, Veblen was promoted to professor of mathematics at Princeton.</li>
<li>Veblen headed the Division of Experimental Ballistics which was the mathematical research facility at the Proving Ground.</li>
<li>Veblen was honoured by Princeton in 1926 when they named him Henry B Fine Professor of Mathematics.</li>
<li>In 1929 funds were provided for Fine Hall at Princeton and Veblen provided most of the ideas that went into its design.</li>
<li>Veblen was a grand man, and the people for whom he made it possible to come to the United States made a great contribution to mathematics.</li>
<li>Veblen's interest in the foundations of geometry led to his work on the axiom systems of projective geometry.</li>
<li>The first of the two volumes in this book were jointly written by the two authors but the second volume was due the Veblen alone.</li>
<li>We mentioned above that Veblen's first work on topology appeared just before he arrived in Princeton.</li>
<li>Soon after Einstein's theory of general relativity appeared Veblen turned his attention to differential geometry.</li>
<li>Veblen was an active member of the American Mathematical Society, serving the Society as vice-president in 1915 and president in 1923-24.</li>
<li>Veblen was elected to the American Philosophical Society and the National Academy of Sciences (United States) and was honoured with memberships of many other societies around the world.</li>
<li>Veblen loved the outdoors and it was his initiative which led to Princeton purchasing a woodland site for the Institute for Advanced Study so that members could go for countryside walks.</li>
<li>In his last years Veblen became partially blind and he devised a number of aids for blind people, one of which was manufactured and distributed by the American Foundation for the Blind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 June 1880, Decorah, Iowa, USA. Died 10 August 1960, Brooklyn, Maine, USA.</p>
