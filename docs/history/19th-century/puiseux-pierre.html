<p><strong>Pierre Puiseux</strong> was a French astronomer who worked on the aberration of light, asteroids and lunar dynamics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Victor and Laure Puiseux had six children: Paul Louis Puiseux (born 18 February 1851, died aged 14 on 6 January 1856); Marie Laure Louise Puiseux (born 28 December 1852, died aged 21 on 11 May 1874); Fébronie Marie Puiseux (born 20 July 1853, died aged 18 on 31 March 1872); Pierre Henri Puiseux (born 20 July 1855, the subject of this biography); André Victor Puiseux (born 11 September 1857, died aged 3 weeks later on 1 October 1857); and André Paul Puiseux (born 22 November 1858, died in 1931).</li>
<li>We note that Pierre's mother Laure died on 2 December 1858, aged 28, as a result of child birth.</li>
<li>At this time Pierre was only three years old and perhaps too young to understand what had happened, but he must have felt the intense sadness.</li>
<li>Sophie Jannet, Pierre's maternal grandmother, was widowed in 1861 and she took a large part in helping Victor Puiseux bring up his five children.</li>
<li>Let us refer to the subject of this biography as Pierre (or Pierre Puiseux) throughout, since otherwise there will be confusion with other family members.</li>
<li>In the 1860s Victor Puiseux took his five children on vacations in the French mountains where they all enjoyed very long walks.</li>
<li>Although only a young lad, Pierre loved this time in the country and mountainside.</li>
<li>While on these holidays, Victor Puiseux would write to Sophie Jannet, Pierre's maternal grandmother, and these letters show how grateful he was for her support with his family.</li>
<li>Pierre, whose studies were all in Paris, began his school studies at the Lycée Henri IV, then entered the Lycée Saint-Louis in 1865.</li>
<li>Augustin Boutan (1820-1900), professor of physics and Headmaster of the Lycée, was a friend of Victor Puiseux.</li>
<li>Another tragedy struck the family soon after Pierre entered the Lycée Saint-Louis when his brother Paul Puiseux died of typhoid fever in January 1866.</li>
<li>Pierre was ten years old and losing his older brother must have been devastating.</li>
<li>In 1867, now with four children, Victor Puiseux went for the summer holiday to Switzerland, to the small village of Engelberg, in the Bernese Alps.</li>
<li>On 7 September Victor Puiseux, Pierre and his two older sisters, made an ascent of the Titlis, a mountain of 3240 metres.</li>
<li>It is remarkable to think that Pierre, only twelve years old at the time, could make such an ascent.</li>
<li>This experience gave Pierre a life-long passion for mountaineering.</li>
<li>In 1870, when Pierre was fifteen years old, the family took their summer holiday in the Pyrenees without André, and on their return in September they stopped at Lectoure, where Augustin Boutan, Pierre's headmaster, had a holiday home.</li>
<li>Victor Puiseux returned to Paris with his two daughters, leaving Pierre with the wife of Augustin Boutan in Lectoure.</li>
<li>Pierre quickly became good friends with the Boutan children.</li>
<li>Over the winter, the mathematics teacher at the local Lycée was absent due to the war and Pierre took over teaching mathematics at the school.</li>
<li>After the armistice at the end of January 1871 Pierre returned to Paris and continued with his schooling at the Lycée Saint-Louis.</li>
<li>Remarkably, every summer, including the years when the girls died, Pierre with his brother André and their father, went climbing in the mountains.</li>
<li>In 1875 Pierre sat the entrance examinations in mathematics for the École Normale Supérieure and later that year he began his studies there.</li>
<li>For example, Pierre and André climber the Dard in 1876, Victor, Pierre and André reached the summit of the Chasseforêt on 1 September 1876, André and Pierre climber the Labby on 4 August, and Pierre climbed the Arpont on 20 August 1876.</li>
<li>This important work was published in the same year and Pierre was awarded his doctorate.</li>
<li>However, the family had always been highly religious and, after the award of his doctorate, Pierre decided to change career completely and study divinity.</li>
<li>However, at this point the family must have put pressure on Pierre to change his mind and to continue to follow a scientific career.</li>
<li>On 20 November, Pierre applied for admission to the Paris Observatory as a student-astronomer, and was accepted on 1 December 1879.</li>
<li>Pierre Puiseux was part of the Martinique expedition headed by Felix Tisserand (1845-1896) which also included Guillaume Bigourdan.</li>
<li>Pierre Puiseux published Note sur le passage de Vénus de 1882 Ⓣ(Note on the passage of Venus of 1882) in the Connaissance des temps ou des mouvements célestes à l'usage des astronomes et des navigateurs Ⓣ(Knowledge of celestial times or movements for the use of astronomers and navigators) published by the Bureau des longitudes.</li>
<li>Pierre Puiseux married Beatrice Elise Marie Bouvet (1861-1963) in Salins on 21 June 1883.</li>
<li>Pierre and Beatrice had six children: Marie-Louise Puiseux (1884-1970); Victor Marie Puiseux (1887-1978); Madeleine Marie Puiseux (1888-1983); Robert André Jean Joseph Puiseux (1892-1992); Marguerite Marie Adele Puiseux (1894-1984); and Olivier Henri Frederic Puiseux (1899-1947).</li>
<li>We have emphasised above the important part that mountaineering had in Pierre Puiseux's life but this was not just a hobby.</li>
<li>In 1882, Loewy with Pierre Puiseux as his assistant, began working on the design and construction of the telescope.</li>
<li>Maurice Loewy and Pierre Puiseux published a description of this work in their book Théorie nouvelles de l'équatorial coudé et des équatoriaux en général Ⓣ(New theory of the equatorial elbow and equatorial in general) published in 1888.</li>
<li>The major work that Loewy and Pierre Puiseux undertook with the Grand Equatorial Coudé was their monumental Atlas Photographique de la Lune Ⓣ(Photographic atlas of the Moon).</li>
<li>This required fourteen years to complete between 1894 and 1909 and in fact Loewy died in 1907 so Pierre Puiseux headed the project on his own in its final stages.</li>
<li>The Paris Observatory sent an expedition to Cistierna, Léon, Spain led by Pierre Puiseux and also involving Maurice Hamy, Charles Le Morvan, Jules Baillaud and Georges Prin.</li>
<li>In 1908 Pierre Puiseux published the book La terre et la lune : forme extérieure et structure interne Ⓣ(The Earth and the Moon: External form and internal structure) giving his theory regarding the craters on the moon.</li>
<li>The principal work carried out by Loewy and Puiseux was on lunar photography.</li>
<li>These were carefully examined by Puiseux, who made the enlargements from which the fine atlas of seventy-one sheets was constructed.</li>
<li>It was Puiseux also who wrote the descriptions and discussed the results.</li>
<li>Pierre Puiseux received many honours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 20 July 1855, Paris, France. Died 28 September 1928, Fontenay, Jura, France.</p>
