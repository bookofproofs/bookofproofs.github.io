<h1>Person: Cantelli, Francesco Paolo</h1>

<p><strong>Francesco Cantelli</strong> was an Italian mathematician who made contributions to the theory of probability.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Palermo Observatory, where Cantelli worked, had been quite famous.</li>
<li>Its most important discovery had been 100 years before Cantelli worked there, on 1 January 1801, when the asteroid Ceres was discovered.</li>
<li>Cantelli's investigation confirmed the hypothesis favouring the year 1301.</li>
<li>Cantelli's work in astronomy involved statistical analysis of data and his interests turned more towards the statistical style of mathematics and to applications of probability to astronomy and other areas.</li>
<li>In 1922, while still working as an actuary at the Istituti di Previdenza, Cantelli qualified to teach in universities.</li>
<li>In 1925 Cantelli was called to Naples where he taught actuarial and financial mathematics.</li>
<li>However others made important contributions, and a number of Italians, including Cantelli, Castelnuovo and de Finetti, did outstanding work in this area.</li>
<li>Although his name is frequently connected with the name of E Borel, Cantelli's approach to probability is very different from that of Borel.</li>
<li>Cantelli's first publications on probability examined the foundations of the subject in connection with logic, for example in Sui fondamenti del calcolo delle probabilità Ⓣ(On the foundations of probability) (1905).</li>
<li>Cantelli, in his work on the law of large numbers, was developing ideas which had been first suggested by Jacob Bernoulli in the 17th  century.</li>
<li>Around the time that Cantelli worked on the law of large numbers, Borel was also interested in the topic.</li>
<li>In spite of these aspects, the Cantelli treatment of stochastic convergence turns out to be exceptionally transparent and quite satisfactory even with respect to the present expositions of the subject.</li>
<li>Financial mathematics was also a topic of Cantelli's research.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 20 December 1875, Palermo, Sicily, Italy. Died 21 July 1966, Rome, Italy.</p>
