<h1>Person: Sundman, Karl Frithiof</h1>

<p><strong>Karl Sundman</strong> was a Finnish mathematician who used analytic methods to find a solution to the three-body problem.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His father John Frithiof Sundman was a customs officer.</li>
<li>Karl's health was poor as he was growing up and he certainly did not have a very easy time studying on his own without a teacher so that he could take the baccalaureate examinations, which he did on 18 May 1893.</li>
<li>After qualifying to enter university, Sundman went to Helsinki (Helsingfors) where he began his studies in the autumn of 1883.</li>
<li>The University was an ancient one, founded in 1640, and there Sundman excelled academically although he had to battle against financial difficulties.</li>
<li>After graduating Sundman went to Pulkovo Observatory to continue his research on astronomy.</li>
<li>Sundman, however, was interested in the theoretical aspects of astronomy.</li>
<li>In this work Sundman examined the perturbations of minor planets whose period of revolution round the sun is in the ratio of 1:2 of that of Jupiter.</li>
<li>In 1902 Sundman was appointed as a lecturer at the University of Helsinki, being promoted to extraordinary professor of astronomy there in 1907.</li>
<li>The most famous contribution of Sundman was his solution of the three-body problem which he accomplished using analytic methods to prove the existence of an infinite series solution.</li>
<li>In 1913 the Academy of Sciences in Paris awarded Sundman their Pontécoulant prize for his outstanding work on this problem.</li>
<li>One of the reasons why the Academy was so impressed by Sundman's solution was that it was a problem to which Henri Poincaré had devoted much effort.</li>
<li>To regularize the singularity of the differential equations of motion, in the 1912 paper mentioned above, Sundman introduced a new independent variable which regularizes the motion within a band of finite breadth.</li>
<li>it is possible to show the existence of two different research programs, one related to Levi-Civita's works, the other to Sundman's investigations, which include for the first time a complete regularization of the three-body problem.</li>
<li>Sundman will always be known for his remarkable solution to the extremely difficult three-body problem, but he did other important work.</li>
<li>Such a machine will necessarily be very complicated and Sundman describes the project in detail using well-known techniques and construction capabilities in a field unrelated to astronomy.</li>
<li>In the 1940 paper Sundman gave a new and elegant demonstration of the theorem of Poisson on the invariability of the major axes of the planetary orbits which had been demonstrated in several ways.</li>
<li>This last statement suggests that Sundman may not have been pleased had he realised that 60 years after his death a biography describing his remarkable achievements would be placed on the web!</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 28 October 1873, Kasko, Vaasa, Finland. Died 28 September 1949, Helsinki, Finland.</p>
