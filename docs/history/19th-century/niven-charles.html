<p><strong>Charles Niven</strong> was a Scot who became Professor of Mathematics at Cork. He returned to Aberdeen as Professor of Natural Philosophy and held this post for 42 years.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Charles Niven's parents were Charles Niven (born around 1802), a ginger beer brewer and spirit dealer, and Barbara Davidson (born 1810 or 1811) of Monquhitter, Aberdeenshire.</li>
<li>Charles and Barbara married on 28 November 1833 and had nine children: John Gibb Niven (born 1834); Thomas Niven (born 1836); William Davidson Niven (born 1842); Charles Niven (born 1845); Barbara Niven (born 1848); James Niven (born 1851); Alexander Niven (born 1854); Thomas Niven (born 1855); and George Niven (born 1859).</li>
<li>Charles was one of three distinguished mathematical brothers, William and James also being Cambridge Wranglers.</li>
<li>William Niven, who became vice-president of the Royal Society and was knighted, has a biography in this archive.</li>
<li>James Niven studied at Queens' College, Cambridge and was bracketed eighth wrangler in the mathematical tripos of 1874.</li>
<li>Charles Niven married Mary Stewart, daughter of Sir David Stewart and Mary Irvine; they had one son and two daughters.</li>
<li>Charles Niven was 41 years as Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Aberdeen, being appointed in 1880.</li>
<li>He is best known in Aberdeen for building up Natural Philosophy in Marischal College but we note that Marischal College was only opened in 1906 when Niven had already been Professor for 26 years.</li>
<li>Professor Charles Niven was presented to the King during the ceremony.</li>
<li>By arrangement with Professor Niven, a pair of the odolites have been lent to the Observatory for the observation of pilot balloons.</li>
<li>The Edinburgh Mathematical Society was founded in 1883 and at the meeting in June of that year Niven was elected as an honorary member.</li>
<li>Charles McGlashan, Oldmachar Cathedral, and Professors Fulton and Cowan.</li>
<li>The chief mourners were Mrs Niven (the widow, daughter of the late Sir David Stewart of Banchory-Devenick), Mr Charles D Niven, B.Sc (son), and Miss Niven and Miss M S Niven (daughters).</li>
<li>The pall-bearers were:- Mr Charles D Niven (son), Dr James Niven, late Medical Officer of Health, Manchester (brother); Colonel D B D Stewart; Banchory House; and Dr George L Stewart, Ipswich (brothers-in-law); Professors Harrower and Reid, Aberdeen University; Dr Fyvie and Dr Geddes, of the Natural Philosophy Department, Marischal College.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 September 1845, Peterhead, Scotland. Died 11 May 1923, Aberdeen, Scotland.</p>
