<p><strong>Alexander Yule Fraser</strong> was an Edinburgh teacher. With Barclay and Knott he was one of the writers who originally proposed the founding of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alexander  had three younger siblings: Jessie (born about 1860), Donald (born about 1862), and Frederick  (born about 1877).</li>
<li>Alexander Fraser's was educated at the University of Aberdeen where he specialised in mathematics and physics.</li>
<li>Mr Fraser was entrusted with the charge of the Mathematical and Physical departments; and it is not too much to say that not a little of the success of this school is due to the energy with which he threw himself into the work of his department.</li>
<li>In 1889 Fraser was appointed as Headmaster of Allen Glen's Institution in Glasgow.</li>
<li>The Edinburgh Mathematical Society was founded in February 1883 and it was Fraser together with Andrew Jeffrey Gunion Barclay, also a mathematics master at George Watson's College at the time, together with Cargill Gilston Knott, an Assistant to the Professor of Natural Philosophy in Edinburgh University, who issued a circular 'to gentlemen in Edinburgh, in Cambridge and throughout Scotland generally whom they deemed likely to take an interest in such a Society' calling for a Mathematical Society to be set up.</li>
<li>FRASER, M.A.(Aberdeen).</li>
<li>Fraser became a founder member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society and was Secretary during 1883-88, and Treasurer during 1883-85.</li>
<li>At the meeting on Friday 8 January 1886 Fraser gave an account of the methods for the quadrature of areas, especially by planimeters.</li>
<li>On the opening of George Heriot's Hospital as a day school, Mr Fraser was appointed head of the mathematical and physical departments, to the equipment and organisation of which be devoted himself with energy and success.</li>
<li>A little over a year ago Mr Fraser was appointed to the headmaster-ship of Allan Glen's Institution in Glasgow, but failing health compelled him to give it up, and be resigned with the intention of going to South Africa.</li>
<li>While Mr Fraser was still a junior master at Watson's College, the idea occurred to him that there was room in Edinburgh for a Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>Fraser had been intending to address the meeting of the Society on Friday 14 November 1890 on the topic of the history of the controversy concerning the differential calculus.</li>
<li>Fraser was elected to a fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 1 June 1885.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 May 1857, Cargill, near Perth, Scotland. Died 9 November 1890, Glasgow, Scotland.</p>
