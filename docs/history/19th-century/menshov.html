<h1>Person: Menshov, Dmitrii Evgenevich</h1>

<p><strong>Dmitrii Menshov</strong> was a Russian mathematician known for his contributions to the theory of trigonometric series.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His mother, Alexandra Nikolaevna Tatishcheva, was an important early influence in Menshov's education.</li>
<li>In 1904, at the age of 12 years, Menshov began his secondary schooling.</li>
<li>Influenced by his mother's tuition in foreign languages, Menshov's first love at school was indeed for languages.</li>
<li>However, Menshov had an outstanding mathematics teacher and, like many children who are influenced by an outstanding teacher, Menshov began to show a strong interest in mathematics from about the age of 13.</li>
<li>After leaving school, Menshov sat the entrance examination for the Moscow Engineering College and began his studies there in the autumn of 1911.</li>
<li>Then in the autumn of 1912 Menshov entered the Department of Physics and Mathematics at Moscow University.</li>
<li>Perhaps the most significant event for Menshov, however, was that Luzin returned from Göttingen to Moscow in the autumn of 1914 and began to lecture on functions of a real variable.</li>
<li>Menshov attended Luzin's lecture course, and when Luzin posed the open problem of whether the Denjoy integral and the Borel integral were equivalent, he was able to solve the problem.</li>
<li>The Denjoy integral is the more general of the two and Menshov showed that this was the case.</li>
<li>Menshov's discovery, made while still an undergraduate, became his first publication.</li>
<li>Luzin quickly established a School of Mathematics at Moscow University and Menshov became one of his fist research students along with P S Aleksandrov, M Ya Suslin, and A Ya Khinchin.</li>
<li>Menshov's first degree was awarded in 1916 for the thesis which he wrote on The Riemann theory of trigonometric series which was examined by Egorov and Luzin.</li>
<li>However, only three weeks after he graduated, Menshov discovered one of his most fundamental results on the uniqueness problem for trigonometric series.</li>
<li>By the end of 1918 Menshov had been awarded his Master's degree and he went to Ivanovo north-east of Moscow, which at that time was the temporary capital of the revolutionary government, but he soon moved to Nizhnii-Novgorod where he was appointed as a professor at the University.</li>
<li>At this time Luzin and other members of his research school were in Ivanovo so Menshov was certainly in the mainstream of the exciting mathematics that was being developed.</li>
<li>In the autumn of 1922 Menshov returned to Moscow and began teaching at the University.</li>
<li>It may have been noticed by an attentive reader that we have still not noted that Menshov being awarded a doctorate (equivalent to the habilitation or D.Sc.).</li>
<li>Together with the award of the doctorate came Menshov's appointment to a professorship at Moscow University.</li>
<li>Privalov held this first chair up to 1941 but then, on Privalov's early death in that year, Menshov was appointed to the chair of the Theory of Functions.</li>
<li>In 1943 these two chairs were combined and the Department of Theory of Functions and Functional Analysis was created with Menshov as its head.</li>
<li>Menshov also worked a the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences from 1934 to 1941 and then again from 1947.</li>
<li>Menshov does not belong among the ranks of those mathematicians who undertake the solution of comparatively easy problems, or who continue the research of other authors on a course that has already been indicated.</li>
<li>For his work on the representation of functions by trigonometric series, Menshov was awarded a State Prize in 1951.</li>
<li>In 1958 Menshov attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Edinburgh and he was invited to address the Congress with his paper On the convergence of trigonometric series.</li>
<li>The first of the two pictures of Menshov which we have given was taken while he was at the Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1958.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 April 1892, Moscow, Russia. Died 25 November 1988, Moscow, Russia.</p>
