<p><strong>Tibor Radó</strong> was a Hungarian mathematician best known for his solution to the Plateau Problem.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>At this stage Radó enlisted as a lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian army and was sent to the Russian front.</li>
<li>Around 600000 men in the Austro-Hungarian army were killed or captured in the 1916 Russian offensive and Radó was one of those taken prisoner by the Russians.</li>
<li>In the camp near Tobolsk Radó had met a fellow prisoner Eduard Helly.</li>
<li>After being shot, Helly had been captured by the Russians towards the end of 1915 and after a spell in hospital was by then in the same prison camp Radó.</li>
<li>However unlike Radó, who had only just begun his university studies, Helly was already a research mathematician who had made remarkable progress in his work on functional analysis, proving the Hahn-Banach theorem in 1912.</li>
<li>In the prison camp Helly acted as mathematics teacher to Radó who was also able to read books on mathematics.</li>
<li>None of this had a significant effect on the Russian Revolution but it did mean that Radó remained a prisoner in the midst of bitter conflict.</li>
<li>Eventually in the confusion that was taking place in Siberia Radó was able to escape from the prison camp but returning to his much reduced country forced him to make a most remarkable journey.</li>
<li>Escaping from the prison camp near Tobolsk, Radó made his way north to the Arctic regions of Russia.</li>
<li>After a trek of many thousands of miles Radó reached Hungary in 1920.</li>
<li>Let us mention in particular the paper from this period, namely Über den Begriff der Riemannschen Fläche Ⓣ(On the concept of Riemann surface) which Radó published in 1925.</li>
<li>The Rockefeller Foundation awarded Radó a fellowship to enable him to spend 1928 working in Germany; part of the year being spent with Carathéodory in Munich and part with Koebe and Lichtenstein in Leipzig.</li>
<li>The following year saw Radó visit the United States where he was a visiting lecturer at Harvard University and Rice University.</li>
<li>In 1930 Radó published the work for which he is most famous, namely his solution to the Plateau Problem.</li>
<li>Garnier made a major breakthrough in 1928 followed soon after by independent solutions to the general problem by Douglas and by Radó.</li>
<li>Their approaches were very different, Radó's being via conformal mappings.</li>
<li>Let us remark that the solution to the Plateau problem by both Douglas and by Radó did not exclude the possibility that the minimal surface contained a singularity.</li>
<li>Radó spent 1942 as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago.</li>
<li>It was in 1945, the year that the war ended, that Radó was invited to be the American Mathematical Society Colloquium Lecturer.</li>
<li>gives a systematic and detailed exposition of most of the contributions to the theory of the Lebesgue area which have been made by C B Morrey, T Radó and Radó's students.</li>
<li>The end of the war also marked a time when Radó took on the role as chairman of the Department of Mathematics of Ohio State University, a position he held from 1946 to 1948.</li>
<li>The Mathematical Association of America invited Radó to give the first Earle Raymond Hedrick Lectures at its meeting in the summer of 1952.</li>
<li>In the last decade of his life, Radó's interests turned to a new area when he found a fascination in the mathematics behind the newly developing ideas in computer science.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 2 June 1895, Budapest, Hungary. Died 12 December 1965, New Smyrna Beach, Florida, USA.</p>
