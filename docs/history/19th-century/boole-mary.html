<p><strong>Mary Everest Boole</strong> was an English mathematician who was married to George Boole. She wrote a number of books on mathematical education.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thomas Everest had one brother, George Everest (1790-1866), who was the surveyor and geographer after whom Mount Everest was named.</li>
<li>Mary Ryall had a brother John Ryall who became Vice President and Professor of Greek at Queen's College, Cork.</li>
<li>After Mary Everest married George Boole she became known as Mary Everest Boole.</li>
<li>For simplicity, we shall refer to her as Mary Boole throughout this biography.</li>
<li>She had a brother, George John Everest (1835-1908) who became vicar of Teynham in Kent.</li>
<li>Thomas Everest studied at Pembroke College, Cambridge and was ordained in 1826.</li>
<li>On 27 September 1830 he married Mary Ryall; their daughter Mary (the subject of this biography) was born in 1832 and their son George in 1835.</li>
<li>In 1837 an influenza epidemic swept through England leaving Thomas Everest as an invalid.</li>
<li>By 1843 Thomas Everest was well enough to return to his church at Wickwar, but the family maintained the routine devised for them by Hahnemann for eleven years.</li>
<li>Whether Thomas Everest recovered because of Hahnemann's treatment or in spite of Hahnemann's treatment is a matter of opinion but certainly the whole family had great faith in the homoeopathic approach.</li>
<li>While in France, Mary Boole became bilingual in French and English.</li>
<li>Mary writes that Deplace was educated in the French school of mathematics.</li>
<li>At age ten, when still in France, Mary Boole heard her father speaking with a friend who was visiting from England.</li>
<li>After the friend left Mary heard her father talking to her mother saying he did not know what he would do with his children since his son lacked interest in education as he would expect of a girl, but his daughter had the educational interests and abilities he would expect of a boy.</li>
<li>"If only she could go to Cambridge and study mathematics she would carry everything before her," he said, "but what could a girl do learning mathematics." Mary was shocked to learn that she could not go to university, she could not study mathematics and she would never meet the famous Charles Babbage.</li>
<li>Mary Boole could not go to university but she could learn mathematics by teaching herself from books.</li>
<li>In December 1843 Mary Boole's uncle, George Everest, returned from India.</li>
<li>George Everest spent many hours with Mary, encouraging her and telling her about his experiences.</li>
<li>George Everest enjoyed his discussions with Mary so much that at one time he even asked her father if he could not adopt her, but this was not what her parents wanted.</li>
<li>Indeed, their relationship evolved partly as a consequence of time they spent together devoted to Mary's private tuition, George proving particularly helpful to overcoming her various difficulties with differential calculus.</li>
<li>When Mary met George Boole she was eighteen years old and he was thirty-five.</li>
<li>In 1852 George Boole visited the Everest family home in Wickwar and at this time he became more formally her mathematics tutor.</li>
<li>On 15 June 1855 Mary's father died leaving her without means of support and George Boole proposed marriage.</li>
<li>It proved a very happy marriage with five daughters: Mary Ellen Boole born in 1856, Margaret Boole born in 1858, Alicia Boole (later Alicia Boole Stott) born in 1860, Lucy Everest Boole born in 1862, and Ethel Lilian Boole born in 1864.</li>
<li>George Boole died on 8 December 1864 with his daughter Ethel Lilian less than seven months old; she had been born on 11 May 1864.</li>
<li>Mary Boole was only 32 years old, having five young daughters and no means of support.</li>
<li>Mary Boole moved back to England where, thanks to Frederick Denison Maurice, she was offered the position as a librarian at Queen's College, London.</li>
<li>series of talks to a group of London mothers who, finding their religion threatened by Darwin's new theories, sought Mrs Boole's philosophic wisdom.</li>
<li>These talks, Mary used as the basis for her book The message of psychic science to mothers and nurses which she completed in 1868 but it was only published in 1883.</li>
<li>She then lived with her unmarried uncle Robert Everest in Sunninghill, Berkshire; she is there at the time of the 1871 census but at this time her children are not living with her since they remained in Harley Street, London.</li>
<li>Mary's occupation is given as "Teacher of Mathematics".</li>
<li>Mary Boole described Hinton as a 'thought-artist'.</li>
<li>Let us note that Mary Boole's daughter Mary Ellen Boole married James Hinton's son Charles Howard Hinton (1853-1907) in 1880.</li>
<li>Charles Howard Hinton was a mathematician who wrote "What is the Fourth Dimension?" but, after being convicted of bigamy Charles and Mary Ellen went to Japan and then to the United States.</li>
<li>At the 1881 census Mary Boole was living at 103 Seymour Place, Marylebone, London with her 22 year old daughter Margaret Boole whose occupation is described as "Art Student (Painting)".</li>
<li>Mary's occupation is given, at this time, as "Civil Service Pensioner".</li>
<li>At the 1891 census Mary Boole was visiting her mother who was living next door to Mary's brother George Everest, vicar of Teynham, Kent.</li>
<li>Mary was described as "living on her own means".</li>
<li>At the 1901 census Mary Boole was living at 16 Ladbroke Road, Notting Hill, Kensington, London.</li>
<li>Mary began teaching, women initially and then children.</li>
<li>We can think for ourselves, and find out what we want to know." Mary believed that it was possible to express all basic notions of the universe with numbers and symbols.</li>
<li>Let us now look briefly at some of Mary Boole's publications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 March 1832, Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England. Died 17 May 1916, Notting Hill, Kensington, England.</p>
