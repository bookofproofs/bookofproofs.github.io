<p><strong>Mary Everest Boole</strong> was an English mathematician who was married to George Boole. She wrote a number of books on mathematical education.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>For simplicity, we shall refer to her as Mary Boole throughout this biography.</li>
<li>Thomas Everest studied at Pembroke College, Cambridge and was ordained in 1826.</li>
<li>In 1837 an influenza epidemic swept through England leaving Thomas Everest as an invalid.</li>
<li>While in France, Mary Boole became bilingual in French and English.</li>
<li>Mary writes that Deplace was educated in the French school of mathematics.</li>
<li>"If only she could go to Cambridge and study mathematics she would carry everything before her," he said, "but what could a girl do learning mathematics." Mary was shocked to learn that she could not go to university, she could not study mathematics and she would never meet the famous Charles Babbage.</li>
<li>Mary Boole could not go to university but she could learn mathematics by teaching herself from books.</li>
<li>George Everest spent many hours with Mary, encouraging her and telling her about his experiences.</li>
<li>Indeed, their relationship evolved partly as a consequence of time they spent together devoted to Mary's private tuition, George proving particularly helpful to overcoming her various difficulties with differential calculus.</li>
<li>When Mary met George Boole she was eighteen years old and he was thirty-five.</li>
<li>Mary Boole moved back to England where, thanks to Frederick Denison Maurice, she was offered the position as a librarian at Queen's College, London.</li>
<li>Mary's occupation is given as "Teacher of Mathematics".</li>
<li>Mary Boole described Hinton as a 'thought-artist'.</li>
<li>Charles Howard Hinton was a mathematician who wrote "What is the Fourth Dimension?" but, after being convicted of bigamy Charles and Mary Ellen went to Japan and then to the United States.</li>
<li>Mary's occupation is given, at this time, as "Civil Service Pensioner".</li>
<li>Mary was described as "living on her own means".</li>
<li>At the 1901 census Mary Boole was living at 16 Ladbroke Road, Notting Hill, Kensington, London.</li>
<li>We can think for ourselves, and find out what we want to know." Mary believed that it was possible to express all basic notions of the universe with numbers and symbols.</li>
<li>Let us now look briefly at some of Mary Boole's publications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 March 1832, Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England. Died 17 May 1916, Notting Hill, Kensington, England.</p>
