<h1>Person: Morton, Vernon</h1>

<p><strong>Vernon Morton</strong> was an English mathematician who  was head of Pure Mathematics at Aberystwyth for many years.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>When Morton attended, the school included both a junior and a secondary school.</li>
<li>The headmaster during Morton's time at the school was James Harvey Hichens (1859-1938), who had an Oxford degree in chemistry, and he had done a remarkable job in raising the standards of the school with many pupils being successful in the Oxford and Cambridge Scholarship Examinations.</li>
<li>However, Morton never fully recovered from the gas attack and suffered the consequences for the rest of his life.</li>
<li>In 1920 Morton won a Junior Mathematical Scholarship and when he graduated in 1921 he won a Senior Mathematical Scholarship.</li>
<li>Dixon was particularly interested in applications of algebra to geometry and Morton was inspired by him to undertake research in this area.</li>
<li>While at Oxford, Morton advised his fellow student Mary Cartwright.</li>
<li>It was a painful decision, over which she agonised for some time, but Morton gave her very sensible advice.</li>
<li>After leaving Oxford, Morton was appointed as a lecturer at Brighton Technical College.</li>
<li>(This College was later named Brighton College of Technology and now is known as City College Brighton &amp; Hove.) Morton taught there for a year which, he later said, gave him very valuable teaching experience.</li>
<li>The reorganisation of the higher courses, and especially the establishment of a very desirable combined Honours course in Pure and Applied Mathematics, was carried out, thanks to the invaluable assistance afforded by Messrs V C Morton and W J Webber ...</li>
<li>Vernon and Olive Morton lived at Eryl Mor, Brynymor Road, Aberystwyth and they had one son, David Charles Morton.</li>
<li>Morton was promoted to Independent Lecturer and Head of the Pure Mathematics Department in 1926 and to Professor in 1933.</li>
<li>From these reports you can follow the progress of the Department of Pure Mathematics under Morton's leadership over a period of 25 years.</li>
<li>Morton's services in many capacities were frequently sought and highly valued by the University of Wales and by the College.</li>
<li>When he reached the age of 65, Morton retired from his chair at Aberystwyth in 1961.</li>
<li>We note that William Barry Pennington (1923- 1968) was appointed to fill Morton's chair at Aberystwyth when he retired in 1961.</li>
<li>Aberystwyth University now awards the V C Morton Prize for outstanding performance by any Mathematics undergraduate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 26 June 1896, Sheffield, England. Died 26 March 1978, Oxford, England.</p>
