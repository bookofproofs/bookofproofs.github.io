<h1>Person: Guccia, Giovanni Battista</h1>
<p><img alt="Guccia.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Guccia.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Giovanni Battista Guccia</strong> was an Italian mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Guccia began his studies at the university in Palermo but he later undertook research under Cremona in Rome.</li>
<li>While a student at Rome, Guccia attended the French Association for the Advancement of Science which was held at Rheims.</li>
<li>In 1880 Guccia submitted his doctoral dissertation on a class of surfaces representable point by point on a plane to the University of Rome and after successfully defending his thesis he returned to his native town of Palermo.</li>
<li>Guccia himself had four articles appear in the first volume of this publication, the first on Cremona transformations and a generalisation of a theorem due to Hirst, while the second was on a generalisation of a theorem due to Max Noether.</li>
<li>When Guccia's society passed a statute allowing foreign members in February 1888, it had rapidly reached its goal of becoming a top quality international society with a leading mathematical publication.</li>
<li>In 1889 Guccia was appointed to the chair of geometry at Palermo which he held for the rest of his life.</li>
<li>Guccia became editor of all these publications.</li>
<li>As we have indicated above, Guccia's work was on geometry, in particular Cremona transformations, classification of curves and projective properties of curves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 October 1855, Palermo, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (now Italy). Died 29 October 1914, Palermo, Italy.</p>
