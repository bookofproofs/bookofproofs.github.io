<p><strong>Aleksandr Kotelnikov</strong> was a Russian mathematician who worked on non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>This connection between Kotelnikov's father and Lobachevsky is important since the Lobachevsky connection was to play a large role in Kotelnikov's work throughout his life.</li>
<li>Kotelnikov was educated at the University of Kazan, graduating in 1884.</li>
<li>After this he taught at a gymnasium in Kazan before entering the Department of Mechanics at Kazan to work for his university teachers qualification.</li>
<li>The thesis he presented for the Master's Degree was The Cross-Product Calculus and Certain of its Applications in Geometry and Mechanics.</li>
<li>This thesis applied vector methods in theoretical mechanics, and he was to teach this vector approach to mechanics throughout his life.</li>
<li>Kotelnikov obtained his doctorate in 1899 for a thesis The Projective Theory of Vectors which generalised the vector calculus to the non-euclidean spaces of Lobachevsky and Riemann.</li>
<li>He also applied this to mechanics in non-euclidean spaces.</li>
<li>Much of his career is spent working on physics and non-euclidean geometry.</li>
<li>In 1899, the year he received his doctorate, he was appointed professor and Head of the Department of Pure Mathematics at the University of Kiev.</li>
<li>Perhaps it is worth pointing out that in many countries today a doctorate is a lower degree, essentially a degree of a level to start university teaching.</li>
<li>This was equivalent to the Master's Degree referred to here, where the doctorate was really the qualification necessary to become a professor.</li>
<li>In 1904 Kotelnikov left Kiev and returned to Kazan to become professor and Head of the Department of Pure Mathematics at the University.</li>
<li>After 10 years he went back to Kiev again, this time o become Head of Theoretical Mechanics at the Polytechnical Institute.</li>
<li>In 1927 he published one of his most important works, The Principle of Relativity and Lobachevsky's Geometry.</li>
<li>He also worked on quaternions and applied them to mechanics and geometry.</li>
<li>Among his other major pieces of work was to edit the Complete Works of two mathematicians, Lobachevsky and Zhukovsky.</li>
<li>He received many honours for his work, being named Honoured Scientist in 1934, then one year before he died he was awarded the State Prize of the USSR.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 20 October 1865, Kazan, Russia. Died 6 March 1944, Moscow, USSR.</p>
