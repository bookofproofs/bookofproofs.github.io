<p><strong>R Buckminster Fuller</strong> is best known for the invention of the geodesic dome.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fuller's family were from New England and he grew up with a boyhood fascination for ship-building and fishing which were part of life on the coast of Maine.</li>
<li>inherited that blend of romantic idealism and Yankee practicality which made him the spiritual heir to Benjamin Franklin and Emerson.</li>
<li>He married Anne Hewlett, daughter of a well-known architect, in 1917, and he served in the US Navy from 1917 to 1919.</li>
<li>Twice expelled from Harvard University, business disasters with the construction company in which he was a minority stockholder, and the death of his four year old daughter, brought him close to suicide.</li>
<li>technology could save the World from itself, providing it is properly used .</li>
<li>In 1927 he designed the Dynaxion House which was intended to house the technology needed for people to live.</li>
<li>With its wire construction it was in no way intended to be aesthetic but aimed to be a totally practical machine to live in.</li>
<li>For many years Fuller worked on ideas for buildings, eventually arriving at the structure for which he is most famous.</li>
<li>He examined a vectorial system of geometry, Energetic- Synergetic geometry, based on the tetrahedron which provides maximum strength with minimum structure.</li>
<li>Over 200,000 of such domes have been built, the most famous example being the United States pavilion at the 1967 international exhibition at Montreal.</li>
<li>Another of Fuller's projects, which he began in 1928, involved the design of a highly unconventional car.</li>
<li>It was called the Dymaxion car, a three wheeled machine capable of carrying 12 passengers, of crossing fields as well as having a top speed of nearly 200 km per hour.</li>
<li>With a manoeuvrability which allowed it to turn within its own length this was a remarkable conception and development continued until 1943.</li>
<li>However, it was never launched as a commercial venture.</li>
<li>Fuller was the author of many books, including Nine chains to the Moon (1938) which was his first book.</li>
<li>Later came No more second-hand God (1962), Utopia or oblivion (1969), and Education automation.</li>
<li>Most famous of all is his 1969 classic Operating manual for spaceship Earth but he also published Earth, Inc.</li>
<li>(1973), and Critical Path (1981).</li>
<li>A collection of his writings was published in 1970 as The Buckminster Fuller reader.</li>
<li>Fuller was research professor at Carbondale, Southern Illinois University, from 1959 to 1968.</li>
<li>He was appointed as Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University in 1962.</li>
<li>In 1968 he became a university professor at Southern Illinois University and retained this post until he retired in 1975.</li>
<li>Fuller was awarded many honours, including a fellowship of the Royal Institute of British Architects.</li>
<li>This Institute awarded him their Royal Gold Medal in 1968.</li>
<li>He also received the Gold Medal Award of the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1968.</li>
<li>it may be thought, however, that Fuller's greatest contribution lay in the field of education.</li>
<li>He was a compulsive talker and he canalized this trait into magical extempore lectures of extraordinary duration - often of up to a day or more with breaks for meals.</li>
<li>Through these he transmitted an enthusiasm for his ideas to generation after generation of students across the world.</li>
<li>He conceived of man as a passenger in a cosmic spaceship - a passenger whose only wealth consists in energy and information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 12 July 1895, Milton, Massachusetts, USA. Died 1 July 1983, Los Angeles, California, USA.</p>
