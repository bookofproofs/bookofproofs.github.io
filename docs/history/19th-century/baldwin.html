<p><strong>Frank Baldwin</strong> was an American who invented a pinwheel calculator.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Baldwin's life as an inventor began soon after he left Union College and, in 1855, he applied for a patent on a self-coupler for railway carriages.</li>
<li>Abraham Lincoln, the President, had asked volunteers to sign up for three months, and this is what Baldwin did.</li>
<li>At this stage Baldwin did not volunteer for further service, however, and he left Carlyle and returned to Fort Wayne, Indiana.</li>
<li>In 1869 Baldwin moved to St Louis to become the manager of the lumber firm Peck's Planning Mills.</li>
<li>Frank and Mary had met while Mary was visiting relatives in St Louis.</li>
<li>In the year following their marriage, they moved to Philadelphia where Baldwin rented a small shop and began to build his calculating machines.</li>
<li>Newcomb studied the operation of the calculator and highly complimented Baldwin on his invention.</li>
<li>The basic ideas of Baldwin's calculator were taken up by Willgodt Theophile Odhner from Sweden.</li>
<li>Very similar in design to the Baldwin machine and embodying the two distinctive features of Mr Baldwin's invention, the cam operated radial pins and the sliding wedge carrying mechanism.</li>
<li>Odhner interchanged the Baldwin static and moving parts, placing the numeral wheels in the carriage and the selector mechanism in the frame ...</li>
<li>Otherwise, the disposition of parts and operation are very similar to those of the Baldwin machine.</li>
<li>Baldwin did not entirely concentrate on calculating machines for he was granted a U.S. Patent for a Cement Mixer on 12 May 1891, and for a Roundabout on 7 June 1892.</li>
<li>However, he returned to further inventions relating to the calculator and he was awarded a U.S. Patent for the Baldwin Computing Engine on 9 January 1900.</li>
<li>Baldwin designed a listing machine in 1905 with only ten keys and a spacer.</li>
<li>After the award of a further Patent in 1908 for the Baldwin Recording Calculator, which combined the listing facilities of the 1905 machine with a calculator, he collaborated with Jay Randolph Monroe, of the Western Electric Company in New York City, from 1911 onwards.</li>
<li>Together they added a keyboard and modified Baldwin's Recording Calculator so that it was suitable for commercial production.</li>
<li>Monroe purchased the rights to the computer from Baldwin and began selling the calculator under the name Model G.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 10 April 1838, New Hartford, Connecticut, USA. Died 8 April 1925, Denville, New Jersey, USA.</p>
