<p><strong>George-Henri Halphen</strong> was a French mathematician who worked on the singularity theory of algebraic curves as well as invariant theory and projective differential geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Political events determined the course of the next few years for Halphen and work for his doctorate would have to wait until after the Franco-Prussian war.</li>
<li>Halphen served in the French army in the conflict.</li>
<li>Halphen, however, had served his country with great distinction.</li>
<li>Also in 1872 Halphen was appointed as répétiteur at the École Polytechnique and he was soon making major contributions.</li>
<li>Halphen showed that Chasles was essentially correct, but that restrictions on the kinds of singularity were necessary.</li>
<li>Halphen's solution was ingenious ...</li>
<li>Halphen took a different view on the problems of enumeration from his contemporaries.</li>
<li>In fact Halphen was well ahead of his time in the ideas which he brought to these problems.</li>
<li>Halphen and Schubert engaged in a heated debate on whether an enumerative formula should be allowed to count degenerate solutions along with the nondegenerate solutions.</li>
<li>Next Halphen classified singular points of algebraic closed curves thus extending the work of Riemann.</li>
<li>A characterisation of such invariant differential equations appeared in Halphen's doctoral dissertation On differential invariants which he presented in 1878.</li>
<li>Halphen made major contributions to linear differential equations and algebraic space curves.</li>
<li>This last result appeared in a paper Halphen published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society in 1878.</li>
<li>In 1884 Halphen was made an examinateur at the École Polytechnique, then two years later he was elected to the Académie des Sciences.</li>
<li>A major figure in his time, much of Halphen's work was in areas which have fallen out of favour.</li>
<li>Perhaps with its inevitable revival, analytic geometry will restore Halphen to the eminence he earned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 30 October 1844, Rouen, France. Died 23 May 1889, Versailles, France.</p>
