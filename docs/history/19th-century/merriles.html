<h1>Person: Merriles, Alexander Johnson</h1>

<p><strong>Alexander Merriles</strong> graduated from Edinburgh University and afterwards taught at Edinburgh Provincial Training College and George Watson's Ladies' College in Edinburgh.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alexander Merriles attended North Berwick Public School from 1890 to 1895, and then North Berwick High School from 1895 to 1899 where he was a pupil-teacher.</li>
<li>At Edinburgh University, among the courses Merriles took at Ordinary level were Latin, Education, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and English.</li>
<li>During his period as an undergraduate at Edinburgh University, Merriles also taught arithmetic and mathematics at Moray House Practising School, both Elementary and Upper, between May 1902 and October 1904.</li>
<li>After graduating Merriles taught mathematics and science at the Edinburgh Provincial Training College from April 1905 to September 1919.</li>
<li>For a feeling almost akin to dismay passed through the school when it was announced at the end of last session that Mr Merriles had ended his long period of service - more than twenty-five years - as principal teacher of Mathematics in George Square.</li>
<li>It was a school in which Scotland produced many champions, and Mr Merriles himself was just short of the championship class, though latterly he never handled a club; just as he - a connoisseur in tobacco - entirely gave up smoking.</li>
<li>Here, as ever, it was the man that counted, and no one who came in contact with Mr Merriles was ever long in doubt that here was a man of sterling character, a warm and true friend, a wise counsellor, and a brilliant scholar.</li>
<li>Merriles joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in June 1905, the year in which he graduated from Edinburgh University.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 October 1880, North Berwick, Scotland. Died 1950, Anstruther, Fife, Scotland.</p>
