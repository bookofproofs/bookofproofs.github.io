<p><strong>John Hopkinson</strong> was an English mathematician and engineer who applied mathematics to electricity.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>John junior, the subject of this biography, was the eldest of a family of five children.</li>
<li>After showing great abilities in mathematics, Hopkinson was awarded a scholarship to allow him to continue his study of that subject at Trinity College, Cambridge.</li>
<li>Although he had been awarded a Whitworth scholarship which would have allowed him to continue his mathematical studies at Cambridge, Hopkinson decided to put his mathematics to practical use in engineering.</li>
<li>There had been no chair of engineering at Owens College when Hopkinson studied there, but it is interesting to note that Osborne Reynolds was appointed to such a chair while Hopkinson was studying at Cambridge.</li>
<li>In 1872 Hopkinson was appointed as the engineering manager of Chance Brothers and Company, a glass manufacturing company in Birmingham.</li>
<li>In 1878 Hopkinson founded his own electrical engineering company.</li>
<li>Collaborating with Edward Hopkinson, one of his brothers, he applied the theory of electricity and magnetism to the development of electric motors.</li>
<li>Hopkinson was appointed professor of electrical engineering at King's College, London, in 1890.</li>
<li>When at the height of his powers Hopkinson was killed in a mountaineering accident while on holiday in Switzerland.</li>
<li>Although Hopkinson's life was cut short by the accident, he had already received several honours for his contributions of applying mathematics to engineering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 27 July 1849, Manchester, England. Died 27 August 1898, Evalona, Val d'Herens, Switzerland.</p>
