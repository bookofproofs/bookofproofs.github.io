<p><strong>Oliver Heaviside</strong> proved important results in electromagnetism and vector calculus. He reduced Maxwell's 20 equations in 20 variables to 4 equations in 2 variables.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Oliver, the youngest of his parents four sons, was born at 55 King Street in Camden Town.</li>
<li>Academic subjects seemed to hold little attraction for Heaviside however and at age 16 he left school.</li>
<li>In 1868 Heaviside went to Denmark and became a telegrapher.</li>
<li>Heaviside became increasingly deaf but he worked on his own researches into electricity.</li>
<li>Maxwell's treatise fascinated Heaviside and he gave up his job as a telegrapher and devoted his time to the study of the work.</li>
<li>Although his interest and understanding of this work was deep, Heaviside was not interested in rigour.</li>
<li>Despite this hatred of rigour, Heaviside was able to greatly simplify Maxwell's 20 equations in 20 variables, replacing them by four equations in two variables.</li>
<li>Today we call these 'Maxwell's equations' forgetting that they are in fact 'Heaviside's equations'.</li>
<li>Oliver Heaviside has cleared these away, has opened up a direct route, has made a broad road, and has explored a considerable trace of country.</li>
<li>Heaviside results on electromagnetism, impressive as they were, were overshadowed by the important methods in vector analysis which he developed in his investigations.</li>
<li>Although highly successful in obtaining the answer, the correctness of Heaviside's calculus was not proved until Bromwich's work.</li>
<li>Tait championed quaternions against the vector methods of Heaviside and Gibbs and sent frequent letters to Nature attacking Heaviside's methods.</li>
<li>Heaviside went on to achieved further advances in knowledge, again receiving less than his just deserts.</li>
<li>His paper is in error and Heaviside pointed this out in Electromagnetic induction and its propagation published in the Electrician on 3 June 1887.</li>
<li>In this paper Heaviside gave, for the first time, the conditions necessary to transmit a signal without distortion.</li>
<li>Heaviside dropped the idea but it was patented in 1904 in the United States.</li>
<li>Michael Pupin of Columbia University and George Campbell of ATT both read Heaviside's papers about using induction coils at intervals along the telephone line.</li>
<li>Not all went badly for Heaviside however.</li>
<li>Thomson, giving his inaugural address in 1889 as President of the Institute of Electrical Engineers, described Heaviside as an authority.</li>
<li>Heaviside was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1891, perhaps the greatest honour he received.</li>
<li>Whittaker rated Heaviside's operational calculus as one of the three most important discoveries of the late 19th  Century.</li>
<li>In 1902 Heaviside predicted that there was an conducting layer in the atmosphere which allowed radio waves to follow the Earth's curvature.</li>
<li>This layer in the atmosphere, the Heaviside layer, is named after him.</li>
<li>It would be a mistake to think that the honours that Heaviside received gave him happiness in the last part of his life.</li>
<li>In 1909 Heaviside moved to Torquay where he showed increasing evidence of a persecution complex.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 May 1850, Camden Town, London, England. Died 3 February 1925, Torquay, Devon, England.</p>
