<p><strong>Woolsey Johnson</strong> was an American text-book writer and one of the founders of the New York Mathematical Society.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Charles Johnson was a gentleman farmer in Tioga County, the son of Robert Charles Johnson (1766-1806) and Catherine Anne Bayard (1770-1806).</li>
<li>Sarah Woolsey  was the daughter of William Walton Woolsey (1766-1839), a New York merchant who imported sugar, cotton and hardware, and Elizabeth Dwight (1772-1813).</li>
<li>Sarah had an older brother, Theodore Dwight Woolsey (1801-1889), who was the President of Yale College from 1846 to 1871.</li>
<li>Charles and Sarah Johnson were married on 23 April 1835.</li>
<li>Charles Johnson had graduated from Union College in 1823 and then attended the Litchfield Law School.</li>
<li>Charles and Sarah Johnson had six children: Charles Frederick Johnson was born on 8 May 1836, graduated B.A. from Yale in 1855, became a Civil Engineer and was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1866; Susan Johnson was born on 28 December 1838 but only lived for five months; Anna Muirson Johnson was born in 1840 and married William Bellamy from Boston, Massachusetts, in 1876; William Woolsey Johnson, the subject of this biography, was born in 1841; Catherine Livingston Bayard Johnson was born in 1845; and Nicholas Bayard Johnson was born in 1849 (died young).</li>
<li>The Johnson family were well-off and they had their son Woolsey (as he liked to be known) tutored privately to prepare him for College.</li>
<li>This College was renamed Yale University in 1864, two years after Johnson graduated with a B.A. He was awarded first prize in mathematics in his first year of study and continued to excel winning the prize for mathematical solutions in his second year.</li>
<li>During his four years at Yale College, Johnson wrote letters to his parents, his sister Katherine, and his brother Charles.</li>
<li>After Johnson graduated, in 1862 he was appointed as an assistant in the Nautical Almanac office in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</li>
<li>Johnson married Susannah Leverett Batcheller (1850-1916) on 12 August 1869, in Annapolis.</li>
<li>Woolsey and Susannah Johnson had two children: Charles William Leverett Johnson, born at Gambier, Ohio, 12 August 1870; and Theodore Woolsey Johnson, born at Owego, 4 June 1872.</li>
<li>In the year that Johnson married, 1869, he published the first of a number of textbooks, An Elementary Treatise on Analytical Geometry, embracing Plane Coordinate Geometry and an Introduction to Geometry of Three Dimensions.</li>
<li>In 1870 Johnson moved to Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio.</li>
<li>Johnson and his wife were already living in Gambier when their first child was born in August 1870.</li>
<li>It had reopened in 1866, six years before Johnson took up his position there.</li>
<li>Johnson began to collaborate with John Minot Rice, a professor of mathematics in the United States Navy and, in 1874, they produced the First Part of their work An Elementary Treatise on the Differential Calculus founded on the Method of Rates or Fluxions.</li>
<li>Clearly with Johnson in Annapolis where he had previously worked with the U.S. Naval Academy, he could continue to keep his links with the Academy despite teaching at St John's College.</li>
<li>The whole Johnson family went with him to Cambridge where to took a house for the year.</li>
<li>We promised above to give some more details of Johnson's sons.</li>
<li>Charles William Leverett Johnson (1870-1954) was awarded a B.A. from Johns Hopkins University in 1891 and then continued to study there for a Ph.D. He was awarded his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins in 1896 for his thesis Musical Pitch and the Measurement of Intervals Among the Ancient Greeks.</li>
<li>In fact Charles Johnson became an Instructor in Greek at Yale University publishing his thesis and the book The motion of the voice: In the theory of ancient music (1899).</li>
<li>Johnson's younger son, Theodore Woolsey Johnson (1872-1953), was as he said in the above quote, more in his own line.</li>
<li>Johnson was one of the founders of New York Mathematical Society in 1888.</li>
<li>The New York Mathematical Society became the American Mathematical Society in 1894 and Johnson served on the AMS Council.</li>
<li>Let us say a little more about Johnson's mathematics.</li>
<li>The reader will see from these Prefaces that Johnson's approach was somewhat old-fashioned for the time in which he wrote but, of course, we must remember that basically he was writing to teach mathematics to U.S. Navy cadets.</li>
<li>We must not be understood as implying that Professor Johnson's book may not be of considerable utility.</li>
<li>Professor Johnson is professor of mathematics at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, and it may be that some will trace in the book methods which are said to be characteristic of the United States Army and Navy mathematics; but it must be said that the plan pursued is likely to lead to a clearer understanding by the student.</li>
<li>The object is to give a knowledge of the subject, so far as it is likely to have practical application; and in this it is safe to say that Professor Johnson has succeeded.</li>
<li>When The Analyst ceased publication and was replaced by the Annals of Mathematics, Johnson continued to publish there with papers such as: James Glaisher's factor tables and the distribution of primes (1884); The kinematical method of tangents (1885); On Singular Solutions of Differential Equations of the First Order (1887); On singular solutions of differential equations of the first order (1887); On the differential equation (1887); On Monge's solution of the non-integrable equation between three variables (1888); and On Gauss's method of substitution (1892).</li>
<li>Johnson also published in the American Journal of Mathematics.</li>
<li>His 1879 paper with William Story Notes on the "15" Puzzle is in two parts, the first by Johnson shows that the 15 puzzle is impossible using the odd/even permutation argument.</li>
<li>Another of Johnson's papers in this journal is The Strophoids (1880).</li>
<li>Johnson also published several papers in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>In 1913 Johnson was given a commissioned rank in the Navy, by a special act of Congress, and when he retired in 1921 he had the rank of Commodore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 June 1841, Owego, Tioga County, New York,USA. Died 14 May 1927, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.</p>
