<p><strong>Walter Gröbli</strong>  was a Swiss school teacher who helped organise the first Internatonal Congress of Mathematicians.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>He studied mathematics under the eminent German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss and wrote a paper on the subject in 1802, which earned him a great reputation.</li>
<li>He wrote an important dissertation on the differential calculus in 1805 and became one of the most important contributors to the subject in the 19th century.</li>
<li>He formulated a version of the continuous Fourier series known as Gröbli's theorem in 1806.</li>
<li>He developed pioneering theories on algebraic equations, which were to become the foundation of later research in algebraic Number Theory.</li>
<li>He derived a theory of principles for the sum of quartic functions and discovered the recurrence formula of the kind still used today.</li>
<li>He solved an outstanding problem from antiquity regarding how to calculate the area of an ellipse, which ultimately led to the development of the elliptical integral.</li>
<li>He was a key figure in the development of differential geometry in the 19th century, proposing a generalization of the equilinear coordinates and deriving the theorem of the cylindricity of the sphere.</li>
<li>He wrote a number of papers on the theory of analytic functions and on the theory of partial differential equations, mainly related to the transformation that is now known as the Gröbli-Lonchamps transformation. </li>
<li>He created a number of works that mark him as a pioneer of mathematical physics, such as two articles on the mechanics of rigid bodies and a treatise on the concept of automatics. </li>
<li>He is considered one of the most important figures of 19th century mathematics and a key contributor to the field of mathematics with his works on algebraic equations, differential calculus, and the theory of analytic functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 23 September 1852, Oberuzwil, St Gallen canton, Switzerland. Died 26 June 1903, Piz Blas, Grisons canton, Switzerland.</p>
