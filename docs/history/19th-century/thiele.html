<p><strong>Thorvald Thiele</strong>  was a Danish mathematician and astronomer. He worked in statistics, interpolation and the three-body problem.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thorvald Thiele's name requires an explanation.</li>
<li>He was named after Bertel Thorvaldsen, a sculptor who was the first internationally acclaimed Danish artist.</li>
<li>Thorvaldsen was born in around 1770 so was 68 years old when Thiele was born.</li>
<li>As a friend of the family, Thorvaldsen became one of Thiele's godfathers and his parents gave their son the name Thorvald after his famous godfather.</li>
<li>From this account we already see that Thorvald's father had friends among the leading artists in Denmark.</li>
<li>Thiele studied astronomy at the University of Copenhagen and from there he obtained his Master's Degree in 1860.</li>
<li>In the year following the award of his doctorate, Thiele married Marie Martine Trolle.</li>
<li>Thiele's wife died in 1889 at the age of 48.</li>
<li>In 1875 Thiele was appointed as Director of the Astronomical Observatory at the University of Copenhagen, a post which he held until he retired in 1907.</li>
<li>As Director of the Astronomical Observatory Thiele had an interest in astronomy.</li>
<li>In 1895 Thiele showed that singularities in the motion of such a system could often be removed by a suitable transformation allowing the motion of bodies after a collision to be studied.</li>
<li>Although, as we have said, this differential equation is Thiele's most significant contribution to actuarial science, he never published the result.</li>
<li>We know of it through J P Gram who was shown the result by Thiele.</li>
<li>Thiele emphasised that old age is the destiny of us all, as opposed to disability or premature death, which is a random phenomenon.</li>
<li>Thiele's importance as a theoretician lies therefore more in the original ideas he stated than his formulations, and his ideas were in many respects not only original but far ahead of his time.</li>
<li>As a final comment, we note that Thiele was an excellent chess player and an active member of the first Danish chess club founded in 1865.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 December 1838, Copenhagen, Denmark. Died 26 September 1910, Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
