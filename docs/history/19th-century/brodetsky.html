<h1>Person: Brodetsky, Selig</h1>

<p><strong>Selig Brodetsky</strong> was educated at Cambridge and Leipzig. He became a lecturer at Bristol and later lecturer and professor at Leeds. He worked on fluid flow with particular emphasis on aerodynamics. He was President of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem for a short time.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 1894, when Selig was old enough to begin school, he attended the Jew's Free School in Whitechapel, London.</li>
<li>Brodetsky achieved a very fine record at Cambridge.</li>
<li>In 1910 Brodetsky was awarded the Isaac Newton Scholarship which enabled him to study at Leipzig for his doctorate.</li>
<li>The University of Leipzig awarded Brodetsky a doctorate in 1913 for a thesis on gravitation and he returned to England in 1914 where he accepted a lectureship in Applied Mathematics at the University of Bristol.</li>
<li>In 1919 Brodetsky accepted a position as a lecturer at the University of Leeds and he was made a Reader in 1920.</li>
<li>Brodetsky's work was mainly on aerodynamics and fluid mechanics.</li>
<li>The 5th  International Congress for Applied Mechanics was held at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1938 and Brodetsky delivered a paper on the equations of motion of an airplane.</li>
<li>We list the chapter and section headings of this paper to give an indication of the approach Brodetsky took.</li>
<li>Lecturing seems to have been one of Brodetsky's real strengths.</li>
<li>However, it is not only for his contributions to mathematics that Brodetsky is well known.</li>
<li>W P Milne was Head of Mathematics at Leeds until he retired in 1946 when Brodetsky took on the role.</li>
<li>This, however, proved much more difficult than Brodetsky expected.</li>
<li>Brodetsky was effective in reforming the Hebrew University but at considerable cost in terms of arguments and disputes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 10 February 1888, Olviopol (near Odessa), Ukraine. Died 18 May 1954, London, England.</p>
