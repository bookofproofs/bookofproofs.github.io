<p><strong>Eustachy Żyliński</strong> was a Ukranian mathematician dealing with number theory, algebra, logic and the basics of mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>He was the only child of Janusz Mikolaj Żyliński (known as Jan) and Kazimiera Zmudzinskich.</li>
<li>When he was ten years old, Eustachy entered the First Gymnasium in Kiev where he studied for the next ten years.</li>
<li>In his memoirs, Grave acknowledges Żyliński's help with this first edition of his book.</li>
<li>In 1912 Żyliński was awarded a 4-year scholarship to fund his studies abroad so that he could undertake research with the aim of becoming a professor of mathematics.</li>
<li>In addition to his foreign visits, Żyliński participated in Grave's seminar in Kiev during the period 1912-1916.</li>
<li>Żyliński's military service ended in November 1917 and, shortly afterwards, he was appointed as an assistant professor of mathematics at the Polish College of the University of Kiev.</li>
<li>Żyliński took up his appointment as associate professor of mathematics at the University of Lwów on 1 October, having been released from the army in the previous month at the request of the University of Lwów.</li>
<li>Żyliński became a colleague of Hugo Steinhaus and soon they were joined in Lwów by Stefan Banach who was an assistant at the Lwów Technical University from 1920.</li>
<li>On 27 July of that year Żyliński was appointed as a full professor of mathematics at the Jan Kazimierz University.</li>
<li>Eustachy and Kazimiera had two children, a daughter Maria (1926-1990) and a son Janusz (1931-).</li>
<li>It was very loosely connected to the course in theoretical arithmetic and it was under the nominal supervision of Żyliński.</li>
<li>Żyliński was called up as an army reservist in the summer of 1939 and at that time his wife, together with their children, left Lwów and went to live in her home town of Szczytniki; they did not return to Lwów until 1943.</li>
<li>Żyliński was in Lwów when the Soviets attacked in September 1939.</li>
<li>Żyliński worked as a statistician in the transport office during the German occupation but, although the Jan Kazimierz University of Lwów was officially closed, secret teaching was organised by a number of the former staff.</li>
<li>Władysław Orlicz and Żyliński were the main mathematics teachers at this underground university.</li>
<li>In August 1944, the Soviets took control of Lwów again and, at this time, they opened the State University of Lwów with Żyliński as head of the Department of Algebra and Number Theory.</li>
<li>In August 1945 it was announced that Lwów would become part of the USSR and Żyliński, together with Stanisław Mazur who was also teaching in Lwów, signed up for voluntary repatriation to Poland.</li>
<li>In May 1946 Żyliński, together with his wife and children, left Lwów and travelled to Łódź.</li>
<li>From 1 October 1946 until he retired on 30 September 1951 Żyliński was a professor and head of the Department of Mathematics, Engineering and Construction at the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice.</li>
<li>He later became an assistant at the university and a colleague of Żyliński.</li>
<li>He was much influenced by Żyliński's courses on Analytical Geometry, assisting in their teaching, and published Analytic Geometry with Particular Regard to the Textbook of Eustachy Żyliński in 1951.</li>
<li>Finally let us note Żyliński's interests outside mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 September 1889, Kuna, near Haisyn, Russian Empire (now Ukraine). Died 4 July 1954, Łódź, Poland.</p>
