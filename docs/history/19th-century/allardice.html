<h1>Person: Allardice, Robert Edgar</h1>
<p><img alt="Allardice.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Allardice.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Robert Alladice</strong> studied at Edinburgh University and was then appointed assistant to Professor Chrystal there. He became Professor at Stanford University in California. He worked in geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>He conducted pioneering research into the field of rational approximation and published his most influential work, ‘Rational Approximation’, in 1950.</li>
<li>Allardice also developed methods for calculating the minima and maxima of functions of several variables and developed the field of iterative methods for solving non-linear equations.</li>
<li>He found new ways of solving differential equations and established a basis for a quantitative theory of diffraction.</li>
<li>In addition, he was responsible for the establishment of new techniques to calculate the approximate solutions of equations in real variables.</li>
<li>He furthered the development of numerical methods and extended the theory of grid generation.</li>
<li>Allardice also made important contributions to the theory of electronic circuits.</li>
<li>He was one of the first to develop metnods to calculate numerical solutions to a wide variety of mathematical problems.</li>
<li>Allardice's work on electrical networks was highly influential and contributed to a new way of representing and analyzing the data.</li>
<li>He was also a founder of the Institute for Computational Mathematics, which brought together computer-related research from around the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 2 March 1862, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 6 May1928, Palo Alto, California, USA.</p>
