<p><strong>Henry Forder</strong> was a New Zealand mathematician who worked in geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Henry was the eldest of his parent's six children, having three brothers and two sisters.</li>
<li>Henry Forder Sr. bought the village blacksmith's business in Worstead, Norfolk, and the family moved there when Henry was young.</li>
<li>In fact Henry Forder Sr. loved books and his son Henry, the subject of this biography, read avidly as a child, continuing this throughout his life.</li>
<li>Henry was fortunate in several ways which enabled him to obtain a first class education.</li>
<li>Firstly the headmaster of the local Worstead church school which he attended realised that Henry was an exceptionally gifted boy and gave him special tuition.</li>
<li>We know a lot about Paston Grammar School since the Venerable Archdeacon Charles R Forder, who was Henry's youngest brother, wrote a history of the school.</li>
<li>Henry, together with another pupil, founded the school debating society in 1907 and Henry took part in debates on topics such as conscription, female suffrage, the House of Lords and the justifiability of Mary Queen of Scots' execution.</li>
<li>He also won many prizes from the school and he chose himself the books Lay Sermons by Thomas Henry Huxley, The Essays of Elia by Charles Lamb, Poems by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Poems by John Milton, Vanity Fair by William Makepeace Thackeray, and Oliver Cromwell by John Morley.</li>
<li>Forder matriculated at Sidney Sussex College on 2 October 1907.</li>
<li>In 1921, while Forder was teaching at Hymers' College, he married his cousin Dorothy Whincup of Bingham, Nottinghamshire; they had no children.</li>
<li>By 1933 Forder had become somewhat dissatisfied with teaching so when he was invited to apply for the Chair of Mathematics at Auckland University College in New Zealand he put in an application.</li>
<li>Forder spent the rest of his career in the Chair of Mathematics at Auckland.</li>
<li>It is the books that Forder wrote which have given him a high reputation in the mathematical world.</li>
<li>The Calculus of Extension (1941) is in many ways the most interesting of all Forder's books.</li>
<li>Of course Forder's love of language was closely related to his love of books which we have mentioned already.</li>
<li>Indeed, Forder was renowned as a wit and conversationist.</li>
<li>Finally let us record some of the honours which Forder received.</li>
<li>The Mathematical Chronicle published a H G Forder 90th  birthday volume in 1980.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 27 September 1889, Shotesham All Saints, near Norwich, England. Died 21 September 1981, Selwyn Village, Port Chevalier, Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
