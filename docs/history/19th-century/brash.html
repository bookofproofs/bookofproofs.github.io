<p><strong>William Brash</strong> graduated from Edinburgh University and went on to teaching posts at Stirling, Aberdeen and Inverness.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>William was living at Dickson's Building, West Calder in 1891 and by 1901 had moved to 12 Society Place, West Calder.</li>
<li>To prepare for his university studies, Brash then went to George Watson's Boys' College, Edinburgh, when he spent two years.</li>
<li>In July 1905 Brash won the Medal for Mathematics from George Watson's and in October of the same year he first matriculated at the University of Edinburgh.</li>
<li>Not only did Brash win bursaries at George Watson's, but he also won a Edinburgh University bursary.</li>
<li>At University, Brash studied Mathematics, Natural Philosophy and Latin in session 1905-06.</li>
<li>The mathematics course was taught by Charles Tweedie and Brash obtained a First Class pass.</li>
<li>Brash returned to West Calder after studying in Edinburgh, then in 1915 he moved to Stirling when he was appointed to Stirling High School.</li>
<li>As many Edinburgh mathematics graduates did, Brash joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society after graduating.</li>
<li>In Brash's case he joined in December 1912 although while his application for membership was being processed he had read a paper to the Society entitled Two general results in the differential calculus at the meeting on Friday 14 June 1912.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 April 1888, West Calder, Scotland. Died 25 February 1962, Dunfermline, Scotland.</p>
