<p><strong>Joseph-Émile Barbier</strong> was a French astronomer and mathematician.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Barbier began his studies at the École Normale Supérieure in 1857 and there he impressed everyone with his deep understanding of mathematics.</li>
<li>Having received his licentiate Barbier proceeded toward his "agregation".</li>
<li>An appointment in Nice might have been attractive but Barbier's keen mind and the subtlety which he saw in even elementary mathematics did not make him a good teacher since the pupils in the Lycée in Nice failed to gain anything from Barbier.</li>
<li>He was offered a post at the Paris Observatory by Le Verrier and Barbier left Nice to begin work as an assistant astronomer.</li>
<li>As time went by, however, Barbier's behaviour became more and more peculiar.</li>
<li>Bertrand discovered that although Barbier was clearly unstable mentally, he was still able to make superb original contributions to mathematics.</li>
<li>He encouraged Barbier to return to scientific writing and, although he never recovered his sanity, he wrote many excellent and original mathematical papers.</li>
<li>Bertrand, as Secretary to the Académie des Sciences, was able to find a small source of income for Barbier from a foundation which was associated with the Académie.</li>
<li>Barbier, although mentally unstable, was a gentle person and it was seen that, with his small income, it was possible for him to live in the community.</li>
<li>This was arranged and Barbier spent his last few years in much more pleasant surroundings.</li>
<li>Barbier's early work, while at the Observatory, consists of over twenty memoirs and reports.</li>
<li>We mentioned above his work with devising a new type of thermometer and Barbier wrote on this as well as on other aspects of instruments.</li>
<li>After he was encouraged to undertake research in mathematics again by Bertrand, Barbier wrote over ten articles between the years 1882 and 1887.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 March 1839, St Hilaire-Cottes, Pas-de-Calais, France. Died 28 January 1889, St Genest, Loire, France.</p>
