<h1>Person: Hotelling, Harold</h1>

<p><strong>Harold Hotelling</strong> was an American mathematical statistician who wrote important papers on economics as well as on statistics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Now the year Harold was born marks the beginning of automobile production in the United States and soon it became clear that automobiles were going to replace horses as a means of transport.</li>
<li>The young Hotelling was an avid reader, making great use of the Seattle Public Library.</li>
<li>Following the award of his doctorate, Hotelling was appointed as a junior associate at the Food Research Institute attached to Stanford University.</li>
<li>The year 1931 was significant for Hotelling in another way for, in that year, he left Stanford University to take up a professorship in the Economics Department of Columbia University.</li>
<li>Hotelling then met Susanna Porter Edmonson who was a student in a statistics course he was teaching.</li>
<li>Hotelling was passionately against all that Hitler stood for and strongly argued for the United States to enter the war long before the country did.</li>
<li>Hotelling pressed Columbia University to set up an independent department of statistics with its own permanent staff.</li>
<li>Hotelling received an offer from the University of North Carolina to start a statistics programme there.</li>
<li>Hotelling, therefore, left Columbia in 1946 to start up a Department of Mathematical Statistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</li>
<li>Hotelling drew together a group of statisticians at the Institute, a list of whom reads like a role call of honour.</li>
<li>In creating a world centre of excellence in mathematical statistical research Hotelling surely had no equal.</li>
<li>Now Hotelling wrote, as we have already indicated, important papers on economics as well as on statistics.</li>
<li>Finally, we should also examine Hotelling's ideas on teaching mathematics and statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 September 1895, Fulda, Minnesota, USA. Died 26 December 1973, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.</p>
