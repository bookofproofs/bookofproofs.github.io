<h1>Person: Sokolov, Yurii Dmitrievich</h1>

<p><strong>Yurii Dmitrievich Sokolov</strong> was a Russian mathematician who worked on the <em>n</em>-body problem.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>He supervised Sokolov's research in the area of mechanics of particles and this was the topic of his doctorate which in many ways followed on from Grave's Master's thesis.</li>
<li>Sokolov's first publication appeared in 1923.</li>
<li>From 1934 Sokolov taught at the Institute of Mathematics at the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.</li>
<li>Sokolov's main work was on the nnn-body problem, which he worked on for nearly 50 years and he summarised his contributions in the book Singular trajectories of a system of free material points (Russian) which was published in 1951.</li>
<li>Sokolov also published on celestial mechanics and hydromechanics.</li>
<li>One of the topics which will always be associated with Sokolov's name is his method for finding approximate solutions to differential and integral equations.</li>
<li>The method which he introduced is now sometimes called 'the averaging method with functional corrections' or sometimes called 'the Sokolov method'.</li>
<li>E L Albasiny, reviewing Sokolov's textbook, first formally describes the approximations from averaging of functional corrections.</li>
<li>The first part of Sokolov's book discusses applications of his method to problems which can be modelled by linear integral equations with constant limits.</li>
<li>In the final part Sokolov examines applications of his method to integral equations of mixed type, then in a number of appendices he presents some generalisations of the method.</li>
<li>Sokolov died only a few months before his 75th  birthday and only a few months short of completing 50 years of scientific work in the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 26 May 1896, Labinskaya Stanitsa (now Labinsk), Russia. Died 2 February 1971, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine).</p>
