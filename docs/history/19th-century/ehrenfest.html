<p><strong>Paul Ehrenfest</strong> was an Austrian mathematician who made important contributions to statistical mechanics and  quantum mechanics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Johanna Ehrenfest worked long hours in their shop and Paul was looked after at home by a nursemaid.</li>
<li>By the time he was six years old Paul could read, write and count.</li>
<li>In 1890 Paul began his secondary education at the Akademisches Gymnasium.</li>
<li>Ehrenfest became a student at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna in October 1899.</li>
<li>Ehrenfest attended Boltzmann's lectures on the mechanical theory of heat during 1899-1900.</li>
<li>In 1901 Ehrenfest moved to Göttingen where he studied under Klein and Hilbert.</li>
<li>While attending courses by Klein and Hilbert, Ehrenfest saw a young Russian student of mathematics Tatyana Alexeyevna Afnassjewa.</li>
<li>Ehrenfest challenged this rule and, after quite a battle, was able to get the rule changed.</li>
<li>Ehrenfest returned to Vienna after spending eighteen months in Göttingen.</li>
<li>It was considered a good piece of work but Ehrenfest himself never rated it very highly and chose not to publish it after receiving his doctorate on 23 June 1904.</li>
<li>In 1905 Ehrenfest published a paper on Planck's theory of black-body radiation.</li>
<li>shows Ehrenfest's real interests and particular talents and the beginning of his personal style.</li>
<li>Ehrenfest took on the task of writing his obituary.</li>
<li>Klein, Hilbert, Minkowski and Carathéodory were all working in Göttingen at this time and it was an important period for Ehrenfest's research.</li>
<li>The two Ehrenfests began working on the article which would not appear in print until 1911.</li>
<li>In 1907 Ehrenfest went to St Petersburg.</li>
<li>Certainly Ehrenfest had mixed feelings about his own country given the anti-Semitic attitudes he had encountered.</li>
<li>The Ehrenfests spent five years in St Petersburg.</li>
<li>It was a time when Ehrenfest was deeply engrossed in research problems.</li>
<li>He corresponded with Klein who told him that what was required was a survey, not a complete solution of all the problems of the subject by Ehrenfest himself.</li>
<li>In the hope that this might lead to an academic post Ehrenfest, despite holding a doctorate, took the degree of Master of Physics at St Petersburg.</li>
<li>An important paper was published by Ehrenfest in 1911 in Annalen der Physik on the essential features of quantum theory.</li>
<li>In January 1912 Ehrenfest set out on a tour of universities in the German speaking world in the hope of a position.</li>
<li>Poincaré had not known of Ehrenfest's contribution and therefore had not referred to his work.</li>
<li>Ehrenfest returned to St Petersburg saddened that Poincaré's paper had been published before he could point out his own contribution to him -- he was paying the price for being isolated from mainstream research in St Petersburg.</li>
<li>On 29 September 1912 Ehrenfest received a telegram saying that he had been named professor at Leiden.</li>
<li>In 1917 and 1920 Ehrenfest published papers investigating the problem of the extent to which the three-dimensional nature of physical space is determined by the structure of basic physical equations or is reflected in these basic equations.</li>
<li>Ehrenfest's arguments were based both on Newton's celestial mechanics and also on Einstein's relativity theory.</li>
<li>Among Ehrenfest's contributions to quantum statistics was an understanding of the nature of photons, and their properties which were implied by Planck's radiation law.</li>
<li>The modern theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics brings together the molecular, collisional ideas of Boltzmann with the statistical ideas of Ehrenfest's to give a nonlinear, statistical theory.</li>
<li>In 1933 Ehrenfest presented a classification of phase transitions based on the discontinuity in derivatives of the free energy function.</li>
<li>Uhlenbeck was a student of Ehrenfest who began research for his Master's degree in 1920.</li>
<li>Niels Bohr and Ehrenfest began to correspond in 1918.</li>
<li>Their exchanges ranged over heaven and earth as Ehrenfest showed his new friend the treasures of the Dutch museums and the brilliant colours of the bulb fields.</li>
<li>Ehrenfest presented Bohr's results to the third Solvay conference in 1921.</li>
<li>Later in 1921 Bohr invited Ehrenfest to Copenhagen.</li>
<li>Ehrenfest was unhappy at the disagreement between Bohr and Einstein over quantum theory.</li>
<li>They did not and Ehrenfest was very unhappy that he was forced to take sides with one of his two close friends.</li>
<li>All through his life Ehrenfest had suffered from low self esteem, which was in marked contrast to the high esteem in which he was held by his fellow scientists.</li>
<li>Ehrenfest shot Wassik in the waiting room of the Professor Watering Institute in Amsterdam where Wassik was being treated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 January 1880, Vienna, Austria. Died 25 September 1933, Leiden, Netherlands.</p>
