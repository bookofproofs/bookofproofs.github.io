<p><strong>Edward Huntington</strong> was an American mathematician who worked in what are now known as metamathematics and model theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Huntington attended Harvard College, and he was awarded his A.B. in 1895, followed by his A.M. two years later.</li>
<li>After being awarded the Master's degree, Huntington was appointed to Williams College.</li>
<li>For two years Huntington worked as a mathematics instructor at Williams College at Williamstown, Massachusetts.</li>
<li>In 1899 Huntington left the United States to study for his doctorate in Europe.</li>
<li>Huntington's doctorate was awarded for a thesis on algebra.</li>
<li>Returning to the United States, Huntington again was appointed as an instructor in Harvard in 1901.</li>
<li>He was promoted to an assistant professor in 1905, then in 1909 he married Suzie Edwards Van Volkenburgh - they had no children.</li>
<li>Huntington was promoted to associate professor in 1915 and to professor of mechanics at Harvard in 1919.</li>
<li>Huntington was interested in the foundations of mathematics.</li>
<li>This is now known as Huntington's theorem.</li>
<li>Huntington himself called these postulates, rather than axioms, and was careful to distinguish between 'postulate' and his own use of the term 'axiom'.</li>
<li>Huntington's book The Continuum and other types of serial order (1917) was a standard work on set theory for many years.</li>
<li>One might wonder why, given these interests, Huntington was appointed as Professor of Mechanics in 1919.</li>
<li>Huntington proposed a method of appointing representatives to the US Congress.</li>
<li>This was published as "Edward V Huntington, Methods of Apportionment in Congress.</li>
<li>In 1919 Huntington was president of the Mathematical Association of America, an organisation he helped to found, and his presidential address considered mathematical problems related to statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 26 April 1874, Clinton, New York, USA. Died 25 November 1952, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.</p>
