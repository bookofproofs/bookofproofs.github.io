<p><strong>Marcel Riesz</strong> was a Hungarian-born mathematician who worked on summation methods, potential theory and other parts of analysis, as well as number theory and partial differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Riesz wrote his doctoral thesis Summierbare trigonometrische Reihen und Potenzreihen Ⓣ(Summable trigonometric series and power series) in 1907 and presented it to the University of Budapest; it was published in the following year.</li>
<li>Von Koch, who was the professor at Stockholm, died in March 1924 and several mathematicians, including Ivar Bendixson and Ivar Fredholm, supported Riesz to fill the vacancy.</li>
<li>Marcel Riesz's interests ranged from functional analysis to partial differential equations, mathematical physics, number theory and algebra.</li>
<li>In a joint work with Hardy The general theory of Dirichlet's series, published by Cambridge University Press  in 1915, he introduced Riesz means.</li>
<li>Riesz broadened his range of interests during the 1930 when he became interested in potential theory and in partial differential equations.</li>
<li>In 1949, Riesz published a 223 page paper L'intégrale de Riemann-Liouville et le problème de Cauchy Ⓣ(The integral of Riemann-Liouville and the Cauchy problem) in which he introduced a multiple integral of Riemann-Liouville type and showed how important this idea is in the theory of the wave equation.</li>
<li>In Problems related to characteristic surfaces  Riesz extended these ideas to obtain the solution of the wave equation for a very general class of characteristic boundaries.</li>
<li>We noted above that Riesz was interested in number theory but as yet have given no examples of his work in this area.</li>
<li>Riesz loved to talk about mathematics and he appreciated having listeners.</li>
<li>Riesz lived alone and these personal lectures took place sometimes in his home, sometimes in his favourite café and sometimes over the telephone.</li>
<li>Riesz retired in 1952 and went to the United States.</li>
<li>In 1993 a facsimile reproduction of Riesz's notes from these lectures was published.</li>
<li>After spending ten years in the United States during which time he continued to work for many hours a day, Riesz suffered a breakdown in 1962 and returned to Lund.</li>
<li>Among the many honours Riesz received, let us mention his election to the Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Physiographical Society in Lund, and the Videnska Selskab in Copenhagen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 16 November 1886, Györ, Hungary. Died 4 September 1969, Lund, Sweden.</p>
