<p><strong>Luigi Bianchi</strong> made important contributions to differential geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Saverio Bianchi had studied law at the University of Parma, graduating in July 1848.</li>
<li>Luigi, however, was attracted to mathematics and he took the competitive entrance examinations for the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa in November 1873.</li>
<li>At the University of Pisa, Luigi Bianchi studied under Enrico Betti and Ulisse Dini and graduated with the highest distinction from Pisa on 30 November 1877.</li>
<li>After his return to Italy in 1881, Bianchi was appointed to a professorship at the Scuola Normale Superiore at Pisa.</li>
<li>Luigi Bianchi made important contributions to differential geometry.</li>
<li>Bianchi also turns to non-Euclidean geometry, taking up the ideas of Beltrami; the surfaces of curvature zero in such geometry draw his special attention.</li>
<li>Bianchi partial differential equations play an important role.</li>
<li>The principal fame of Darboux and Bianchi lies in their beautiful textbooks, in which they combine their on results with those of their predecessors.</li>
<li>Bianchi's 'Lezioni di geometria differenziale' Ⓣ(Lectures on differential geometry) (1893), a new edition of autographed lectures published in 1886, is a systematic treatise of the theory of curves and surfaces, with special attention paid to more-dimensional geometry.</li>
<li>Perhaps Bianchi's most famous paper was the 92-page On the three-dimensional spaces which admit a continuous group of motions published in 1897.</li>
<li>As preparation for the general solution, the author applies the Lie-Killing methods for finding all three-dimensional spaces in which the motions of figures with given degrees of freedom are possible - this is enough to outline the goal and the general train of thought of Bianchi's work.</li>
<li>The importance of his results is known to every reader who is familiar with the awards of the Royal Jablonowski Society for 1901; their citation states that the strength of the methods and the elegance of the solutions need not be pointed out when we are talking about a paper whose author is Bianchi.</li>
<li>During his time as editor other mathematicians who shared the editorial duties with him include Luigi Cremona, Ulisse Dini, Corrado Segre, Salvatore Pincherle, Tullio Levi-Civita and Francesco Severi.</li>
<li>Bianchi received many honours including being made a corresponding member of the Accademia dei Lincei in 1887 and a fellow of the Academy in 1893.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 January 1856, Parma (now Italy). Died 6 June 1928, Pisa, Italy.</p>
