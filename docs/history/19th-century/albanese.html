<h1>Person: Albanese, Giacomo</h1>

<p><strong>Giacomo Albanese</strong> was an Italian mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry. He finished his career teaching in Brazil.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>During the time Albanese was studying at the Scola Normale Superiore, Ulisse Dini was the director of the School, but he also gave lectures on infinitesimal calculus which Albanese attended.</li>
<li>Another of his teachers at the School was Eugenio Bertini who was a leading researcher in algebraic geometry and Albanese undertook research for his doctorate under Bertini's supervision.</li>
<li>Following the award of his doctorate, Albanese was appointed as Dini's assistant at Pisa.</li>
<li>However, Dini died in 1918, and following his death Albanese became an assistant to Onorato Nicoletti, an expert in the theory of Hermitian forms who took over Dini's courses on infinitesimal calculus after his death.</li>
<li>From 1913 to 1919, as well as his position as assistant, Albanese lectured at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa but he was given leave for military service during the years 1917-18.</li>
<li>With large losses of men, Italy called up all men aged eighteen and over and at this time Albanese was called up for military service.</li>
<li>Albanese left Padua in the year 1920 to take up a professorship in analysis and algebra at the Naval Academy in Livorno which, as happened with Italian chairs, he had won after a competition.</li>
<li>Albanese's research involved examining curves on algebraic surfaces and the genus of an algebraic variety.</li>
<li>His name is remembered today for Albanese varieties used as a standard tool in algebraic geometry.</li>
<li>In other notes from 1924-1927 Albanese proved sufficient conditions for a surface to be rational; he resolved the problem of the base for the curves on a surface and undertook a general study of the geometry of manifolds.</li>
<li>This was in the years in which Albanese became professor of geometry at the University of Catania, going later to Palermo and then to Pisa.</li>
<li>Let us look briefly at Albanese's paper Sulle condizioni perchè una algebraica riducible si possa considerare come limite di una curva irreducible Ⓣ(On the conditions that a reducible algebraic curve can be considered as the limit of an irreducible curve) (1928).</li>
<li>The reason Albanese was sent to Brazil in 1936 was as part of the move to establish universities there.</li>
<li>Albanese spent the rest of his life in São Paulo, holding the chair of Analytical, Projective and Descriptive Geometry, except for the year 1942 when he returned to Pisa because of World War II.</li>
<li>Soon after the war ended, Albanese, who was by then back in São Paulo, became closely acquainted with André Weil, who taught there from 1945 to 1947.</li>
<li>the attribution of this concept to Albanese is dubious ....</li>
<li>geometry with Giacomo Albanese.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 July 1890, Geraci Siculo (near Palermo), Italy. Died 8 June 1948, São Paulo, Brazil.</p>
