<p><strong>Louis Milne-Thomson</strong> was an English applied mathematician best known for his textbooks on applied mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Louis was the eldest of his parents' sons.</li>
<li>Milne-Thomson entered Clifton College in Bristol in 1906 as a classical scholar and in his final year at the College he won a scholarship to study mathematics at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.</li>
<li>Milne-Thomson was appointed as an assistant mathematics master at Winchester College in 1914.</li>
<li>On 12 September 1914, shortly after he took up his appointment, Milne-Thomson married Gertrude Frommknecht; the marriage produced three daughters.</li>
<li>After teaching for seven years at Winchester College, Milne-Thomson left in 1921 to take up an appointment as professor of mathematics at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich.</li>
<li>The most important topic that Milne-Thomson undertook research on near the start of his career was compiling tables.</li>
<li>Of course the main mathematical tool used in constructing tables was the method of finite differences and in 1933 Milne-Thomson published his first textbook, The Calculus of Finite Differences, a text in which he set out to explain to students the techniques which he used in table making.</li>
<li>His next text was also to become a classic but it marked a change in direction in Milne-Thomson's research interests.</li>
<li>In 1956 Milne-Thomson reached the age of sixty-five years and retired from the Royal Naval College in Greenwich.</li>
<li>Let us now look briefly at some papers which Milne-Thomson published between 1940 and his final paper in 1972.</li>
<li>Two years later Milne-Thomson published a sequel entitled Antiplane elastic systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 May 1891, Ealing, London, England. Died 21 August 1974, Sevenoaks, Kent, England.</p>
