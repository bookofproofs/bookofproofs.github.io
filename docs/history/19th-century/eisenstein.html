<h1>Person: Eisenstein, Ferdinand Gotthold Max</h1>

<p><strong>Gotthold Eisenstein</strong> worked on a variety of topics including quadratic and cubic forms, the reciprocity theorem for cubic residues, quadratic partition of prime numbers and reciprocity laws.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The family was Jewish but before Gotthold, who was their first child, was born they had converted from Judaism to become Protestants.</li>
<li>Their family were not well off, for Johan Eisenstein, after serving in the Prussian army for eight years, found it hard to adjust to a steady job in civilian life.</li>
<li>Eisenstein suffered all his life from bad health but at least he survived childhood which none of his five brothers and sisters succeeded in doing.</li>
<li>All of them died of meningitis, and Gotthold himself also contracted the disease but he survived it.</li>
<li>His mother, Helene Eisenstein, had a major role in her son's early education.</li>
<li>This school adopted an almost military style of discipline and a strict formal approach to education which did nothing for Eisenstein's creative nature.</li>
<li>In 1837, when he was fourteen years old, Eisenstein entered the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium then moved to the Friedrich Werder Gymnasium in Berlin to complete his schooling.</li>
<li>Eisenstein remained at school in Berlin becoming more and more devoted to mathematics.</li>
<li>The family tried spending time in Wales and Ireland but Eisenstein's father could not find the right job to give him satisfaction and financial security.</li>
<li>As they moved from place to place Eisenstein read Disquisitiones arithmeticae Ⓣ(Investigations in arithmetic) and played the piano whenever it was possible.</li>
<li>While in Ireland in 1843 Eisenstein met Hamilton in Dublin, a city he would have dearly liked to have settled in, and Hamilton gave him a copy of a paper that he had written on Abel's work on the impossibility of solving quintic equations.</li>
<li>This further stimulated Eisenstein to begin research in mathematics.</li>
<li>In June 1843 Eisenstein returned to Germany with his mother who separated from his father at this time.</li>
<li>Eisenstein applied to take his final school examinations and was allowed to do so in August/September.</li>
<li>Eisenstein enrolled at the University of Berlin in the autumn of 1843 and in January 1844 he delivered Hamilton's paper to the Berlin Academy.</li>
<li>Crelle was appointed as referee for Eisenstein's paper and, with his usual intuition for spotting young mathematical talent, Crelle immediately realised that here was a potential genius.</li>
<li>Eisenstein met von Humboldt in March 1844.</li>
<li>Eisenstein's financial position was poor and von Humboldt went out of his way to obtain grants from the King, the Prussian government, and the Berlin Academy.</li>
<li>Had it not been for von Humboldt's personal generosity, Eisenstein would have had a harder time than in fact he had.</li>
<li>But Eisenstein was a sensitive person and he was not happy to receive the grants, particularly when he felt that the official ones were given grudgingly.</li>
<li>The authorities should certainly have been pleased with the return for their money since Eisenstein published 23 papers and two problems in Crelle's Journal in 1844.</li>
<li>In June 1844 Eisenstein went to Göttingen for two weeks to visit Gauss.</li>
<li>Gauss had a reputation for being extremely hard to impress, but Eisenstein had sent some of his papers to Gauss before the visit and Gauss was full of praise.</li>
<li>At this time Eisenstein was working on a variety of topics including quadratic and cubic forms and the reciprocity theorem for cubic residues.</li>
<li>It was a highly successful visit and Eisenstein made a friend at Göttingen, namely Moritz Stern.</li>
<li>Kummer arranged that the University of Breslau award Eisenstein an honorary doctorate in February 1845.</li>
<li>Jacobi had also been involved in arranging this honour, but Eisenstein and Jacobi were not always on the best of terms having a very up and down relationship.</li>
<li>From 1846 to 1847 Eisenstein worked on elliptic functions and in the first of these years he was involved in a priority dispute with Jacobi.</li>
<li>In 1847 Eisenstein received his habilitation from the University of Berlin and began to lecture.</li>
<li>Riemann attended lectures that he gave on elliptic functions in that year and we comment below on possible interaction between Riemann and Eisenstein at this time.</li>
<li>Eisenstein attended some pro-democracy meetings but did not play any active political role.</li>
<li>However, on 19 March 1848, during street fighting in Berlin shots were fired on the King's troops from a house which Eisenstein was in (although it was not his own house) and he was arrested.</li>
<li>Despite his health problems Eisenstein published one treatise after another on quadratic partition of prime numbers and reciprocity laws.</li>
<li>He was receiving many honours, for example Gauss proposed Eisenstein for election to the Göttingen Academy and he was elected in 1851.</li>
<li>Early in 1852, at Dirichlet's request, Eisenstein was elected to the Berlin Academy.</li>
<li>Eisenstein died of pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of 29.</li>
<li>His great supporter Alexander von Humboldt, by that time 83 years of age, followed Eisenstein's coffin at the cemetery.</li>
<li>He had successfully obtained funds to allow Eisenstein to spend time in Sicily in order to recover his health, but it was too late.</li>
<li>There are three major areas of mathematics to which Eisenstein contributed and we have already mentioned them above.</li>
<li>In his work on this topic Eisenstein used Kummer's theory of ideals.</li>
<li>The third topic to which Eisenstein made a major contribution was the theory of elliptic functions.</li>
<li>This book by Weil shows that Eisenstein's approach is of major importance to the mathematics which is being developed today, a great tribute to a genius who died 150 years ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 16 April 1823, Berlin, Germany. Died 11 October 1852, Berlin, Germany.</p>
