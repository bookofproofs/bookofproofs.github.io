<p><strong>Arthur Hirsch</strong> was a German mathematician (born in Königsberg) who worked on differential equations and hypergeometric functions.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hirsch studied mathematics, physics and philosophy in his hometown and in Berlin.</li>
<li>Hirsch acted as co-advisor and second examiner for a number of PhD theses between 1916 and 1926, but none of the PhD candidates became influential in mathematics.</li>
<li>In 1909 Hirsch was listed as Deputy Head in the School Board minutes for the first time; he was re-elected every other year until 1921.</li>
<li>Hirsch published a few papers in Mathematische Annalen, primarily on differential equations and integrals.</li>
<li>Hirsch was a member of the Swiss Mathematical Society; he also attended some of the German Mathematical Society's annual meetings.</li>
<li>Hirsch joined the organising committee of the first International Congress of Mathematicians in December 1896.</li>
<li>At the meeting on 21 January 1897 Hurwitz and Rudio suggested that Hirsch join the reception committee (alongside Burkhardt and Gubler), partly in order to help deal with the congress publications.</li>
<li>Like his colleagues Dumas and Franel, Hirsch was on the organising committee for the 1932 ICM in Zürich, but did not give a talk during the congress.</li>
<li>Arthur Hirsch retired in 1936.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 July 1866, Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 18 November 1948, Zürich, Switzerland.</p>
