<p><strong>Gustav Hertz</strong> was a German physicist and Nobel Prize winner for his work on inelastic electron collisions in gases.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gustav Hertz (senior) was a lawyer who was one of the brothers of Heinrich Hertz, the discoverer of wireless waves, who also has a biography in this archive.</li>
<li>Gustav, the subject of this biography, attended the Johanneum Gymnasium in Hamburg as his famous uncle had done about thirty years earlier.</li>
<li>As was the custom with German students at this time, Hertz did not complete his studies at a single university, but moved around to sample the best of a number of institutions.</li>
<li>After Göttingen, Hertz moved to Munich where he studied at the university before moving to the University of Berlin in 1909 to study for his doctorate.</li>
<li>In 1913 Hertz was appointed as an Assistant in Physics at the University of Berlin.</li>
<li>Franck was five years older than Hertz and had been awarded his doctorate by the University of Berlin in 1909.</li>
<li>Both Hertz and Franck were mobilised when war broke out and their research collaboration necessarily stopped.</li>
<li>The war proved unfortunate for Hertz who was severely wounded in action in 1915.</li>
<li>They had two sons, Carl Hellmuth Hertz, born on 15 October 1920, and Johannes Hertz who both became physicists.</li>
<li>Hertz left Berlin in 1920 and worked for five years in the physics laboratory of the Philips Incandescent Lamp Factory at Eindhoven.</li>
<li>After being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1925, Hertz gave his Nobel lecture on The results of the electron-impact tests in the light of Bohr's theory of atoms  on 11 December 1926.</li>
<li>Hertz qualified under the exemptions, but this was not honoured over the following period.</li>
<li>Hertz resigned his positions at the Technological University of Berlin in 1935 and returned to industry being appointed Director of the Siemens physics laboratory.</li>
<li>In 1941 Hertz's wife Ellen died.</li>
<li>When the war ended in 1945 Hertz went to the Soviet Union where he worked as the head of a research laboratory.</li>
<li>Hertz received many honours in addition to the 1925 Nobel Prize in Physics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 22 July 1887, Hamburg, Germany. Died 30 October 1975, Berlin, East Germany.</p>
