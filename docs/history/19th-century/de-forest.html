<p><strong>Erastus De Forest</strong> was an American mathematician and statistician and an early user of Monte Carlo methods.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>De Forest remained at Yale to study engineering and at this time was a fellow student with J Willard Gibbs who entered Yale in the year that De Forest was awarded his B.A. In 1856 De Forest was awarded a Ph.B. by Yale and then in February of the following year he set off with his aunt for New York to begin a journey with her to Havana.</li>
<li>However, before the ship was due to depart De Forest vanished leaving his luggage.</li>
<li>It was more than two years after he vanished that John De Forest received a letter from his son, posted in Australia.</li>
<li>De Forest, depressed with his privileged life, had travelled to California where he had got a job at a mine.</li>
<li>From his return to Connecticut in 1865 he devoted himself to the study of mathematics.</li>
<li>The remarkable contributions of De Forest to statistics had little or no influence on the subject since those who later developed similar ideas were totally unaware of his contributions.</li>
<li>De Forest was not associated with any institution so lacked the visibility that such a position would have meant.</li>
<li>His contributions were recognised, however, by Pearson whose attention was drawn to De Forest's papers.</li>
<li>Pearson acknowledged De Forest's priority in deriving the chi square distribution.</li>
<li>Stigler uses information on De Forest available to him from a well researched but unpublished work on De Forest by H H Wolfenden.</li>
<li>Shortly before he died he founded the Erastus L De Forest Professorship of Mathematics at Yale.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 27 June 1834, Watertown, Connecticut, USA. Died 6 June 1888, Watertown, Connecticut, USA.</p>
