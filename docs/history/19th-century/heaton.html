<p><strong>Henry Heaton</strong> was an American amateur mathematician who published a large number of elegant problems and puzzles.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>We note that George Heaton and Ella M Heaton were twins.</li>
<li>Rachel was 18, Eliza 17, Henry 14, William 11, and twins George and Ella were 8 years of age.</li>
<li>Henry Heaton began his two parallel careers at the age of eighteen.</li>
<li>Heaton's occupation, as shown on the census form, was that of carpenter.</li>
<li>By this time Heaton's parents had left Greenfield and were living in New Haven, Fayette County, Pennsylvania.</li>
<li>Heaton moved to Des Moines to take up a position as a teacher and there he made the acquaintance of Hendricks who encouraged Heaton's interest in mathematics.</li>
<li>Hendricks suggested that Heaton subscribe to the Yates County Chronicle and it was to this journal that he began to send solutions of mathematical problems posed in the Chronicle.</li>
<li>It was Hendricks who taught Heaton the basic concepts of probability theory which he quickly mastered.</li>
<li>In Volume 3, Part 3, Hendricks published a solution to the "Four Bricks Problem" and notes that Heaton has solved this problem.</li>
<li>Heaton continued his contributions to the Annals.</li>
<li>Between 1878 and 1894 Heaton posed, or published solutions to, several problems in The Mathematical Visitor.</li>
<li>We noted that Heaton met Joel Hendricks when he (Heaton) was teaching at Des Moines in the early 1870s.</li>
<li>The Heatons did not stay in Des Moines for long for in 1877-78 they were living in Sabula, Jackson County, Iowa, a town on the Iowa/Illinois border almost surrounded by the Mississippi River, where Heaton was Superintendent of Schools.</li>
<li>By 1879 Heaton was living in Atlantic, Cass county, Iowa, a town between Omaha and Des Moines, and in 1881 in Perry, Iowa, about 40 km north west of Des Moines.</li>
<li>In 1906 Heaton moved from Atlantic to Belfield, North Dakota.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 April 1846, Millsboro, Washington County, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 27 January 1927, Biddle, Power River County, Montana, USA.</p>
