<h1>Person: Lamb, Horace</h1>

<p><strong>Horace Lamb</strong> wrote important texts and made important contributions to applied mathematics, in particular to acoustics and fluid dynamics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His mother was Elizabeth Lamb (born Hayfield, Derbyshire about 1817).</li>
<li>John Lamb died when Horace was young and after his mother remarried, Horace went to live with Mrs Holland who was his mother's sister.</li>
<li>She was kindly lady but nevertheless brought Horace up in a severe Puritan manner.</li>
<li>Horace was educated at the Grammar School in Stockport.</li>
<li>In 1866, when Horace was only 17, he won a scholarship to read classics at Queen's College, Cambridge but declined the scholarship to spend a year studying at Owens College, Manchester.</li>
<li>It was at Owens College that Lamb's interests turned firmly towards mathematics so that, when he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, the following year it was to study mathematics.</li>
<li>Lamb was taught by Stokes and Maxwell at Cambridge and graduated as Second Wrangler in 1872 (meaning that he was second in the ranked list of those students awarded a First Class degree).</li>
<li>Adelaide was extremely fortunate in their choice of Lamb as their first professor of mathematics and he rapidly built the reputation of the mathematics department there.</li>
<li>Lamb left Australia in 1885, accepting a chair at Victoria University in England (now the University of Manchester).</li>
<li>Lamb held the chair at Manchester until 1920 when, at the age of 70, he retired and moved to Cambridge.</li>
<li>Lamb wrote important texts and made important contributions to applied mathematics, in particular to acoustics and fluid dynamics, for example Mathematical Theory of the Motion of Fluids (1878).</li>
<li>Lamb's texts had a major role on teaching in British universities for many years.</li>
<li>Lamb wrote books in addition to those mentioned above, including Infinitesimal Calculus (1897), Dynamical Theory of Sound (1910), and Higher Mechanics (1920).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 November 1849, Stockport, England. Died 4 December 1934, Cambridge, England.</p>
