<h1>Person: Zeuthen, Hieronymous Georg</h1>

<p><strong>Hieronymus Georg Zeuthen</strong> was a Danish mathematician who worked on the geometry of conic sections, algebraic surfaces and the history of mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>However Zeuthen's father moved in 1849 from a church in Grimstrup to a church in Soro and at this time Zeuthen began his secondary education.</li>
<li>At Copenhagen Zeuthen studied a broad mathematics course attending courses on topics in both pure and applied mathematics.</li>
<li>This was extremely important for Zeuthen since his research areas of mathematics were firmly shaped by Chasles during this period.</li>
<li>The first topic on which Zeuthen undertook research was enumerative geometry.</li>
<li>Up until 1875 Zeuthen worked almost exclusively on enumerative geometry.</li>
<li>After 1875 Zeuthen's contributions to mathematics became more varied.</li>
<li>Unlike many historians of science Zeuthen explained the ancient texts in the manner of a colleague of the ancient mathematicians.</li>
<li>Zeuthen argued that Pythagoras himself discovered that 2 was irrational when computing the diagonal of a square.</li>
<li>17 was also carefully studied by Zeuthen.</li>
<li>Zeuthen's largest historical work was published in 1896.</li>
<li>Zeuthen's papers and books, on the other hand, present deep mathematical analyses of the methods found in classical works mostly from antiquity and from the 16th  and 17th  centuries in an attempt to capture their fundamental ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 February 1839, Grimstrup, West Jutland, Denmark. Died 6 January 1920, Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
