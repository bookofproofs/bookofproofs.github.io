<p><strong>Sophie Willock Bryant</strong> was an Irish mathematician who also published on many other topics: Irish history, religion, education, women's rights, and philosophy.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sophie, the third of her parents six children, was brought up near Dublin for the first few years of her life, then in Ballymony, Co Cork, where her father accepted a living in the Church of Ireland, and still later in Cleenish near Enniskillen.</li>
<li>In 1863, when Sophie was thirteen years old, her father was appointed to the Chair of Geometry in the University of London, and the family moved to London.</li>
<li>In 1869 she married Dr William Hicks Bryant from Plymouth.</li>
<li>Hicks Bryant was a surgeon who, at 29, was ten years older than his wife.</li>
<li>Sadly the marriage lasted less than one year for Hicks Bryant died of cirrhosis in 1870.</li>
<li>Sophie Bryant then took a teaching post at a school for ladies in Highgate but she also continued her own studies.</li>
<li>Sophie Bryant first met her in 1867 when she sat the Cambridge Local Examination.</li>
<li>Buss encouraged Bryant to continue her education after the death of her husband, and, in 1875, appointed her to teach mathematics at the North London Collegiate School.</li>
<li>Of course Bryant had no degree, for women could not take degrees at universities at this time.</li>
<li>Still encouraged by Buss, Bryant decided to read for a B.Sc. degree but there were severe difficulties to overcome.</li>
<li>While studying for her D.Sc., Bryant was elected to the London Mathematical Society in 1882.</li>
<li>Bryant, however, does have the distinction of being the first woman to have a paper published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>Bryant's conclusion that elongated rhombic semi-dodecahedra are the natural form of honeycomb cells had been observed by Kepler.</li>
<li>In 1895 Frances Buss died and Bryant succeeded her as head of the North London Collegiate School.</li>
<li>Bryant published on many topics, Irish history, religion, education, women's rights, and philosophy.</li>
<li>A staunch supporter of Irish Home Rule, Sophie work books on Irish history - Celtic Ireland (1889), The Genius of the Gael: A study in Celtic psychology and its manifestations (1913) and Liberty, order and law under native Irish rule: a study in the Book of the Ancient Laws of Ireland (1923).</li>
<li>Later in 1904, when Trinity College Dublin opened its degrees to women, Bryant was one of the first to be awarded an honorary doctorate.</li>
<li>Climbing was one of Bryant's loves and she had climbed many of the mountains in the Alps, for example the Matterhorn and Mount Blanc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 February 1850, Sandymount, near Dublin, Ireland. Died 14 August 1922, Chamonix, France.</p>
