<p><strong>Ludwig Schlesinger</strong> was a mathematician, born in what is now Slovakia, who worked on differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 1889 Schlesinger became an associate professor at the University of Berlin; in 1897, invited professor at the University of Bonn, and in the same year he was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Kolozsvár, Hungary (now Cluj, Romania).</li>
<li>In 1902 Schlesinger was elected as a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and in 1909 he was honoured with the award of the Lobachevsky Prize.</li>
<li>Ludwig Schlesinger wrote many papers for scientific periodicals and journals.</li>
<li>In this paper Schlesinger formulated the problem of isomonodromy deformations for a certain matrix Fuchsian equation.</li>
<li>Schlesinger solved a particular case of the problem using Poincaré's theory of the Fuchsian zeta-functions.</li>
<li>The paper introduces what today are known as the Schlesinger transformations and Schlesinger equations which have an important role in differential geometry.</li>
<li>Schlesinger is the author of Handbuch der Theorie der Linearen Differentialgleichungen Ⓣ(Handbook of the theory of linear differential equations) (B G Teubner, Leipzig; Vol 1, 1895; Vol 2 Part 1, 1897; Vol.</li>
<li>In 1926 Schlesinger published a book on Lebesgue integration and Fourier series in collaboration with Abraham Plessner.</li>
<li>Another of Schlesinger's interests was the history of mathematics and he made a number of important contributions to this topic.</li>
<li>After reading Zoárd Geöcze's papers during his stay at the University of Kolozsvár, Ludwig Schlesinger suggested to him that he write down his ideas and submit them to Comptes Rendus for publication.</li>
<li>Ludovicus Schlesinger].</li>
<li>During his stay in Kolozsvár (Cluj), Schlesinger contributed significantly to the advancement of mathematics in the city.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 November 1864, Nagyszombat, Hungary (now Trnava, Slovakia). Died 16 December 1933, Giessen, Germany.</p>
