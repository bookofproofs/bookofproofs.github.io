<h1>Person: Weldon, Walter Frank Raphael</h1>

<p><strong>Raphael Weldon</strong> was a pioneer in the application of Statistics to biology and a founder of the journal <em>Biometrika</em>.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Walter was a journalist and chemist, and he moved around the country so frequently that it was not possible for Raphael to attend school until he reached thirteen years of age.</li>
<li>Walter and Anne had three children; their first child was a girl, with Raphael born next followed by his younger brother Dante.</li>
<li>Raphael did receive some tutoring from a local clergyman before he was thirteen years old then, in 1873, he entered Mr Watson's boarding school at Caversham near Reading.</li>
<li>He was taught mathematics by Henrici who impressed Weldon more than any of his other lecturers; he later wrote that Henrici was the first naturally gifted teacher he had studied under.</li>
<li>In 1877 Weldon went to King's College, London, his aim still being to enter the medical profession.</li>
<li>Weldon married Florence Tebb, from Burstow in Surrey, on 13 March 1883.</li>
<li>She played a large role in Weldon's scientific work, assisting him on many of his projects.</li>
<li>After he was married Weldon took all his holidays with his wife in places where they could study marine biology.</li>
<li>The Marine Biological Association set up a laboratory in Plymouth and Weldon and his wife began spending all their vacations there undertaking research.</li>
<li>By 1888 they were spending as much time there as Weldon's duties at Cambridge would allow, and he only went to the university to give his lectures.</li>
<li>Realising that his mathematical skills were somewhat less than he wished, Weldon read widely studying, in particular, the leading works by the French mathematicians on the calculus of probability.</li>
<li>Weldon was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in May 1890 and later that year he was appointed Jodrell professor at University College, London, taking up his duties in 1891.</li>
<li>Weldon asked the questions that drove Pearson to some of his most significant contributions.</li>
<li>What were the questions which Weldon asked Pearson?</li>
<li>By 1893 Weldon was serving on a Royal Society Committee along with Galton and Pearson 'For the Purpose of conducting Statistical Enquiry into the Variability of Organisms'.</li>
<li>Weldon proposed a journal for biometrics in a letter written to Pearson dated 16 November 1899.</li>
<li>The journal Biometrika was named within weeks and Weldon and Pearson became joint editors.</li>
<li>Weldon was appointed to a chair in Oxford in 1900 and he held this post until his death in 1906.</li>
<li>The debate, which was conducted before a large and somewhat agitated audience, resolved itself into a dialectical duel between the president of the section and professor Weldon, and developed quite a considerable amount of heat.</li>
<li>In the Easter vacation of 1906 Weldon was staying with his wife in an inn at Woolstone when he contracted pneumonia.</li>
<li>It is likely that the illness became serious due to overwork and Weldon's refusal to stop work when he became ill.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 March 1860, Highgate, London, England. Died 13 April 1906, London, England.</p>
