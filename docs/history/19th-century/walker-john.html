<p><strong>John James Walker</strong> was an English mathematician whose work was mainly in analysis of plane curves and in quaternions.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In fact Walker attended London High School, the school at which his father was then headmaster until his father moved to become headmaster of Plymouth New Grammar School.</li>
<li>Walker completed his school education at Plymouth New Grammar School before entering Trinity College Dublin as an undergraduate.</li>
<li>His mother's family were English but Walker followed his father's family tradition in attending Trinity College Dublin.</li>
<li>Walker's grandfather had been a fellow of Trinity and published classical texts as well as elementary mathematics and logic texts.</li>
<li>Things were not entirely straightforward for Walker at Dublin for his family had ceased to be conformists so he was debarred from holding a scholarship.</li>
<li>To add to his problems his father died young and Walker was left having little in the way of funds to see out his education.</li>
<li>After Walker graduated he became tutor to the Guinness family, a wealthy Irish family who had made their money from brewing.</li>
<li>Walker became a private tutor to the family in 1853, two years before the death of the founder Arthur Guinness, and he continued as a tutor until 1862.</li>
<li>Walker returned to England and, from 1865, he worked in London as a lecturer in applied mathematics and physics at University College.</li>
<li>Walker was honoured with election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1883.</li>
<li>The range of Walker's mathematical research was quite impressive.</li>
<li>Walker was a strong advocate of Hamilton's quaternions and strongly believed that they had not been given as wide a use as they merited.</li>
<li>The three most important papers that Walker wrote were on the analysis of plane curves and curved lines.</li>
<li>It is an interesting thought what someone writing in 1901 about 'courtesy of manner which seemed to belong to a bygone generation' might think of Walker now, almost 100 years later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 2 October 1825, Kennington, Surrey, England. Died 15 February 1900, Hampstead, England.</p>
