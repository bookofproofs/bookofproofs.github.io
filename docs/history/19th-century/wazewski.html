<p><strong>Tadeusz Ważewski</strong> was a Polish mathematician who contributed to the theory of differential equations, control theory and the theory of analytic spaces.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Russia controlled much of the country and in the years prior to Ważewski's birth there had been strong moves by Russia to make "Vistula Land", as it was called, be dominated by Russian culture.</li>
<li>Ważewski attended secondary school in Tarnów, today in the south-east of Poland, but at that time part of Austrian controlled Galicia.</li>
<li>Under Zaremba, Ważewski became interested in set theory and topology and decided to study in Paris for his doctorate.</li>
<li>This was a typical route for Polish mathematicians of this period, forced to study abroad (as Poland was partitioned) many chose the same route as Ważewski studying in Polish universities in Austrian controlled Galicia and completing their education in France.</li>
<li>Ważewski studied in Paris between 1921 and 1923 continuing his interest in topology acquired during his studies at Kraków under Zaremba.</li>
<li>Having secured his doctorate, Ważewski returned to the Jagiellonian University in Kraków where he was he was appointed a docent in 1927.</li>
<li>Ważewski was sent to the Sachsenhausen- Oranienburg concentration camp north-west of Berlin where he survived for two years.</li>
<li>Ważewski returned to Kraków and taught in the underground university there despite the severe risk to his life.</li>
<li>Ważewski was appointed a full professor at the Jagiellonian University and put all his efforts into restoring the educational system which had been destroyed.</li>
<li>Ważewski made important contributions to the theory of ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, control theory and the theory of analytic spaces.</li>
<li>We mentioned above that Ważewski worked in control theory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 September 1896, Galicia, Poland. Died 5 September 1972, Rabka-Zdrùj, Poland.</p>
