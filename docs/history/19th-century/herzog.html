<h1>Person: Herzog, Albin</h1>

<p><strong>Albin Herzog</strong>  was a Swiss mathematician who was director of the ETH Zurich. His main interest was in mechanics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Albin first attended primary school in his native village, then secondary school in Steckborn, and then the Kantonsschule in Frauenfeld, Thurgau's capital.</li>
<li>Herzog was a very good student and matriculated at the Polytechnic in Zürich in 1870.</li>
<li>After his graduation Herzog received a prize for solving a problem posed at his department, and in 1875 he received a doctorate from the University of Zürich for his thesis Bestimmung einiger specieller Minimalflächen (Determining Some Special Minimal Surfaces).</li>
<li>Herzog took on Kargl's lectures during the professor's illness and after his death.</li>
<li>In 1877 Herzog was appointed to a full professorship in applied mechanics, which was quite unusual for the time given his young age.</li>
<li>Herzog was head of the Mechanical-Technical Department for some years, but stepped down from this post when he succeeded his good friend Geiser as Director of the Polytechnic (1895-1899).</li>
<li>Geiser acted as Herzog's deputy.</li>
<li>Together they founded the Polytechnic's Civil Fund for Widows and Orphans, but Herzog seems to have been the driving force behind the project.</li>
<li>Deeming the first as too analytical and missing rigour in the second, Herzog based his lectures on Jacob Bernoulli's work and a synthetic approach.</li>
<li>When the young Einstein failed the Polytechnic's entry exam in 1895, Herzog recommended him to the Kantonsschule in Aarau, where Einstein indeed obtained the Matura.</li>
<li>Having been a keen singer in his student years, Herzog supported the student choir throughout his life.</li>
<li>Beside his teaching and administrative duties, Herzog still found time to do research.</li>
<li>On the occasion of the Polytechnic's 50th  anniversary in 1905, Herzog was one of its professors who were awarded honorary citizenship of the town Zürich.</li>
<li>Herzog was a member of the Polytechnic's alumni association, the Gesellschaft Ehemaliger Polytechniker (GEP) and the Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft.</li>
<li>The original committee invited Herzog to join the organising committee of the first International Congress of Mathematicians in his capacity as Director of the Polytechnic in November 1896.</li>
<li>Herzog, Rudio and Hurwitz were the most active committee members with regards to organising the social side of the congress.</li>
<li>Herzog's position and connections proved useful for securing the necessary subventions from the authorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 26 October 1852, Homburg, Thurgau canton, Switzerland. Died 13 June 1909, Mammern, Switzerland.</p>
