<p><strong>Benjamin Kagan</strong> was a Russian and Soviet mathematician who woked on non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kagan entered Novorossysky University in Odessa in 1887.</li>
<li>In 1892 Kagan received a degree from Kiev University, then in 1895 he was awarded a Master's Degree by St Petersburg University.</li>
<li>As if this was not enough, Kagan also edited the Journal of Experimental Physics and Elementary Mathematics from 1902 until 1917 and he was the director of a large publisher of scientific materials Mathesis.</li>
<li>Kagan was the first Head of Department and he founded an important School of Differential Geometry.</li>
<li>In 1927, Kagan organised a seminar on vector and tensor analysis.</li>
<li>In 1934 Kagan and other members of his School organised an International conference on differential geometry which took place at Moscow University.</li>
<li>Kagan worked on the foundations of geometry and his first work was on Lobachevsky's geometry.</li>
<li>Kagan studied tensor differential geometry after going to Moscow because of an interest in relativity.</li>
<li>Kagan wrote a history of non-euclidean geometry and also a detailed biography of Lobachevsky.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 10 March 1869, Shavli, Kovno (now Kaunas, Lithuania). Died 8 May 1953, Moscow, USSR.</p>
