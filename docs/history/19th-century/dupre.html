<p><strong>Athanase Dupré</strong> was a French mathematician who worked on number theory and the mechanical theory of heat.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>They had at least seven children, Pierre Louis (born 1797), Marie Anne Victoire (born 1800), Louise Constance Aline (born 1807), the subject of this biography Louis Victoire Athanase (born 1808), Louise Delphine Eugénie (born 1810) and Antoine Ferdinand Palimon (born 1817).</li>
<li>A seventh child, Paul, is referred to by Athanase Dupré in a footnote in his book Théorie mécanique de la chaleur Ⓣ(Mechanical Theory of Heat) where he thanks his "brother Paul" for a helpful suggestion.</li>
<li>We have not found a date of birth for Paul Dupré.</li>
<li>The Dupré family was Roman Catholic and brought their children up in that faith; Athanase Dupré remained a staunch Catholic throughout his life.</li>
<li>After the award of his degree, Dupré was appointed to the Collège Royal in Rennes.</li>
<li>In 1838 Dupré married Louise Euphrasie Rousseau, born in 1804 in Villeneuve-la-Guyard in the Yonne department, and they lived on the rue de Paris in Rennes.</li>
<li>Édouard Louis Athanase, born 11 July 1839 in Rennes, became professor at the Lycée in Cherbourg and become a Knight of the Légion d'Honneur.</li>
<li>Pierre Louis Athanase, born 24 February 1842 in Rennes, became a captain in the navy and an Officer of the Légion d'Honneur.</li>
<li>Raphaël Athanase, born 22 September 1843 in Rennes, studied at the École Polytechnique, became director of marine engineering and also became an Officer of the Légion d'Honneur.</li>
<li>A fourth son, Paul Louis Athanase Dupré, was born in Rennes, studied at the École Polytechnique and went on to undertake joint work with his father.</li>
<li>In 1847 Dupré was appointed to the chair of applied mathematics in the Faculty of Science at Rennes.</li>
<li>When Dupré was appointed, the Faculty was housed on the first floor of the north wing in the Rennes City Hall, but new buildings were planned and these were completed in 1855.</li>
<li>In 1866 Dupré was appointed dean of the Faculty after the previous dean, the chemist Faustino Malaguti (1802-1878), had been appointed rector of Rennes Academy.</li>
<li>For the first part of his career, from 1826 until 1859, Dupré contributed to a number of different areas in mathematics and physics.</li>
<li>In the second of these papers Dupré discussed calculating the greatest common divisor of two Gaussian integers.</li>
<li>It looks as if Dupré was somewhat unhappy with the reaction to his work in number theory.</li>
<li>His work had a major influence on François Jacques Dominique Massieu (1832-1896), a French engineer known for introducing 'free entropy' in 1869, who was a colleague of Dupré's in Rennes during the 1860s.</li>
<li>During the 1860s Dupré published a series of memoirs on the mechanical theory of heat in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique.</li>
<li>Dupré's son, Paul Dupré, who became well-known for experimental work in physics particularly involving capillary forces and surface tension in liquids, undertook some joint work with his father which was reported on in some of these memoirs.</li>
<li>In his fifth, sixth and seventh memoirs on the mechanical theory of heat Athanase Dupré applied the principles of thermodynamics to capillary action.</li>
<li>His son Paul had devised some ingenious experiments to find how surface tension affected capillary action and these played an important role in Dupré's memoirs.</li>
<li>In 1866 Athanase and Paul Dupré jointly published the article On the law of the union of simple substances, and on attractions at small distances.</li>
<li>Some of Dupré's contributions in the 1860s certainly made a very considerable impact.</li>
<li>to conclude the marvels of the microscope, we cannot do better than mention a rather new discovery which is inserted in a memoir read at the 'Académie des Sciences' (1866), by M Athanase Dupré.</li>
<li>M Dupré has proved that a cube of water, visible only with a powerful microscope, contains more than a hundred and twenty-five thousand millions of molecules.</li>
<li>Sauzay was not the only one amazed by the result Dupré's.</li>
<li>Thus, Lord Rayleigh stated: "we cannot do better than follow the method of Dupré".</li>
<li>Dupré popularised the notion of surface tension which he called 'force contractile'.</li>
<li>We have mentioned above the influence that Dupré had on Willard Gibbs who was interested in Dupré's work on surface tension as well as many other parts of his work on thermodynamics.</li>
<li>Dupré entered for the Academy of Sciences' Bordin prize for 1866 with the same 'half success' as his entry on number theory.</li>
<li>Paul Dupré's experimental contributions were highlighted by his father on the title page of Théorie mécanique de la chaleur Ⓣ(Mechanical Theory of Heat).</li>
<li>The quality of this book was noted by Maxwell in a paper of 20 May 1876, in which he describes Dupré's book as "very ingenious memoirs".</li>
<li>Dupré's work on thermodynamics was also taken up by philosophers who saw that it said something fundamental about the universe.</li>
<li>For example, Elme Marie Caro, the professor of philosophy in Paris, was influenced by Dupré's work.</li>
<li>In 1866 Dupré had pointed out that although the first law of thermodynamics might seem to lead to an indefinite duration of the present order of nature, this was not the case if the second law was taken into account.</li>
<li>.' Dupré argued that the second law can have operated only in a finite span of time, and Caro adopted his argument.</li>
<li>Neither Dupré nor Caro concluded that the world must therefore have been created by God, but it is clear from Caro's exposition that he considered the entropic argument as a welcome support for a divinely created universe.</li>
<li>Dupré received relatively little in the way of honours for his mathematical work in view of its importance and its quality.</li>
<li>Paul Dupré continued to make physics experiments after the death of his father.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 28 December 1808, Cerisiers, France. Died 10 August 1869, Rennes, France.</p>
