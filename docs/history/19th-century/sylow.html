<p><strong>Ludwig Sylow</strong> was a high school teacher who proved what is perhaps the most profound result in the theory of finite groups.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thomas Edvard Sylow was a captain in the cavalry and later became a government minister.</li>
<li>Although Sylow had a good upbringing, learning how to work on his own, being taught the importance of doing one's best and working hard, nevertheless in some ways his upbringing would prove a disadvantage in his career.</li>
<li>Sylow attended Christiania Cathedral School, graduating in 1850.</li>
<li>Sadly, although Sylow would have made an outstanding university lecturer, he did not make a particularly good school teacher.</li>
<li>Finding Abel's papers on the solvability of algebraic equations by radicals more interesting, Sylow was led from them (by the professor in applied mathematics, Carl Bjerknes) to Galois.</li>
<li>Broch retained his interest in the Hartvig Nissen school, of which he had been a co-founder, and gave the young teacher Sylow much encouragement to continue his advanced mathematical researches.</li>
<li>Although at first Sylow found reading Abel's papers a difficult task, soon he found that Abel had achieved a far deeper understanding of the theory of equations than his published papers indicated.</li>
<li>Sylow's first attempts to publish some of Abel's unpublished results that he had found in his papers proved a problem.</li>
<li>Kronecker, therefore, rejected Sylow's paper but, of course, since Sylow had correctly portrayed Abel's unpublished results, eventually they were indeed attributed to Abel rather than Kronecker.</li>
<li>In 1861 Sylow obtained a scholarship to travel and visited Berlin and Paris.</li>
<li>In 1862 Sylow lectured at the University of Christiania, substituting for Broch who had been elected to serve in the Storting, the Norwegian parliament.</li>
<li>In his lectures Sylow explained Abel's and Galois's work on algebraic equations.</li>
<li>It is worth noting that although he had not proved 'Sylow's theorems' at this time (he published them 10 years later) he did pose a question about them.</li>
<li>After proving Cauchy's theorem that a group of order divisible by a prime ppp has a subgroup of order ppp, Sylow asks whether it can be generalised to powers of ppp.</li>
<li>Sylow's lectures were extremely valuable in giving Lie a fundamental appreciation of a topic to which he would make major contributions.</li>
<li>Broch was again in the Storting from 1865 to 1868 and he was keen to have Sylow take over his university teaching during this time.</li>
<li>However, the school in Fredrikshald refused to give Sylow leave to teach at the university.</li>
<li>In 1869 Broch left his chair of pure mathematics, leaving a vacancy that Sylow was well qualified to have filled.</li>
<li>Sylow was too theoretical in his approach so he was not appointed.</li>
<li>In 1870-71 Sylow exchanged nine letters with Julius Petersen who, at this time, was working on his doctoral dissertation.</li>
<li>Petersen sought Sylow's advice about the main theorem of his dissertation and these letters all deal with this.</li>
<li>Between 1873 and 1881 Sylow and Lie prepared an edition of Abel's complete work published under the title Oeuvres complète de Niels Henrik Abel Ⓣ(Complete Works of Niels Henrik Abel).</li>
<li>This funding allowed Sylow to take leave from his school for four years in order to devote himself to the project.</li>
<li>Much additional Abel material was found and published in the Sylow/Lie edition which appeared on 9 December 1881.</li>
<li>However, today Sylow's fame rests on one 10 page paper published in 1872.</li>
<li>In this paper Théorèmes sur les groupes de substitutions which Sylow published in Mathematische Annalen Volume 5 (pages 584 to 594) appear the three Sylow theorems although we know that he had already proved his famous theorem by September 1870.</li>
<li>Almost all work on finite groups uses Sylow's theorems.</li>
<li>Sylow became an editor of Acta Mathematica, was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences of Göttingen in 1883, and, in 1894, was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Copenhagen.</li>
<li>Lie had a special chair created for Sylow at Christiania University and Sylow taught at the university from 1898.</li>
<li>In 1902 Sylow gave the welcoming address at a conference to mark the centenary of Niels Abel's birth.</li>
<li>In 1902 Sylow, in collaboration with Elling Holst, published Abel's correspondence.</li>
<li>Further Abel documents had been discovered after the Sylow/Lie book came out in 1881 and, at the 'Third Scandinavian Congress of Mathematicians' which was held in Kristiania in 1913, Sylow discussed this new material.</li>
<li>In 1876 Frobenius remarked that "as every educated person knows the Pythagorean theorem so does every mathematician speak of Abel's theorem and Sylow's theorem".</li>
<li>We must not give the impression that the Sylow theorems and the Abel material were Sylow's only mathematical contributions.</li>
<li>Finally we should say a little about Sylow's life outside mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 12 December 1832, Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. Died 7 September 1918, Christiania (now Oslo), Norway.</p>
