<h1>Person: Pasch, Moritz</h1>

<p><strong>Moritz Pasch</strong> was a German mathematician who worked on the foundations of geometry. He found a number of assumptions in Euclid that nobody had noticed before.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Pasch proved the first version of what is now known as the Pasch Axiom, which states that between any two points that lie on the same side of a line, there is at least one other point lying on the opposite side of the line.</li>
<li>He also published his book Vorlesungen über neuere Geometrie (‘Lectures on Modern Geometry’) in 1882 which established the basis of modern synthetic geometry.</li>
<li>Pasch was the first mathematician to use the concept of a Jordan curve, which is the path a continuously moving point takes throughout a 2D space, to prove theorems.</li>
<li>Pasch developed his own definition of a ‘limit’, later known as the Pasch Limit Theorem; this was a precursor to the modern definition of a limit.</li>
<li>He was a pioneer of non-Euclidean geometry in the 1880s; he developed the first ‘non-Euclidean’ definition of a ‘straight line’ which, he argued, was mutually exclusive from Euclidean definitions.</li>
<li>He proved that the concept of the ‘curvature of a line’, which was a crucial component of the mathematical fields of topology and differential geometry, could be calculated from the size of a triangle.</li>
<li>Pasch formulated the first definition of a 'geometric group'; a group of permutations operating on a space which does not shift the shape of the space.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 8 November 1843, Breslau, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 20 September 1930, Bad Homburg, Germany.</p>
