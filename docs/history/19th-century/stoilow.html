<p><strong>Simion Stoilow</strong> was a Romanian mathematician, creator of the Romanian school of complex analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stoilow attended both primary and secondary school in Craiova, and showed great potential in mathematics.</li>
<li>In Paris Stoilow was able to benefit from being in a major centre for mathematical research.</li>
<li>Stoilow's thesis advisor was Émile Picard, and in 1914 he submitted his doctoral thesis Sur une classe de fonctions de deux variables definies par les equations lineaires aux derivees partielles Ⓣ(On a class of functions of two variables defined by linear equations with partial derivatives).</li>
<li>In 1919 Stoilow was appointed as a lecturer in the Department of Mathematical Analysis at the University of Iasi.</li>
<li>Stoilow was Dean of Cernauti University for two periods during the sixteen years he spent there, namely in 1925-26 and again in 1932-39.</li>
<li>Stoilow returned to Bucharest in 1939 when he was appointed Head of the Department of the Theory of Functions at the Polytechnic Institute, succeeding Dimitrie Pompeiu.</li>
<li>Before he took up his first university appointment in 1919, Stoilow concentrated on the theory of partial differential equations in the complex domain.</li>
<li>Three theorems of Stoilow, published in 1928, 1932 and 1935, constitute his main contribution to the topological theory of analytic functions, a field of which he must be considered one of the founders.</li>
<li>In 1936 Stoilow addressed the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo.</li>
<li>Stoilow gave a series of six lectures on Riemann surfaces at the Istituto di Alta Matematica in Rome in April, 1957.</li>
<li>These lecturers were published as Sur quelques points de la théorie moderne des surfaces de Riemann Ⓣ(On some points of the modern theory of Riemann surfaces) (1957) and provide an excellent account of Stoilow's contributions and how they fit around other progress in the same areas over the years.</li>
<li>In the two volumes of Theory of functions of a complex variable (Romanian) (1954, 1958), we see lecture courses which Stoilow gave at the University of Bucharest.</li>
<li>In 1936 Stoilow was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy of Sciences and he became a full member in 1945.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 September 1887, Bucharest, Romania. Died 4 April 1961, Bucharest, Romania.</p>
