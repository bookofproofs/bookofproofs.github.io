<p><strong>Karl Rohn</strong>  was a German mathematician, who studied geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 1884 Rohn was promoted to extraordinary professor at Leipzig, then in 1887 he became a full professor at Technische Hochschule in Dresden where he held the chair of descriptive geometry.</li>
<li>He said that Rohn's work on this topic was the most significant.</li>
<li>One of Rohn's models for the Kummer surface uses the generating lines on a hyperboloid of one sheet.</li>
<li>Gifted with a strong spatial intuition, Rohn possessed outstanding ability to select geometric facts from algebraic relations.</li>
<li>Rohn constructed models of surfaces and space curves that he was studying, particularly in the early part of his career.</li>
<li>In 1884 the Jablonowski Society proposed as prize problem asking for essays on the general surface of order 4, extending the work of Schläfli, Klein and Zeuthen on cubic surfaces; they awarded the prize to Rohn for his essay in 1886.</li>
<li>Rohn was made rector of the Technical University of Dresden during 1900-01.</li>
<li>In Dresden, Rohn gave the course 'Darstellende Geometrie' in the summer of 1904.</li>
<li>From 1 April 1905 until his death, Rohn held the chair of mathematics at the University of Leipzig.</li>
<li>Let us look briefly at some of the mathematical highlights of Rohn's career, some of which have already been mentioned.</li>
<li>Rohn published three papers contributing to this problem.</li>
<li>After Rohn's death, the book Stereometrie: Ein Handbuch für Studierende und Lehrer Ⓣ(Stereometry: A Handbook for Students and Teachers) (1922) was published.</li>
<li>Dr Rohn was himself a pupil of Professor Klein, and the latter, in his appreciative introduction, speaks highly of his skill in the field of geometry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 28 January 1855, Schwanheim (near Bensheim), Hesse, Germany. Died 4 August 1920, Leipzig, Germany.</p>
