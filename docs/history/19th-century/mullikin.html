<p><strong>Anna Margaret Mullikin</strong>  was an American mathematician who was one of the early investigators of point set theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anna Mullikin taught mathematics first at Science Hill School in Shelbyville, Kentucky, taking up the appointment in 1915 following her graduation.</li>
<li>On 25 October 1919 Robert Moore read a paper by Mullikin to a meeting of the American Mathematical Society held at Columbia University.</li>
<li>He arranged a position for Mullikin as an Instructor at the University of Texas for the session 1920-21.</li>
<li>The American Mathematical Society met again at Columbia University on 28 December 1920 and Mullikin, now at the University of Texas in Austin, attended the meeting and gave a lecture on Certain theorems concerning connected point sets.</li>
<li>On 26 February 1921 the American Mathematical Society met again at Columbia University but this time neither Mullikin nor Robert Moore attended.</li>
<li>However Mullikin's paper A necessary and sufficient condition that the sum of two bounded, closed and connected point sets should disconnect the plane was read to the Society by title.</li>
<li>It is clear that by this stage Mullikin had proved all the results which she would include in her thesis.</li>
<li>Leaving Austin, Mullikin returned to the University of Pennsylvania after teaching for a year at the University of Texas.</li>
<li>Although Robert Moore was now at the University of Texas he continued to be Mullikin's thesis advisor.</li>
<li>We note that the Transactions had a policy not to publish doctoral theses so it is a tribute to the quality and importance of Mullikin's work that they agreed publication.</li>
<li>Zygmunt Janiszewski, who died in January 1920, had proved similar results to Mullikin although her work was completely independent of his.</li>
<li>Mullikin's results have been highly significant in the development of the subject.</li>
<li>In 1922-23 Mullikin taught at the William Penn High School for Girls in Philadelphia after which she was appointed to Germantown High School.</li>
<li>Towards the end of her teaching career, Mullikin collaborated with Ethel L Grove, who had taught at Cuyahoga Heights High School in Cleveland, and Ewart L Grove, who taught at the University of Alabama, in writing textbooks.</li>
<li>As a high-school teacher Mullikin served as an excellent mentor and role model for all her students during a 40-year teaching career.</li>
<li>As a person Miss Mullikin was generous of spirit and purse, leaving a financial legacy which continues to benefit humanity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 March 1893, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Died 24 August 1975, Philadelphia, USA.</p>
