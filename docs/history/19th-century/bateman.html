<p><strong>Harry Bateman</strong> was an English mathematician who did extensive work in analysis -- particularly on Special Functions and Integral Transforms.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Harry attended Manchester Grammar School where he first grew to love mathematics, and in his final year he won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge.</li>
<li>Bateman was awarded a Smith's prize in 1905 for an essay on differential equations.</li>
<li>Bateman began publishing mathematics while he was still an undergraduate.</li>
<li>During the years 1905 and 1906 Bateman travelled on the continent, visiting Paris and Göttingen.</li>
<li>This prompted Bateman to use the methods being developed there to study the propagation of earthquake waves.</li>
<li>Bateman emigrated to the United States in 1910 having published four papers in 1909 and seventeen papers in 1910.</li>
<li>The appointment of Bateman was a brilliant move to bring an extremely active young research mathematician into the College.</li>
<li>There is one strange aspect to Bateman's career which will not be evident from our description above.</li>
<li>When Bateman arrived there in 1917 the College had gone through a marked transition.</li>
<li>A number of superb appointments, such as that of Bateman and also the physicist Robert A Millikan, helped achieve Hale's aim.</li>
<li>Some of Bateman's early work was on geometry and the influence of geometry on all his work is evident.</li>
<li>Bateman was one of the first to apply Laplace transforms to integral equations in 1906.</li>
<li>Bateman's method was the now familiar one of applying the complex inversion formula of the Laplace transform.</li>
<li>The finest contribution Bateman made to mathematics, however, was his work on transformations of partial differential equations, in particular his general solutions containing arbitrary functions.</li>
<li>The "Guide to the Functions" which Bateman planned would have been invaluable.</li>
<li>Office of Naval Research pooled their resources to continue Bateman's task.</li>
<li>It turned out that no single section of Bateman's work was in a state suitable for immediate publication, and the field was so wide that it appeared essential to narrow it down if anything useful was to be accomplished.</li>
<li>The whole work has been carried out by the staff of the Bateman Manuscript Project, under the directorship of Arthur Erdélyi.</li>
<li>In all Bateman published around 200 papers in a period of 40 years.</li>
<li>Bateman received many honours for his contributions, including election to the Royal Society of London in 1928 and election to the National Academy of Sciences in Washington in 1930.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 May 1882, Manchester, England. Died 21 January 1946, Pasadena, California, USA.</p>
