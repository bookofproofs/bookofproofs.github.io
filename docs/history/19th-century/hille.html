<h1>Person: Hille, Einar Carl</h1>

<p><strong>Einar Carl Hille</strong> was an American mathematician who worked on analysis and functional analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>That was the name by which Einar Hille was always known.</li>
<li>Although he was born in the United States, Hille's parents were Swedish.</li>
<li>Hille would spend the next 24 years of his life in Sweden only returning to the United States when he was 26 years old.</li>
<li>In 1900 Einar entered the Palmsgrenska Samskola, a private school in Stockholm.</li>
<li>Hille entered the University of Stockholm in 1911 with the intention of reading for a degree in chemistry.</li>
<li>Hille made an impressive start to his career in chemistry with his first publication in 1913 being jointly with Euler-Chelpin.</li>
<li>However, Hille decided that he did not have the necessary dexterity to make a career in a subject which involved delicate experiments.</li>
<li>Hille was fortunate in not only having a world class chemist to work under in Stockholm, but also world class mathematicians.</li>
<li>Hille was awarded his first degree in mathematics in 1913 and the equivalent of a Master's degree in the following year.</li>
<li>Then Hille began working with Marcel Riesz on conformal mappings and submitted a thesis on that topic in 1916; for this he was awarded a Lic.</li>
<li>In 1919 Hille was awarded the Mittag-Leffler prize for his outstanding contributions, and was given the right to teach at the University of Stockholm.</li>
<li>Hille obtained a fellowship to work with Birkhoff in Harvard and he returned to the land of his birth in 1920, spending the academic year 1920-21 at Harvard where, as well as working with Birkhoff, he also studied with Kellogg.</li>
<li>In academic year 1921-22 Hille was Benjamin Peirce Instructor at Harvard then, in 1922, he went to Princeton as an instructor.</li>
<li>In 1923 Hille was promoted to assistant professor at Princeton, and in 1927 to associate professor.</li>
<li>Hille was appointed director of graduate studies in 1938 and he held this position, and his chair, at Yale until he retired in 1962.</li>
<li>Hille's main work was on integral equations, differential equations, special functions, Dirichlet series and Fourier series.</li>
<li>Among Hille's other texts were Analytic function theory Vol 1 (1959), Vol 2 (1964); Analysis Vol 1 (1964), Vol 2 (1966); Lectures on ordinary differential equations (1969); Methods in classical and functional analysis (1972); and Ordinary differential equations in the complex domain (1976).</li>
<li>The book also contains a personal account of Hille's mathematical career which he gave at the Yale Colloquium in May 1962.</li>
<li>Hille served as president of the American Mathematical Society (1937-38) and was the Society's Colloquium lecturer in 1944.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 28 June 1894, New York, USA. Died 12 February 1980, La Jolla, California, USA.</p>
