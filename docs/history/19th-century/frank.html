<p><strong>Philipp Frank</strong> was an Austrian-born physicist, mathematician and philosopher who moved to America.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Philipp studied physics at the University of Vienna obtaining a doctorate in theoretical physics in 1907 after working under Boltzmann.</li>
<li>The group of students that Frank is describing in this quotation is the group who would eventually become known as the Vienna Circle.</li>
<li>During this time Frank became a friend of von Mises, who obtained his doctorate from Vienna in the 1907, the same year as Frank.</li>
<li>In 1907 Frank wrote an important paper on causality.</li>
<li>Einstein was impressed by Frank's ideas which he put forward in this paper and the resulting discussions led to another life long friendship, this time between Frank and Einstein.</li>
<li>Frank received his habilitation and was appointed a lecturer in the University of Vienna in 1910.</li>
<li>On Einstein's recommendation Frank succeeded him to the chair of theoretical physics in the German University of Prague in 1912.</li>
<li>Frank, Hahn and von Mises became part of the somewhat larger group active during the 1920s in the Vienna Circle of Logical Positivists.</li>
<li>The friendship between Frank and von Mises developed into a collaboration in the mid 1920s.</li>
<li>Frank had married on 16 November 1920, his wife being Hania Gerson.</li>
<li>Frank remained at the German University in Prague until 1938.</li>
<li>Political pressure was put on Frank and other members of the Vienna Circle, and the group disbanded with many of its members including Frank fleeing to the United States.</li>
<li>In the United States Frank was first appointed as a visiting lecturer, then made a lecturer in physics and mathematics at Harvard.</li>
<li>In 1947 Frank wrote an excellent biography Einstein: His Life and Times.</li>
<li>Frank worked on a wide range of topics in mathematics, and when one takes into account his publications on physics and philosophy it was a truly remarkable breadth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 20 March 1884, Vienna, Austria. Died 21 July 1966, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.</p>
