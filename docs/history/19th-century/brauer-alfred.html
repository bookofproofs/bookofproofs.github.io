<h1>Person: Brauer, Alfred</h1>

<p><strong>Alfred Brauer</strong> was a German-American mathematician who worked in number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Max Brauer's wife was Lilly Caroline and Alfred was the oldest of their three children.</li>
<li>He had an younger, and more famous, brother Richard Brauer, who also has a biography in this archive.</li>
<li>Alfred Brauer was seven years older than Richard and of an age between the two brothers was Alfred's sister Alice.</li>
<li>The Brauers were a Jewish family and they would live through a period in German history when to be non-Aryan brought great hardships and suffering.</li>
<li>Brauer was back studying at the University of Berlin after World War I.</li>
<li>In 1920 he attended Schur's seminar along with his brother Richard Brauer so by this stage Alfred, although seven years older than his brother, was at much the same stage in his education.</li>
<li>In 1921 Alfred, working with his brother Richard, solved one of Schur's open problems and this would set both brothers on their way as researchers.</li>
<li>In 1928 Brauer's dissertation, written under Schur's guidance at the University of Berlin, was published and he began to teach at the University.</li>
<li>Brauer certainly qualified under this clause and this allowed him to keep his lecturing post in Berlin in 1933.</li>
<li>Brauer had been one of the organisers of the Mathematisch-physikalische Arbeitsgemeinschaft which was an organisation for students in the University of Berlin who held views at odds with the extreme right views of many of the other students.</li>
<li>The exemption clause saw Brauer able to hold his lecturing post until 1935 but he was dismissed in that year despite the exemption clause in the Civil Service Law which was simply disregarded after decisions at the Nuremberg party congress in the autumn of 1935.</li>
<li>Brauer was still in Berlin hoping to be allowed to emigrate in 1938 but there were problems on all sides.</li>
<li>We should note in passing that the driving force behind that committee who was responsible for saving Brauer(and many other German academics) was the American Stephen Duggan.</li>
<li>Brauer left Germany in 1939, but Brauer's sister Alice stayed behind and was murdered in a concentration camp by the Nazis.</li>
<li>Another who had helped arrange for Brauer to go to the United States was Weyl.</li>
<li>When Brauer reached the USA he went to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton as Weyl's assistant.</li>
<li>Brauer remained at the Institute for Advanced Study until 1942, but during these three years he also lectured at New York University.</li>
<li>In 1942 he moved to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and later built up the mathematics library there to a very excellent one now named the "Alfred T Brauer Library".</li>
<li>Brauer made major contributions to number theory, for example on the non-existence of odd perfect numbers of certain forms, and the Khinchin conjecture which was later proved and extended by Henry B Mann.</li>
<li>From the late 1950s Brauer published a series of papers on nonnegative matrices, a topic studied by Frobenius towards the end of his career.</li>
<li>Brauer also published results on stochastic matrices and tournament matrices.</li>
<li>Brauer retired at age 70 from the University of North Carolina and then taught for eight more years at Wake Forest University.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 9 April 1894, Berlin, Germany. Died 23 December 1985, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.</p>
