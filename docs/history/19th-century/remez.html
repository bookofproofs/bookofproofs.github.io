<p><strong>Evgeny Yakovlevich Remez</strong> was a Belarus mathematician. He is known for his work in the constructive function theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remez graduated in 1924 and began to teach both at the Institute of Public Education and at the Mechanical Trade School.</li>
<li>Remez lived in Kiev, teaching at various institutions there, for most of his life.</li>
<li>The Institute of Mathematics had only been founded in Kiev shortly before Remez began to work there.</li>
<li>Now we said above that Remez obtained his Ph.D. in 1929.</li>
<li>Professorships were only open to those holding the degree of Doctor of Sciences, so it was important to Remez that he work towards this degree.</li>
<li>In the mid 1930s, he developed general computational methods of Chebyshev approximation and the Remez algorithm which allows uniform approximation.</li>
<li>Remez generalised Chebyshev-Markov characterisation theory and used it to obtain approximate solutions of differential equations.</li>
<li>For some mathematicians, Remez is best known as the author of the book General computation methods for Chebyshev approximation.</li>
<li>Of course this was a topic which developed quickly over the following years, much of the development being due to Remez and his students.</li>
<li>Not only did Remez develop techniques which originated with Chebyshev, but he also became an expert on Chebyshev and his work.</li>
<li>Remez lectured at this meeting on Chebyshev's work on approximation theory.</li>
<li>In 1974 Remez published Some of the principal divisions of P L Chebyshev's scientific activity (Ukrainian) which discussed Chebyshev's contributions to number theory, the theory of mechanisms, approximation of functions, minimax problems, and cartography.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 17 February 1896, Mstsislau, Mahiliou gubernia, Belarus. Died 31 August 1975, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine).</p>
