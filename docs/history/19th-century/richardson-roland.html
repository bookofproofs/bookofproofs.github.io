<p><strong>Roland Richardson</strong> was a Canadian mathematician who worked in the USA. He is known for his work at Brown University and with the American Mathematical Society.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After completing his secondary education, Richardson was appointed as a teacher at the fishing village of Margaretsville in Annapolis County, Nova Scotia.</li>
<li>Renamed Acadia College in 1841, it had become Acadia University in 1891, five years before Richardson began his studies there.</li>
<li>In 1899 Richardson was appointed as principal of the High School in Westport, Nova Scotia.</li>
<li>Richardson continued as principal of the High School in Westport for three years before, in 1902, he entered Yale University.</li>
<li>Given these research interests it was natural that he should steer Richardson in this direction.</li>
<li>Richardson was awarded his Ph.D. in 1906 for his thesis Improper Multiple Integrals.</li>
<li>In 1907 Richardson accepted the offer of an appointment as assistant professor of mathematics at Brown University.</li>
<li>In 1909 Richardson returned to his position as Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Brown University.</li>
<li>Roland and Louise had one son, George Webdell Richardson, born 7 July 1920 in Providence, Rhode Island.</li>
<li>Even though by 1928 Richardson's duties as dean and secretary, in addition to demands upon him as chairman of a department, had forced him to give up his own scientific research, he had through the years been laying sure foundations for the establishment of a strong department, for attracting not only candidates for the doctorate in mathematical analysis, but also those seeking post-doctoral inspiration.</li>
<li>In 1938 (after more than a decade of earlier consideration) when the American Mathematical Society was active in the establishment of Mathematical Reviews, Richardson was mainly instrumental in arranging not only that Brown should provide housing for the project, but also that its chief editor should be brought from Europe as a professor, adding strength to his department.</li>
<li>In December 1920 Richardson became the Secretary of the American Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>Richardson was deeply appreciative of the Council's action not only in presenting to him a beautifully hand-illuminated copy of the resolution of appreciation adopted by the Council upon his retirement as secretary, together with a silver coffee set, and for Mrs Richardson a handbag, but also in dedicating to him the 1941 volume of this Bulletin.</li>
<li>A number of articles written by Richardson were important in taking an overview of different aspects of mathematics instruction in America.</li>
<li>Richardson attended the International Congress of Mathematicians at Zurich, Switzerland, on 4-12 September.</li>
<li>Richardson received many honours for his contributions in addition to those bestowed by the American Mathematical Society mentioned in a quote above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 May 1878, Dartmouth, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Died 17 July 1949, South River Lake, Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada.</p>
