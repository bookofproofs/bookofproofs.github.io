<p><strong>Gheorghe Țițeica</strong> was a Romanian mathematician who worked in geometry. He was a founder of the Romanian school of differential geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The city, situated near the Jiu River, 185 km west of Bucharest, was a good centre for music and the arts which suited Țițeica very well.</li>
<li>Teachers at the school, and Țițeica's friends, all encouraged him to go to Paris and study further mathematics, and this he did in 1897 when he entered the École Normale Superieure.</li>
<li>Țițeica flourished in Paris having teachers and friends with outstanding mathematical abilities who inspired him to produce excellent research.</li>
<li>Returning to Romania, Țițeica was appointed as an assistant professor at the University of Bucharest where he taught the course on differential and integral calculus.</li>
<li>Țițeica's research contributions were mainly in geometry, in particular affine differential geometry.</li>
<li>His book Géométrie différentielle projective des réseaux Ⓣ(Differential geometry of projective networks) (1923) consisted mostly of Țițeica's own results.</li>
<li>Further investigations of such structures led Țițeica to develop further beautiful theory which he set out in his book The projective differential geometry of lattices (1927).</li>
<li>As well as being famed for this geometrical research, Țițeica also gave a famous geometry course at Bucharest University over many years.</li>
<li>Another important contribution made by Țițeica was his work with the Journal of Mathematics, which published research contributions, and Natura, a magazine he co-founded which published popular scientific articles.</li>
<li>He notes in particular the non-parochial emphasis Țițeica placed on learning about, and incorporating, the experiences of other countries, while at the same time keeping in mind their relevance to Romanian national spirit and culture.</li>
<li>Țițeica was elected a corresponding fellow of the Maryland Academy of Science in 1930, a fellow of the Royal Society of Science in Liège in 1934 and, in the same year, he was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Warsaw.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 October 1874, Turnu-Severin, Oltenia, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Romania). Died 5 February 1939, Bucharest, Romania.</p>
