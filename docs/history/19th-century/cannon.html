<p><strong>Annie Jump Cannon</strong> was an American astronomer whose work led to the Harvard Stellar Classification Scheme.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It was with Mary's encouragement of the subject that Annie would, in the attic of their house using an old astronomy textbook, learn the constellations and identify stars.</li>
<li>One of the first to enrol, from 1880 Annie attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts, one of the top academic schools for women at the time.</li>
<li>Annie returned to Wellesley for graduate study in mathematics, physics and astronomy.</li>
<li>Under the guidance of Professor Sarah Frances Whiting (1847-1927), one of the few female physicists in the United States at the time, Annie gained an interest in the spectroscopic analysis of light.</li>
<li>To advance her work, and access a better telescope, Cannon enrolled at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts as a 'special student'.</li>
<li>She added Annie to the team in 1896.</li>
<li>The Second Catalogue of Variable Stars was produced by Annie Cannon and published in 1907 in the Annals of the Astronomical Observatory at Harvard College as Volume 55 Part I.</li>
<li>It was here that Annie would conduct the work for which she would be remembered.</li>
<li>Cannon saw an easier way.</li>
<li>Soon it was realised that Cannon's scheme of stellar classification was based upon the stars' temperatures, where the ordering is from O the hottest to M the coolest, and it was established that it was a suitable method.</li>
<li>It was with this classification method that Cannon et al.</li>
<li>With only minor adaptations, the method of classification Cannon implemented is still used today.</li>
<li>Miss Cannon sailed for Europe on June first and received the degree in person.</li>
<li>And it is to Miss Cannon's untiring work during the past thirty years that much of the present knowledge of stellar spectra owes its existence.</li>
<li>She turned over this money to the American Astronomical Society allowing the establishment of the Annie Jump Cannon Award, a prize given to a female astronomer, within five years of her receiving her doctorate, for her distinguished contribution to astronomy.</li>
<li>One of the other women working in the observatory who also made significant contributions was Henrietta Swan Leavitt, who, like Annie, was deaf.</li>
<li>Other than her work in the observatory, Cannon played a major role in the development, and the gain in popularity, of astronomy.</li>
<li>Cannon officially retired from the observatory in 1940, but continued researching until her death the following year.</li>
<li>Over a career of more than 40 years, Annie not only boosted the reputation of astronomy, but also helped women gain acceptance and respect within the scientific community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 December 1863, Dover, Delaware, USA. Died 13 April 1941, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.</p>
