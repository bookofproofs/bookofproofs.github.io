<p><strong>David Widder</strong> was an American mathematician who worked on integral transforms and partial differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>David Henry Widder, born in Montsera, Pennsylvania, was a railway mail clerk who died of myocarditis in Harrisburg.</li>
<li>David Henry Widder and Edith Drabenstadt were married in 1893.</li>
<li>David Widder, the subject of this biography, had a sister Freda Bernice Widder (1894-1959) who was four years older than him.</li>
<li>We note at this point that Freda B Widder graduated from the Central High School, Harrisburg, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.</li>
<li>The above information about Widder's family comes various census returns and the details about his parents is confirmed on Widder's 'Certificate of Intention of Marriage'.</li>
<li>David Widder, the subject of this biography, like his sister Freda attended Central High School, Harrisburg.</li>
<li>In this school he sat beside a student called Rusty who said that Harvard was the best university so Widder applied to Harvard, took the entrance examination, and was accepted to begin his studies in September 1916.</li>
<li>Back at Harvard, Widder took courses on complex variable from William Caspar Graustein (1888-1941) who, like Widder, had been at the Aberdeen Proving Ground.</li>
<li>Edward B Van Vleck from the University of Wisconsin was visiting Harvard for a term and also taught Widder who graduated in 1920.</li>
<li>After his year abroad, Widder returned to Harvard for the beginning of the 1921-22 academic year.</li>
<li>Widder was awarded his Ph.D. in 1924 for his thesis Theorems of mean value and trigonometric interpolation.</li>
<li>After the award of his Ph.D., Widder was appointed to Bryn Mawr College where the head of mathematics was Anna Pell.</li>
<li>At this time Widder was appointed so succeed her as head of mathematics.</li>
<li>In 1930 Widder moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, when he was given a joint appointment to Radcliffe College and Harvard University.</li>
<li>Ada Comstock negotiated a new relationship between Radcliffe College and Harvard University in the 1940s and eventually Widder became a full professor at Harvard.</li>
<li>Widder, in collaboration with Arthur Coble and Joseph Miller Thomas, became a founding managing editor of the Duke Mathematical Journal in 1935.</li>
<li>Widder's book The Laplace Transform was published in 1941.</li>
<li>By the time the book was published, Widder had married.</li>
<li>David and Vera Widder had two children, David Charles Widder (5 August 1940 - 28 December 2010) and Edith Anne Widder (born 11 June 1951).</li>
<li>Let us note at this point that David C Widder studied Mechanical Engineering at Northeastern University and Edith Widder studied biology at Tufts University.</li>
<li>She married David Smith, a computer scientist.</li>
<li>Widder attended many conferences, helped to organise some and made research visits.</li>
<li>On 2 August 1954 Widder, his wife and children went to France for six weeks.</li>
<li>Widder attended this Congress and his wife Vera accompanied him.</li>
<li>His wife Vera Widder continued to teach mathematics.</li>
<li>In addition to The Laplace transform (1941) which we mentioned above, Widder wrote several other important books.</li>
<li>David Widder died in Arlington, Massachusetts and was buried in Maytown Union Cemetery in Maytown, Pennsylvania, his mother's home town.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 March 1898, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 8 July 1990, Arlington, Massachusetts, USA.</p>
