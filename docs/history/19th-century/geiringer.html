<p><strong>Hilda Geiringer</strong> was an Austrian-born mathematician who worked in Statistics and Mechanics. She was married to Richard von Mises.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>At Gymnasium Hilda showed great mathematical ability and her parents supported her financially so that she could study mathematics at the University of Vienna.</li>
<li>After receiving her first degree, Geiringer continued her study of mathematics at Vienna, working under Wirtinger for her doctorate.</li>
<li>In 1921 Geiringer moved to Berlin where she was employed as an assistant to von Mises in the Institute of Applied Mathematics.</li>
<li>Although trained as a pure mathematician, Geiringer moved towards applied mathematics to fit in with the work being undertaken at the Institute of Applied Mathematics.</li>
<li>The controversy and Geiringer's unpublished reminiscences reveal the decisive influence of Richard von Mises ...</li>
<li>The debate over Geiringer's theses for Habilitation opens up a chapter of the history of mathematical statistics, namely, expansions of a discrete distribution with an infinite number of values in a series in successive derivatives of the Poisson distribution with respect to the parameter.</li>
<li>Under this law, Geiringer lost the right to teach at the university in December 1933.</li>
<li>Von Mises, though a convert to Catholicism from Judaism, left Germany at the very end of 1933 to take up a newly founded chair of mathematics in Istanbul and, in 1934, Geiringer followed him to Istanbul.</li>
<li>Again of course, Geiringer had to learn another language in order to teach.</li>
<li>In addition to her lecturing duties at Bryn Mawr College, Geiringer undertook classified work for the National Research Council as part of the war effort.</li>
<li>Neyman, who himself had emigrated to the United States, wrote a report on Geiringer in April 1940, shortly after she arrived from Turkey.</li>
<li>There were only two members of the mathematics faculty at Wheaton College and Geiringer longed for a situation where she was among mathematicians who were carrying out research.</li>
<li>For Geiringer who had been so discriminated against in Germany because of her Jewish background, to now be discriminated against because she was a woman must have been a difficult blow.</li>
<li>In 1953 von Mises died and the following year Geiringer, although retaining her job at Wheaton College, began to work at Harvard on editing von Mises' works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 28 September 1893, Vienna, Austria. Died 22 March 1973, Santa Barbara, California, USA.</p>
