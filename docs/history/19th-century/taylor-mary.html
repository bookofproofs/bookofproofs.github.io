<p><strong>Mary Taylor Slow</strong> was a British mathematician and physicist who worked on the theory of radio waves and the application of differential equations to physics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>John Edward Taylor (1856-1932) studied at the University of London and was awarded an M.A., a B.Sc., an a B.D. (Hons).</li>
<li>He had married Caroline Shepherd on 15 March 1878 in St George the Martyr Church in Southwark, England: they had two children, a son Edward E Taylor (born 1879, who became an advertising manager for a corset manufacturer) and a daughter Mary Emma Taylor (born 1881).</li>
<li>Caroline Taylor died on 5 May 1896 at the age of 39 and John Edward Taylor married Sarah Hett, the daughter of Charles Hett, the foreman in a silver refinery, and Mary Bennett in 1897.</li>
<li>John Edward Taylor was headmaster of the Sheffield Central School and the Taylor family lived at Sandon Cottage, 92 Brunswick Street, Sheffield.</li>
<li>Mary had a younger sister, Dorothy Taylor (born 1903).</li>
<li>Mary attended Pomona Street Elementary School in Sheffield before continuing her education at Sheffield High School.</li>
<li>Taylor was awarded a BA by Cambridge in 1919, having studied both the Mathematical Tripos and the Natural Science Tripos.</li>
<li>As well as teaching mathematics, Taylor became interested in the theory of radio waves and began research on the topic under the direction of Edward Appleton who was at this time working at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge.</li>
<li>Taylor left Cambridge and went to Göttingen in Germany where she continued to study aspects of electromagnetic waves.</li>
<li>Taylor returned to England in 1929 and was appointed as a Scientific Officer at the Radio Research Station in Slough, Berkshire.</li>
<li>In 1934 Taylor married Clive Slow and as a consequence had to leave her position at the Radio Research Station under the Civil Service rules which were in force at that time.</li>
<li>Mary and Clive Slow had two daughters.</li>
<li>Mary Slow then taught mathematics in local schools, in particular Worcester Grammar School for Girls, and Lawnside, Malvern.</li>
<li>He set about educating himself and was rewarded with a London B.Sc. (external) and then found his first job at the Slough Radio Research Station, where his work with Watson-Watt and Wilkins drew him into the radar story, and provided him with a wife, Dr Mary Taylor, a brilliant mathematician.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 July 1898, Sheffield, England. Died 26 May 1984, Malvern, England.</p>
