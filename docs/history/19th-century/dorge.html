<p><strong>Karl Dörge</strong> was a German mathematician whose specialties were real functions, probabilities and analytic number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Friedrich Dörge was born in Eickendorf near Haldensleben on 16 May 1864.</li>
<li>Karl spent the first five years of his life in Müllerdorf.</li>
<li>In 1905 the family moved to Seyda, a village in the district of Wittenberg, where again Dörge's father Friedrich was the local pastor.</li>
<li>Until he was thirteen years old, Karl was educated by private tutors.</li>
<li>From his father, Karl learnt religion, mathematics, history and German.</li>
<li>Dörge followed this route, enlisted for the army and he passed the Notabitur in Torgau in 1915.</li>
<li>In 1919, now nearly twenty years old, Dörge was able to continue his education which had been disrupted by the war.</li>
<li>Dörge's years of study at university had been difficult one since Germany went through a period of hyperinflation which made life close to impossible.</li>
<li>Dörge habilitated at the University of Cologne in 1926.</li>
<li>In 1932 Dörge was promoted to extraordinary professor at the University of Cologne.</li>
<li>This did not directly affect Dörge but, of course, the large impact on mathematics throughout Germany had an indirect impact on everyone.</li>
<li>(He committed suicide on 26 January 1942 when it was clear he was about to be sent to a concentration camp.) On 26 February 1936 the University of Bonn submitted the following names for the Hausdorff succession to the Ministry of Education: Ernst Kähler, Konrad Knopp and Karl Dörge.</li>
<li>Dörge remained in Cologne and, perhaps as a consequence of being recommended for a full chair in Bonn, he was appointed to a full chair at Cologne later in 1936.</li>
<li>Dörge continued working on algebra and number theory.</li>
<li>In 1938 Dörge's father, by this time 74 years old, came to live with his son at his home in Lindenthal on the west side of Cologne.</li>
<li>Friedrich Dörge spent the last five years of his life living with his son and died on 28 May 1943.</li>
<li>Dörge published a number of books.</li>
<li>Klaus Wagner (31 March 1910 - 6 February 2000) was Dörge's most famous student.</li>
<li>He received his Ph.D. from the University of Cologne in 1937 advised by Dörge, and taught at Cologne for many years becoming head of the Cologne graph theory school.</li>
<li>Later in his career Dörge studied universal algebra.</li>
<li>We should add one further fact about Dörge, namely his passion for art.</li>
<li>Dörge's copy was made in 1600 while the original now hangs in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte in Naples.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 November 1899, Müllerdorf, near Halle, Saxony, Germany. Died 16 June 1975, Bensberg, Germany.</p>
