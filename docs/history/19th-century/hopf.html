<h1>Person: Hopf, Heinz</h1>

<p><strong>Hopf</strong>'s work was in algebraic topology. He studied vector fields and extended Lefschetz's fixed point formula. He also studied homotopy classes and defined what is now known as the 'Hopf invariant'.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elizabeth Hopf was a Protestant and, in 1895, Wilhelm converted to his wife's religion.</li>
<li>Heinz attended Dr Karl Mittelhaus's school from 1901 until 1904 and following this he began his studies at the König-Wilhelm Gymnasium in Breslau.</li>
<li>In April 1913 Hopf entered the Silesian Friedrich Wilhelms University in Breslau to read for a degree in mathematics.</li>
<li>During a fortnight's leave from military service in 1917 Hopf went to a class by Schmidt on set theory at the University of Breslau.</li>
<li>After the war Hopf returned to his studies in Breslau but after about a year he left and went to the University of Heidelberg.</li>
<li>At Heidelberg Hopf took courses in philosophy and psychology as well as attending courses by Perron and Stäckel.</li>
<li>In 1920 Hopf went to study for his doctorate at the University of Berlin where Schmidt was now teaching.</li>
<li>Hopf went to Göttingen in 1925 where he met Emmy Noether.</li>
<li>Her contributions would play an important part in Hopf's developing ideas.</li>
<li>During this year in Göttingen Hopf worked on his habilitation thesis which was completed by the autumn of 1926.</li>
<li>Aleksandrov and Hopf spent some time in 1926 in the south of France with Neugebauer.</li>
<li>This was an important year in the development of topology with Aleksandrov and Hopf in Princeton and able to collaborate with Lefschetz, Veblen and Alexander.</li>
<li>During their year in Princeton, Aleksandrov and Hopf planned a joint multi-volume work on Topology the first volume of which did not appear until 1935.</li>
<li>In 1930 Weyl left his chair in the ETH in Zürich to take up a chair at Göttingen and in 1931 Hopf was approached to see if he was interested in accepting this chair.</li>
<li>However, before receiving the formal offer from Zürich, Hopf received the offer of a chair at Freiburg but he waited for the Zürich offer and accepted it.</li>
<li>The next few years were not easy ones for Hopf.</li>
<li>Hopf continued to visit his parents in Breslau up until 1939.</li>
<li>Hopf was able to provide refuge in Switzerland for friends who had to flee Germany under the Nazis.</li>
<li>Hopf's own position became more difficult, however, for he was still a German citizen.</li>
<li>Lefschetz, realising Hopf's difficulties, invited him to Princeton but Hopf refused.</li>
<li>Soon after the Oberwolfach visit, Hopf went to the United States where he spent six months and there he renewed many old friendships.</li>
<li>Most of Hopf's work was in algebraic topology where he can be thought of as continuing Brouwer's work.</li>
<li>Hopf extended Lefschetz's fixed point formula in work which he undertook in 1928.</li>
<li>He defined what is now known as the 'Hopf invariant' in 1931.</li>
<li>The ideas which he introduced in this investigation led to him defining what is today called a Hopf algebra.</li>
<li>The honours which Hopf received are almost too numerous to list.</li>
<li>But Heinz Hopf was not only a gifted researcher: he was also an excellent teacher and a personality of the highest integrity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 November 1894, Gräbschen (near Breslau), Germany (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 3 June 1971, Zollikon, Switzerland.</p>
