<p><strong>Warren Weaver</strong> was an American mathematician famous as one of the pioneers of machine translation.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It was in Madison that Weaver attended secondary school and also where he entered the University of Wisconsin.</li>
<li>Weaver initially intended to train to become an engineer, but he was influenced to move towards applied mathematics and mathematical physics by his teachers, in particular Max Mason.</li>
<li>The other influence on Weaver was Charles Slichter who was professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin and had earlier influenced Mason to change from engineering to mathematics.</li>
<li>Weaver was awarded a B.S. in 1916 and a C.E. in the following year.</li>
<li>Weaver was clearly in this latter category.</li>
<li>However during the years that he was undertaking research for his doctorate Weaver had other jobs: he was assistant professor of mathematics at Throop Polytechnic Institute in Pasadena, California during 1917-18.</li>
<li>Weaver also served in the U.S. Air Force from 1917 to 1919, and married Mary Hemenway in 1919; they had two children.</li>
<li>After completing his war service in the Air Force, Weaver returned to Throop Polytechnic Institute in 1919 where he taught for a year as an assistant professor of mathematics before returning to Wisconsin-Madison to complete his doctoral studies; he was awarded his Ph.D. in 1921.</li>
<li>After becoming president, Mason approached Weaver to take up the post of director of the Natural Sciences Division.</li>
<li>Weaver was appointed in 1932 and held the position until 1957.</li>
<li>As developed by Weaver, the program operated on a worldwide basis and stressed the acquisition of knowledge - that is, it was conscientiously pure science.</li>
<li>Weaver personally chose the grantees; peer review was not his style.</li>
<li>Perhaps Weaver is best known for his work as an applied mathematician during World War II.</li>
<li>Weaver suffered a serious illness shortly after the end of the war.</li>
<li>Let us mention another aspect of Weaver's work.</li>
<li>Some ideas are suggested in this paper by Weaver for a broader application of the fundamental principles of communication theory.</li>
<li>Weaver was also famed for his popular writings on science.</li>
<li>Having worked for the private support of science for most of his life, Weaver's book U.S. Philanthropic Foundations : Their History, Structure, Management and Record (1967) is written by someone who understood intimately the workings of such institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 17 July 1894, Reedsburg, Wisconsin, USA. Died 24 November 1978, Upper Milford, Connecticut, USA.</p>
