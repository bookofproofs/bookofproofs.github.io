<p><strong>Charles Boys</strong> was an English physicist, known for his careful and innovative experimental work.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Charles was one of a large family, being his parents' eighth child, and he was brought up in the vicarage at Wing.</li>
<li>From there Boys went to the Royal School of Mines where he was taught physics by Frederick Guthrie.</li>
<li>The school had no mathematics department so Boys learnt mathematics from books including Todhunter's Integral Calculus.</li>
<li>Boys is famed as a physicist and inventor of instruments.</li>
<li>After graduating in mining it was natural for Boys to seek employment at a colliery, which he did.</li>
<li>It was by using a quartz fibre suspension in Cavendish type experiments that Boys was able to improve the value obtained for the gravitational constant.</li>
<li>In 1888 Boys was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.</li>
<li>In 1887 Boys took up an applied science post of Metropolitan Gas Referee and he held this post until the Referees were abolished in 1939.</li>
<li>Boys divorced his wife in 1910 after 18 years of marriage.</li>
<li>Boys received many honours in addition to election to the fellowship of the Royal Society which we mentioned above.</li>
<li>The University of Edinburgh awarded Boys an honorary degree in 1932.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 March 1855, Wing, Rutland, England. Died 30 March 1944, St Mary Bourne, Andover, Hampshire, England.</p>
