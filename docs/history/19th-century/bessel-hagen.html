<h1>Person: Bessel-Hagen, Erich</h1>

<p><strong>Erich Bessel-Hagen</strong> was a German mathematician and a historian of mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are a number of incorrect explanations of Bessel-Hagen's name in the literature, so we should explain where the slightly strange name originated.</li>
<li>Although we have given Berlin as Erich Bessel-Hagen's birthplace, this is not quite accurate since he was actually born outside but close to that city.</li>
<li>Bessel-Hagen attended the University of Berlin where he obtained a doctorate working under Constantin Carathéodory, with some help from Erhard Schmidt.</li>
<li>While at Berlin, however, Bessel-Hagen had also heard lectures from the famous classicist, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Möllendorf, and was inspired by him to a life-long devotion to classical antiquity as well.</li>
<li>At Berlin, Bessel-Hagen met his fellow student Carl Siegel and the two became life-long friends.</li>
<li>After graduating with his doctorate, Bessel-Hagen was appointed to Göttingen University.</li>
<li>Felix Klein had an exceptionally strong influence on him, for not only did Bessel-Hagen live in Klein's house, but he was Klein's private assistant from 1921 to 1923.</li>
<li>Bessel-Hagen was one of a small number who had attended these lectures delivered in Klein's home.</li>
<li>Braun says that Siegel and Bessel-Hagen first met as students in Berlin.</li>
<li>Bessel-Hagen revered Siegel for his mathematical ability, and Siegel in turn was gratified to be admired by someone he could accept.</li>
<li>They were friends all their lives, until Bessel-Hagen's early death in 1946.</li>
<li>Bessel-Hagen walked with a slight limp - Braun thought because of polio.</li>
<li>Schaffeld, Siegel, and Bessel-Hagen were united in their attitude towards marriage.</li>
<li>In contrast, Siegel couldn't resist baiting or playing sometimes cruel and humiliating practical jokes on Bessel-Hagen.</li>
<li>Siegel had to review Bessel-Hagen's thesis for habilitation - perhaps as a friend, perhaps in some official capacity.</li>
<li>However, it came to him at a time when he was deeply involved in his own research, and Bessel-Hagen's thesis was in a different area.</li>
<li>he told Bessel-Hagen he had done him a favour.</li>
<li>To make up, he invited Bessel-Hagen on a long vacation to Greece.</li>
<li>Bessel-Hagen also played a major role in establishing the historical division, including an important library, as part of the mathematical seminar in Bonn.</li>
<li>Bessel-Hagen was also involved in editing the works of Gauss.</li>
<li>Bessel-Hagen wrote more than 200 reviews for Neugebauer's Zentralblatt.</li>
<li>Béla Kerékjártó visited the University of Göttingen in 1922 and attended lectres by Bessel-Hagen.</li>
<li>In the following year Kerékjártó published Vorlesungen über Topologie the index of which contains a reference to Bessel-Hagen.</li>
<li>Turning to the indicated page, there is no mention of Bessel-Hagen.</li>
<li>In fact Bessel-Hagen was renowned for having large ears that stuck out of his head.</li>
<li>At first this appears to be a rather cruel joke, but in fact Kerékjártó was merely following the teaching staff at Göttingen who all made jokes at Bessel-Hagen's expense.</li>
<li>in 1935, Bessel-Hagen seems to have been the only one of his former colleagues to visit him.</li>
<li>In fact Bessel-Hagen was an excellent mathematician who, because of his shyness, did not publish much.</li>
<li>Most of the other mathematicians at Bonn were conscripted so only Bessel-Hagen and Hans Beck remained to teach.</li>
<li>After Beck died in 1942, Bessel-Hagen essentially became a one-man department.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 12 September 1898, Berlin, Germany. Died 29 March 1946, Bonn, Germany.</p>
