<p><strong>Ralph  Sampson</strong> was an Irish astronomer who worked on the theory of the motions of Jupiter's four Galilean satellites.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only at age fourteen did Ralph's formal education begin when he entered the Liverpool Institute.</li>
<li>After two years as a lecturer in mathematics in London, Sampson returned to Cambridge in 1891 when he became the first holder of the Isaac Newton Studentship in Astronomy and Physical Optics.</li>
<li>Sampson used a series of accurate observations from Harvard College Observatory to amend the existing theory of the satellite orbits, but the disagreement between theory and observation persisted.</li>
<li>Sampson also did a superb job editing one volume of the papers of his former tutor, John Couch Adams.</li>
<li>The whole work was published in several volumes between 1896 and 1900, with Sampson's volume appearing in 1900.</li>
<li>In 1910 Sampson was appointed to a professorship at the University of Edinburgh and also as Astronomer Royal for Scotland.</li>
<li>More significant was that during Sampson's presidency, women were admitted as fellows on equal terms to men.</li>
<li>Sampson received many honours for his contributions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 June 1866, Schull, Co Cork, Ireland. Died 7 November 1939, Bath, England.</p>
