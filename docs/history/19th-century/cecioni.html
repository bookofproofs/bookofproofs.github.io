<p><strong>Francesco Cecioni</strong> was an Italian mathematician who specialised in algebra.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cecioni won a place to study at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa where he came under the influence of Luigi Bianchi.</li>
<li>After graduating, in 1907 Cecioni was employed as an assistant in algebra and analytical geometry at the University of Pisa.</li>
<li>Cecioni became an infantry officer and for most of the war he fought on the Austrian front taking part in the fierce fighting which took place.</li>
<li>Cecioni did not continued teaching at the Istituto Nautico for long since he became Professor of Mathematics at the Naval Academy of Livorno.</li>
<li>Cecioni did not give up his position at the Naval Academy when appointed to the chair at the University but continued to hold both positions until 1942 when he left his role at the Academy.</li>
<li>Cecioni then moves on to recall the definition of the "row-column" product, its algebraic properties, the concept of permutable matrices, that of the exponent of a square matrix MMM, the notions of diagonal and unit matrices, the notion of matrix sum and difference, of a zero matrix and, in particular, of a linear function of a matrix (variable) XXX.</li>
<li>In the first and second chapters of his work, Cecioni discusses some particular linear equations between matrices, but he does this more generally by discussing the conditions of solubility and all of the possible solutions.</li>
<li>Cecioni's contribution to the didactics of elementary mathematics, as well as to the detailed study of that same elementary mathematics and of its foundations, is also remarkable.</li>
<li>On the theory of divisibility, Cecioni wrote the article Alcune osservazioni sulla teoria della divisibilità Ⓣ(Some observations on the theory of divisibility) (published in Boll.</li>
<li>This text includes a conspicuous part of Cecioni's lectures in Complementary Mathematics, he addressed to the students of Pisa University.</li>
<li>We are sure the reader will find stimulating and original points of views in Cecioni's conceptions, although, perhaps, he will not agree with the whole of Cecioni's view.</li>
<li>Let us return to Cecioni's career.</li>
<li>In fact this was the first volume of a major work which Cecioni was not able to complete due to deteriorating health and his death in 1968.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 December 1884, Livorno, Italy. Died 30 September 1968, Livorno, Italy.</p>
