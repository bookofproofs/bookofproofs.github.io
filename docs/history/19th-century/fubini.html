<p><strong>Guido Fubini</strong> was an Italian mathematician who worked in many different areas including analysis, the calculus of variations and group theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Guido attended secondary school in Venice where he showed that he was brilliant at mathematics and it was clear from this stage that he would follow career in the subject.</li>
<li>In 1896 Fubini entered the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa.</li>
<li>There he was taught by Dini and Bianchi who quickly influenced Fubini to undertake research in geometry.</li>
<li>However, Fubini was lucky for his teacher Bianchi was about to publish an important work on differential geometry and he discussed the results of Fubini's thesis in his treatise which appeared in 1902.</li>
<li>Fubini remained at Pisa to qualify as a university teacher.</li>
<li>In October 1901 Fubini began teaching at the University of Catania in Sicily.</li>
<li>In 1908 Fubini moved to Turin where he taught both at the Politecnico and at the University of Turin.</li>
<li>Fubini's interests were exceptionally wide moving from his early work on differential geometry towards analysis.</li>
<li>Fubini was forced to retire from his chair in Turin.</li>
<li>They emigrated to the United States immediately, although Fubini himself was in rather poor health by this time.</li>
<li>As remarked above, Fubini's interests in mathematics were wide.</li>
<li>Fubini also worked on the theory of groups.</li>
<li>Since Fubini's sons trained as engineers he took an interest in the problems they were studying.</li>
<li>The textbook, jointly authored with G Albenge, only appeared in 1954, eleven years after Fubini's death.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 January 1879, Venice, Italy. Died 6 June 1943, New York, USA.</p>
