<h1>Person: Nicoletti, Onorato</h1>

<p><strong>Onorato Nicoletti</strong>  was an Italian mathematician who worked in various fields of mathematics, including numerical analysis, infinitesimal analysis and differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>At the time when Onorato was born the town was part of Umbria, only being annexed by Lazio in 1923.</li>
<li>A committee, with Ulisse Dini as president, considered Nicoletti's application along with that of seven other candidates, namely Italo Zignago, Giulio Vivanti, Mineo Chini, Rodolfo Bettazzi, Domenico Amanzio, Orazio Tedone and Giuseppe Lauricella.</li>
<li>Nicoletti's good attitude is also known, which is also proven by a certificate from the director of the Pisa Scuola Normale Superiore, relating to the courses given in it.</li>
<li>The committee ranked Vivanti first followed by Nicoletti and Lauricella.</li>
<li>However, Vivanti did not take up the position and, in January 1898, Nicoletti was appointed to the chair of infinitesimal calculus at the University of Modena.</li>
<li>After two years at Modena, Nicoletti was called to the Chair of Algebra at the University of Pisa where he became a colleague of Ulisse Dini, who held the chair of infinitesimal analysis, of Luigi Bianchi and of Eugenio Bertini.</li>
<li>At this time Nicoletti took over Dini's courses on infinitesimal calculus moving to the chair of infinitesimal analysis.</li>
<li>Albanese then became Nicoletti's assistant.</li>
<li>Nicoletti remained in Pisa for the rest of his career, but died at the age of 57, well before he reached the age of retiring.</li>
<li>Nicoletti published works in various fields of mathematics, including algebraic analysis, infinitesimal analysis, equations related to Hermitian matrices and differential equations.</li>
<li>Nicoletti contributed two articles to this encyclopaedia, namely Forme razionali di una o più variabili Ⓣ(Rational forms of one or more variables)  and Proprietà generali delle funzioni algebriche Ⓣ(General properties of algebraic functions.).</li>
<li>Editions of these two books appeared long after Nicoletti's death.</li>
<li>The merits of Onorato Nicoletti as a scientist will be hinted at here only briefly; in this brief mention, it was more dear to me to have spent a little time reviewing his figure as a man, still as alive among us as when he was with us.</li>
<li>Honored Nicoletti was born in Rieti on 21 June 1872.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 June 1872, Rieti, Lazio, Italy. Died 31 December 1929, Pisa, Italy.</p>
