<p><strong>Thomas Muir</strong> was a Scot who went on to be Superintendent General of Education in South Africa and  is best known for his five volume <em>History of Determinants</em>.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>George was a shoemaker in Biggar and it was in that town, about 15km from the town of Thomas's birth, that Thomas was brought up.</li>
<li>Thomas entered the University of Glasgow intending to study his favourite subject of Greek.</li>
<li>Muir spent three years lecturing on mathematics at Glasgow University and quickly gained a reputation as a fine teacher.</li>
<li>The Edinburgh Mathematical Society was founded in 1883 and in the following year Muir was elected as president.</li>
<li>Also in 1890 Muir was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, then two years later he went to the Cape, South Africa, as Superintendent General of Education.</li>
<li>Muir was appointed to this position by Cecil Rhodes, then prime minister of Cape Colony, while Rhodes was visiting England.</li>
<li>Muir was at the time deciding whether to accept an offer of the Chair of Mathematics from Stanford University in California.</li>
<li>There was another reason why accepting a post in South Africa was attractive to Muir.</li>
<li>In 1897 Muir was appointed vice-chancellor of the University of the Cape; he held this post for four years.</li>
<li>Muir received several awards from the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</li>
<li>Muir was knighted in 1910, four years after he had reworked his 1890 publication to become Volume 1 of History of determinants which covered the origins to Leibniz in 1840.</li>
<li>Muir was working on Volume 6 1920-1940 at the time of his death.</li>
<li>In 1930, at the age of 86, Muir published Contributions to the history of determinants.</li>
<li>It is worth thinking exactly what Muir was attempting here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 August 1844, Stonebyres, Falls of Clyde, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Died 21 March 1934, Rondebosch, South Africa.</p>
