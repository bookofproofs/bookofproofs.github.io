<p><strong>Julius Gysel</strong> was a Swiss school-teacher with an interest in geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His father was Johannes Gysel (1815-1875), a council clerk; he also served as president of the town council and later on as Kantonsrat.</li>
<li>Gysel grew up in his hometown with his four siblings and attended elementary school there.</li>
<li>After being awarded his Matura in 1869, Gysel studied mathematics at the Polytechnic until 1872.</li>
<li>Subsequently, Gysel attended mathematics lectures at the University of Bern for a year, notably those by Georg Sidler and Ludwig Schläfli.</li>
<li>Whilst writing his thesis, Gysel worked as a supply teacher for mathematics at the Kantonsschule in Schaffhausen from 1872-1874.</li>
<li>Gysel taught mathematics in the classical track until his retirement in 1926.</li>
<li>Despite all the educational reforms since Gysel's death, his observation about the popularity of the school subject mathematics still holds true today -- surely many of today's mathematics teachers would agree with him.</li>
<li>Gysel greatly influenced the school not only as a teacher, but also in his capacity as headmaster in particular.</li>
<li>Gysel's passion for physics experiments and technological progress (see paragraph below) is representative of his time.</li>
<li>Gysel aka  "Tschuli" was quite popular among his pupils, not only as a teacher, but also as headmaster.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the dialect writer Albert Bächtold (1891-1981, also from Wilchingen) honoured Gysel's influence on his own life in his novel De Studänt Räbme Ⓣ(The student Rabne) (1947): The headmaster in the novel, called  "Vatter" ("father"), is based on Gysel.</li>
<li>Throughout his life, Gysel educated himself further, both in his subjects and in educational matters.</li>
<li>Gysel was also a keen member of the Naturforschende Gesellschaft Schaffhausen, his local Society for Natural Scientists, from 1876 onwards.</li>
<li>Gysel became a member of the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung in 1897.</li>
<li>The list of his publications comprises only seven items: apart from his doctoral thesis, Gysel published three papers on problems in geometry as part of his school's Osterprogramme: Beiträge zur analytischen Geometrie der Kurven und Flächen 2.</li>
<li>On top of his school duties, Gysel took on a number of positions in various committees, which again reflect his interest in education and in technological progress.</li>
<li>On 3 August 1876, Gysel married Barbara Carolina Bollinger from Schaffhausen.</li>
<li>One of their sons, also called Julius (1881-1972), graduated as a mechanical engineer from the ETH in 1906 and worked for an electric power company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 August 1851, Wilchingen (Schaffhausen canton), Switzerland. Died 23 August 1935, Schaffhausen, Switzerland.</p>
