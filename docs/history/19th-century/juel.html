<p><strong>Christian Juel</strong> was a Danish mathematician, specializing in geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In January 1876 Juel took the entrance examinations for the University of Copenhagen.</li>
<li>Juel completed his Master's Degree at the University of Copenhagen in 1879.</li>
<li>Juel had spent sixteen years completing his university education and so, despite starting young, was 30 years old before he received his doctorate.</li>
<li>Juel worked for several years as a mathematics teacher and private tutor of mathematics before being appointed to the Polytechnic Institute in Copenhagen in 1894.</li>
<li>However, at first it was a journal aimed at school teachers of mathematics but in 1890, when Juel was editor, it was split into Series A containing school level mathematics, and Series B which was a scientific journal containing articles on advanced topics.</li>
<li>In 1907 Juel was appointed to a newly created chair of rational mechanics at the Polytechnic institute.</li>
<li>Juel's programme of research extended certain theorems on real manifolds of algebraic geometry to non-algebraic manifolds, even to non-analytic manifolds provided the concepts are generalised in a suitable way.</li>
<li>Although he was not alone in making these improvements, since Corrado Segre also proved similar results, but there is no doubt that Juel's results were obtained independently of Corrado Segre.</li>
<li>This reproach Professor Juel has set himself (with no less industry than ingenuity) to remove.</li>
<li>Juel also worked on the theory of finite equal polyhedra and on oval surfaces.</li>
<li>Although these ideas are clever, Juel did not treat them with care and his writings on this topic, although interesting, are less than precise and leave something to be desired.</li>
<li>Juel served mathematics in other important ways.</li>
<li>Juel attended the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Bologna in September 1928.</li>
<li>In his final years Juel's eyesight deteriorated and he was only able to write his classic text Vorlesungen über projektive Geometrie mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der v.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 January 1855, Randers, Denmark. Died 24 January 1935, Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
