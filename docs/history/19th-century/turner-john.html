<p><strong>John Turner</strong> graduated from the university of Edinburgh and taught at the Royal High School of Edinburgh.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>John Turner entered Bridge of Weir Public School in 1877, when he was six years old, and after two years moved to Paisley Public School.</li>
<li>Turner first matriculated at the University of Edinburgh in October 1886 when he was fifteen years old.</li>
<li>John Marshall, M.A. Oxon., LL.D. Edin., a classics scholar, was Rector of The Edinburgh High School when Turner was appointed.</li>
<li>Mr Turner's work throughout the Session has been most successful.</li>
<li>In November 1894, Turner joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>Turner was a very active member of the Society.</li>
<li>Turner carried out administrative duties for the Society over many years but he also contributed to the academic work of the Society.</li>
<li>W King Gillies, M.A., B.A. (Oxon.), LL.D., F.R.S.E., a classics scholar, was Rector of the Edinburgh Royal High School during the last thirteen years the Turner taught there.</li>
<li>The Rector presided, and, in addition to the whole Staff, there were present Miss Turner and Miss MacLaren.</li>
<li>He mentioned his personal indebtedness to Mr Turner and, expressing his profound gratitude for thirteen years' assistance, said that Mr Turner's wise and dispassionate judgment on affairs had been a source of comfort and assurance.</li>
<li>To all his colleagues Mr Turner had been a valued friend, the younger members of the Staff in particular finding in him a kind and considerate adviser.</li>
<li>The Rector congratulated Mr Turner on entering on his retirement after such long and distinguished service, and expressed his pleasure in handing over to him a pair of field-glasses and several books as a token of affection and esteem from his colleagues, who might fairly claim to represent the High School Masters and Mistresses of the last forty years.</li>
<li>Mr Turner in reply said that the occasion marked the end of a long story, not very exciting, but pleasant, and might also be the beginning of another, perhaps shorter one, but one which, if good wishes counted, would be happy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 June 1871, Bridge-of-Weir, Kilbarchan (near Paisley), Scotland. The date of his death is unknown.</p>
