<h1>Person: Andreev, Konstantin Alekseevich</h1>

<p><strong>Konstantin Alekseevich Andreev</strong> was a Russian mathematician, best known for his work on geometry, especially projective geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>However, when Konstantin Alekseevich was young his father's business collapsed and the family suffered severe hardship.</li>
<li>But financial problems were not all that troubled the family for Konstantin Alekseevich had very poor health as a child.</li>
<li>These problems made it impossible for Konstantin Alekseevich to attend school until he was twelve years of age.</li>
<li>In 1867 Andreev entered the mathematics department in the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of Moscow State University.</li>
<li>Among the professors who influenced Andreev so much during his undergraduate years, he mentions in particular August Yulevich Davidov and Nicolai Vasilievich Bugaev.</li>
<li>While he was a student, Andreev wrote an essay On mortality tables for which he was awarded a gold medal.</li>
<li>The quality of the essay was so high it was published in the Memoirs of Moscow University in 1871, becoming Andreev's first publication.</li>
<li>In this same year of 1871 Andreev began graduate studies taking the two-year course which was necessary preparation for becoming a university professor.</li>
<li>In that year a vacancy occurred at Kharkov University and Bugaev strongly recommended Andreev for the position.</li>
<li>At Kharkov, Andreev joined the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics which he helped build into a leading centre.</li>
<li>While Andreev was on the faculty, he was joined by Aleksandr Mikhailovich Lyapunov and Vladimir Andreevich Steklov in 1885.</li>
<li>Andreev defended his Master's thesis On a geometric formation of planar curves in February 1875 and, following a successful defence, he became an assistant professor at Kharkov.</li>
<li>Andreev took a leading role in the foundation and development of the Kharkov Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>This Society is one of the oldest mathematical societies and was founded in 1879, the year Andreev became an extraordinary professor.</li>
<li>Andreev became an ordinary professor at Kharkov in 1886 and, one year earlier he had become a professor at the Kharkov Technological Institute in the year of its foundation.</li>
<li>In October 1898 Andreev left Kharkov to take up an appointment at Moscow University where he was appointed to the chair of mathematics.</li>
<li>Andreev is best known for his work on geometry, although he also made contributions to analysis.</li>
<li>Gram determinants were introduced by J P Gram in 1879 but Andreev invented them independently in the context of problems of expansion of functions into orthogonal series and the best quadratic approximation to functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 26 March 1848, Moscow, Russia. Died 29 October 1921, Near Sevastopol, Crimea.</p>
