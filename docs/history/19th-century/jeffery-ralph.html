<p><strong>Ralph Jeffery</strong> was a Canadian mathematician who worked on analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Frank Jeffery was a fisherman.</li>
<li>Ralph attended school up to Grade 8 when, in the middle of the year, he left to join his father as a fisherman.</li>
<li>It was Nellie Jeffery who persuaded her husband to continue with his education and enrol in Acadia University, Wolfville, Nova Scotia.</li>
<li>We have reached Jeffery's university education without mentioning mathematics.</li>
<li>This may not seem like a particularly good foundation for research in mathematics, but Jeffery had come to love the subject so much that he went to Cornell University to undertake graduate studies.</li>
<li>At this point Jeffery had not completed his doctorate so, in 1928, he returned to Cornell University to finish off his work.</li>
<li>Before he submitted his thesis, Jeffery was publishing papers such as Definite integrals containing a parameter  and The Continuity of a Function Defined by a Definite Integral, the latter being in the American Mathematical Monthly.</li>
<li>Jeffery remained at Acadia University until 1942, except for one year which he spent as acting as Head of Mathematics at the University of Saskatchewan in 1938.</li>
<li>The Mathematics Department at Queen's was fairly small with seven faculty members when Jeffery became Head.</li>
<li>Queen's University honoured Jeffery's outstanding contribution by naming a new building, built between 1967 and 1969 to house the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, as Jeffery Hall.</li>
<li>An important book which Jeffery published in 1951 was The Theory of Functions of a Real Variable.</li>
<li>Jeffery was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1937 and latter served as its President.</li>
<li>Jeffery received many honours for his outstanding work in encouraging mathematical research in Canada.</li>
<li>The Canadian Mathematical Society honoured him by setting up the Jeffery-Williams Prize to recognize mathematicians who have made outstanding contributions to mathematical research.</li>
<li>In 1956 Nellie Jeffery died.</li>
<li>In 1970, when he was 81 years old, Jeffery married Frances Lewis of Bedford.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 October 1889, Overton, Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, Canada. Died 1975, Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada.</p>
