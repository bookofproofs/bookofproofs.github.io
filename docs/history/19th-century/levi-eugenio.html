<p><strong>Eugenio Levi</strong> was an Italian mathematician who worked in complex analysis, differential geometry, Lie groups, partial differential equations and the minimum principle.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The family was Jewish and Eugenio was the ninth of his parents' ten children.</li>
<li>The fourth of these ten children was Beppo Levi (born 1875) who also became a mathematician and has a biography in this archive.</li>
<li>The youngest member of the family was Decio Levi (1885-1917), who became an engineer.</li>
<li>Eugenio attended the Azeglio High School in Turin where he showed that he was an extremely gifted pupil.</li>
<li>Two aspects of Bianchi's work would be particularly significant in his influences on Levi.</li>
<li>He had published two important works before Levi began to study with him, namely Lectures on differential geometry (1894) and Lectures on the theory of groups of substitutions (1900).</li>
<li>The other mathematician in Pisa who had a major influence on Levi's research was Ulisse Dini who held two chairs at the University of Pisa, the chair of analysis and higher geometry, and the chair of infinitesimal analysis.</li>
<li>In 1904 Levi graduated from the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa with the award of his laurea.</li>
<li>Levi published Sulla struttura dei gruppi finiti e continui Ⓣ(On the structure of finite and continuous groups) in 1905, the paper having been presented to Academy of Science of Turin on 2 April of that year by Bianchi.</li>
<li>In 1906 Levi submitted his habilitation thesis Sulle equazioni lineari totalmente ellittiche alle derivate parziali to the Scuola Normale Superiore.</li>
<li>Levi became interested in the Cauchy problem.</li>
<li>Levi's remarkable mathematical career came to an end with the outbreak of World War I.</li>
<li>It was over one year later, in October 1916, that Levi entered military service in, as a lieutenant in the 1st  Regiment of Engineers stationed at their headquarters in Pavia.</li>
<li>Levi, however, was highly patriotic wished to return to military service.</li>
<li>Decio Levi, who was a major in the Italian army, was killed on 15 September as fighting continued in the Monte Santo area.</li>
<li>Eugenio Levi was a captain in charge of a company of engineers in the same general area.</li>
<li>During the retreat, Eugenio Levi was hit in the forehead by a stray bullet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 October 1883, Turin, Italy. Died 28 October 1917, Cormons, Italy.</p>
