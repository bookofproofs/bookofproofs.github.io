<p><strong> Evgeny Slutsky</strong> was important in the application of mathematical methods in economics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After leaving school Slutsky entered the University of Kiev in 1899 to study mathematics.</li>
<li>That is precisely what happened to Slutsky in January 1901, but he was not given a particularly long spell and he was soon back at Kiev University.</li>
<li>Slutsky had little choice if he wanted an education so he went abroad and entered Munich Polytechnikum entering in 1902.</li>
<li>Leontovich was a physiologist who had been studying the statistical ideas of Gauss and Pearson and he gave Slutsky material on statistical techniques.</li>
<li>Slutsky was quickly involved with this work, and still in 1912 he published a text in Kiev entitled The theory of correlation.</li>
<li>Slutsky had been a supporter of the revolution when a student but now he became much more careful in making his views known.</li>
<li>Slutsky may well have foreseen this and decided to keep out of advising on economic policy decisions.</li>
<li>Other high ranking members of the Institute suffered banishment but Slutsky alone was able to continue his career without problems.</li>
<li>After the Conjuncture Institute was closed in 1930 Slutsky began to apply his statistical skills to meteorology, taking up a position in the Central Institute of Meteorology in 1931.</li>
<li>As a statistician, Slutsky was influenced by Pearson's work, as we mentioned above, and he was interested in both the mathematical background of the statistical methods he studied as well as their application to economics and, later in his career, to natural sciences.</li>
<li>While at the Kiev Institute of Commerce, Slutsky gave the fundamental equation of value theory to economics.</li>
<li>Slutsky introduced stochastic concepts of limits, derivatives and integrals between 1925 to 1928 while he worked at the Conjuncture Institute.</li>
<li>Slutsky applied his theories widely, in addition to economics mentioned above he also studied solar activity using data from 500 BC onwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 April 1880, Novoe, Yaroslavl guberniya, Russia. Died 10 March 1948, Moscow, USSR.</p>
