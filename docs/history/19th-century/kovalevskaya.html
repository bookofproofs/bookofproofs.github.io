<p><strong>Sofia Kovalevskaya</strong> was a Russian born mathematician who made valuable contributions to the theory of differential equations. She finished her career in Sweden.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sofia's name is written in different forms and we should say a little about that here.</li>
<li>Sofia had an older sister Anyuta Vasilievna Korvin-Krukovskaya (1843-1887), and a younger brother Fyodor Vasilievich Korvin-Krukovsky (1855-1919).</li>
<li>We need to also say a little about Sofia Kovalevskaya's name.</li>
<li>She was given the name Sofia Vasilievna Krukovsky, only adopting the name Korvin-Krukovsky after her father's application for nobility was accepted in 1858.</li>
<li>She is often called Sophie or Sonya, the first being an anglicised version of Sofia, the second being a familiar version by which she was known by her friends after she became an adult.</li>
<li>Kovalevskaya is the female version of her husband's name Kovalevsky which is often transliterated as Kovalevskaia, and infrequently as Kovalevskaja.</li>
<li>We will use the form Sofia Kovalevskaya throughout this biography.</li>
<li>In 1855 Sofia's father, General Krukovsky, was posted to Kaluga, about 70 km south west of Moscow, and the family lived there until 1858.</li>
<li>Sofia lived at Palibino, the Krukovsky country estate, from 1858 when he father retired, and was educated by tutors and governesses.</li>
<li>Sofia's father was fully occupied managing the estate and the family lived comfortably in the manor house.</li>
<li>It was at a very young age that Sofia was attracted to mathematics.</li>
<li>When Sofia was 11 years old, the walls of her nursery were papered with pages of Ostrogradski's lecture notes on differential and integral analysis.</li>
<li>Ostrogradski's lecture notes on differential and integral analysis were there because Vasily Vasilievich, Sofia's father, had attended his course when undergoing his military training.</li>
<li>Studying the wallpaper was Sofia's introduction to calculus.</li>
<li>It was under the family's tutor, Yosif Ignatievich Malevich (1813-1898), that Sofia undertook her first proper study of mathematics, beginning with arithmetic (which she found boring) and then moving on to elementary geometry and algebra.</li>
<li>The incident she refers to happened a year later when a neighbour, Nikolai Tyrtov, Professor of Physics at the Naval Academy, presented her family with a physics textbook which he had written, and Sofia attempted to read it.</li>
<li>Tyrtov argued with Sofia's father that she should be encouraged to study mathematics further but it was two years later before he permitted Sofia to take private lessons with Aleksandr Strannoliubskii (1839-1903) who had been a student of Tyrtov.</li>
<li>There Sofia joined her family's social circle which included the author Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky.</li>
<li>We now need to say a little about Sofia's sister Anyuta at this point, because she was a strong influence on the young Sofia.</li>
<li>Well, it was done secretly from everyone except Sofia, for the two sisters kept nothing from each other.</li>
<li>Dostoevsky came to visit and both Anyuta and Sofia would meet him.</li>
<li>Sofia had written some poetry which was shown to Dostoevsky and he praised it.</li>
<li>Dostoevsky began to turn his attention more and more to Sofia and in turn she practised her piano playing to entertain him.</li>
<li>By this time Sofia was eighteen years old and on one occasion she came with her sister to meet Vladimir who, after that meeting insisted he would marry Sofia rather than Anyuta or her friend.</li>
<li>Sofia realised that by marrying Vladimir she could do what her sister had wanted and go abroad to enter higher education.</li>
<li>At first things went well for Sofia living in St Petersburg and attending the University there.</li>
<li>Although her marriage was allowing Kovalevskaya to get the education she craved at this time, it soon caused her problems and, throughout its fifteen years, it was a source of intermittent sorrow, exasperation and tension and her concentration was broken by her frequent quarrels and misunderstandings with her husband.</li>
<li>In the spring of 1869 Kovalevskaya travelled with her husband to Heidelberg to study mathematics and the natural sciences, only to discover that women could not matriculate at the university.</li>
<li>Following Leo Königsberger's advice, in 1871 Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin to study with Karl Weierstrass, Königsberger's former teacher.</li>
<li>Sofia rushed to Paris where the Commune was being suppressed by the French army.</li>
<li>Naturally, this episode made a big impression on Sofia.</li>
<li>By the spring of 1874, Kovalevskaya had completed three papers.</li>
<li>In 1874 Kovalevskaya was granted her doctorate, summa cum laude, from Göttingen University after it received very positive reports from Karl Weierstrass, Paul Du Bois-Reymond, and Lazarus Fuchs.</li>
<li>Sofia quickly recovered and wanted to continue her academic career but, now in St Petersburg, despite having a doctorate and letters of strong recommendation from Weierstrass, she was unable to obtain an academic position.</li>
<li>Unable to get a job, Kovalevskaya and her husband decided to live as man and wife rather than brother and sister.</li>
<li>In October 1878, she gave birth to a daughter, Sofia Vladimirovna (who was called Fufa), but from 1880 increasingly returned to her study of mathematics.</li>
<li>In 1891, Volterra discovered that Kovalevskaya had made the same mistake as Lamé, on whose work these papers were based, though she had pointed out several others which he had made in his presentation of the problem.</li>
<li>In the spring of 1883, Vladimir, from whom Sofia had been separated for two years, committed suicide after he was again in financial difficulties which led to a stock scandal.</li>
<li>After the initial shock, Kovalevskaya immersed herself in mathematical work in an attempt to rid herself of feelings of guilt.</li>
<li>Mittag-Leffler managed to overcome opposition to Kovalevskaya in Stockholm, and obtained for her a position as privatdocent.</li>
<li>Kovalevskaya had left her daughter in Moscow and only saw her during the summer of 1884, but in 1885, when Fufa was eight years old, she brought her to Stockholm.</li>
<li>During Kovalevskaya's years at Stockholm, she carried out what many consider her most important research She taught courses on the latest topics in analysis and became an editor of the new journal Acta Mathematica.</li>
<li>Anna Leffler, a well-known advocate of women's rights and a writer, encouraged Sofia's literary leanings.</li>
<li>It was based on an idea that had occurred to Sofia while she sat at the bedside of her dying sister.</li>
<li>After Anyuta died in the fall of 1887, Sofia felt lonely and despondent.</li>
<li>The sisters had been close, and Sofia felt the loss deeply.</li>
<li>Kovalevskaya entered and, in 1886, was awarded the Prix Bordin for her paper Mémoire sur un cas particulier du problème de le rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe, où l'intégration s'effectue à l'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps Ⓣ(Memoir of a special case of the problem of the rotation of a heavy body around a fixed point where the integration is performed using the functions of  ultraelliptiques time).</li>
<li>Entries for the prize were supposed to be anonymous and many biographies of Kovalevskaya claim that she only won because the judges did not know the entry was from a woman.</li>
<li>Kovalevskaya's further research on this subject won a prize from the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1889, and in the same year, on the initiative of Chebyshev, Kovalevskaya was elected a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences.</li>
<li>Kovalevskaya's last published work was a short article Sur un théorème de M Bruns Ⓣ(On a theorem of M Bruns) in which she gave a new, simpler proof of Bruns's theorem on a property of the potential function of a homogeneous body.</li>
<li>In early 1891, at the height of her mathematical powers and reputation, Kovalevskaya died of influenza complicated by pneumonia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 January 1850, Moscow, Russia. Died 10 February 1891, Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
