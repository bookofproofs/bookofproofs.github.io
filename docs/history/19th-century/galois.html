<p><strong>Évariste Galois</strong> was a French mathematician who produced a method of determining when a general equation could be solved by radicals and is famous for his development of early group theory. He died very young after fighting a duel.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>However there is no sign of any mathematical ability in any of Galois' family.</li>
<li>His mother served as Galois' sole teacher until he was 12 years old.</li>
<li>Galois' father was an important man in the community and in 1815 he was elected mayor of Bourg-la-Reine.</li>
<li>The starting point of the historical events which were to play a major role in Galois' life is surely the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789.</li>
<li>Galois was by this time at school.</li>
<li>Galois was not involved and during 1824-25 his school record is good and he received several prizes.</li>
<li>However in 1826 Galois was asked to repeat the year because his work in rhetoric was not up to the required standard.</li>
<li>February 1827 was a turning point in Galois' life.</li>
<li>Galois' school reports began to describe him as singular, bizarre, original and closed.</li>
<li>In 1828 Galois took the examination of the École Polytechnique but failed.</li>
<li>It was the leading University of Paris and Galois must have wished to enter it for academic reasons.</li>
<li>However, he also wished to enter this school because of the strong political movements that existed among its students, since Galois followed his parents example in being an ardent republican.</li>
<li>Back at Louis-le-Grand, Galois enrolled in the mathematics class of Louis Richard.</li>
<li>In April 1829 Galois had his first mathematics paper published on continued fractions in the Annales de mathématiques.</li>
<li>Cauchy was appointed as referee of Galois' paper.</li>
<li>Tragedy was to strike Galois for on 2 July 1829 his father committed suicide.</li>
<li>The priest of Bourg-la-Reine forged Mayor Galois' name on malicious forged epigrams directed at Galois' own relatives.</li>
<li>Galois' father was a good natured man and the scandal that ensued was more than he could stand.</li>
<li>Galois was deeply affected by his father's death and it greatly influenced the direction his life was to take.</li>
<li>A few weeks after his father's death, Galois presented himself for examination for entry to the École Polytechnique for the second time.</li>
<li>Galois therefore resigned himself to enter the École Normale, which was an annex to Louis-le-Grand, and to do so he had to take his Baccalaureate examinations, something he could have avoided by entering the École Polytechnique.</li>
<li>Galois sent Cauchy further work on the theory of equations, but then learned from Bulletin de Férussac of a posthumous article by Abel which overlapped with a part of his work.</li>
<li>Galois then took Cauchy's advice and submitted a new article On the condition that an equation be soluble by radicals in February 1830.</li>
<li>Fourier died in April 1830 and Galois' paper was never subsequently found and so never considered for the prize.</li>
<li>Galois, after reading Abel and Jacobi's work, worked on the theory of elliptic functions and abelian integrals.</li>
<li>Galois tried to scale the wall to join the rioting but failed.</li>
<li>Guigniault wrote newspaper articles attacking the students and Galois wrote a reply in the Gazette des Écoles, attacking M.</li>
<li>For this letter Galois was expelled and he joined the Artillery of the National Guard, a Republican branch of the militia.</li>
<li>In January 1831 Galois attempted to return to mathematics.</li>
<li>Galois was invited by Poisson to submit a third version of his memoir on equation to the Academy and he did so on 17 January.</li>
<li>On 18 April Sophie Germain wrote a letter to her friend the mathematician Libri which describes Galois' situation.</li>
<li>Fourier, have been too much for this student Galois who, in spite of his impertinence, showed signs of a clever disposition.</li>
<li>During the dinner Galois raised his glass and with an open dagger in his hand appeared to make threats against the King, Louis-Phillipe.</li>
<li>After the dinner Galois was arrested and held in Sainte-Pélagie prison.</li>
<li>Galois, rather surprisingly since he essentially repeated the threat from the dock, was acquitted.</li>
<li>The 14th  of July was Bastille Day and Galois was arrested again.</li>
<li>Galois was sent back to Sainte-Pélagie prison.</li>
<li>He did, however, encourage Galois to publish a more complete account of his work.</li>
<li>While in Sainte-Pélagie prison Galois attempted to commit suicide by stabbing himself with a dagger but the other prisoners prevented him.</li>
<li>In March 1832 a cholera epidemic swept Paris and prisoners, including Galois, were transferred to the pension Sieur Faultrier.</li>
<li>After he was released on 29 April Galois exchanged letters with Stephanie, and it is clear that she tried to distance herself from the affair.</li>
<li>The name Stephanie appears several times as a marginal note in one of Galois' manuscripts.</li>
<li>Galois fought a duel with Perscheux d'Herbinville on 30 May, the reason for the duel not being clear but certainly linked with Stephanie.</li>
<li>Galois was wounded in the duel and was abandoned by d'Herbinville and his own seconds and found by a peasant.</li>
<li>Galois' brother and his friend Chevalier copied his mathematical papers and sent them to Gauss, Jacobi and others.</li>
<li>It had been Galois' wish that Jacobi and Gauss should give their opinions on his work.</li>
<li>Liouville published these papers of Galois in his Journal in 1846.</li>
<li>The theory that Galois outlined in these papers is now called Galois theory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 October 1811, Bourg La Reine (near Paris), France. Died 31 May 1832, Paris, France.</p>
