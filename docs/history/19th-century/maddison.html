<p><strong>Isabel Maddison</strong> was an English mathematician best known for her work on differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Isabel Maddison entered University College in Cardiff in 1885.</li>
<li>A fellow student who matriculated at Girton at the same time as Maddison was Grace Chisholm (later Grace Chisholm Young).</li>
<li>Maddison attended lectures at Cambridge by Cayley, Whitehead and Young, and she earned a First Class degree in the Mathematical Tripos examinations of 1892 although at this time women could not formally receive a degree at Cambridge.</li>
<li>After Maddison completed her studies at Cambridge in 1892 she was awarded a scholarship which enabled her to spend the year 1892-93 at Bryn Mawr College undertaking research with Scott.</li>
<li>Maddison had, like Scott, become interested in linear algebra through the influence of Cayley at Cambridge.</li>
<li>When she first reached Bryn Mawr College, Maddison continued to work on this topic but later, advised by Scott, she began to work on singular solutions of differential equations.</li>
<li>Although she had earned the equivalent of a First Class degree at Cambridge, Maddison still had no degree so she took the external examinations of the University of London in 1893 which allowed her to graduate with a B.Sc. with honours.</li>
<li>Maddison attended lectures by Klein, Hilbert and Burkhardt during her year at Göttingen where she played a full part in the exciting mathematical atmosphere of the department.</li>
<li>In 1895 Maddison returned to Bryn Mawr College to take up the position of assistant to the president of the College, Carey Thomas, as Martha Carey Thomas preferred to be known.</li>
<li>Until 1902 Carey Thomas held both the position of dean and of president so Maddison had a busy life as her assistant.</li>
<li>Maddison remained at Bryn Mawr until she retired in 1926.</li>
<li>After Maddison retired she returned to England for a time but later went back to Pennsylvania where she spent time writing poetry rather than mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 13 April 1869, Cumberland, England. Died 22 October 1950, Martin's Dam, Wayne, Pennsylvania, USA.</p>
