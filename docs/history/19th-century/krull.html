<p><strong>Wolfgang Krull</strong> proved the Krull-Schmidt theorem for decomposing abelian groups of operators and defined the Krull dimension of a ring.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Helmuth Krull had a dentist's practice in Baden-Baden and it was in that town that Krull attended school.</li>
<li>It was the custom in those days for students in Germany to move around various universities during their period of study and Krull was no exception.</li>
<li>His inaugural address on becoming a full professor at Erlangen was one which says much of how Krull saw mathematics.</li>
<li>The ten years Krull spent in Erlangen were the most productive period of his career.</li>
<li>In 1939 Krull left Erlangen to take up a chair at Bonn.</li>
<li>However, his career was disrupted by the Second World War which began shortly after Krull was appointed to the University of Bonn.</li>
<li>When his war service had ended in 1946, Krull took up again his post at the University of Bonn and he would remain there for the rest of his life.</li>
<li>In this final period of his career Krull continued his high level of productivity (he wrote 50 papers in his post-war years in Bonn) and also broadened his mathematical interests.</li>
<li>Krull's first publications were on rings and algebraic extension fields.</li>
<li>In 1925 he proved the Krull-Schmidt theorem for decomposing abelian groups of operators.</li>
<li>In passing from the finite to the infinite case Krull introduced topological ideas.</li>
<li>In 1928 he defined the Krull dimension of a commutative Noetherian ring and brought ring theory into in new setting in which he was able to show that the principal ideal theorem held.</li>
<li>Perhaps the reason that the idea of the Krull dimension is such a natural concept is that it encapsulates in an abstract setting the analogues of geometric dimensions.</li>
<li>Krull carried his work forward, defining further concepts which are today central to modern research in ring theory.</li>
<li>In 1932 he defined valuations which are today known as Krull valuations.</li>
<li>He then wrote the remarkable treatise Ideal Theory which remains a beautiful introduction to ring theory but is simply a theory built from the results that Krull had himself proved.</li>
<li>One could say that Krull had achieved the goal he had in some sense set himself in his Erlangen address and arranged his theory to be self-evident.</li>
<li>The concept was introduced by Krull in 1938 and his fundamental results were developed into a major theory by mathematicians such as Chevalley and Zariski.</li>
<li>Indeed much of modern ring theory is still following the path which Krull took, building on the foundations which Emmy Noether had laid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 26 August 1899, Baden-Baden, Germany. Died 12 April 1971, Bonn, Germany.</p>
