<p><strong>Herbert Ellsworth Slaught</strong>  was an American mathematician who became president of the Mathematical Association of America.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The name Ellsworth was chosen by his parents to honour Colonel Ephraim Elmer Ellsworth who had been killed in the civil war on 24 May 1861.</li>
<li>Slaught himself has said that he would probably have spent his life working on the farm if it had not happened, and the farm was apparently not a very good one.</li>
<li>Slaught attended Colgate Academy in Hamilton until he graduated in 1879.</li>
<li>Slaught was quickly promoted at the Peddie Institute, first to assistant principal in 1886, then to principal in 1889.</li>
<li>So in 1892 Slaught accepted a two-year appointment to one of the first three fellowships awarded by the Department of Mathematics at the University of Chicago, which was just then opening its doors.</li>
<li>Chicago had not been Slaught's first choice, for he had planned to undertake research for his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University and had applied for a fellowship.</li>
<li>Slaught soon received promotion at the University of Chicago.</li>
<li>Slaught remained at Chicago for the rest of his career, retiring from his chair in 1931.</li>
<li>Many students who had studied calculus before, learned what the subject really meant in Professor Slaught's class.</li>
<li>During 1902-3 Slaught travelled in Europe attending lectures by the leading mathematicians.</li>
<li>The proposition took a more definite shape, under Slaught's impetus, at the April 1914 meeting of the Chicago Section of the Society.</li>
<li>Slaught also became active in the organisation of the Mathematical Association of America and served as its President in 1919.</li>
<li>Slaught was chairman of the local organising committee.</li>
<li>Slaught acted as toastmaster at a joint dinner for all three societies.</li>
<li>We can see from Slaught's work for many societies and associations which were interested in secondary school teaching that he had a strong interest in that area.</li>
<li>Professor Slaught's manner was entirely unpretentious and free from the slightest affectation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 July 1861, Watkins, New York, USA. Died 21 May 1937, Chicago, Illinois, USA.</p>
