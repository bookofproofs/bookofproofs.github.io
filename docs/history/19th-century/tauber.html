<p><strong>Alfred Tauber</strong> was a Slovakian-born mathematician, known for his contribution to mathematical analysis and to the theory of functions of a complex variable.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tauber's intention was to publish his thesis but in fact this never happened.</li>
<li>in the same year and Tauber began to lecture in Vienna as a privatdozent.</li>
<li>This was a topic which was of little interest to Tauber, yet he was still a privatdozent so needed to earn money and his lectures on the mathematics of insurance gave him a monthly salary.</li>
<li>Tauber's main income, however, came from his position as Head of Mathematics at the Phönix Insurance Company in Vienna.</li>
<li>Tauber's lack of success in being given a professorial position was certainly not due to any lack of mathematical ability, for he continued to publish a series of high quality papers.</li>
<li>Only in 1908 did Tauber get a position as assistant lecturer at the University of Vienna, and at this stage he resigned at head of mathematics at the Phönix Insurance Company, although he remained as an advisor to the company over the next four years.</li>
<li>Tauber's research was on function theory and potential theory.</li>
<li>He obtained important results on divergent series and the name 'Tauberian Theorems'  was coined by Hardy and Littlewood.</li>
<li>The conditions which Tauber gave to allow him to prove the converse of Abel's limit theorem on power series are now known as 'Tauberian conditions' and appeared in Ein Satz aus der Theorie der unendlichen Reihen Ⓣ(A theorem on infinite series) (1897).</li>
<li>Of lesser importance is Tauber's work on differential equations and the gamma function, but let us give the title of one of his papers on this latter topic, namely über die unvollständigen Gammafunktionen (1906).</li>
<li>Although, as we pointed out above, Tauber did not enjoy working on the mathematics of insurance, nevertheless he did produce important contributions to the area.</li>
<li>Just after Tauber arrived the entire non-Jewish population of 3,700 of Theresienstadt was evacuated and he was one of 53,000 inhabitants of the camp.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 November 1866, Pressburg (now Bratislava), Slovakia. Died 26 July 1942, Theresienstadt, Germany (now Terezin, Czech Republic).</p>
