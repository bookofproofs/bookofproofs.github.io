<p><strong>Aleksandr Lyapunov</strong> was a Russian mathematician best known for his development of the stability theory of a dynamical system. He also made contributions to mathematical physics and probability theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lyapunov graduated in 1880 and remained at St Petersburg to undertake research.</li>
<li>Although Lyapunov's Master's thesis did not answer this question, the work of the thesis was motivated by it.</li>
<li>The problem posed by Chebyshev concerning the existence of figures of equilibrium, in addition to ellipsoidal ones, of a rotating fluid under sufficiently small variations of angular velocity of revolution was first solved by Lyapunov in a first approximation.</li>
<li>Lyapunov established that with variation in the angular velocity of revolution Maclaurin ellipsoids pass into Jacobi ellipsoids.</li>
<li>In 1901 Lyapunov was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences in St Petersburg and in the following year became an academician in applied mathematics of the Academy.</li>
<li>In 1917 Lyapunov left St Petersburg to take up a post at the university in Odessa, on the Black Sea coast.</li>
<li>Natalia Rafailovna suffered from a form of tuberculosis and Lyapunov was greatly disturbed to watch her health fail.</li>
<li>We have described Lyapunov's main work which was on the theory of rotating liquids.</li>
<li>For example on 6 June 1957 Sobolev gave the lecture On the works of A M Lyapunov on potential theory in Moscow to a joint session of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences, the divisions of technical and physical sciences of the Academy of Sciences, the Moscow University, the Moscow Mathematical Society, the Institute of Mechanics of the Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of Automatics and Telemechanics of the Academy of Sciences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 6 June 1857, Yaroslavl, Russia. Died 3 November 1918, Odessa, Russia.</p>
