<p><strong>Leonard James Rogers</strong> was an English mathematician who is best known for what are now called the Rogers-Ramanujan identities.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His mother was Anne Susanna Charlotte Rogers (born in London about 1826).</li>
<li>In his childhood Leonard had a serious illness and, though his recovery was complete, he was not sent to school.</li>
<li>Mr J Griffith, of Jesus College, himself a well-known Oxford mathematician with a strong interest in elliptic functions, noticed Rogers' marked mathematical ability, and taught him during his boyhood.</li>
<li>Rogers was a man of extraordinary gifts in many fields, and everything he did, he did well.</li>
<li>Rogers is now remembered for a remarkable set of identities which are special cases of results which he had published in 1894.</li>
<li>Such names as Rogers-Ramanujan identities, Rogers-Ramanujan continued fractions and Rogers transformations are known in the theory of partitions, combinatorics and hypergeometric series.</li>
<li>The Rogers-Ramanujan identities were discovered in the papers On the expansion of some infinite products, Lond.</li>
<li>They were found first in 1894 by Rogers, a mathematician of great talent but comparatively little reputation, now remembered mainly from Ramanujan's rediscovery of his work.</li>
<li>Rogers was a fine analyst, whose gifts were, on a smaller scale, not unlike Ramanujan's; but no one paid much attention to anything he did, and the particular paper in which he proved the formulae was quite neglected.</li>
<li>In that year Ramanujan, looking through old volumes of the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, came accidentally across Rogers's paper.</li>
<li>A correspondence followed in the course of which Rogers was led to a considerable simplification of his original proof.</li>
<li>The above neglect can be gauged by the fact that in 1936 the future Fields Medallist, Atle Selberg, published a "generalization" of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities which turned out, in fact, to be another special case of Rogers' original result.</li>
<li>The Rogers inequality was proved in 1888 in his paper An extension of a certain theorem in inequalities, Messenger of Math.</li>
<li>Hölder even made clear that he was indebted to a paper of Rogers by referring to it.</li>
<li>However, it should be called the Rogers inequality or Rogers-Hölder-Riesz inequality or, at least, Rogers-Hölder or Hölder-Rogers inequality (cf.</li>
<li>Rogers published over thirty papers in mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 30 March 1862, Oxford, England. Died 12 September 1933, Oxford, England.</p>
