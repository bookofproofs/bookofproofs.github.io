<p><strong>Raymond Brink</strong> was an American mathematician who studied at Kansas State University, Harvard and Paris. He taught at the University of Minnesota though he spent a year in Edinburgh in 1919. He worked on the convergence of series.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brink entered Kansas State University in 1904 at the remarkably young age of fourteen.</li>
<li>Following the award of his doctorate Brink studied at the Collège de France and the Sorbonne in Paris spending the academic year 1916-17 financed by the prestigious Sheldon Travelling Fellowship.</li>
<li>Brink fell in love with France and he had a passion for the country for the rest of his life.</li>
<li>Brink spent the academic year 1919-20 at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland where he was appointed as a lecturer in Mathematics.</li>
<li>Except for two further periods of study leave spent in Paris (1924-25 and 1932-33) Brink continued to teach at the University of Minnesota.</li>
<li>Dinner at the Brink house was a formal event, with conversations often focusing on spelling and grammar.</li>
<li>After a break from his Chairman role for a few years, Brink became Chairman again in 1939 and continued to lead the department until he retired in 1957.</li>
<li>These included Professor Raymond W Brink who was Chairman of the department, and had been President of the Mathematical Association of America.</li>
<li>As this quote indicates, Brink was much involved with the Mathematical Association of America.</li>
<li>Brink gave his retiring presidential address entitled 'College Mathematics during Reconstruction' in November 1943.</li>
<li>Finally we give some examples of Brink's papers: A new integral test for the convergence and divergence of infinite series (1918); A new sequence of integral tests for the convergence and divergence of infinite series (1919); The May Meeting of the Minnesota Section (1927); Recent Publications: Reviews: Studies in the History of Statistical Method - With Special Reference to Certain Education Problems (1929); The May Meeting of the Minnesota Section (1930); A Simplified Integral Test for the Convergence of Infinite Series (1931); Recent Publications: Reviews: Differential Equations (1932); The Annual Meeting of the Minnesota Section (1937); College Mathematics During Reconstruction (1944), and A Course in Mathematics for the Purpose of General Education (1947).</li>
<li>We see from this list that, other than the papers which resulted from his thesis, most of Brink's papers relate to teaching, mathematical education or reports of meetings.</li>
<li>The greatest contribution that Brink made is considered by most to be his textbooks.</li>
<li>We noted above that Brink retired from the University of Minnesota in 1957.</li>
<li>She was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Idaho in 1965 and the university named Brink Hall after her.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 January 1890, Newark, New Jersey, USA. Died 27 December 1973, La Jolla, California, USA.</p>
