<p><strong>Emil Weyr</strong> was born in what is now the Czech Republic and worked in descriptive and projective geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Before examining Emil's life in detail, let us briefly comment on all ten children.</li>
<li>These were Karel Weyr (1844-1915), Emil Weyr, the subject of this biography, Marie (1850-1923), Eduard Weyr, who has a biography in this archive, Bedrich Weyr (1853-1908), Anna (1854-1884), Antonie (1856-1919), Emilie (1858-1934), Berta (1860-1927), and Helen (1867-1955).</li>
<li>Bedrich, the one brother younger than the two mathematicians Emil and Eduard, studied chemistry at the Czech College of Technology (1871-1874) and at the University of Prague (1875-1878).</li>
<li>Emilie married the architect and builder Josef Roesel (1855-1922).</li>
<li>The youngest daughter, Helen, lived with her brother Emil in Vienna for many years.</li>
<li>According to the parish records, Emil was born on 1 September 1848 and he was baptised in St Stephen's Church in the Upper New Town of Prague on 3 September.</li>
<li>However, the Weyr family believed that Emil was born on 31 August and always celebrated his birthday on that day.</li>
<li>He was four years older than his brother Eduard Weyr who also became a famous mathematician.</li>
<li>He loved animals, especially dogs and birds, something which he passed on to his son Emil.</li>
<li>Emil entered the elementary school of Our Lady of the Snows in 1854 where he was taught by František Petter.</li>
<li>From 1859, Emil attended the realschule in Mikulandska street in Prague where his father taught, but already at this time he was engaged in studying advanced mathematics guided by his father.</li>
<li>Weyr was an excellent student and began publishing papers during his undergraduate studies.</li>
<li>Weyr volunteered to do one year's military service, from March 1869 to January 1870.</li>
<li>The physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach (1838-1916), had been appointed as professor of Experimental Physics at the Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in 1867 and he encouraged Weyr to habilitate at the Charles University.</li>
<li>In the summer of 1870, Weyr began preparing to go to Paris having been awarded a state scholarship to fund his visit.</li>
<li>Weyr quickly changed his plans and decided instead to visit Italy.</li>
<li>In February 1871 his brother Eduard Weyr visited him in Milan.</li>
<li>The first two volumes had Emil as the main author while Eduard was the main contributor to the third volume.</li>
<li>In April 1871 Emil Weyr set off on a sightseeing tour of Italy, visiting Padua, Bologna, Pisa, Florence, Rome, and Naples.</li>
<li>In a reaction to his stay in Italy, Emil Weyr wrote 22 works in 1871 (13 German, 8 Italian, 1 Czech), 11 works in 1872 (6 German, 3 Czech, 2 Italian) and 11 works in 1873 (5 German, 4 Czech, 2 Italian).</li>
<li>Weyr returned to Italy for another visit in April 1873.</li>
<li>His main task on this trip was to have further discussions with Luigi Cremona since Weyr was translating Cremona's books.</li>
<li>He, together with his brother Eduard Weyr, were the main members of the Austrian geometric school.</li>
<li>Among many works Emil Weyr published were Die Elemente der projectivischen Geometrie Ⓣ(Elements of projective geometry) and Über die Geometrie der alten Aegypter Ⓣ(On the geometry of the ancient Egyptians).</li>
<li>In 1877 Emil Weyr married Marie Waniek von Domyslowa (1860-1934) in Vienna.</li>
<li>Emil and Marie Weyr had three children: František (1879-1951) became a lawyer and was professor at Masaryk University in Brno; Jindrich (1880-1957); and Marie (1883- ?).</li>
<li>Both Emil Weyr and his brother Eduard Weyr were invited to lecture at the Congress.</li>
<li>Weyr, with great skill and ingenuity, became a great master of this method and produced many results using his approach.</li>
<li>In his own time, Emil Weyr was considered to have made more significant contributions than his younger brother Eduard Weyr but, now that we can see how the contributions of the two brothers influenced later research, it is possible to suggest that Eduard Weyr made some of the the more lasting contributions.</li>
<li>Together with the Austrian mathematician Gustav Ritter von Escherich (1849-1935), Emil Weyr founded the important mathematical journal Monatshefte für Mathematik und Physik in 1890.</li>
<li>The first volumes of the journal contain papers written by his brother Eduard Weyr.</li>
<li>In 1891 Emil Weyr became one of the first 19 founder members of the Royal Czech Academy of Sciences.</li>
<li>If among Austrian middle school teachers geometric knowledge and understanding of the methods of geometry are widely used, that is mostly due to Weyr.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 31 August 1848, Prague, Bohemia (now Czech Republic). Died 25 January 1894, Vienna, Austria.</p>
