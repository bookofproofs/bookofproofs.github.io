<p><strong>Edwin Elliott</strong> was an English mathematician whose work included algebra, algebraic geometry, synthetic geometry, elliptic functions and invariant theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After outstanding achievements at university, Elliott became a Fellow and Mathematical Tutor of Queen's College, Oxford, in 1874.</li>
<li>In addition to his Fellowship at Queen's College, Elliott was appointed a lecturer in mathematics at Corpus Christi College in Oxford in 1884.</li>
<li>These appointments came to an end in 1892 when Elliott became the first Waynflete professor of Pure Mathematics.</li>
<li>The Waynflete chair came with a Fellowship at Magdalen College so Elliott was again attached to his old College.</li>
<li>Elliott held the Waynflete chair for 29 years until his retirement in 1921.</li>
<li>In the book Elliott presented a wealth of material on invariant theory which had been developed on the Continent of Europe, but he presented it in a style which was more familiar to English mathematicians familiar with the work of Cayley and Sylvester.</li>
<li>It was a popular book and, in 1913, Elliott published a second revised edition.</li>
<li>All ageing mathematicians should be particularly pleased to learn that a second piece of work by Elliott, which was again of major importance, was his contribution to the theory of integral equations which he made after he retired.</li>
<li>Elliott wrote well and he always produced clear rigorous arguments.</li>
<li>Outside mathematics, Elliott had many interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 June 1851, Oxford, England. Died 21 July 1937, Oxford, England.</p>
