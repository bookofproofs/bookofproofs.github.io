<p><strong>James Cockle</strong> was an English lawyer and mathematician who wrote papers on both pure and applied mathematics, as well as on the history of science. He became Chief Justice of Queensland.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>James entered Stormond House, Kensington in 1825 and was educated there until 1829 when he attended Charterhouse as a day pupil for two years.</li>
<li>Many intending to enter the legal profession studied mathematics at this time and indeed Cockle began his legal training at the Middle Temple in 1838.</li>
<li>Despite the relatively low position in the tripos, Cockle had demonstrated his mathematical abilities by having a paper published while still an undergraduate.</li>
<li>Cockle was called to the bar in November 1846 and, although a barrister by profession, he maintained his interest in mathematics.</li>
<li>For his efforts in Australia, then of course a British Colony, Cockle was knighted in 1869.</li>
<li>Despite the positions of high authority that Cockle held, he was remarkably productive as a mathematician publishing over 100 papers.</li>
<li>Cockle joined the Royal Astronomical Society in 1854, the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1856, and the London Mathematical Society in 1870.</li>
<li>After his presidency of the  London Mathematical Society, Cockle became a member of the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society, serving in this role from 1888 to 1892.</li>
<li>After a brief illness, Cockle died at his home in St Stephen's Road, Bayswater.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 14 January 1819, Great Oakley, Essex, England. Died 27 January 1895, Bayswater, London, England.</p>
