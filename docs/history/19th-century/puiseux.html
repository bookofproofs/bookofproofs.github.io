<p><strong>Victor Puiseux</strong> worked on elliptic functions and studied computational methods in astronomy.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Louis Victor Puiseux was born in Paris on 23 June 1783 and became a tax collector.</li>
<li>Louis Victor was an accountant whose job was to collect the taxes on these goods.</li>
<li>Louis-Victor and Louise had three children, François Léon Puiseux born on 8 April 1814 in Jumilhac, Aquitaine, Victor Alexandre Puiseux the subject of this biography, and a daughter born in 1832 who died within a year.</li>
<li>François Léon Puiseux studied at the colleges of Pont-à-Mousson, Metz and Henri IV in Paris, and entered the École normale in Paris in 1834.</li>
<li>The Puiseux family moved to Longwy in Lorraine when Victor was only three years old, his father Louis-Victor being posted there to collect taxes.</li>
<li>When Victor was four years old his mother tried to teach him to read but at first he refused to learn.</li>
<li>In 1826 Louis Victor Puiseux was posted to Pont-à-Mousson and his son Victor was brought up in that region of France.</li>
<li>He attended the Collège de Pont-à-Mousson and while he was there his brother, who had completed his schooling in Paris and had just been accepted for admission to the École Normale, persuaded Victor also to complete his schooling in Paris.</li>
<li>In 1834 Victor went to Paris and became a boarder at the Collège Rollin.</li>
<li>At the Collège Rollin, Puiseux attended lecture courses by Charles Sturm on special mathematics.</li>
<li>Puiseux's father asked his widowed sister-in-law Elizabeth if she would keep house for him and she agreed.</li>
<li>Shortly after his mother's death Puiseux decided to stop boarding at the Collège Rollin but to continue studying there as an external student.</li>
<li>In 1836 Puiseux sat the Concours général, the most prestigious academic competition for high school students in France.</li>
<li>Although passionately interested in science, Puiseux also spent much time in philosophical and religious discussions with his fellow students.</li>
<li>In 1840 Puiseux was placed first in his final examination at the École Normale Supérieure and spent another year studying in Paris.</li>
<li>From 1841 until 1845 Puiseux taught at the Collège Royal in Rennes.</li>
<li>Another scientist appointed at the same time was the chemist Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville (1818-1881) and Puiseux quickly became friends with his colleague Deville.</li>
<li>During this period Puiseux published a series of more than ten papers in Liouville's Journal.</li>
<li>Victor and Laure Puiseux had six children: Paul Louis Puiseux (born 18 February 1851, died aged 14 on 6 January 1866); Louise Marie Laure Puiseux (born 28 December 1852, died aged 21 on 11 May 1874); Marie Fébronie Puiseux (born 20 July 1853, died aged 18 on 31 March 1872); Pierre Henri Puiseux (born 20 July 1855, became a mathematicians and astronomer with a biography in this archive, died 28 September 1928); André Victor Puiseux (born 11 September 1857, died aged 3 weeks later on 1 October 1857); and André Paul Puiseux (born 22 November 1858, died in 1931).</li>
<li>We note that Puiseux's wife Laure died on 2 December 1858, aged 28, as a result of child birth.</li>
<li>Sophie Jannet, Laure's mother, became a widow in 1861 and, having no other family, she helped out looking after Puiseux and his children.</li>
<li>Puiseux was appointed to the École Normale Supérieure as an assistant lecturer in differential calculus in 1849, replacing Jean-Marie Duhamel.</li>
<li>Jules Tannery was one of Puiseux's students at the École Normale.</li>
<li>From 1868 to 1872 Puiseux held a post at the Bureau de Longitudes.</li>
<li>In the 1860s every summer Puiseux took his five children on vacation to the French mountains where they all enjoyed very long walks.</li>
<li>While on these holidays, Puiseux would write to Sophie Jannet, Laure's mother, and these letters show how grateful he was for her support for his family.</li>
<li>Paul Puiseux died of typhoid fever in January 1866 while the family were living at 64 Rue de l'Ouest.</li>
<li>In 1867, now with four children, Puiseux went for the summer holiday to Switzerland, to the small village of Engelberg, in the Bernese Alps.</li>
<li>Puiseux returned to Paris with his two daughters, leaving Pierre with the wife of Augustin Boutan in Lectoure.</li>
<li>Puiseux, despite being 50 years old, was given a role in defending the city.</li>
<li>Puiseux's daughter Marie became ill during the Paris siege and died from tuberculosis in March 1872.</li>
<li>Puiseux had attended courses by Cauchy early in his career and he soon became interested in research in the topics Cauchy was studying.</li>
<li>Puiseux contributed to the problem of the acceleration of the mean motion of the Moon with his major paper Sur les principales integalites du mouvement de la lune Ⓣ(On the main integrals of the movement of the moon) (1864).</li>
<li>Although a purely negative conclusion, Puiseux's finding led to a better delimitation of the problem, which was investigated by G Hill in 1877.</li>
<li>Victor's son, Pierre Puiseux also studied the motion of the moon.</li>
<li>More details of the Puiseux family can be found in our biography of Pierre Puiseux.</li>
<li>Victor Puiseux also worked on elliptic functions and studied computational methods which were used to reduce astronomical data.</li>
<li>We have already noted that Puiseux was a keen mountaineer but we should record that he was the first to scale an Alpine peak which is now named after him.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 16 April 1820, Argenteuil, Val-d'Oise, France. Died 9 September 1883, Frontenay, Jura, France.</p>
