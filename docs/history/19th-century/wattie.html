<p><strong>James Wattie</strong> studied at Aberdeen and Oxford. He taught for a while at George Watson's College in Edinburgh and the Church of Scotland Training College in Aberdeen before becoming a Schools Inspector.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His parents were Alexander Wattie (1829-1864) and Betsey McPherson (1828-1915), born in Strachan, Kincardineshire.</li>
<li>James was the third of his parents' three children, having two sisters, Annie Wattie and Sarah E Wattie who were ten and two years older than him respectively.</li>
<li>His father died when he was two years old and his mother Betsey Wattie supported the family working as a school teacher.</li>
<li>Annie was an apprentice dressmaker while Sarah and James were both at school.</li>
<li>James went on to attend Old Aberdeen Grammar School before he matriculated at the University of Aberdeen in 1879.</li>
<li>James was a student at the University of Aberdeen living as a boarder at 21 King Street, Aberdeen with Peter Diack, his wife Mary and four children.</li>
<li>We note at this stage that one of Peter and Mary Diack's children was Katherine Carney Diack whom James later married.</li>
<li>James graduated from the University of Aberdeen with an M.A. in 1883 with First Class Honours in Classics and First Class Honours in Mathematics.</li>
<li>Wattie was First Class in Classical Mods in 1885.</li>
<li>After he received his B.A. from Oxford, Wattie taught at George Watson's College, Edinburgh from 1887 to 1893.</li>
<li>He married Katherine Carney Diack (born in Aberdeen 1864, died 1931) in Old Machar, Aberdeen in 1892; they had four daughters, Mary Frances Carney Wattie (born 1892 in Old Machar, Aberdeen), Katherine B McPherson Wattie (born 1896 in Old Machar, Aberdeen), Nora Isabel Wattie (born 1899 in St Andrew, Edinburgh) and Margaret Patricia McPherson Wattie (born 1903 in Monifieth).</li>
<li>In Aberdeen the Wattie family lived first at 60 Queen's Road, next at 1 Rubislaw Dens, then at 14 Hamilton Place.</li>
<li>In 1927 Wattie became Senior Chief Inspector of Schools in Scotland; he retired in the same year.</li>
<li>After he retired, Wattie had several articles published with contributions to the Year Book of Education, 1932 where he wrote Chapter 5, Scotland: elementary education; the English Association's Essays and Studies contributing the articles The Grammarian and his Material (1930) and Tense (1931); and the Transactions of Glasgow Philosophical Society in which he published A discourse on parody (read before the Society on 17 October 1928, published 1929).</li>
<li>Wattie joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in January 1889 when he was teaching English at George Watson's College, Edinburgh.</li>
<li>After Wattie died in 1943 his daughters Nora Isabel Wattie MB ChB (Assistant Medical Officer in the Public Health Department in Glasgow), Mary Frances Carney Wattie MA (married name Gant after her marriage to Thomas Harold Gant in 1921), Katherine B McPherson Wattie MA (married name Cope after her marriage to Thomas Cope), and Margaret Wattie (married name Espinasse after her marriage to the professor of zoology Paul Gilbert 'Espinasse), founded the Wattie Prize in Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Aberdeen.</li>
<li>to commemorate the name of James Macpherson Wattie, their father, the prize is awarded annually to the best candidate in English Language in the English Honours examination, provided that his or her work shows distinction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 17 November 1862, Aberdeen, Scotland. Died 6 January 1943, Glasgow, Scotland.</p>
