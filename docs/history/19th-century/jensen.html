<h1>Person: Jensen, Johan Ludwig</h1>
<p><img alt="Jensen.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Jensen.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Johan Ludwig Jensen</strong> was a Danish mathematician and engineer who worked on the Riemann hypothsis and convex functions.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>When Jensen was young his father took a position in Sweden as the manager of an estate in the north of the country.</li>
<li>Jensen always said in later life that these childhood years were "the most wonderful of his life".</li>
<li>When his position as estate manager ended Jensen's father returned to Denmark and Jensen completed his schooling in Copenhagen.</li>
<li>Jensen was essentially self taught in research level mathematics and never held an academic appointment.</li>
<li>The Company thrived, at least in part through the high level of technical skill that Jensen possessed.</li>
<li>For his whole working life Jensen was an amateur mathematician only doing mathematics in his spare time.</li>
<li>Jensen contributed to the Riemann Hypothesis, proving a theorem which he sent to Mittag-Leffler who published it in 1899.</li>
<li>The theorem is important, but does not lead to a solution of the Riemann Hypothesis as Jensen had hoped.</li>
<li>In a paper which he published in Acta mathematica in 1906, Jensen proved an inequality for convex functions which had a whole host of classical inequalities as special cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 8 May 1859, Nakskov, Denmark. Died 5 March 1925, Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
