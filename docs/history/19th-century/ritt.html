<p><strong>Joseph Ritt</strong> was an American mathematician who worked on ordinary and partial differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Observatory measured the position of celestial objects for purposes of timekeeping and navigation and in 1904, six years before Ritt took a job there, the Observatory broadcast the world's first radio time signals.</li>
<li>While he was in Washington D.C. Ritt did manage to continue his education as well as working at the Observatory.</li>
<li>He studied at the George Washington University (it had university status from 1873 but had adopted its current name only six years before Ritt began to study there).</li>
<li>He was awarded a B.A. in 1913 and, following the award, he took a summer graduate course at Columbia University (Columbia College had been renamed Columbia University in the year before Ritt took the course).</li>
<li>Edward Kasner, who was on the faculty at Columbia University, recognised Ritt's remarkable talents and he was offered a fellowship to undertake research for his doctorate at Columbia.</li>
<li>Ritt resigned his position at the Naval Observatory and began working for his doctorate which was awarded in 1917 for his thesis On a general class of linear homogeneous differential equations of infinite order with constant coefficients.</li>
<li>In 1921 Ritt was appointed as an assistant professor at Columbia University and was promoted to associate professor in 1927.</li>
<li>In fact Ritt published two important papers in 1922, namely Prime and composite polynomials  and On algebraic functions which can be expressed in terms of radicals.</li>
<li>One year before the publication of this work, Ritt had published Theory of Functions  which provides an introduction to the theory of functions in a series of short and to the point lecture notes giving the student an account of the fundamental definitions and theorems of the subject.</li>
<li>Ritt had begun a new major research topic in the 1930s when he began to create a theory of ordinary and partial differential equations.</li>
<li>The book considers the results obtained by Ritt and his students on topics such as differential polynomials, differential ideals, and differential manifolds.</li>
<li>We left our description of Ritt's career at the point where he was associate professor at Columbia University.</li>
<li>In the last three years of his life Ritt began a deep study of the applications of Lie theory to homogeneous differential equations.</li>
<li>Ritt received many honours during his career.</li>
<li>It is clear that Ritt took an unusual interest in reading the great mathematical works of his predecessors.</li>
<li>Among his heroes were Niels Henrik Abel, Augustin Louis Cauchy, David Hilbert, Carl G J Jacobi, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, the marquis Pierre Simon de Laplace, Joseph Liouville and Jules Henri Poincaré.</li>
<li>Their works set the standards Ritt tried to reach in his own mathematics, and were they to judge his work, he hoped it would be found worthy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 August 1893, New York City, USA. Died 5 January 1951, New York City, USA.</p>
