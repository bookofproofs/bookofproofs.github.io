<h1>Person: Hamel, Georg Karl Wilhelm</h1>

<p><strong>Georg Hamel</strong> was a German mathematician who worked in mechanics, the foundations of mathematics and function theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>At this time Klein was running a seminar which studied the theory of elasticity, descriptive geometry, and mechanics, and Hamel participated in this seminar.</li>
<li>Hamel was appointed Professor of Mechanics at the German Technical University of Brünn on 3 October 1905.</li>
<li>Klein spoke highly of Hamel in his reference but considered Carathéodory superior for the particular position, and Carathéodory was appointed.</li>
<li>Hamel was appointed to the chair of mechanics at the Rheinisch-Westfälische Hochschule in Aachen on 1 October 1912, then in 1919 he moved to the Technical University of Charlottenburg in Berlin where he was appointed as professor of mathematics and mechanics.</li>
<li>Hamel was clearly associated with the views of National Socialism and in 1933 spoke of a spiritual bond between mathematics and the "Third Reich".</li>
<li>Blaschke resigned the Chairmanship of the German Mathematical Society in January 1935 and Hamel was appointed chairman to replace him.</li>
<li>Although Hamel met with approval by the National Socialists, his leadership was based on mathematical scholarship despite his close links with Nazi policies.</li>
<li>Together with Süss and Behnke, Hamel also served on an Instruction Commission set up by the German Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>Hamel worked in function theory, mechanics and the foundations of mathematics.</li>
<li>He is perhaps best known for the Hamel basis, published in 1905, when he made an early and explicit use of the Axiom of Choice to construct a basis for the real numbers as a vector space over the rational numbers.</li>
<li>In 1927 Hamel computed the size of the key space of the Kryha-Ciphering-Machine, which was quoted extensively by "Internationale Kryha-Maschinen-Gesellschaft" (Hamburg) to infer the unbreakability of the Kryha machines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 12 September 1877, Düren, Rhineland, Germany. Died 4 October 1954, Landshut, Germany.</p>
