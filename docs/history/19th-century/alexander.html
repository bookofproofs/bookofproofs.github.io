<h1>Person: Alexander (2), James Waddell</h1>
<p><img alt="Alexander.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Alexander.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>James Alexander</strong> was an American mathematician who worked in topology. He is best known for the knot-theory invariant known as the Alexander polynomial.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The name Waddell came through his grandfather on his mother's side, John Waddell Alexander who was the President of the Equitable Life Assurance Society.</li>
<li>John White Alexander was quite famous in his own right as an artist and painter of murals.</li>
<li>Alexander studied mathematics and physics at Princeton, where he was a student of Veblen, obtaining a B.S. degree in 1910 and an M.S. degree in 1911.</li>
<li>During this period abroad, Alexander studied at Paris and Bologna.</li>
<li>In 1917, after marrying Natalia Levitzkaja on 15 January, later that year Alexander served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Ordnance Office at the Aberdeen Proving Ground.</li>
<li>By the end of the war Alexander had reached the rank of captain.</li>
<li>Alexander, however, never drew a salary from the Institute for Advanced Study.</li>
<li>Alexander, who held left-wing political views, began to come under suspicion from authorities who saw imaginary problems everywhere.</li>
<li>Alexander had virtually become a recluse after he retired in 1951 and the McCarthy era resulted in his disappearance from public life.</li>
<li>Alexander's work around this time went a long way to put the intuitive ideas of Poincaré on a more rigorous foundation.</li>
<li>Also before 1920 Alexander had made fundamental contributions to the theory of algebraic surfaces and to the study of Cremona transformations.</li>
<li>Soon after arriving in Princeton, Alexander generalised the Jordan curve theorem and continued his work, now exclusively on topology, with an important paper on the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem.</li>
<li>This latter paper contains the Alexander Duality Theorem and Alexander's lemma on the nnn-sphere.</li>
<li>In 1924 he introduced the now famous Alexander horned sphere.</li>
<li>In 1928 he discovered the Alexander polynomial which is much used in knot theory.</li>
<li>In the same year the American Mathematical Society awarded Alexander the Bôcher Prize for his memoir, Combinatorial analysis situs published in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society two years earlier.</li>
<li>The theory which is now called the Alexander-Spanier cohomology theory, was introduced in 1935 by Alexander but was generalised by Spanier in 1948 to the form seen today.</li>
<li>Also around 1935 Alexander discovered cohomology theory, at essentially the same time as Kolmogorov, and the theory was announced in the 1936 Moscow Conference.</li>
<li>Among the many honours bestowed on Alexander was his election to the American Academy of Sciences in 1930.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 September 1888, Sea Bright, New Jersey, USA. Died 23 September 1971, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.</p>
