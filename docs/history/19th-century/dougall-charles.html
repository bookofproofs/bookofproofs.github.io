<p><strong>Charles Shirra Dougall</strong> was a Scottish school teacher who became Rector of Dollar Academy.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>John, like Charles, achieved distinction during his undergraduate years and has a biography in this archive.</li>
<li>Charles Dougall entered the University of Glasgow after having studied at the EC Normal College.</li>
<li>Dougall was awarded an M.A. with First Class Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy from the University of Glasgow in 1894.</li>
<li>We trust that Mr Dougall will never have cause to regret the step he has taken in coming to Dollar, and that the Governors and all well-wishers will have every ground for satisfaction in the choice which has been made of a Headmaster to our far-famed Academy.</li>
<li>Dougall's appointment as Rector of Dollar Institution, followed George Thom's retirement due to ill health.</li>
<li>During Dougall's Rectorship, the Government introduced the National Pay Scale.</li>
<li>Dougall resigned through ill health in 1922, and died in Stirling in 1930.</li>
<li>In the above quote by Bruce Baillie, reference is made to Dougall's expertise as a Burns scholar.</li>
<li>The second is Robert Burns poems, epistles, songs, epigrams &amp; epitaphs, a collection of Burns' work edited by Dougall.</li>
<li>Dougall joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in January 1897 when teaching at Whitehill School in Glasgow.</li>
<li>Charles Dougall remained a member of the Society throughout his life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 3 September 1868, Kippen, Stirlingshire, Scotland. Died 2 January 1930, Stirling, Scotland.</p>
