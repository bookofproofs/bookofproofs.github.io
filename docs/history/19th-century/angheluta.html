<p><strong>Theodor Angheluță</strong> was a Romanian mathematician who made important contributions to Function Theory, to Differential and Integral Equations, and to Functional and Algebraic Equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>From 1910, Theodor Angheluță was a student at the Sorbonne in Paris, working mainly on the guidance of Émile Picard.</li>
<li>Theodor Angheluță was appointed associate professor in the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Bucharest in 1919.</li>
<li>On 16 June 1922 Angheluță defended his Ph.D. thesis On a general class of trigonometric polynomials and the approximation of a continuous function at the University of Bucharest.</li>
<li>After the award of his doctorate, in 1923 Angheluță was appointed as a full professor of Algebra in the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Cluj.</li>
<li>Angheluță was fully involved in the intense work of organizing mathematical education at the University.</li>
<li>Professor Theodor Angheluță was the dean of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Cluj between 1931 and 1932.</li>
<li>All of them began operating in November 1940 and at this time Angheluță taught at Timișoara.</li>
<li>Angheluță retired on 1 September 1947, but then, at the end of 1950, he was appointed again as a full professor at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at the Victor Babeș University of Cluj.</li>
<li>From 1 October 1955 to September 1962, Professor Theodor Angheluță was a full professor in the Mathematics Department of the Technical Institute of Cluj.</li>
<li>Theodor Angheluță made important contributions to Function Theory, to Differential and Integral Equations, and to Functional and Algebraic Equations.</li>
<li>A special kind of functional equation is today named after him, namely the 'Angheluță type functional equation'.</li>
<li>We note that this represents only small selection from the papers that Angheluță published.</li>
<li>Theodor Angheluță died at Cluj in May 1964.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 28 April 1882, Adam, Tutova county, Romania. Died 30 May 1964, Cluj, Romania.</p>
