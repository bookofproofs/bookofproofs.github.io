<h1>Person: Picard (2), Émile</h1>

<p><strong>Émile Picard</strong> worked in algebraic geometry as well as elasticity, heat and electricity.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It was during this siege that Émile's father died.</li>
<li>Picard's mother, the daughter of a medical doctor, was put in an extremely difficult position when her husband died.</li>
<li>As well as Émile, she had a second young son, and in order to support them through their education she had to find employment.</li>
<li>Only her determination to give her sons a good start, despite the tragedy, allowed Émile to receive the education which gave him the chance to achieve the highest international stading in mathematics.</li>
<li>Picard's secondary education was at the Lycée Napoléon, later called the Lycée Henri IV.</li>
<li>It was only during the vacation after completing his secondary studies that Picard read an algebra book and suddenly he became fascinated in mathematics.</li>
<li>Picard received his agrégation in 1877, being placed first.</li>
<li>In 1881 Picard was nominated for membership of the mathematics section of the Académie des Sciences.</li>
<li>He had already proved two important theorems which are both today known under Picard's name, yet it was still a little soon to gain admission to the prestigious academy and he would have to wait a few more years.</li>
<li>Picard and his wife had three children, a daughter and two sons, who were all killed in World War I.</li>
<li>In 1885 Picard was appointed to the chair of differential calculus at the Sorbonne in Paris when the chair fell vacant on the death of Claude Bouquet.</li>
<li>The regulations were circumvented by making Picard his own suppléant until he reached the age of thirty which was in the following year.</li>
<li>Picard made his most important contributions in the fields of analysis, function theory, differential equations, and analytic geometry.</li>
<li>Picard's solution was represented in the form of a convergent series.</li>
<li>Picard used the theory of Hermite's modular functions in the proof of this important result.</li>
<li>Building on work by Abel and Riemann, Picard's study of the integrals attached to algebraic surfaces and related topological questions developed into an important part of algebraic geometry.</li>
<li>Picard also discovered a group, now called the Picard group, which acts as a group of transformations on a linear differential equation.</li>
<li>Picard examined several specific cases before discussion his general theory.</li>
<li>Picard also applied analysis to the study of elasticity, heat and electricity.</li>
<li>Among the honours given to Picard was his election to the Académie des Sciences in 1889, eight years after he was first unsuccessfully nominated.</li>
<li>Picard was awarded the Poncelet Prize in 1886 and the Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques in 1888.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 July 1856, Paris, France. Died 11 December 1941, Paris, France.</p>
