<h1>Person: Sleszynski, Ivan Vladislavovich</h1>

<p><strong>Ivan Śleszyński</strong> was a Ukranian born mathematician whose main work was on continued fractions, least squares and axiomatic proof theory based on mathematical logic.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>This work by Śleszyński was more than a translation since it contained Śleszyński's own very useful commentary.</li>
<li>Śleszyński left Odessa and went to Poland in 1911 where he was appointed as an extraordinary professor at the Jagellonian University of Kraków.</li>
<li>We should note that in fact Kraków was at this time in the Austro-Hungarian Empire but, remembering Śleszyński's Polish background, it is fair to say that he was moving to Poland.</li>
<li>Śleszyński's main work was on continued fractions, least squares and axiomatic proof theory based on mathematical logic.</li>
<li>Thron demonstrates that Pringsheim was aware of Śleszyński's work, though Pringsheim himself claims that he only became aware of Śleszyński after his article was completed.</li>
<li>Śleszyński then represents the five different situations by using Venn diagrams.</li>
<li>Śleszyński then argues as follows.</li>
<li>Next Śleszyński looks at the situation where common elements exist.</li>
<li>Śleszyński also goes on to consider what happens when empty classes are allowed and shows that three further relations occur.</li>
<li>We should mention another interesting work by Śleszyński, namely On the significance of logic for mathematics (Polish) published in 1923.</li>
<li>However, despite the interesting publications we have mentioned, Śleszyński did not publish much of his work.</li>
<li>One of Śleszyński's most famous students at the Jagellonian University of Kraków was Stanisław Zaremba.</li>
<li>In 1925 Zaremba, acting as editor, published the first of two volumes of The theory of proof based on Śleszyński's lectures at Kraków.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 23 July 1854, Lysianka, Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine. Died 9 March 1931, Kraków, Poland.</p>
