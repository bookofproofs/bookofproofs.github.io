<p><strong>Francis Dominic Murnaghan</strong> was an Irish mathematician who worked in the application of group theory to continuum mechanics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His parents, Angela Mooney and George Murnaghan, were Roman Catholics although George had been educated at a Protestant school.</li>
<li>Harry Bateman had been appointed there in 1912 and his interests in partial differential equations fitted perfectly with Murnaghan's interests at the time.</li>
<li>Arriving at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Murnaghan began doctoral studies working on differential equations which arose in the study of radio-active decay.</li>
<li>In 1916 Murnaghan submitted his thesis The Lines of Electric Force Due to a Moving Electron and was awarded his Ph.D. Following this he was appointed as a lecturer at the Rice Institute in Houston, Texas.</li>
<li>Murnaghan helped supervise the studies of the first Ph.D. produced by the Rice Institute, namely Hubert Evelyn Bray whose thesis A Green's Theorem in Terms of Lebesgue Integrals was submitted in 1918, the year Murnaghan left.</li>
<li>In 1928 Frank Morley retired as Head of Mathematics at Johns Hopkins, and Murnaghan was appointed as Professor and Head of the Mathematics Department.</li>
<li>Let us now examine the mathematics which interested Murnaghan.</li>
<li>Over the period up to 1936, in addition to the major texts we have already mentioned, Murnaghan undertook research and published papers on a wide variety of topics such as electrodynamics, relativity, tensor analysis, elasticity, dynamics, aerodynamics, quantum mechanics, and celestial mechanics.</li>
<li>Although we have mentioned six books by Murnaghan, this is less than half his total of books since he published 16 in all.</li>
<li>As a teacher, Murnaghan certainly appears to have had great style.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 August 1893, Omagh, Co. Tyrone, Ireland. Died 24 March 1976, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.</p>
