<h1>Person: Stott, Alicia Boole</h1>

<p><strong>Alicia Boole Stott</strong> was a daughter of George Boole who made some discoveries in four-dimensional geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 1852 George Boole became her tutor and, following the death of her father, they married in 1855 and went to live in Castle Road, near Cork, Ireland.</li>
<li>George and Mary Boole had five daughters, Mary Ellen Boole (1856-1900) who married the mathematician Charles Howard Hinton (1853-1907), Margaret Boole (1858-1935) who married Edward Taylor and was the mother of Geoffrey Ingram Taylor, Alicia Boole the subject of this biography known to her friends as Alice, Lucy Everest Boole (1862-1905) who became a chemist and the first woman to be elected a fellow of the Institute of Chemistry, and Ethel Lilian Boole (1864-1960) who became an author.</li>
<li>Let us note the surprising fact that Charles Howard Hinton, who played a part in Alicia's mathematical education which we describe below, was convicted of bigamy after he married Maud Florence in 1883.</li>
<li>George Boole died when his daughter Alicia was only four years old and, unable to support herself without a husband, his widow Mary left Ireland with four of her five daughters to live in London.</li>
<li>However, she left Alicia in Cork to live with her maternal grandmother.</li>
<li>Alicia she was brought up partly by her grandmother, partly by her great-uncle, but these were years when she felt repressed and unhappy.</li>
<li>Mary Boole was forced to leave her job as a librarian and became a secretary to James Hinton (1822-1875), a surgeon and author, and father of the mathematician Charles Howard Hinton who married Alicia's oldest sister Mary Ellen in 1880.</li>
<li>When Alicia was sixteen, in 1876, she returned to Cork for a short while where she worked in a children's hospital.</li>
<li>Although Alicia had no formal education, she was taught by her mother Mary.</li>
<li>If we are to gain some idea about the teaching that Alicia received from her mother, we must look at Mary Boole's ideas about teaching.</li>
<li>Here are some quotes which are relevant to Alicia's education.</li>
<li>Alicia Boole experimented with the cubes and soon developed an amazing feel for four dimensional geometry.</li>
<li>Alicia Boole wrote part of the preface of this book and also wrote some of the chapters on sections of 3-dimensional solids.</li>
<li>After taking up secretarial work near Liverpool in 1889 Alicia Boole met and married the actuary Walter Stott in 1890; they had two children, Mary Stott (1891-1982) and Leonard Stott (1892-1963).</li>
<li>Through her husband, Stott learned of Pieter Hendrik Schoute's work on central sections of the regular polytopes in 1895 and Alicia Stott sent him photographs of her cardboard models.</li>
<li>Schoute was amazed to see Stott's models and immediately proposed meeting her in England.</li>
<li>He came to England for his summer holidays over the next few years and stayed with Stott at the home of her maternal cousin in Hever.</li>
<li>Schoute worked with Alicia Stott for almost 20 years, persuading her to publish her results which she did in two papers published in Amsterdam.</li>
<li>Alicia Stott made two further important discoveries relating to constructions for polyhedra related to the golden section.</li>
<li>Schoute died in April 1913 and at this point Stott's work on polytopes seems to stop.</li>
<li>Three of these papers are written jointly with late Professor Dr P H Schoute connected during so many years to the University of Groningen; And this fruitful cooperation with the professor that she lost, is the reason for the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics to propose Mrs A Boole Stott for the doctorate honoris causa in Mathematics and Physics, to confer on the occasion of the coming festive commemoration of the 300th  birthday of the University.</li>
<li>It was arranged for Stott to say with Schoute's widow when she came to Groningen to attend the celebrations and receive the honorary degree.</li>
<li>When Coxeter left England to take up a post in Toronto in 1936 he received a present from Stott in the form of an antique stained-glass Archimedian solid lampshade.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 8 June 1860, Cork, Ireland. Died 17 December 1940, Highgate Middlesex, England.</p>
