<p><strong>Henry Watson</strong> was an English mathematician who wrote some influential text-books on electricity and magnetism.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Henry was educated at King's College, London, winning the first mathematical scholarship which had been set up there, then in 1846 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, again with a scholarship.</li>
<li>In 1851 Watson became a fellow of Trinity College and from 1851 until 1853 he was a tutor in mathematics at Cambridge.</li>
<li>From 1857 Watson lectured at King's College, London.</li>
<li>Watson has been ordained a deacon in 1856 and he took priest's orders two years later.</li>
<li>After leaving Berkswell, Watson went to live in Brighton.</li>
<li>Watson wrote a number of mathematics books during the time he was rector of Berkswell.</li>
<li>After this book appeared Watson corresponded with Maxwell and the results of this correspondence is contained in the second edition of the book which appeared in 1893.</li>
<li>After publishing on dynamics in 1879, Watson wrote a two volume work The mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism.</li>
<li>He therefore persuaded Watson to take up the matter.</li>
<li>Galton had consulted Watson a year or so earlier about a device for obtaining useful work from the energy of waves...</li>
<li>Watson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1881 and given an honorary D.Sc. by Cambridge in 1883.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 February 1827, Marylebone, London, England. Died 11 January 1903, Berkswell (near Coventry), England.</p>
