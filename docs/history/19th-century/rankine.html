<p><strong>William Rankine</strong> worked on several areas of applied mathematics including mechanics, thermodynamics and waves.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rankine's interests were divided between music and mathematics.</li>
<li>For two years from 1836 to 1838 Rankine studied at the University of Edinburgh, attending a wide range of lectures in science subjects, but choosing not to attend mathematics classes.</li>
<li>From 1839 to 1841 Rankine worked on numerous projects that John Benjamin MacNeill was involved with, including river improvements, waterworks, railways and both harbours.</li>
<li>Some of the work took Rankine to Ireland.</li>
<li>Further papers read to the Institution of Civil Engineers were highly thought of and several won Rankine prizes.</li>
<li>Rankine was appointed to the regius chair of civil engineering and mechanics at Glasgow in 1855.</li>
<li>Rankine's study of the applications of mathematics began quite early in his career as an engineer.</li>
<li>Both Rankine and Clausius approached the second law of thermodynamics from the point of view of the transformation from one kind of energy to the other.</li>
<li>But whereas Clausius considered the conversion between heat and work and the flow of heat from high to low temperature in a cyclic process, Rankine concentrated on the change from kinetic (molecular) to potential energies, and related this change to heat flow by use of his "heat-potential" function.</li>
<li>Rankine's work was extended by Maxwell.</li>
<li>Rankine also wrote on fatigue in the metal of railway axles, on earth pressures in soil mechanics, and the stability of walls.</li>
<li>Rankine's health deteriorated rapidly during the final six months of his life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 July 1820, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 24 December 1872, Glasgow, Scotland.</p>
