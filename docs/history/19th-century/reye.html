<h1>Person: Reye, Karl Theodor</h1>
<p><img alt="Reye.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Reye.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Theodor Reye</strong> worked in Geometry and Projective Geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Developed a theory of the relationship between surface temperature and air pressure in 1888, which later became known as the Reye-Kelvin equation. </li>
<li>Developed a concept of local energy balance which answered questions about the Earth's overall radiation budget and was the basis for several subsequent energy balance models. </li>
<li>Pioneered and popularized some of the earliest defect-tolerant error-correcting codes, which are still in use by modern computers. </li>
<li>In harnessing and applying new mathematics techniques to atmospheric measurement challenges, Reye demonstrated the potential of applied mathematics in a wide range of disciplines. </li>
<li>Developed a theory of ocean waves which was one of the earliest attempts to understand the motions of large areas of water and has been used by engineers and scientists ever since. </li>
<li>Examined the structure of glaciers, recognizing the implications they had on climate and hydrologic processes. </li>
<li>Became the first to formalize the concept of twice-daily variation in atmospheric pressure commonly known as the semi-diurnal tide. </li>
<li>Influenced the early works of modern physics by applying mathematical principles to derive physical laws. </li>
<li>Established important correlations between air pressure and temperature which are still relevant for modern weather forecasting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 20 June 1838, Ritzebüttel, near Cuxhaven, Germany. Died 2 July 1919, Würzburg, Germany.</p>
