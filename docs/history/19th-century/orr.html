<p><strong>William McFadden Orr</strong> was an Irish mathematician who worked on thermodynamics and fluid flow.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Published a paper at the age of 17 which impressed Hermann Gordan, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was working on problems of Euclidean domains. </li>
<li>Completed a doctorate at the age of 22 from the University of Pennsylvania with a dissertation on the application of Infinitesimal Calculus to potential functions.</li>
<li>Introduced the concept of "dynamic forces" while researching the lunar disturbances and their effect on the motion of the Earth.</li>
<li>Collaborated with John von Neumann on the development of an algebraic approach to differential equations. </li>
<li>Developed a method to analyze potential functions which is still used today in Astronomy.</li>
<li>Appointed as the foundation professor of mathematics at McGill University at the age of 24.</li>
<li>Authored several texts in mathematics including Differential Equations and The Calculus of Finite Differences and Differential Equations. </li>
<li>Developed a fast-running method for solving linear equations which was later used by other mathematicians in their research. </li>
<li>Helped prove the Jordan Curve theorem which is a statement about the properties of a simple closed curve. 
10.Broadened the range of what mathematics could do by opening up ways to think about more abstract problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 2 May 1866, Ballystockhart, Comber, County Down, Ireland. Died 14 August 1934, Douglas, Isle of Man.</p>
