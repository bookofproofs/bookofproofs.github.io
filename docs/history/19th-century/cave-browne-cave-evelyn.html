<p><strong>Frances Evelyn Cave-Browne-Cave</strong> was home educated, then studied the mathematical tripos at the University of Cambridge, being ranked next to G H Hardy. She was the first recipient of a research grant from Girton College, worked with Karl Pearson and published two papers. She spent the rest of her career teaching at Girton College.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thomas Cave-Browne-Cave was a civil servant who became Deputy Accountant-General of the Army from 1897 to 1900 and a Commissioner of the Royal Hospital Chelsea from 1899 to 1923.</li>
<li>Thomas and Blanche Cave-Browne-Cave had six children only five of whom reached adulthood: Blanche Isabel Cave-Browne-Cave (12 July 1871 - 10 August 1871); Jeanette Gertrude Cave-Browne-Cave (16 September 1872 - 9 March 1950); Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave (30 May 1874 - 9 July 1947); Frances Evelyn Cave-Browne-Cave (21 February 1876 - 30 March 1965), the subject of this biography; Thomas Reginald Cave-Browne-Cave (11 January 1885 - 26 November 1969); and Henry Meyrick Cave-Browne-Cave (1 February 1887 - 5 August 1965).</li>
<li>Frances Evelyn Cave-Browne-Cave appears on her mathematical publications as "F E Cave-Browne-Cave" but in her less formal works she gives her name as "F E Cave." We will refer to Frances Evelyn Cave-Browne-Cave as "Evelyn" and her sister Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave as "Beatrice" throughout this biography to avoid confusion.</li>
<li>Evelyn was brought up in quite privileged circumstances.</li>
<li>The three sisters were all educated at home and by the time of the 1891 census Evelyn was living with her parents, two sisters, two brothers, and four servants (cook, nurse, parlour maid, and housemaid).</li>
<li>Neither of Evelyn's brothers studied at university but both became engineers, first in the navy and then the Royal Air Force on its formation in 1918.</li>
<li>At Cambridge, Evelyn was in the same year as G H Hardy and James Hopwood Jeans.</li>
<li>Evelyn was ranked between the Fourth and Fifth Wranglers, so above her were Ronald William Henry Turnbull Hudson (1876-1904), the Senior Wrangler, John Forbes Cameron (1873-1952), James Hopwood Jeans and G H Hardy.</li>
<li>After this outstanding performance, Evelyn was offered a three-year research studentship by Girton College.</li>
<li>Evelyn undertook research at Girton College, advised by Karl Pearson.</li>
<li>The author is given as F E Cave-Browne-Cave with some assistance from Karl Pearson.</li>
<li>Both sisters Cave-Browne-Cave were among the six collaborators who worked on the project.</li>
<li>Only a few assistants, including Frances and Beatrice Cave-Browne-Cave, processed the data, creating tables, and computing correlations.</li>
<li>In 1905 Evelyn published a follow-up paper to the one she had published in 1902.</li>
<li>The paper was titled On the Influence of the Time Factor on the Correlation between the Barometric Heights at Stations more than 1000 Miles apart and had the single author F E Cave-Browne-Cave.</li>
<li>This paper was the last of Evelyn's research publications and from that time on she concentrated on teaching and administration.</li>
<li>Evelyn was a gifted teacher who was especially talented in helping less able students: a stammer that affected her normal speech completely disappeared when she was teaching.</li>
<li>Her father, four of her siblings (Beatrice and her two brothers), and many others named Cave-Browne-Cave are buried in St Peter's Churchyard.</li>
<li>We promised further details of Evelyn's brothers.</li>
<li>Thomas Reginald Cave-Browne-Cave attended Dulwich College and became an Engineering Officer in the Royal Navy.</li>
<li>Henry Meyrick Cave-Browne-Cave initially followed a similar career to his brother, being trained at Dulwich College, and becoming an Engineering Officer in the Royal Navy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 February 1876, Streatham Common, London, England. Died 30 March 1965, Shedfield, Hampshire, England.</p>
