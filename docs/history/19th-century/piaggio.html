<p><strong>H T H Piaggio</strong> graduated from Cambridge and then worked at the University of Nottingham. He is best known for his text-book on Differential Equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His mother was Mary Piaggio (born at St Pancras, London about 1855) who was a cloakroom attendant.</li>
<li>H T H Piaggio  had a younger sister Edith Mabel (born about 1888) who became a shorthand typist.</li>
<li>He also had a younger brother Edward Ernest (born about 1894) who became a clerk.</li>
<li>H T H Piaggio was educated at the City of London School and at St John's College, Cambridge.</li>
<li>In 1908 he was appointed Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Nottingham although at that time there was no separate Department of Mathematics there.</li>
<li>A chair of mathematics was created at Nottingham and Piaggio was appointed to it in 1919.</li>
<li>His most famous work, An Elementary Treatise on Differential Equations, was published by G Bell &amp; Sons in 1920.</li>
<li>Full details of his life appear in the obituary by D A Young.</li>
<li>Here list a few articles which Piaggio published in The Mathematical Gazette: Relativity rhymes with a mathematical commentary (January 1922); Geometry and relativity (July 1922); Mathematics for evening technical students (July 1924); Mathematical physics in university and school (October 1924); Probability and its applications (July 1931); Three Sadleirian professors: A R Forsyth, E W Hobson and G H Hardy (October 1931); Mathematics and psychology (February 1933); Lagrange's equation (May 1935); Fallacies concerning averages (December 1937); and The incompleteness of "complete" primitives of differential equations (February 1939).</li>
<li>In Nature  Piaggio published articles such as The operational calculus (1943) and The significance and development of Hamilton's quaternions (1943).</li>
<li>In the Proceedings of the Glasgow Mathematical Association he published Exceptional integrals of a not completely integrable total differential equation (1953).</li>
<li>The author effectively remarks that this is not a necessary condition for the existence of a solution.</li>
<li>Piaggio was a member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, joining the Society in May 1912.</li>
<li>He read papers to the Society such as Note on Linear Differential Equations with constant coefficients  on 10 May 1912.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 2 June 1884, London, England. Died 26 June 1967, Cedars Home, Nottingham, England.</p>
