<p><strong>Emory McClintock</strong> was an American mathematician and actuary.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>As well as being a clergyman in the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Reverend McClintock taught mathematics, Greek, and Latin at Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania.</li>
<li>McClintock spent the latter part of 1860 studying chemistry at the University of Paris and then in the following year he studied at Göttingen.</li>
<li>By April 1861 the civil war had broken out and by February 1862 McClintock felt that he had to return to support his country.</li>
<li>By the time McClintock returned to the United States the South had already introduced conscription and the Union was encouraging volunteers for military service although they had not yet introduced conscription.</li>
<li>McClintock immediately decided to volunteer for the Union army and was offered a post as a second lieutenant in the Topographical Engineers.</li>
<li>McClintock was for many years the leading actuary in America.</li>
<li>In 1889 when McClintock took up his actuarial post with the Mutual Life Insurance Company in New York, the New York Mathematical Society was just coming into existence.</li>
<li>McClintock joined the Society in December 1889 and was elected vice-president of the Society.</li>
<li>During McClintock's presidential term, Klein visited the Society and talked on non-euclidean spherical trigonometry.</li>
<li>Study also addressed the Society during McClintock's term as president and talked on his work with Engel.</li>
<li>Before ending this biography we should mention McClintock's hobbies of genealogy and military history.</li>
<li>A series of notebooks reflecting specific research into the Baskerville, Kemble, McClintock, and Wakeman families record the lines of descent through each ancestral surname.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 September 1840, Carlisle, Pennsylvania , USA. Died 10 July 1916, Bay Head, New Jersey, USA.</p>
