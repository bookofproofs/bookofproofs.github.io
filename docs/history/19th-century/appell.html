<p><strong>Paul Appell</strong> was a French mathematician who worked in analysis, geometry and mechanics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Appell rejected the Catholic views of his parents but he retained their strong patriotic French views.</li>
<li>The Germans captured Strasbourg after a 50-day siege in which Appell suffered greatly.</li>
<li>Strasbourg was annexed by the Germans and Appell moved to Nancy to become a French citizen and prepare himself to study at university in Paris.</li>
<li>Appell became a life-long friend of Poincaré while at Nancy.</li>
<li>Appell now worked in Paris but returned for each vacation to German held Alsace.</li>
<li>In 1892 Appell was elected to the Académie des Sciences.</li>
<li>Dreyfus, like Appell, came from Alsace.</li>
<li>Appell was very much involved with the case.</li>
<li>When Dreyfus was granted a retrial in 1904, Appell served as an expert on the commission that, by July 1906, had cleared Dreyfus and reversed all previous convictions.</li>
<li>After the war Appell had the ambition of his life fulfilled when his homeland of Alsace was returned to France.</li>
<li>Also following the war the League of Nations was set up by the Allies at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, and Appell served as secretary-general for the French Association during the 1920s when the League had its headquarters at Geneva.</li>
<li>Appell's first paper in 1876 was based on projective geometry continuing work of Chasles.</li>
<li>In 1880 Appell defined a series of functions satisfying the condition that the derivative of the nnnth function is nnn times the (n−1)(n - 1)(n−1)th function.</li>
<li>These are now called the Appell polynomials.</li>
<li>There is an obvious question that we must ask ourselves about Appell.</li>
<li>This is a pretty accurate assessment: Appell was one of the finest problem solvers there has been in mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 27 September 1855, Strasbourg, France. Died 24 October 1930, Paris, France.</p>
