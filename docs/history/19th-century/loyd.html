<p><strong>Sam Loyd</strong> was an American amateur mathematician best known for his invention of puzzles as well as chess problems.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>While still at school, Loyd won prizes for his chess problems.</li>
<li>Loyd's first chess problem was published in the New York Saturday Courier on 14 April 1855.</li>
<li>After leaving school Loyd began to study engineering, intending to become a steam and mechanical engineer, but he found he could make his living from his puzzles and chess problems.</li>
<li>Loyd's interests were by now rather diverse for as well as earning money as a plumbing contractor he had purchased a chain of music stores.</li>
<li>He continued to compose chess problems, write newspaper columns, and edit papers such as Sam Loyd's Puzzle Magazine and even a mechanics journal.</li>
<li>By 1870 Loyd had become more interested in composing mathematical puzzles than chess problems.</li>
<li>As well as chess problems of the type "White to play and mate in three", Loyd also produced mathematical problems involving chess boards.</li>
<li>Loyd discussed this in the April 1908 edition of Sam Loyd's Puzzle Magazine.</li>
<li>Loyd contributed the following problems to the first part of the American Chess Journal.</li>
<li>These show Loyd's genius very clearly - particularly d) which is an incredible achievement.</li>
<li>Loyd's most famous puzzle was the 15 Puzzle which he produced in 1878.</li>
<li>Of course, Loyd knew his $1000 was safe for the puzzle cannot be solved.</li>
<li>Another of Loyd's famous puzzles was called "Get off the Earth" and was produced many years after the 15 Puzzle.</li>
<li>We have talked about mathematical puzzles invented by Loyd.</li>
<li>At first sight one would not expect there to be a unique solution to this problem, but Loyd was well aware that a logical argument would find the one and only one solution.</li>
<li>Not only did Loyd produce puzzles, he also gave performances of tricks.</li>
<li>Loyd produced over 10 000 puzzles in his lifetime many involving sophisticated mathematical ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 31 January 1841, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , USA. Died 10 April 1911, New York, USA.</p>
