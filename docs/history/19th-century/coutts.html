<p><strong>William Coutts</strong> graduated from Edinburgh University and after a period in the Army in World War I he became interested in the mathematical theory of artillery. He became a Professor at the Military College of Science at Shrivenham.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His mother was  Elizabeth Martin Barron (born in St Cuthberts, Edinburgh about 1857).</li>
<li>He had two younger brothers, Alexander (born about 1888) and Robert (born about 1888).</li>
<li>William B Coutts' home was at Green Croft, Kinghorn.</li>
<li>He first matriculated at Edinburgh University in October 1904.</li>
<li>In his first year he took Latin and Mathematics, failing both subjects in April 1905, but passing them in the October resits.</li>
<li>His second year was slightly more successful since he passed Natural Philosophy and English at the first attempt in April 1906 but failed Logic and Metaphysics.</li>
<li>He sat the examination in Logic and Metaphysics at the resit in October 1906 but, despite improving his performance from 25% to 40%, he failed again.</li>
<li>He passed Logic and Metaphysics at the third attempt in April 1907, achieving a comfortable pass at 58%.</li>
<li>He also took three attempts to pass Chemistry, failing in July 1907 and April 1908, but passing in July 1908.</li>
<li>He took Honours courses in Mathematics, Analytical Dynamics, Thermodynamics, and Advanced Experimental Physics between summer 1906 and 1909, but graduated M.A. without Honours in 1909.</li>
<li>He was awarded a B.Sc. (Pure) by the University of Edinburgh in 1912.</li>
<li>After graduating, Coutts taught at George Heriot's School, Edinburgh.</li>
<li>He was commissioned in 1915 to the Royal Garrison Artillery and served at Gibraltar.</li>
<li>The Royal Garrison Artillery dealt with coastal defence, mountain, siege and heavy batteries, and was responsible for ammunition storage and supply.</li>
<li>It was during this period that Coutts became interested in mathematical questions relating to firing.</li>
<li>He married Isabella Muirhead Allan (Chorlton, Lancashire, 1884-1973).</li>
<li>William Baron Coutts was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 1 December 1913.</li>
<li>He was proposed for the fellowship by Ralph Allan Sampson, John Brown Clark, Cargill Gilston Knott, and James Robert Milne.</li>
<li>His obituary, written by J R H Whiston, appeared in the Royal Society of Edinburgh Year Book (1948-1949), page 12.</li>
<li>Born at Kinghorn, Fifeshire, on May 26, 1885, he was educated at Edinburgh University and after a period as a schoolmaster was commissioned in 1915 to the R.G.A. (S.R.).</li>
<li>He served at Gibraltar, and it was his work on the Rock which created his lifelong interest in the problems of fire direction and control.</li>
<li>In 1917 he was recalled to join the 35th  Advanced Class and after completing the course and obtaining the p.a.c. - a distinction of which he was very proud - he was appointed first Instructor and then Senior Lecturer in Range Finding at the College.</li>
<li>In 1938 he was promoted to be Assistant Professor of Fire Control Instruments, a position which he held until his death.</li>
<li>He was also a member of the Council of the Optical Society and for a period of five years was one of its Honorary Secretaries.</li>
<li>He was for many years a regular contributor on Optical Instruments in the Journal of Scientific Instruments.</li>
<li>He was beloved alike by his colleagues and students, to whom he was universally known as "Willie", and his gift of dry Scotch humour enlivened many otherwise dreary conferences and lectures.</li>
<li>His specialised knowledge of optical and fire control instruments, and his ability to teach the subjects to technical officers will be a great loss.</li>
<li>He is one of quite a number who attended the 1913 Edinburgh Mathematical Colloquium held in Edinburgh during the week beginning Monday 4th  August 1913, then applied for membership of the Society.</li>
<li>After he became a Professor at the Military College of Science, he left the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.</li>
