<p><strong>Ramchundra</strong> was an Indian mathematician whose book, <em>Treatise on Problems of Maxima and Minima</em>, was promoted by De Morgan.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ramchundra's early education was at home, a standard for India at that time, but he also attended school in Panipat from the age of six.</li>
<li>In 1833 Ramchundra entered the English Government School in Delhi.</li>
<li>The College incorporated the English Government School which Ramchundra attended.</li>
<li>In 1841 Ramchundra competed for a scholarship and was awarded a senior scholarship of thirty rupees per month.</li>
<li>Ramchundra began a programme of translating and compiling works into Urdu.</li>
<li>Ramchundra, along with the advanced students in the English and Oriental departments of the Delhi College, founded a Society of the Diffusion of Knowledge in 1847.</li>
<li>In another monthly publication, founded in September 1847 and published by Delhi College, Ramchundra contributed articles on a wide variety of topics including: A Description of the Diving Bell, by which Sunken Materials may be retrieved from the Sea; A Discussion of the Mistakes that Hindu Learned Men have made in Various Sciences in the Shastras; On Astronomy; On the work of Sir Isaac Newton; A discussion of the Relationship of the Human Mind and Body; On Demosthenes; On Confucius; and A biography of the Safavid Shah Abbas.</li>
<li>In 1850 Ramchundra published at Calcutta, at his own expense, the book A treatise on problems of maxima and minima solved by algebra.</li>
<li>In 1852 Ramchundra converted to Christianity.</li>
<li>Ramchundra's health was not good at this stage and he retired from his position as headmaster on grounds of ill health in 1866 when 45 years of age.</li>
<li>Though Niven addresses the same ideas and even some of the same problems as Ramchundra addressed over a century earlier, he has completely overlooked his Indian predecessor.</li>
<li>Despite the illustrious De Morgan's efforts to make this remarkable Hindu algebraist known, Ramchundra does not appear in Niven's text, index, or bibliography.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1821, Panipat, India. Died 11 August 1880, Delhi, India.</p>
