<h1>Person: Boruvka, Otakar</h1>

<p><strong>Otakar Boruvka</strong> was a Czech mathematician known for his work in graph theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>With the influence of the military increasing, Boruvka went to the military school in Hranice in northern Moravia.</li>
<li>In 1920 Boruvka became an assistant at the Institute of Physics and, in the same year, began taking courses also at the Masarak University in Brno.</li>
<li>Lerch became the first professor of mathematics at this new university and he selected Boruvka to become his research assistant in 1921.</li>
<li>Boruvka then became Čech's research assistant and Čech interested Boruvka in differential geometry.</li>
<li>After being awarded his doctorate in 1923, Boruvka continued to undertake research at Masaryk University.</li>
<li>To many people Boruvka is best known for his solution of the Minimal Spanning Tree problem which he published in 1926 in two papers On a certain minimal problem (Czech) and Contribution to the solution of a problem of economical construction of electrical networks (Czech).</li>
<li>The problem had been suggested to Boruvka before he became a university student.</li>
<li>Boruvka was offered a job with West-Moravian Powerplants at this time but declined.</li>
<li>Moreover, recent development places Boruvka's pioneering work in a new and very contemporary context.</li>
<li>One can even say that out of many available Minimal Spanning Tree algorithms, Boruvka's algorithm is presently the basis of the fastest known algorithms.</li>
<li>Čech suggested to Boruvka that he should go abroad and broaden his mathematical horizons.</li>
<li>An obvious choice, suggested Čech, was Paris where Boruvka could work with Élie Cartan.</li>
<li>The graph theory work undertaken by Boruvka early in his career did not lead to further work in this area.</li>
<li>Boruvka had already written a paper on differential equations in 1934, but now he began to direct the research of Masaryk University towards that topic.</li>
<li>In 1946 Boruvka became an ordinary professor at Masaryk University and in the following year he set up a Differential Equations Seminar.</li>
<li>Much of his work, and that of others participating in his seminar, is contained in Boruvka's book Lineare differential- transformationen 2.</li>
<li>Among the many honours which Boruvka receiced were election to the Czech Academy of Sciences (corresponding member 1953, ordinary member 1965), and honorary doctorates from Bratislava (1969) and Brno (1994).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 10 May 1899, Uhersky Ostroh, Austria-Hungary (now Czech Republic). Died 22 July 1995, Brno, Czech Republic.</p>
