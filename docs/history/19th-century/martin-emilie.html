<p><strong>Emilie Martin</strong> was an American mathematician and professor of mathematics at Mount Holyoke College. Her research focused on primitive substitution groups.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Robert Wilkie Martin was born in Port Richmond, Philadelphia on 14 June 1841.</li>
<li>His parents, Thomas Martin and Agnes Thornley, were both born in Bolton, England, and emigrated to the United States.</li>
<li>Robert Martin became a prominent homeopathic surgeon in Philadelphia.</li>
<li>Collier Ford Martin became a physician and professor of medicine in Philadelphia.</li>
<li>Emilie Martin's preparation to study at college was two-fold, partly by attending Mrs E L Head's School in Germantown, Philadelphia, and partly by studying on her own.</li>
<li>Mrs E L Head's School provided a way for women students to prepare for entry into Bryn Mawr College and Martin was one of a number of students taking that route.</li>
<li>Bryn Mawr College was quite a young institution when Martin began her studies there for it had been founded only five years earlier in 1885.</li>
<li>The head of mathematics at Bryn Mawr College when Martin studied there was Charlotte Angas Scott who had been a student of Arthur Cayley in Girton College, University of Cambridge.</li>
<li>In 1893, while she was a student at Bryn Mawr College, Martin started to act as a private tutor in mathematics and Latin.</li>
<li>Bryn Mawr College was the first institution in the United States to offer higher degrees to women and, after graduating in 1894, Martin spent a semester as a graduate student.</li>
<li>After one semester of graduate study, Martin spent the second semester of 1894-95 as a teacher of Latin in the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore.</li>
<li>This was the school where Martin taught Latin.</li>
<li>The fellowship was established in 1894 and Martin received $500 which funded her stay during 1897-98 at the Göttingen University in Germany.</li>
<li>After her year at Göttingen, Martin returned to Bryn Mawr College where she was appointed as a fellow by courtesy in mathematics for 1898-99.</li>
<li>Martin taught there until the end of the first semester of 1904-05.</li>
<li>Martin spent 1906-07 undertaking postdoctoral study at Bryn Mawr before returning to her position as an instructor in mathematics at Mount Holyoke College.</li>
<li>Martin published Some varieties of space in The Mathematics Teacher 16 (8) (1923), 470-480.</li>
<li>Martin was promoted to full professor in 1925 and took on the role of Chairman of the Mathematics Department in 1927.</li>
<li>As an influential member of the faculty, Miss Martin was vigorous and wise in her judgment, never passive, and never satisfied with the second-rate.</li>
<li>The college has reason to give thanks for Miss Martin's long and valuable service as teacher, as head of an important department, as member of many student and faculty groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 30 December 1869, Elizabeth, New Jersey, USA. Died 8 February 1936, South Hadley, Massachusetts, USA.</p>
