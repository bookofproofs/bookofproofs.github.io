<p><strong>Charles Weatherburn</strong> worked on vector analysis and differential geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Charles was educated at Blackfriars School, Chippendale, Sydney and the Sydney Boys' High School which he entered in 1897.</li>
<li>This was the first building designed as a High School in any of the Colonies and it was in this building that Weatherburn studied.</li>
<li>Following the award of his M.A., Weatherburn went to England in 1906, after the award of a scholarship, and studied at Trinity College Cambridge where he attended lectures by Alfred North Whitehead, Edmund Whittaker and G H Hardy.</li>
<li>Charles and Lucy May Weatherburn had three sons, one of whom was Alan Keith Weatherburn (1911-2006).</li>
<li>Weatherburn was appointed as a teacher of mathematics and physics at Sydney Boys' High School in 1909.</li>
<li>In addition to teaching at the High School, Weatherburn also taught mathematics and physics at St Paul's College, an all male College affiliated to the University of Sydney.</li>
<li>The professor of mathematics at Melbourne was John Henry Michell and he encouraged Weatherburn to write a book on vector analysis.</li>
<li>Certainly vector analysis was not universally accepted at this time and Weatherburn fought the battle for its acceptance against opposition from people such as Harold Jeffreys.</li>
<li>The young Weatherburn, however, read practically all the accessible literature and applied his own vector methods in an endeavour to arrive at a decision on the theory.</li>
<li>The above quotation gives us a good insight into the character of Weatherburn - a man who would not take a decision lightly, who would not be swayed by others simply because of their standing and reputation, and a man who firmly believed in the simplicity and goodness of life.</li>
<li>Weatherburn did indeed apply his own vector methods to the theory of general relativity and published the paper Vector algebra in general relativity in 1921.</li>
<li>This paper was one of twenty that Weatherburn published while at Melbourne.</li>
<li>Weatherburn left Sydney in 1923 to take up the chair of mathematics and natural philosophy in Canterbury College, University of New Zealand.</li>
<li>In 1929 Weatherburn returned to Australia taking up the chair of mathematics at the University of Western Australia (founded 1911), becoming the first holder of this chair.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 June 1884, Chippendale, Sydney, Australia. Died 18 October 1974, Claremont, Perth, Australia.</p>
