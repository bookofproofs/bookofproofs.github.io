<p><strong>Anton Dimitrija Bilimovic</strong> wasa Ukranian-born mathematician who worked on a wide variety of both pure and applied mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anton attended elementary school in Vladimir, the main town of Vladimir Oblast, Russia, located on the Klyazma River about 190 km east of Moscow.</li>
<li>Bilimovic wanted to become a professor so he had to obtain a doctorate (similar to the German habilitation).</li>
<li>Bilimovic then spent the following year 1906-07 at the University of Göttingen in Germany where he worked with David Hilbert.</li>
<li>After spending these two years abroad, Bilimovic returned to the Ukraine and defended his doctoral thesis Contact motion of rigid body, first part: Motion with one degree of freedom at the University of Odessa in 1907.</li>
<li>At the University, Bilimovic was one of the founding members of the Belgrade school of mechanics.</li>
<li>We have already mentioned some of Bilimovic's mathematical contributions.</li>
<li>The main characteristic of his scientific opus is that he did not address only problems of one narrow scientific field, but Bilimovic also studied the problems of theory of curves and surface, rational mechanics, celestial mechanics and geophysics, nonanalytical functions and vector calculus.</li>
<li>The war years, during which most of the papers we have just mentioned were published, were difficult ones for Bilimovic with his Russian background.</li>
<li>Bilimovic was now a Russian in Belgrade which was under German rule yet Germany was at war with the Soviet Union.</li>
<li>In his preface Bilimovic first gives the phenomenological interpretation of a principle of mechanics which is called Pfaff's principle and the substance of which, in a different form, has been known for quite a long time.</li>
<li>Professor Bilimovic said to students: "Now, the theorem is proved."</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 20 July 1879, Zhytomyr, Zhytomyrs'ka oblast, Ukraine. Died 17 September 1970, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, now Serbia.</p>
