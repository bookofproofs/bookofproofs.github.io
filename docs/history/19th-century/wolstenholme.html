<p><strong>Joseph Wolstenholme</strong>  was an English mathematician who made a significant contribution to mathematical education.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Joseph studied at Wesley College in Sheffield, then entered St John's College, Cambridge on 1 July 1846 and, four years later, he graduated as Third Wrangler (he was ranked third in the list of first class degrees given in mathematics that year).</li>
<li>Wolstenholme was awarded a fellowship to St John's College in March 1852.</li>
<li>On four occasions during the years that he held the fellowship at Christ's College Wolstenholme was an examiner for the mathematical tripos (1854, 1856, 1863, 1870).</li>
<li>One of the conditions of fellowships was that the holder had to be unmarried, so when Wolstenholme wished to marry a Swiss girl on 27 July 1869, he had to resign his fellowship.</li>
<li>However, Wolstenholme continued to take pupils at Cambridge for two years after resigning his fellowship.</li>
<li>In 1871 Wolstenholme was appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper's Hill, near London.</li>
<li>He married Therese Wolstenholme (born in Zürich, Switzerland about 1851) and they had three children: Rowland  (born about 1873), Cecil  (born about 1874) and Aubrey (born about 1877).</li>
<li>Wolstenholme's problems have proved a help and a stimulus to many students.</li>
<li>During that period he became friends with Wolstenholme.</li>
<li>Stephen's daughter, Virginia Woolf, was a young girl when Wolstenholme shared the family holidays.</li>
<li>She later incorporated Wolstenholme into one of her most famous books To the Lighthouse.</li>
<li>In this book Mr Augustus Carmichael is based on Wolstenholme.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 30 September 1829, Eccles (near Manchester), England. Died 18 November 1891, Maida Vale, London, England.</p>
