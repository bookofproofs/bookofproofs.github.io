<p><strong>Hilda Hudson</strong> was an English mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>William Hudson was appointed Professor of Mathematics at King's College London in 1882 holding the post until 1903.</li>
<li>After leaving Cambridge, Hilda Hudson went to Germany for a year spending the time studying at the University of Berlin with Schwarz, Schottky, Edmund Landau and others.</li>
<li>Hudson was Associate Research Fellow at Newnham College until the end of the academic year 1912-1913, but she spent this last academic year at Bryn Mawr College, a private women's college founded in 1885 in Pennsylvania in the United States.</li>
<li>Charlotte Angas Scott, who had studied under Cayley and shared Hudson's interests in algebraic geometry, was Head of the Mathematics department there.</li>
<li>It was a remarkably productive period for Hudson who published her first paper in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society in 1911, followed by three papers in 1912, and six papers on topics such as Cremona transformations, nodal curves, pinch-points, and algebraic surfaces in 1913.</li>
<li>After spending the academic year 1912-13 at Bryn Mawr, Hudson returned to England.</li>
<li>In 1919, after the war had ended, Hudson was appointed as a technical assistant at Parnell and Company in Bristol.</li>
<li>During the years in which she was writing her major treatise Hudson returned to publishing on Cremona transformations and algebraic surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 June 1881, Cambridge, England. Died 26 November 1965, London, England.</p>
