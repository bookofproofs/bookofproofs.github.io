<p><strong>John Venn</strong> was an English mathematician and logician best known for the Venn diagrams which can be used to visualise the unions and intersections of sets.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His father was the Rev Henry Venn who, at the time of John's birth, was the rector of the parish of Drypool, near Hull.</li>
<li>The Rev Henry Venn, himself a fellow of Queen's, was from a family of distinction.</li>
<li>His father, John's grandfather, was the Rev John Venn who had been the rector of Clapham in south London.</li>
<li>It was not only Venn's grandfather who played a prominent role in the evangelical Christian movement, for so did his father the Rev Henry Venn.</li>
<li>The Rev Henry Venn became secretary to this Society in 1841 and in order to carry out his duties moved to Highgate near London.</li>
<li>As might be expected from his family background, John was very strictly brought up, and there was never any thought other than that he would follow the family tradition into the priesthood.</li>
<li>He had already become interested logic, philosophy and metaphysics, reading the treatises of De Morgan, Boole, John Austin, and John Stuart Mill.</li>
<li>Venn extended Boole's mathematical logic and is best known to mathematicians and logicians for his diagrammatic way of representing sets, and their unions and intersections.</li>
<li>In 1867 Venn married Susanna Carnegie Edmonstone, the daughter of the Rev Charles Edmonstone.</li>
<li>They had one child, a son John Archibald Venn, who became president of Queen's College, Cambridge, in 1932, and undertook major collaborative research projects with his father that we give more details on below.</li>
<li>Venn published Symbolic Logic in 1881 and The Principles of Empirical Logic in 1889.</li>
<li>In 1883 Venn was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in the same year was awarded a Sc.D. by Cambridge.</li>
<li>finding himself still less in sympathy with the orthodox clerical outlook, Venn availed himself of the Clerical Disabilities Act.</li>
<li>Venn's interest turned towards history and he signalled this change in direction by donating his large collection of books on logic to the Cambridge University Library in 1888.</li>
<li>In 1910 he published a work on historical biography, namely a treatise on John Caius, one of the founders of his College.</li>
<li>At the time of Venn's death the second part, covering the period from 1751 to 1900, existed in manuscript and contained a further 60,000 names.</li>
<li>Venn had other skills and interests too, including a rare skill in building machines.</li>
<li>He used his skill to build a machine for bowling cricket balls which was so good that when the Australian Cricket team visited Cambridge in 1909, Venn's machine clean bowled one of its top stars four times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 August 1834, Hull, England. Died 4 April 1923, Cambridge, England.</p>
