<p><strong>Ludwig Berwald</strong> was a Czech mathematician who made important contributions to differential geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Max and Friedericke had there children; Ludwig had one brother and one sister.</li>
<li>Ludwig entered the Graben Gymnasium, previously called the Imperial Royal State High School of Prague, in 1893.</li>
<li>Around 1900 Max Berwald sold his bookshop in Prague and moved with his family to Munich.</li>
<li>There Ludwig continued his education at the Luitpold Gymnasium, completing his school education in 1902.</li>
<li>He entered the Royal Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich in the Fall of 1892, where he pursued his studies in mathematics and physics.</li>
<li>After the award of the doctorate, Berwald was appointed as assistant to Heinrich Burkhardt.</li>
<li>This should have presented Berwald with the opportunity to work on his habilitation thesis so that he could become a privatdozent in Munich, but sadly he had rather severe health problems.</li>
<li>On 12 September 1915 Berwald married Hedwig Adler, the daughter of Friedericke and Emanuel Adler, who had also been born in Prague; she was eight years older than her husband.</li>
<li>After that Berwald and his wife made many trips to Prague, and there he got to know two mathematics lecturers Gerhard Kowalewski and Georg Pick.</li>
<li>With their support, Berwald became a lecturer at the German University in Prague.</li>
<li>After Pick retired in 1929, Berwald became Head of the Mathematics Department.</li>
<li>Berwald was tall and slender in statue.</li>
<li>As a result of his early serious illness Berwald was very prone to colds.</li>
<li>Berwald was an excellent pianist and also played chamber music with a certain well-ordered regularity that enabled him to study a broad range of musical literature together with his fellow musicians, among them Professor Pick who played the violin.</li>
<li>One could make Berwald very happy if one turned the conversation to his Dalmatian trips - how he loved the hot sun of this stony country.</li>
<li>Berwald's scientific work was mainly in the area of differential geometry.</li>
<li>Many people working in Finsler geometry consider that Ludwig Berwald is the founder of Finsler geometry.</li>
<li>Berwald and E Cartan developed a general theory of two-dimensional Finsler spaces.</li>
<li>Berwald wrote a series of major papers On Finsler and Cartan geometries.</li>
<li>On 22 October 1941, Berwald's scientific work came to a close.</li>
<li>Hedwig Berwald died on 27 March 1942; the cause of death was given as blocked arteries.</li>
<li>Ludwig Berwald died a few weeks later on 20 April; the cause of death was given as intestinal catarrh and heart failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 8 December 1883, Prague, Bohemia (now Czech Republic). Died 20 April 1942, Łódź, Poland.</p>
