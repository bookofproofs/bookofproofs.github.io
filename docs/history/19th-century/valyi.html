<h1>Person: Vályi, Gyula</h1>

<p><strong>Gyula Vályi</strong> was a Hungarian mathematician and theoretical physicist known for his work on mathematical analysis, geometry and number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gyula's mother was a descendent of the nobleman György Dózsa (1470-1514), who led an army in a crusade against the Turks which later became a peasant revolt against the Hungarian nobility.</li>
<li>Gyula had an older brother Gábor Vályi who went on to become a professor of statistics.</li>
<li>Vályi was born in Marosvásárhely, which was a famous town for any Hungarian mathematician to be born in given the connection with Farkas Bolyai and János Bolyai.</li>
<li>The University of Kolozsvár was a newly established university when Vályi entered it, being founded in 1872.</li>
<li>After qualifying as a teacher of mathematics and physics from the University of Kolozsvár, Vályi was awarded a scholarship to allow him to undertake further study abroad.</li>
<li>Vályi was appointed professor of theoretical physics at Kolozsvár in 1884, and in the following year he also became professor of mathematics lecturing on analysis, geometry and number theory.</li>
<li>Vályi asked which triangles are similar to their nnnth  pedal triangle (that is, they have the same angles).</li>
<li>Vályi also made extensive studies of projective geometry, in particular studying polar reciprocity, and used elliptic functions to study third order curves.</li>
<li>Vályi showed that there are precisely five triangles with this property.</li>
<li>Vályi's eyesight deteriorated rapidly and he had to lecture without notes for he could not read them.</li>
<li>Vályi's lectures did not always follow the same pattern.</li>
<li>There were two courses of Vályi which hardly changed over time.</li>
<li>One of them presented the basic theory of functions; in it Vályi followed his old master Weierstrass and included the theory of elliptic functions.</li>
<li>The other concerned with János Bolyai's "Appendix"; in that course Vályi, especially in the first years stuck to the order and contents of the sections of Bolyai's masterpiece.</li>
<li>Vályi remained in Kolozsvár all his life despite being offered a professorship in Budapest.</li>
<li>After Vályi retired he went to live with his brother Gábor who had also retired by this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 January 1855, Marosvásárhely, Transylvania, Hungary (now Târgu-Mureș, Romania). Died 13 October 1913, Kolozsvár, Hungary (now Cluj, Romania).</p>
