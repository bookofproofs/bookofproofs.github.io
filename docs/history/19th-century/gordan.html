<h1>Person: Gordan, Paul Albert</h1>

<p><strong>Paul Gordan</strong> worked with Clebsch on invariant theory and algebraic geometry. He also gave simplified proofs of the transcendence of $e$ and $\pi$.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paul was educated in Breslau where he attended the Gymnasium, going on to study at the business school.</li>
<li>At this stage Gordan was not heading for an academic career and he worked for several years in banks.</li>
<li>He had, however, attended lectures by Kummer on number theory at the University of Berlin in 1855 and his interest in mathematics was strongly encouraged by N H Schellbach who acted as a private tutor to Gordan.</li>
<li>Moving to Königsberg, Gordan studied under Jacobi, then he moved to Berlin where he began to become interested in problems concerning algebraic equations.</li>
<li>As soon as Gordan had completed his dissertation he went to visit Riemann at Göttingen.</li>
<li>However, Riemann had caught a heavy cold which turned to tuberculosis so Gordan's visit was cut short.</li>
<li>In 1863 Clebsch invited Gordan to come to Giessen.</li>
<li>In 1869, while still at Giessen, Gordan married Sophie Deurer who was the daughter of the professor of law there.</li>
<li>The first work which Gordan and Clebsch worked on in Giessen was the theory of abelian functions.</li>
<li>The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients used in spherical harmonics were introduced by them as a result of this cooperation.</li>
<li>The topic for which Gordan is most famous is invariant theory and Clebsch introduced him to this topic in 1868.</li>
<li>For the rest of his career, although Gordan did not work exclusively on this topic, it would be fair to say that invariant theory dominated his mathematical research.</li>
<li>For the next twenty years Gordan tried to prove the finite basis theorem conjecture for nnn-ary forms.</li>
<li>Gordan did not undertake the bulk of this work at Giessen, however, for he moved to Erlangen in 1874 to become professor of mathematics at the university.</li>
<li>When Gordan was appointed Klein held the chair of mathematics at Erlangen but he moved in the following year to the Technische Hochschule at Munich.</li>
<li>In the year 1874-75 when Gordan and Klein were together at Erlangen they undertook a joint research project examining groups of substitutions of algebraic equations.</li>
<li>Hilbert submitted his results to Mathematische Annalen and, since Gordan was the leading world expert on invariant theory, he was asked his opinion of the work.</li>
<li>Gordan found Hilbert's revolutionary approach difficult to appreciate and not at all consistent with his ideas of constructive mathematics.</li>
<li>Gordan was recognised as the leading world expert on invariant theory and he was also a close friend of Klein's.</li>
<li>Gordan also worked on algebraic geometry and he gave simplified proofs of the transcendence of e and π.</li>
<li>This was rather an unfortunate episode since it resulted in Gordan, who had enjoyed a fine reputation, losing respect from his colleagues.</li>
<li>Gordan's only doctoral student was Emmy Noether, the daughter of Max Noether who was also at Erlangen during this period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 27 April 1837, Breslau, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 21 December 1912, Erlangen, Germany.</p>
