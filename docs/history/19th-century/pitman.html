<p><strong>Edwin  Pitman</strong>  was an Australian mathematician who made contributions to statistics and probability theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Edwin Edward worked for a firm making machinery.</li>
<li>Pitman's early education was at Kensington State School, and from there he progressed to South Melbourne College.</li>
<li>Even so, Edwin was dissatisfied with the course, believing that, although it was advanced it was not rigorous enough.</li>
<li>One was the New Zealander D K Pieken, who taught Pitman a rigorous understanding of the number systems.</li>
<li>Pitman graduated with a B.A. with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1921 and a B.Sc., mainly involving physics, in 1922.</li>
<li>The student, R A Scott, asked him to check that his analysis was correct before it sent it to John Wishart in Cambridge, which Pitman did.</li>
<li>Not only did this mark the start of Pitman's collaboration with Scott and the State Department of Agriculture, but Scott also showed him a copy of R A Fisher's Statistical Methods for Research Workers.</li>
<li>Pitman had no thoughts of publishing research articles at this stage in his career.</li>
<li>This was only the first of several visits Pitman made to the United States.</li>
<li>In fact most of these visits were made after Pitman retired, which was in 1962 when he reached the age of sixty-five.</li>
<li>In 1979, Pitman published a book entitled Some basic theory for statistical inference.</li>
<li>Pitman received many honours for his contributions to mathematics and statistics.</li>
<li>Two years earlier he had been made an honorary life member of the Statistical Society of Australia and the Society now awards the Pitman Gold Medal as its highest honour.</li>
<li>The first such presentation of the Pitman Gold Medal was made to Pitman himself in 1978.</li>
<li>Edwin's most endearing characteristic was modesty about his achievements.</li>
<li>Finally, we note that in addition to mathematics and statistics, Pitman was very fond of gardening, music and drama.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 29 October 1897, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Died 21 July 1993, Kingston, Tasmania, Australia.</p>
