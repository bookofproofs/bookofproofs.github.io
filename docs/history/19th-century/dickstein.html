<p><strong>Samuel Dickstein</strong> was a Polish mathematician whose work was mostly in algebra and the history of mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Poland did not formally exist at the time of Dickstein's birth and much of the pattern of his life was dominated by the aim of Poles to restore their country.</li>
<li>In 1846, three years before Dickstein was born, there was an attempted revolution by Polish nationalists.</li>
<li>During the following years when Dickstein was a young child Poles sought independence but were kept down by armed force.</li>
<li>Some reforms were put in place in the Russian areas of Poland (which included Warsaw where Dickstein lived) but these only seemed to invoke anger among young patriotic Poles.</li>
<li>For a year Dickstein, a youth aged 12, saw the Polish uprising being crushed.</li>
<li>The victorious Russian occupiers then carried out executions, confiscations, and deportations, and one can only imagine how a young man like Dickstein might have felt knowing that Poles could not hope to rule their own country again in the foreseeable future.</li>
<li>There was no Polish university for Dickstein to attend so, in 1866, he entered one of the only higher education establishments in Warsaw, the teacher's college.</li>
<li>From 1870 to 1876 Dickstein attended this Russian university in Warsaw specialising in mathematics.</li>
<li>With the education system controlled by the Russian rulers, Dickstein decided to do what he could to promote a Polish education and he directed his own private school for ten years beginning in 1878.</li>
<li>Dickstein was one of the main instigators of publishing mathematical journals in Poland.</li>
<li>It was not only with his role in publishing that Dickstein made a major contribution to Polish mathematics.</li>
<li>In 1903 Dickstein was a founder of the Warsaw Scientific Society and he was important in the development of the Polish Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>Dickstein was one of two mathematicians in this founding group of fourteen, and was elected as secretary of the group.</li>
<li>A Mathematical Study was set up with Dickstein donating a fine library of mathematical texts.</li>
<li>Dickstein taught in the newly established university, giving the first year lectures on algebra.</li>
<li>Dickstein's work was mostly in algebra and the history of mathematics.</li>
<li>Ulam, at age 23, met Dickstein, who was then in his eighties, at the International Mathematical Congress in Zürich in 1932.</li>
<li>Dickstein's teacher had been a student of Cauchy in the early nineteenth century, and he still considered Poincaré, who died in 1912, a bright young man.</li>
<li>Dickstein died in the Nazi bombing of Warsaw in 1939 and all his family died during the German occupation of Poland.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 12 May 1851, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 29 September 1939, Warsaw, Poland.</p>
