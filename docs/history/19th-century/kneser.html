<p><strong>Adolf Kneser</strong> was a German mathematician who wrote on integral equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adolf's secondary schooling took place in Rostock, and after this was complete he entered the University there.</li>
<li>His remarkable talents are easily illustrated for even at this very early stage in his education, Kneser published his first paper which was on the refraction of sound waves.</li>
<li>We should remark, however, that Kneser's interests were surprisingly broad and during his university studies he attended lectures on history, literature and philosophy.</li>
<li>Kneser submitted his habilitation thesis to the University of Marburg where he taught for a while, then he moved to Breslau (now Wrocław in Poland) where he also lectured.</li>
<li>The couple had four sons; Hellmuth Kneser was born while they lived in Dorpat.</li>
<li>In 1900 Adolf Kneser was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the Bergakademie  (Academy of Mining) in Berlin.</li>
<li>Adolf Kneser's early work was on algebraic functions and equations.</li>
<li>Kneser brought the theory of the so-called second variation to a certain conclusion.</li>
<li>But above all, the decisive advances towards the solution of the so-called Mayer Problem, recently introduced to the calculus of variations, are due to Kneser.</li>
<li>In 1911 Kneser published his famous text, Die Integralgleichungen und ihre Anwendungen in der mathematischen Physik: Vorlesungen an der Universität zu Breslau Ⓣ(The integral equations and their applications in mathematical physics: lectures given at the University of Wroclaw).</li>
<li>Kneser's work, however, was surprisingly broad and he continued to show an interest in philosophy and knowledge theory which he had from his student days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 March 1862, Grüssow, Mecklenburg, Germany. Died 24 January 1930, Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland).</p>
