<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>

<li>After leaving university, Blades attended the Training College, where he was awarded the first prize in the final year.</li>
<li>After the requisite period of teaching in an elementary school, for several years Blades was junior lecturer in mathematics and assistant in science and geography in Moray House Training College, Edinburgh.</li>
<li>Mr Blades had now retired and was looking forward to the enjoyment of well-earned leisure: yet without hesitation he answered the call which came to him.</li>
<li>Mr Blades first dealt with adult education among the civilian population.</li>
<li>Blades, who at that time was retiring from the honorary secretaryship of the committee, gave an address "Reflections on Adult Education".</li>
<li>Edward Blades joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in March 1905 when he was teaching at George Watson's Ladies' College, Edinburgh.</li>
<li>Blades attended meetings of the Society and sometimes communicated papers written by others to the Society.</li>
