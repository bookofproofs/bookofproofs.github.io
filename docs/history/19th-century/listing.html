<p><strong>Johann Listing</strong> wrote one of the earliest texts on Topology.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 1825 Listing entered a Gymnasium where he studied for five years.</li>
<li>Being an art foundation they could not support Listing to undertake a degree in mathematics, which would have been his preferred option, but instead awarded him the scholarship for the study of mathematics and architecture.</li>
<li>Although there was a time when architecture was considered as a branch of mathematics, it certainly was not considered such in Listing's day so the combination was a rather peculiar one dictated by a compromise between Listing's wishes and the remit of the Städel foundation.</li>
<li>Listing entered Göttingen University in 1830 and attended a remarkably broad range of courses, much broader than the mathematics and architecture specified by his scholarship.</li>
<li>Soon Listing was attending mathematics courses given by Gauss and he was quickly spotted by Gauss as being both a very able and a very hard working student.</li>
<li>Listing was not the only student invited into close friendship with Gauss.</li>
<li>Another student was Sartorius von Walterhausen who was one year younger than Listing.</li>
<li>Walterhausen, who was interested in geology, became a lifelong friend of Listing.</li>
<li>The influence of Gauss on Listing was, however, very marked.</li>
<li>It was from Gauss that Listing began to learn topological concepts.</li>
<li>Gauss became the supervisor of Listing's dissertation De superficiebus secundi ordinis Ⓣ(Surfaces of the second order) which was on surfaces of the second degree and ternary forms.</li>
<li>Listing was an obvious choice for an assistant to accompany him and the pair set off less than a month after Listing had obtained his doctorate.</li>
<li>It was a journey on which Listing maintained his interests in many different topics and as well as the geology and physics which were the purpose of the trip.</li>
<li>While on his travels Listing was approached by the Höhere Gewerbeschule Hannover asking if he would be interested in a post as a teacher of applied mathematics.</li>
<li>Because of a cholera epidemic Sartorius and Listing delayed their return to Göttingen.</li>
<li>Listing went to Hannover to be interviewed for the post in the Gewerbeschule and was appointed, starting his teaching career in November 1837.</li>
<li>He produced a list of three names with Listing in third place.</li>
<li>When the first two turned down the offer, Listing was appointed in 1839 despite never having published a paper.</li>
<li>As professor of physics Listing could choose his area for research.</li>
<li>As well as containing data from careful experimental work, the book was beautifully illustrated by Listing using all his skills in drawing and calligraphy.</li>
<li>Listing continued to think about topological ideas, however, and he wrote the book Vorstudien zur Topologie in 1847.</li>
<li>It was the first published use of the word topology although, as we mentioned above, it was first used in Listing's letter of 1836.</li>
<li>Of course Listing had been appointed to fill Weber's chair so a compromise had to be reached.</li>
<li>This was that Listing was promoted to ordinary professor of mathematical physics while Weber became professor of experimental physics.</li>
<li>Although little changed in the research that Listing undertook, since he had always gone in the direction which interested him, he did have to give up a large part of his laboratory to Weber.</li>
<li>The near bankruptcy came around the time that Listing was publishing another remarkable contribution to topology.</li>
<li>It was Sartorius who had arranged for the rescue act by the ministry and here he was repaying a debt to Listing who had saved his life by nursing him through a serious illness during their journey of nearly thirty years earlier.</li>
<li>The range of contributions made by Listing is quite remarkable.</li>
<li>Among the honours which Listing did receive were election to the Göttingen Academy and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 July 1808, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Died 24 December 1882, Göttingen, Germany.</p>
