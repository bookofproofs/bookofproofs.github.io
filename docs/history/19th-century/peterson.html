<p><strong>Karl Peterson</strong> was a Latvian mathematician worked in differential geometry and partial differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Karl was born into a country which had been dominated by Russia since the end of the 18th  century although Riga had been taken by the Russians long before.</li>
<li>This caused unrest in the Latvian lands throughout much of Peterson's life.</li>
<li>Karl attended the Gymnasium in Riga and he graduated in 1847 with excellent qualifications which meant that he as able to study at the University of Dorpat (now Tartu).</li>
<li>Although a university had existed in Tartu since 1632, Peterson entered the Kaiserliche Universität zu Dorpat in Tartu (Dorpat) which had been established in 1802.</li>
<li>At this University, Peterson studied under Ferdinand Minding.</li>
<li>He was to have a strong influence on Peterson and give him the urge to undertake mathematical research.</li>
<li>Peterson would follow in the footsteps of his professor in undertaking deep research while a school teacher, but unlike his professor he never became a university teacher.</li>
<li>Peterson wrote an unpublished "candidate's" thesis, Über die Biegung der Flächen Ⓣ(On the bending of surfaces) (Dorpat, 1853) on differential geometry.</li>
<li>The dissertation contains a derivation of two equations equivalent to those of Mainardi and Codazzi, and in it Peterson outlined a proof of the fundamental theorem of surface theory.</li>
<li>After obtaining his candidate's degree, Peterson worked in Moscow as a teacher of mathematics.</li>
<li>Largely because he was not at a university his results were not well known but they did influence Egorov in Moscow, but Peterson gained an international reputation only when Darboux and Bianchi used his results.</li>
<li>Surfaces with such nets were first studied by Peterson in 1866.</li>
<li>Peterson's paper 'On curves on surfaces'  (1867) and the book 'Über Curven und Flächen' Ⓣ(On curves and surfaces) (1868) were devoted to differential geometry.</li>
<li>Some of the results of these papers of Peterson were later duplicated by G Darboux and other foreign geometers, but after E Cosserat's translations of Peterson's main works from 1866-1867 were published in Toulouse in 1905, his work achieved general recognition.</li>
<li>In addition to his mathematical research while he taught in Moscow schools, Peterson also worked with Brashman and Davidov in founding the Moscow Mathematical Society.</li>
<li>The first such Society had been founded in 1810 but had ceased to function and a totally new Society, which Peterson helped found and organise, started to operate in 1864.</li>
<li>Mathematicheskii Sbornik, the journal of the Society, first appeared in October 1866 and from that time on Peterson published almost all his research papers in that journal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 May 1828, Riga, Russia (now Latvia). Died 19 April 1881, Moscow, Russia.</p>
