<li>Professor Gray occupied the Chair of Applied Physics, and was widely known for his experiments and original scientific work.</li>
<li>Since the war Britain has benefited further from Professor Gray's experiments, and when the Cargill Chair of Applied Physics was instituted in Glasgow in 1920 his appointment to the Professorship met with the warm commendation of scientists all over the world.</li>
<li>Professor Gray took a prominent part in building up the organisation by means of which his department at the University was brought to its present high state of efficiency.</li>
<li>Professor Gray took a keen interest in the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow, and rendered valuable service to its mathematical and physical section.</li>
<li>A native of Glasgow, Professor Gray, received his early education at Friars Grammar School, Bangor, and subsequently entered the University College of North Wales.</li>
