<p><strong>Georges Valiron</strong> was a French mathematician, best known for his contributions to analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It was during these years that he taught André Bloch and his younger brother Georges.</li>
<li>Valiron was awarded a bursary to enable him to study for his doctorate at the Faculty of Science in Paris and he spent the years 1912-14 undertaking research advised by Émile Borel.</li>
<li>Valiron was mobilized and served in the artillery during the war.</li>
<li>Valiron was one of a number of eminent Frenchmen sent to Strasbourg to achieve this aim.</li>
<li>In February and March 1922 Valiron delivered a series of lectures to honours students at the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth.</li>
<li>Valiron delivered the lectures in French and they were translated into English by Edward Collingwood who, after undergraduate studies at Cambridge, had gone to Aberystwyth at the invitation of W H Young.</li>
<li>Following the publication of this classic text, Valiron published a number of small books containing between 50 and 60 pages.</li>
<li>Valiron published his Cours d'Analyse mathématique Ⓣ(Course of mathematical analysis) in two volumes.</li>
<li>Such a contrast, if accurate, does not disparage either side ; and if we say that Valiron's book has more of the air of Goursat and de la Vallée Poussin, the implied mild regret is surely more than outweighed by the magnitude of the compliment.</li>
<li>Most biographies of Valiron state that his most famous doctoral student was Laurent Schwartz who was awarded his doctorate by the University of Strasbourg in 1943.</li>
<li>This is slightly puzzling since Valiron spent the war years in Paris and had not taught at Strasbourg in the preceding ten years.</li>
<li>Another point which requires clarification is the comment by one biographer that Valiron was not Laurent Schwartz's doctoral advisor, but rather an examiner of his thesis.</li>
<li>Laurent Schwartz studied in Paris at the École Normale Supérieure in the 1930s and at this time took a course by Valiron on Functions of a complex variable.</li>
<li>It is certainly true that Valiron was an examiner of the thesis, as Laurent Schwartz states in his autobiography.</li>
<li>had (like me) Valiron as his thesis advisor.</li>
<li>There is, therefore, no doubt that Laurent Schwartz considered Valiron to have been his thesis advisor although he almost certainly did not have this as a formal role.</li>
<li>We note also that Valiron examined the doctoral thesis of Laurent Schwartz's wife, Marie-Hélène, the daughter of Paul Lévy.</li>
<li>Valiron received many honours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 September 1884, Lyon, France. Died 17 March 1955, Paris, France.</p>
