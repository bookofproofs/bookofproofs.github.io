<p><strong>Michele Cipolla</strong>  was an Italian mathematician who worked in number theory.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After two years in Pisa, Cipolla returned to Palermo where he studied for his doctorate at the university under Gabriele Torelli's supervision.</li>
<li>Cipolla was awarded his doctorate from Palermo in 1902 for his thesis on asymptotic determinations of primes.</li>
<li>When he had been in Pisa, Cipolla had been introduced to group theory in Bianchi's lectures.</li>
<li>Although an extremely productive mathematician, in 1904 Cipolla became a secondary school teacher in Corleone, a small town about 35 km south of Palermo.</li>
<li>In 1911 Cipolla was appointed as Professor of Algebraic Analysis at the University of Catania, in the town of Catania on the east coast of Sicily.</li>
<li>From 1916, Cipolla was joined in Catania by Gaetano Scorza who also worked on group theory and had generalised some of Cipolla's work on finite groups to infinite groups.</li>
<li>In it, Cipolla gathered the lectures on group theory and Galois theory he had given at the University of Catania in the academic years 1920-1921 and 1921-1922, and it can be considered the most complete treatise written in the Italian language on classical Galois theory.</li>
<li>It was intended to be read by university students and was edited by Cipolla.</li>
<li>In 1923, the year in which the third volume of his group theory treatise was published, Cipolla returned to Palermo where he was appointed as professor.</li>
<li>It was first published in 1927 with a second edition in 1929, and finally a third edition appeared in 1949 after Cipolla's death.</li>
<li>With his student Gaspare Mignosi (1875-1951), who worked with him in Catania and determined the fundamental subgroups of the linear projective group of dimension two over a finite field, Cipolla wrote secondary school level textbooks such as Analisi matematiche elementare Ⓣ(Elementary mathematical analysis) (1924), Lezioni di Algebra per il liceo classico, per il biennio del liceo scientifico e dell'istituto tecnico nautico Ⓣ(Algebra lessons for high school, for the two years of scientific and technical naval high schools) and Geometria elementare per Ginnasi Superiori e i Licei : vol.</li>
<li>Cipolla received many honours for his outstanding contributions to mathematics and mathematical education, such as being elected Vice President of the Circolo Matematico di Palermo.</li>
<li>He has also been honoured with the 'Liceo Scientifico Statale Michele Cipolla' in Castelvetrano, Sicily being dedicated to him.</li>
<li>Also in Castelvetrano the 'Via Michele Cipolla' is named for him, while in Palermo there is a 'Via Michele Cipolla' on which the Universita' Degli Studi Di Palermo is situated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 28 October 1880, Palermo, Italy. Died 7 September 1947, Palermo, Italy.</p>
