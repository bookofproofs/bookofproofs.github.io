<h1>Person: Darwin, George Howard</h1>

<p><strong>George Darwin</strong> was an English mathematician who was a son of Charles Darwin and studied the three-body-problem.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>George's mother Emma Wedgwood was from another famous family, being a granddaughter of Josiah Wedgwood who is famed for his world famous pottery.</li>
<li>Darwin excelled at Pritchard's school and he won a scholarship to study at Trinity College, Cambridge.</li>
<li>Many top graduates from Cambridge from this period entered the legal profession and that indeed is what Darwin did, being called to the Bar in 1874.</li>
<li>However it was not uncommon for some to return to mathematical or other scientific study and Darwin followed this route returning to Trinity where he still held his fellowship.</li>
<li>In 1884 Darwin married Maud du Puy; they had four children, two boys and two girls.</li>
<li>Darwin studied tidal effects on the planets.</li>
<li>Darwin made a major study of the three-body problem in the case of the orbits of the Sun-Earth-Moon system.</li>
<li>Despite the fact that we do not accept Darwin's conclusions today, he is important in being the first to apply mathematical techniques to study the evolution of the Sun-Earth-Moon system.</li>
<li>Darwin was President of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1899-1900 and won the Gold Medal from that Society 1892.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 9 July 1845, Downe, Kent, England. Died 7 December 1912, Cambridge, England.</p>
