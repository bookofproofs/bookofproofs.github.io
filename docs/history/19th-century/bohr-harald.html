<p><strong>Harald Bohr</strong> worked on Dirichlet series, and applied analysis to the theory of numbers. He is (as far as we know) the only mathematician to win an Olympic medal (a silver for representing Denmark at soccer in 1908).</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Their father, Christian Bohr, was professor of physiology at the University of Copenhagen.</li>
<li>Christian Bohr was famous for his work on the physical and chemical aspects of respiration.</li>
<li>Harald and Niels Bohr's mother, Ellen Adler Bohr, came from a wealthy Jewish family with family members who were important in banking and in politics in Denmark.</li>
<li>Harald studied mathematics at the University of Copenhagen.</li>
<li>It is perhaps surprising that Harald and Niels did not collaborate more frequently.</li>
<li>Harald Bohr worked on Dirichlet series, and applied analysis to the theory of numbers.</li>
<li>In 1914 they proved the Bohr-Landau theorem on the distribution of zeros of the zeta function.</li>
<li>Some of this important work on the zeta function was due to Bohr alone, some came from the collaboration with Landau.</li>
<li>Bohr's interest in which functions could be represented by a Dirichlet series led him to devise the theory of almost periodic functions.</li>
<li>Bohr published three major works on this topic in Acta Mathematica between 1924 and 1926.</li>
<li>This result lead Bohr to a result on the uniform approximation to almost periodic functions by exponential functions.</li>
<li>However, the theory of almost periodic functions of a complex variable remains up to now in the same perfect form in which it was given by Bohr.</li>
<li>After setting up the theory of almost periodic functions, Bohr's mathematical work became devoted exclusively to furthering the subject.</li>
<li>Bohr the man was not less remarkable than Bohr the mathematician.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 22 April 1887, Copenhagen, Denmark. Died 22 January 1951, Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
