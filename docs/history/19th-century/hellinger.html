<p><strong>Hellinger</strong> introduced a new type of integral: the <em>Hellinger integral </em>. Jointly with Hilbert he produced an important theory of forms.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ernst grew up in Breslau where he attended school, graduating from the Gymnasium there in 1902.</li>
<li>It was at the Breslau Gymnasium that Hellinger first became fascinated in mathematics, and this was the result of an excellent mathematics teacher at the school.</li>
<li>Hellinger entered the University of Heidelberg but, following the tradition in Germany at that time, he did not complete his studies at a single university but moved to several different universities during the course of his studies.</li>
<li>Hellinger would keep in touch with Born and developments in quantum mechanics for much of his life.</li>
<li>In Göttingen Hellinger was a student of Hilbert and, not long after he began his studies there, he was joined by Courant and Toeplitz who had been his fellow students at Breslau.</li>
<li>Hellinger was awarded his doctorate by the University of Göttingen in 1907 for a thesis entitled Die Orthogonalinvarianten quadratischer Formen von unendlich vielen Variablen Ⓣ(The Orthogonallly invariant quadratic forms in an infinite number of variables).</li>
<li>He introduced a new type of integral, the Hellinger integral in his doctoral thesis and, jointly with Hilbert, he produced the important Hilbert-Hellinger theory of forms.</li>
<li>From Göttingen Hellinger went to Marburg where he was a Privatdozent from 1909 to 1914.</li>
<li>Hellinger certainly qualified under this clause and this allowed him to keep his lecturing post in Frankfurt in 1933.</li>
<li>Hellinger continued to live in Frankfurt.</li>
<li>Fortunately friends were able to arrange a temporary job for Hellinger at Northwestern University at Evanston in the United States.</li>
<li>Hellinger's position at Evanston throughout the war was precarious with a series of one-year appointments but he acquired American citizenship in 1944 and worked at Evanston until 1949 when he retired.</li>
<li>At Frankfurt, Hellinger had continued his mathematical work on the spectral theory of Jacobi forms and continued fractions.</li>
<li>Hellinger also worked on the history of mathematics and, while at Frankfurt, he wrote an important paper on James Gregory.</li>
</ul>
