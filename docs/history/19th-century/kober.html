<p><strong>Hermann Kober</strong> was a Polish-born mathematician who spent much of his life as a school teacher in England but published many papers on analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hermann was born into a successful Jewish family, his father having made a fine reputation for himself.</li>
<li>The family was a large one, with Hermann having four older brothers.</li>
<li>Breslau was the sixth largest city of Germany and, in that thriving industrial city, Kober attended school.</li>
<li>Kober chose to study at Göttingen, famed as a centre for mathematics, where he was one of Landau's first students.</li>
<li>Kober was forced out of his teaching post in 1934 but he continued with his teaching career, now at a Jewish school in Breslau.</li>
<li>Suddenly Kober's research career went into overdrive.</li>
<li>She was herself a mathematician and played a large role in Kober's mathematical research taking off.</li>
<li>Kober's wife provided him with the sort of back-up which allowed him to make lengthy visits to Cambridge in England, for she simply took over teaching his classes in Breslau while he spent time at Cambridge doing research.</li>
<li>Birmingham awarded Kober an M.Sc. in 1940 and a D.Sc. in 1943.</li>
<li>By 1943 Kober had published 30 mathematical papers and he continued to undertake mathematical research for the rest of his life.</li>
<li>Kober was a highly productive mathematician working on special functions, functional analysis (in this area Kober's Theorem which appeared A theorem on Banach spaces (1939) is named after him), approximation theory and the theory of functions of a real variable.</li>
<li>In the 1970s, although by that time in his 80s, Kober published: New properties of the Weyl extended integral (1970); Some new properties of the Poisson operator (1971); and The infinite strip in the complex plane and Poisson's operator (1972).</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 February 1888, Beuthen (now Bytom), Upper Silesia (now Poland). Died 4 October 1973, Birmingham, England.</p>
