<p><strong>Gösta Mittag-Leffler</strong> was a Swedish mathematician who worked on the general theory of functions. His best known work concerned the analytic representation of a one-valued function.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It was not until Gösta Leffler was a twenty year old student that he decided to add "Mittag" to his name.</li>
<li>It was clear from his later life that Mittag-Leffler had many talents in addition to his mathematics and it was his upbringing that did much to foster these talents.</li>
<li>Mittag-Leffler trained as an actuary but later took up mathematics.</li>
<li>As a result Mittag-Leffler was appointed as a Docent at the University of Uppsala in 1872.</li>
<li>In October 1873 Mittag-Leffler set off for Paris.</li>
<li>Although Mittag-Leffler met many mathematicians in Paris, such as Bouquet, Briot, Chasles, Darboux, and Liouville, the main aim of the visit was to learn from Hermite.</li>
<li>Mittag-Leffler attended Hermite's lectures on elliptic functions but found them hard going.</li>
<li>Certainly Hermite spoke in glowing terms about Weierstrass and the contributions he and other German mathematicians were making, so Mittag-Leffler made a decision to go to Berlin in the spring of 1875.</li>
<li>There he attended Weierstrass's lectures which proved to be extremely influential in setting the direction of Mittag-Leffler's subsequent mathematical work.</li>
<li>We have quoted extensively from Mittag-Leffler's writing about this overseas trip and his reaction to national rivalries.</li>
<li>We have done so because it is important in determining the international role which Mittag-Leffler went on to play, for his passion for international cooperation in mathematics was a direct consequence of what he saw on his three year trip abroad.</li>
<li>Mittag-Leffler was appointed to a chair at the University of Helsinki in 1876 and, five years later, he returned to his home town of Stockholm to take up a chair at the University.</li>
<li>Mittag-Leffler made numerous contributions to mathematical analysis particularly in areas concerned with limits and including calculus, analytic geometry and probability theory.</li>
<li>His best known work concerned the analytic representation of a one-valued function, this work culminated in the Mittag-Leffler theorem.</li>
<li>Mittag-Leffler tried to generalise this result to meromorphic function while he was studying in Berlin.</li>
<li>Mittag-Leffler became the sole proprietor of a theorem that later became widely known and with this he took his place in the circle of internationally known mathematicians.</li>
<li>Mittag-Leffler was one of the first mathematicians to support Cantor's theory of sets but, one has to remark, a consequence of this was that Kronecker refused to publish in Acta Mathematica .</li>
<li>Between 1900 and 1905 Mittag-Leffler published a series of five papers which he called "Notes" on the summation of divergent series.</li>
<li>The region in which he was able to do this is now called Mittag-Leffler's star.</li>
<li>In 1882 Mittag-Leffler founded Acta Mathematica and served as chief editor of the journal for 45 years.</li>
<li>It required an international base and certainly Mittag-Leffler fully understood this.</li>
<li>Mittag-Leffler was always a good judge of the quality of the work submitted to him for publication.</li>
<li>In 1884, the year Mittag-Leffler published his masterpiece, Kovalevskaya arrived in Stockholm at his invitation.</li>
<li>there Mittag-Leffler appeared at his best, a most entertaining mixture of the great international mathematician and the rather naive country squire.</li>
<li>However, eventually the Mittag-Leffler Institute was set up based on the house and today is a major mathematical research centre.</li>
<li>Mittag-Leffler received many honours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 16 March 1846, Stockholm, Sweden. Died 7 July 1927, Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
