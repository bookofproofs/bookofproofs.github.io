<h1>Person: Dodgson, Charles Lutwidge</h1>

<p><strong>Charles Dodgson</strong> was a mathematics lecturer and author of mathematics books who is better known by the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. He is known especially for <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em>.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dodgson wrote mathematical works under his own name but for his children's books he invented the pen name "Lewis Carroll" by translating his first two names "Charles Lutwidge" into Latin as "Carolus Lodovicus", then anglicising and reversing their order.</li>
<li>Charles Lutwidge Dodgson's father was the Reverend Charles Dodgson.</li>
<li>Charles Dodgson senior was born in 1800 and studied at the University of Oxford where he gained a First Class degree in both mathematics and classics.</li>
<li>He was appointed as a mathematics lecturer at Oxford where he held a Fellowship but, on marrying his cousin Frances Jane Lutwidge in 1827, he had to give up his Oxford Fellowship.</li>
<li>He then became a curate at All Saints' Church in Daresbury and it was in that town that ten of Charles and Frances' eleven children were born.</li>
<li>Charles Lutwidge was the eldest of his parents three boys, having two elder sisters Fanny, born in 1828, and Elizabeth, born in 1830.</li>
<li>Charles was baptised on 11 July 1832 in his father's church and grew up in a strict Christian household.</li>
<li>Charles looked up to his father and wished to be like him.</li>
<li>Since mathematics was his father's favourite subject, it is easy to see how Charles gained an early love for it.</li>
<li>Not only did Charles model himself on his father, but his father also wanted his son to follow in his footsteps by studying mathematics at Oxford, then obtaining a Fellowship, marrying and becoming a vicar.</li>
<li>At Daresbury the Dodgson family had to struggle financially, so it was a relief when Charles's father moved to become vicar at Croft-on-Tees in Yorkshire in 1843 where his income was substantially increased.</li>
<li>On 1 August 1844 Charles enter Richmond School as a boarder, living in the headmaster's house.</li>
<li>On 27 January 1846, Charles' fourteenth birthday, he enrolled at Rugby School.</li>
<li>This was a famous school but one where Charles found things extremely difficult.</li>
<li>Despite being deeply unhappy, Dodgson achieved high standards in his school work, receiving a steady stream of prizes.</li>
<li>As his father wished, Dodgson matriculated at Christ Church College Oxford, which had been his father's College.</li>
<li>On 24 January 1851 Dodgson returned to Oxford to live with the Rev.</li>
<li>Dodgson's father was absolutely delighted with his son's success and, moreover, he himself had been made Canon of Ripon Cathedral in 1852, going on to become Archdeacon of Richmond two years later.</li>
<li>This was the year when Dodgson completed his studies receiving a Third Class Degree in Classics but topping the list of those receiving First Class honours in mathematics by a good margin.</li>
<li>At this point, however, the usually conscientious Dodgson became too taken up with leisure and cultural activities and failed to put in the necessary work at mathematics.</li>
<li>During the summer of 1855 Dodgson taught at his father's school in Croft and by the time he returned to Oxford in October it was as a Mathematics Lecturer, the position that he had sought.</li>
<li>Dodgson remained at Christ Church, Oxford, lecturing on mathematics and writing treatises and guides for students until 1881.</li>
<li>Although he took deacon's orders in 1861, Dodgson was never ordained a priest, partly because he was afflicted with a stammer that made preaching difficult and partly, perhaps, because he had discovered other interests such as the theatre.</li>
<li>Among Dodgson's hobbies was photography, at which he became highly proficient.</li>
<li>Not only did Dodgson enjoy photographing children, but he also enjoyed their company.</li>
<li>It was in 1862 that Dodgson wrote down the stories at Alice's request.</li>
<li>Henry Kingsley, the author, visited the Liddells and happened to pick up Dodgson's stories.</li>
<li>He made it very clear that Dodgson had to be persuaded to publish his writings.</li>
<li>Three years later, after polishing them and adding some more material, Dodgson published his first "Alice book" as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.</li>
<li>As a mathematician, Dodgson was rather conservative but certainly thorough and careful.</li>
<li>Dodgson wrote it to defend using Euclid's Elements as a means of teaching geometry.</li>
<li>In the latter work Dodgson presented a way of visually representing propositions in a diagram which is similar to Venn diagrams, developed by John Venn in 1881, but Dodgson's pictures have certain advantages.</li>
<li>However, Venn diagrams are today much used and Dodgson's gameboard method is forgotten.</li>
<li>As early as 1894 Dodgson used truth tables for the solution of specific logic problems.</li>
<li>By 1896 Dodgson had developed the method of trees for determining some validity, which bears a resemblance to the trees frequently employed by contemporary logicians.</li>
<li>Other recent work has again put Dodgson's mathematical contributions in a much more favourable light than it was previously seen.</li>
<li>It is argued that Dodgson's work on cycles anticipates a stochastic model proposed by Thompson and Remage in 1964 and includes ideas that are basic to maximum likelihood estimation.</li>
<li>Dodgson, writing as Lewis Carroll, contributed wonderful examples of nonsense verse the best known of which is 'Jabberwocky' from Through the Looking-Glass.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 27 January 1832, Daresbury, England. Died 14 January 1898, Guilford, England.</p>
