<h1>Person: Krylov, Aleksei</h1>
<p><img alt="Krylov_Aleksei.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Krylov_Aleksei.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Aleksei Krylov</strong> was a Russian applied mathematician who worked in many areas including shipbuilding, magnetism, artillery, mathematics, astronomy, and geodesy.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Around the time that Aleksei was born, his father was Deputy Marshal of the Nobility and became the first president of the Alatyr District Council.</li>
<li>The family were certainly not wealthy, but as the son of an army veteran, Aleksei was entitled to a free education.</li>
<li>Krylov's work in the unit was supervised by Ivan Petrovich de Collong who was an outstanding scientist and the founder of the theory of magnetic deviation of the compass.</li>
<li>In 1888 Krylov joined the department of ship construction of St Petersburg Maritime Academy.</li>
<li>Krylov benefited greatly from Korkin's tuition and he graduated First Class in 1890 after only two years of study.</li>
<li>Korkin then persuaded Krylov to stay at the Maritime Academy and take over teaching his courses.</li>
<li>In 1898 Krylov received a Gold Medal from the Royal Institution of Naval Architects for his outstanding contributions to the theory of oscillating motion of a ship.</li>
<li>The Superintendent of the Tank was A A Grekhnev but after he left, Captain of the Admiralty A N Krylov was appointed 'the Acting Superintendent of the Tank' on 3 January 1900.</li>
<li>Krylov proposed establishing a scientific institution that would include the Towing Tank, testing and physical-chemical laboratories for research on ship construction materials, a mechanical laboratory and an electrical engineering laboratory.</li>
<li>expressing his Imperial gratitude to Krylov as the Superintendent of the Tank.</li>
<li>But Krylov went even further, joining a voyage on board the 1-rank cruiser Askold  in 1902.</li>
<li>Once, giving a speech at an important meeting before a large audience, Krylov addressed naval officers asking them for their support in his "fight against the rut in shipbuilding".</li>
<li>Another incident also quite remarkably illustrates Krylov's personality: on a sitting of a high-rank technical committee Krylov once took with him several technicians directly from the ships so that they could support his opinion in the debates.</li>
<li>Krylov gave up his posts at the Maritime Ministry in 1910.</li>
<li>After the October Revolution of 1917 Krylov sided with the Soviet Government but tried to influence their attitude towards science.</li>
<li>In February 1919 they set up a committee of four, Ioffe, Krylov, Anri and Lazarev, to coordinate the receipt of foreign literature, instruments and equipment, and to restart foreign research travel.</li>
<li>Indeed Krylov was one of the first scientists allowed to travel to the West after the Revolution, travelling to London in 1921 to re-establish contacts between Russia and the West.</li>
<li>Krylov made many mathematical advances in his applications of mathematics to shipbuilding.</li>
<li>In fact Krylov published the first Russian translation from Latin of Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1915.</li>
<li>Three editions were published during Krylov's lifetime, then in 1989 a facsimile reproduction of the third edition was published.</li>
<li>On 5 October 1933 Krylov gave a speech in Moscow during the celebration at the USSR Academy of Sciences of the 150th  anniversary of the death of Euler.</li>
<li>Finally let us mention some of the classic texts which Krylov published.</li>
<li>The first edition of Lectures on Approximate Calculations appeared in 1911, the second edition in 1932, the third in 1935, and the fourth in Krylov's collected works.</li>
<li>The first edition of On Some Differential Equations of Mathematical Physics Having Application to Technical Problems appeared in 1913, the second edition in 1932, and the fourth appeared in 1948 as part of Krylov's collected works.</li>
<li>Krylov married Elisaveta Dmitrievna Dranitsyna; their daughter Anna, later became Anna Kapitsa after marrying the famous physicist Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1978 for his research in magnetism and low-temperature physics.</li>
<li>Krylov died in Leningrad (now St Petersburg) and is buried in the Volkovo cemetery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 August 1863, Visyaga, Simbirskoy (now Ulyanovskaya), Russia. Died 26 October 1945, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).</p>
