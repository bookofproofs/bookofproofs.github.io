<p><strong>Alfred Loewy</strong> was a German mathematician who worked on linear groups, the algebraic theory of differential equations and actuarial mathematics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alfred was born two years after the unification of Germany, and with that came full emancipation of Jews.</li>
<li>Discrimination against Jewish families, especially those with an orthodox lifestyle, became widespread and Loewy would encountered increasing discrimination throughout his life.</li>
<li>Loewy studied at the universities of Breslau, Munich, Berlin and Göttingen between 1891 and 1895.</li>
<li>Then, from 1897, Loewy taught at the University of Freiburg having submitted his habilitation thesis.</li>
<li>Loewy became an honorary ordinary professor at Freiburg in 1916 before his appointment as ordinary professor in 1919.</li>
<li>Other algebraists who spent some time in Freiburg working under Loewy are E Witt, Bernhard Neumann, R Brauer, R Baer, and A Scholz.</li>
<li>Increasing discrimination was not the only source of difficulty in Loewy's life.</li>
<li>Despite these severe health problems Loewy continued to carry out his teaching duties.</li>
<li>Loewy was forced to retire in 1933 under the Civil Service Law.</li>
<li>Loewy worked on linear groups, the algebraic theory of differential equations and actuarial mathematics.</li>
<li>Among Loewy's most famous books are Lehrbuch der Algebra Ⓣ(Textbook of algebra) (1915) and Mathematik des Geld- und Zahlungsverkehrs Ⓣ(Mathematics of money and payments) (1920).</li>
<li>Let us now mention the connection between Loewy and Fraenkel.</li>
<li>It was Loewy who persuaded Fraenkel to travel to Marburg to study under Hensel and it was Loewy who had helped Fraenkel publish his early work in Crelle's journal with a paper about the date of Easter.</li>
<li>But the mathematical topics Fraenkel studied were also influenced by Loewy whose interest in the study of axiomatic systems encouraged a similar interest by Fraenkel.</li>
<li>The relationship worked both ways round, however, and Loewy's Grundlagen der Arithmetik Ⓣ(Foundations of arithmetic), published in 1915, was prepared with Fraenkel's assistance.</li>
<li>Loewy mentioned in this work that in the system of integers, the product of any two integers is zero, if and only if one of them is zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 20 June 1873, Rawitsch, Germany (now Rawicz, Poland). Died 25 January 1935, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.</p>
