<p><strong>Otto Haupt</strong> was a German mathematician who specialised in geometry and real analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Otto attended a Realschule in Würzburg for two years before entering the Royal New Gymnasium.</li>
<li>This school, founded in 1886, was a humanistic school but it did not suit Haupt.</li>
<li>The main teaching method in the school involved learning by rote and Haupt was highly critical of this method.</li>
<li>Haupt looked through the 400-page book and saw a wealth of propositions and exercises that excited him.</li>
<li>After four semesters at Würzburg, Haupt took the first set of the Bavarian state examinations required to become a secondary school teacher.</li>
<li>After successfully completing these examinations, Haupt spent the winter semester of 1908-09 at the University of Berlin before returning to Würzburg.</li>
<li>In October 1910 Haupt took the extremely difficult and extensive second set of Bavarian state examinations in mathematics and physics.</li>
<li>Haupt chose to serve in the 2nd   Train Battalion, a military unit that organised the transport of army materials.</li>
<li>Haupt decided that the Train Battalion would give him plenty of free time which he wanted to use for mathematics research.</li>
<li>Following his military service, Haupt said that he was "physically and mentally exhausted" but, following Hilb's advice, he applied for a Lamont-Stipend from the Bavarian Academy of Sciences.</li>
<li>Haupt received an invitation from Adolf Krazer, a former student of Friedrich Prym, to become his assistant at the Technical University of Karlsruhe.</li>
<li>Once Breslau heard that Haupt had the invitation from Karlsruhe, they tried to stop him leaving but Haupt decided that he would prefer to take up Krazer's offer at Karlsruhe.</li>
<li>Every month the department held a "Mathematical Party" which Haupt really enjoyed.</li>
<li>Haupt was involved from the day Germany mobilised.</li>
<li>Haupt did not remain long at Karlsruhe for in 1920 he was appointed to a chair of mathematics at Rostock.</li>
<li>This did not turn out well for Haupt who found the necessary tasks so arduous that he had hardly any time left to undertake research.</li>
<li>After Max Noether retired, Heinrich Tietze had been appointed to his chair in 1919 so was already in post when Haupt took up his professorship.</li>
<li>Max Noether had continued to live in Erlangen but died a few months after Haupt arrived there.</li>
<li>Haupt often went for long walks with Emmy Noether and during these walks he learnt new groundbreaking ideas concerning algebra.</li>
<li>This led to Haupt publishing a two-volume Einführung in die Algebra Ⓣ(Introduction to Algebra) in 1929.</li>
<li>Haupt certainly played an important role in administration at the University of Erlangen.</li>
<li>This was a jointly authored work but it would appear that it was mainly due to Haupt since it was described as "written by 0tto Haupt, assisted by Georg Aumann." A second edition, now entitled Differential- und Integralrechnung unter besonderer Berücksichtigung neueren Ergebnisse Ⓣ(Differential and integral calculus with special consideration of recent results), listed three authors, Haupt, Aumann and Christian Pauc.</li>
<li>It was a revision by Haupt and Pauc of the original text and the three volumes were published in 1948, 1950 and 1955.</li>
<li>A third edition, considerably rewritten, was entitled Einführung in die reelle Analysis Ⓣ(Introduction to Real Analysis) and had the two original authors, Haupt and Aumann.</li>
<li>Furthermore, Haupt's "jog" was not on level ground but preferably on rough terrain on the slope of the Rathsberg and then it usually took place on the direct route.</li>
<li>Haupt's wife, Edith, died in 1981.</li>
<li>Haupt's friends could only admire the stamina and vigour that enabled him to open for himself still another period of his life.</li>
<li>By the time he had reached the age of 100 years, Haupt was living in a retirement home in Bad Soder/Taunus, near Frankfurt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 March 1887, Würzburg, Germany. Died 10 November 1988, Bad Soden, Germany.</p>
