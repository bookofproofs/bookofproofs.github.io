<h1>Person: Clausius, Rudolf Julius Emmanuel</h1>

<p><strong>Rudolf Clausius</strong> did important work in thermodynamics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rudolf was brought up in a large family, being the sixth of his father's sons.</li>
<li>Clausius entered the University of Berlin in 1840 although at this stage he was still not clear which subjects he would pursue.</li>
<li>At the Gymnasium Clausius taught the advanced classes in mathematics and physics.</li>
<li>However in this work Clausius applied mathematics far more deeply than any of his predecessors and it is a good illustration of how physical problems drive the development of mathematics even when their physical basis is unsound.</li>
<li>Clausius's first paper on the mechanical theory of heat was published in 1850.</li>
<li>On 29 August 1855 Clausius was appointed to the Chair of Mathematical Physics at the Polytechnikum in Zürich and at the same time he was also appointed to the University of Zürich.</li>
<li>It was certainly an excellent place for Clausius to push forward his ideas surrounded by other excellent mathematicians and physicists.</li>
<li>Soon after this, however, political events would have a major effect on Clausius's life.</li>
<li>Clausius was a German patriot and, although he was nearing 50 years of age, he offered his services to his country in the Franco-Prussian war which had broken out.</li>
<li>Clausius received the Iron Cross in 1871 for his services to the German campaign.</li>
<li>The child, which survived, was their sixth but only four, two boys and two girls, survived Clausius.</li>
<li>However after the death of his wife Clausius had the responsibility of bring up his family and, together with his war wound, meant that he had little chance for concentrated academic work.</li>
<li>This Clausius did and in 1878 he took up riding, soon becoming an expert horseman.</li>
<li>His second wife was Sophie Stack from Essen and Clausius had one further child, a son, with his second wife.</li>
<li>Clausius was a theoretical physicist, in fact he played an important role in establishing theoretical physics as a discipline.</li>
<li>Clausius first stated the basic idea of the second law of thermodynamics.</li>
<li>To understand the significance of Clausius's paper we should say a few words about the theory of heat which existed at this time.</li>
<li>However, in his 1850 paper, Clausius states clearly that the assumptions of the caloric theory are false and he gives two laws of thermodynamics to replace the incorrect assumptions.</li>
<li>Clausius had experimental evidence of this law, not from his own experiments but from those of Joule.</li>
<li>Clausius interpreted free heat as the kinetic energy of the particles of the body.</li>
<li>The introduction of U, the energy of the body, was of great significance although Clausius did not give it a name.</li>
<li>this was only the beginning of Clausius's long involvement in the study of the second law.</li>
<li>Clausius restated Sadi Carnot's principle of the efficiency of heat engines in his work.</li>
<li>The Clausius-Clapeyron equation appears which expresses the relation between the pressure and temperature at which two phases of a substance are in equilibrium.</li>
<li>Still without giving the concept a name Clausius formulated, in a memoir of 1854, the rudiments of the theory of the concept of the measure of transformation equivalence he later called entropy.</li>
<li>In his paper of 1865 Clausius stated the First and Second laws of thermodynamics in the following form.</li>
<li>We have referred above to the great patriotism shown by Clausius.</li>
<li>Clausius was very critical that a German had been the first to establish the result, not the Englishman Joule.</li>
<li>Clausius stumbled into the controversy quite accidentally when Tyndall had asked him to send him all von Mayer's papers.</li>
<li>However Clausius then published an article in 1868 stating that not only did von Mayer have priority but so did the German nation.</li>
<li>A more bitter dispute between Tait and Clausius began in 1872 when Maxwell published Theory of Heat.</li>
<li>Clausius stated that the British were trying to claim more than they deserved for the theory of heat which, Clausius said, he alone was the discoverer.</li>
<li>One would have to add that Maxwell had, over a number of years, fully recognised Clausius's contribution, so he had little grounds for the complaint.</li>
<li>The sadness of the situation was the effect that Clausius's attitude had on his own achievements.</li>
<li>Some historians claim that Clausius made more use of the ideas of others than he was prepared to admit.</li>
<li>our purpose is to make sense of what Clausius did in this long endeavour.</li>
<li>We must not give the impression that Clausius's work was not of outstanding importance for it most certainly was.</li>
<li>Clausius replied to the criticisms but saying that his absolute velocity was relative to the medium surrounding the charge.</li>
<li>Clausius received many honours for his work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 2 January 1822, Koslin, Prussia (now Koszalin, Poland). Died 24 August 1888, Bonn, Germany.</p>
