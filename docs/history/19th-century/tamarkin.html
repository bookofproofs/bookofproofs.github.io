<p><strong>Yakov  Tamarkin</strong> was a Ukranian-American mathematician who made important contributions to mathematical analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tamarkin was in the same class at the Second Gymnasium as Alexander Friedmann and the two became very close friends.</li>
<li>Smirnov was also a pupil at the Second Gymnasium and was one year older than Tamarkin and Friedmann.</li>
<li>In each class Tamarkin and Friedmann performed brilliantly and from the fifth form onwards they concentrated hard on their mathematical studies.</li>
<li>One amusing fact which the school records show is that Tamarkin was often late for school.</li>
<li>In 1905 Tamarkin and Friedmann wrote a paper on Bernoulli numbers which they submitted to Hilbert for publication in Mathematische Annalen.</li>
<li>Tamarkin graduated from the Second Gymnasium in 1906 with a gold medal and entered the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of the University of St Petersburg in August of that year.</li>
<li>Tamarkin maintained his close friendship and academic collaboration with Friedmann and by 1908 the two were attending lectures by Steklov on partial differential equations.</li>
<li>In April 1909 Steklov set Tamarkin a project.</li>
<li>Tamarkin graduated in 1910 with the equivalent to a Master's degree, then remained at St Petersburg to prepare for the position of professor of mathematics.</li>
<li>For his Magister degree, Tamarkin had to both take examinations and also to write a thesis.</li>
<li>As well as teaching at the University, Tamarkin taught at two other institutions in St Petersburg, namely the Electro-Technical School and the School of Communications.</li>
<li>Friedmann and Besicovitch had worked there through the difficult times and in late 1919 Tamarkin went there too.</li>
<li>Both Friedmann and Besicovitch returned to Petrograd (as St Petersburg was then called) but Tamarkin spent two years at Perm until 1922 both as professor and dean of the university.</li>
<li>In 1927 Tamarkin was appointed to Brown University where he remained for the rest of his career.</li>
<li>Not only did Tamarkin publish in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society and in the Annals of Mathematics but he also was an editor of these two journals; the first from 1927 to 1936, and the second from 1928 to 1939.</li>
<li>Tamarkin published a series of papers written jointly with Hille between 1932 and 1934.</li>
<li>In 1945 when he was 56 years old, Tamarkin suffered a heart attack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 11 July 1888, Chernigov, Ukraine. Died 18 November 1945, Washington, D.C., USA.</p>
