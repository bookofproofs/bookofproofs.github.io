<h1>Person: Wren (2), Thomas Lancaster</h1>

<p><strong>Thomas Wren</strong> was an English mathematician whose main work was in geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thomas and Amy Elizabeth were married on 5 August 1884 in Hammersmith, Middlesex, England.</li>
<li>Thomas, the subject of this biography, entered Latymer Upper School in 1896.</li>
<li>It moved into new buildings in 1890, the year after Wren was born, and these buildings are still part of the school today.</li>
<li>When Wren studied there it was a boys' school and, after an excellent education, he graduated in  1908.</li>
<li>Wren held this fellowship from 1913 to 1919 and, in addition, he was an Assistant in Mathematics at Bedford College, London, during the academic year 1913-14.</li>
<li>Now, by the time Wren was appointed as a College lecturer at Cambridge, Britain was already at war having declared war on Germany after that country invaded Belgium on 4 August 1914.</li>
<li>Wren had been in the Officers Training Corps while an undergraduate at Cambridge and, after teaching at Cambridge for the academic year 1914-15, he joined the Army.</li>
<li>Other mathematicians serving in the Anti-Aircraft Experimental Section included William Edward Hodgson Berwick who was one year older than Wren and had taken the same Cambridge Mathematical Tripos examinations one year earlier.</li>
<li>Richmond was much older than Wren and had graduated from Cambridge before Wren was even born.</li>
<li>The interplay between these mathematicians working in the Anti-Aircraft Experimental Section was very effective and Wren always said what stimulating contacts he had made at that time.</li>
<li>The war ended in November 1918, and in February 1919 Wren returned to his position as a fellow and College lecturer at Cambridge.</li>
<li>However, it should be recorded that L N G Filon dedicated the second edition of his 'Introduction to projective geometry' to Wren, acknowledging that without Wren's friendly and unselfish help he could never have accomplished his task.</li>
<li>Mr Wren very kindly undertook the laborious task of looking over the whole manuscript of the revised work and has actually checked practically every example, and suggested many new ones.</li>
<li>A joint seminar, established by J G Semple and Wren and held alternately at King's and University Colleges, promoted the exchange of such ideas.</li>
<li>Geometry was not Wren's only contribution.</li>
<li>Although Wren only published four papers, he did also write some excellent review articles such as his review of The Theory of Ruled Surfaces (1931), by W L Edge.</li>
<li>After a long period when he ceased to be able to move about easily but remained otherwise as alert as ever, Wren died on 14th  July, 1972.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 April 1889, Islington, London, England. Died 14 July 1972, Kensington, London, England.</p>
