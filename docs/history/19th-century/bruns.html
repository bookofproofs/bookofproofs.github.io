<p><strong>Heinrich Bruns</strong> was a German scientist who was interested in astronomy, mathematics and geodesy and worked on the three body problem.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bruns studied in Berlin from 1866 to 1871, obtaining a doctorate under Weierstrass and Kummer in 1871 for his thesis De proprietate quadam functionis potentialis corporum homogeneorum Ⓣ(The property of a potential function of a homogeneous body).</li>
<li>When Bruns worked there the director was Otto Vasiliyevich Struve, son of the first director.</li>
<li>At the Pulkovo Observatory Bruns met another calculator, Marie Wilhelmine Schleussner who was two years younger than Bruns, and the two married.</li>
<li>In 1873 Bruns left Pulkovo to take up the position of observer at the Dorpat Observatory (now Tartu, Estonia).</li>
<li>Peter Carl Ludwig Schwarz had taken over from Thomas Clausen when he retired as director in the year before Bruns arrived at the Observatory.</li>
<li>After three years at Dorpat, Bruns was appointed as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Berlin where he remained until 1882.</li>
<li>Bruns was the second director, the first being Carl Christian Bruhns who held the position from 1861 until his death in 1881.</li>
<li>Bruns held these positions until his death in 1919.</li>
<li>Bruns was interested in astronomy, mathematics and geodesy.</li>
<li>Bruns showed in 1887 that there could be no conserved quantities which could be expressible as algebraic functions of the positions and velocities of the three bodies.</li>
<li>A few years later Poincaré extended Bruns' work to show that no solution to the three-body problem was possible given by algebraic expressions and integrals.</li>
<li>In addition to this major contribution to the three-body problem, Bruns also published major contributions to potential theory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 September 1848, Berlin, Germany. Died 23 September 1919, Leipzig, Germany.</p>
