<p><strong>William Hamilton</strong> was a Scottish philosopher whose approach to logic influenced Boole, De Morgan and others.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>William was educated at a variety of Scottish and English schools before entering the University of Glasgow when he was 12 years old to study Greek and Latin.</li>
<li>In 1807, having been award a Snell exhibition, Hamilton matriculated in Balliol College, Oxford.</li>
<li>on the personal side, Hamilton was aggressive and opinionated in discussion, and in a university that took the literary qualities of the classics more seriously than their philosophical qualities, his erudition may have seemed more awkward than attractive.</li>
<li>Back in Edinburgh Hamilton joined the legal profession becoming an advocate.</li>
<li>From this time on he dropped his middle name of Stirling and called himself Sir William Hamilton of Preston and Fingalton, baronet.</li>
<li>In 1821 Hamilton was appointed professor of civil history at Edinburgh University but from 1829 he began to become known as a philosopher when he published an article in the Edinburgh Review which discussed Kant's ideas.</li>
<li>In 1836 Hamilton became professor of logic and metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh, giving his inaugural lecture on 21 November.</li>
<li>Hamilton was one of the first in a series of British logicians to create the algebra of logic and introduced the 'quantification of the predicate'.</li>
<li>Boole, De Morgan and Venn followed him, but Hamilton helped begin this development and his work, although not of great depth, influenced Boole to produce a much more sophisticated system.</li>
<li>Sadly, however, Hamilton claimed that De Morgan was guilty of plagiarism which was a ridiculous suggestion.</li>
<li>One important aspect is that Hamilton stimulated an interest in metaphysics and introduced Kant and other German philosophers to the British public.</li>
<li>Hamilton had a stroke in 1844 which left him partially paralysed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 8 March 1788, Glasgow, Scotland. Died 6 May 1856, Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
