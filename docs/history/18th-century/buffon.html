<p><strong>Georges Buffon</strong> was a French scientist who was important in the area of natural history. His needle experiment caused much discussion about probability.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Georges-louis Leclerc, as was his name until 1725, was the eldest of his parents five children.</li>
<li>When Georges was ten years old his mother inherited a large sum of money which allowed Benjamin Leclerc to become lord of Buffon and Montbard.</li>
<li>The name Buffon was that of an estate that his mother Anne inherited at this time.</li>
<li>At this time Georges entered the Jesuit College of Godrans in Dijon and he was educated there until 1723.</li>
<li>Three of his younger brothers went on to join the Church but Georges' father wanted his eldest son to study law.</li>
<li>It did not look that Georges would become a star in legal circles for his school performance was not above average.</li>
<li>However, he was more interested in mathematics than he was in the law and at the age of 20 Buffon (he was now calling himself Georges-Louis Leclerc De Buffon) discovered the binomial theorem.</li>
<li>In 1728 Buffon went to Angers to study mathematics, but he also studied other topics such as medicine and botany.</li>
<li>Buffon, the Duke of Kingston and his tutor Nathaniel Hickman, visited southern France and Italy, arriving in Rome early in 1732.</li>
<li>When news reached Buffon that his mother had died, he returned to France.</li>
<li>His mother had left Buffon her fortune which he inherited despite his father objecting strongly.</li>
<li>Buffon decided to settle on what was now his estate at Montbard.</li>
<li>He wanted to improve the construction of ships of war, and he asked Buffon to study the tensile strength of timber to assist in this task.</li>
<li>As a result of this fine memoir Buffon was elected to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris on 9 January 1734.</li>
<li>Someone who is skilled in financial affairs and who starts with a large amount of money is usually able to make a considerably larger fortune for themselves, and this is precisely what Buffon did over the years from 1734 to 1740.</li>
<li>A new phase in Buffon's life began in July 1739 when he was appointed as keeper of the royal botanical garden, the Jardin du Roi.</li>
<li>For fifty years, Buffon spent the summer on his estate, returning to Paris in the autumn.</li>
<li>Buffon married Françoise de Saint-Belin-Malain in 1752.</li>
<li>By this time Buffon was forty-five years of age but his wife was twenty.</li>
<li>They had one son in 1764 but Buffon's wife died five years later.</li>
<li>It looked as though Buffon's son had a brilliant future and he was expected to achieve fame at least equal to that of his father.</li>
<li>When Buffon's son was seventeen years old his father arranged for the naturalist J-B Lamarck to take him with him on his botanical studies through Europe.</li>
<li>The wide range of topics which Buffon wrote on include mathematics, the theory of probability, astronomy and physics, especially optics.</li>
<li>Unlike Newton, Buffon believed that everything developed through natural phenomena.</li>
<li>Buffon proposed a method of creation of the planets which involved the collision of a comet with the sun.</li>
<li>Similarly Buffon argued that life came about on earth through the appearance of organic matter which was the result of heat on aqueous, oily substances.</li>
<li>Buffon was among the first to create an autonomous science, free of any theological influence.</li>
<li>Voltaire did not appreciate his style, and d'Alembert called him "the great phrasemonger." According to the writer J-F Marmontel, Buffon had to put up with snubs from the mathematicians, chemists, and astronomers, while the naturalists themselves gave him little support and some even reproached him for writing ostentatiously in a subject that required a simple and natural style.</li>
<li>Buffon himself reacted to the attacks on him with great dignity and did not get into bad tempered disputes as many scientists of this period did.</li>
<li>The needle experiment, described in 1777, was not the only problem in probability that Buffon examined.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 September 1707, Montbard, Côte d'Or, France. Died 16 April 1788, Paris, France.</p>
