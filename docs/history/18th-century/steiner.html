<h1>Person: Steiner, Jakob</h1>

<p><strong>Jakob Steiner</strong> was one of the greatest contributors to projective geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jakob was the youngest of the children and spent his early years helping his parents with the small farm and business that they ran near the village of Utzenstorf, about 24 km north of Bern.</li>
<li>Jakob, however, wanted something better for himself but his parents were delighted to have his help with their business.</li>
<li>Pestalozzi ran his innovative school in the town from 1805 to 1825 and Steiner entered in the spring of 1814.</li>
<li>The fact that Steiner was unable to pay anything towards his education at the school was not a problem, for Pestalozzi wanted to try out his educational methods on the poor.</li>
<li>Pestalozzi's school had a very significant effect on Steiner's attitude both to the teaching of mathematics and also to his philosophy when undertaking research in mathematics.</li>
<li>In the autumn of 1818, Steiner left Yverdom and travelled to Heidelberg where he earned his living giving private mathematics lessons.</li>
<li>Steiner's time as a mathematics teacher at the Werder Gymnasium proved a difficult one.</li>
<li>Perhaps, understandably, Zimmermann wanted Steiner to teach his courses using a textbook written by Zimmermann himself.</li>
<li>Steiner, who was a firm believer in Pestalozzi's methods of teaching, used those methods in the classroom.</li>
<li>Zimmermann claimed that these were only suitable for elementary courses, and Steiner was dismissed in the autumn of 1822.</li>
<li>Carl Jacobi, although eight years younger than Steiner, was a student at the University of Berlin at this time and soon Steiner and Jacobi became friends.</li>
<li>In 1825 Steiner was appointed as an assistant master at the Technical School of Berlin.</li>
<li>The type of difficulties that Steiner had experienced at the Werder Gymnasium again arose at the Technical School.</li>
<li>Klöden, almost certainly correctly, believed that Steiner was not giving him the respect that he deserved.</li>
<li>Despite the bad atmosphere, Steiner managed to carry out some outstanding mathematical research while teaching at the Technical School.</li>
<li>We have already mentions that Steiner became friendly with Jacobi, but he also became friendly with other influential mathematicians in Berlin.</li>
<li>Steiner became an early contributor to Crelle's Journal, the Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, which was the first journal devoted entirely to mathematics founded.</li>
<li>The first volume of the journal appeared in 1826 and contains Steiner's first long work, Einige geometrische Betrachtungen Ⓣ(Some geometric considerations).</li>
<li>It is also important for Steiner's use of the principle of inversion in many of the proofs.</li>
<li>This paper was the first of 62 papers which Steiner published in Crelle's Journal.</li>
<li>In 1832 Steiner published his first book Systematische Entwicklung der Abhangigkeit geometrischer Gestalten voneinander Ⓣ(Systematic development of the dependence of geometric shapes on each other).</li>
<li>Much of the material had already appeared in Steiner's papers over the preceding six years.</li>
<li>Soon Steiner was being honoured for his remarkable achievements.</li>
<li>He was in Rome in 1844 and on this visit he spent his time investigating a fourth order surface of the third class now called the 'Roman surface' or 'Steiner surface'.</li>
<li>He discovered the 'Steiner surface' which has a double infinity of conic sections on it.</li>
<li>The 'Steiner theorem' states that the two pencils by which a conic is projected from two of its points are projectively related.</li>
<li>Another famous result is the 'Poncelet-Steiner theorem' which shows that only one given circle and a straight edge are required for Euclidean constructions.</li>
<li>Today these ellipses are called the 'Steiner ellipses'.</li>
<li>He also introduced Steiner curves, discussed tangents at points of inflection, double tangents, cusps and double points.</li>
<li>This wealth of material is presented, however, without any indication of the proofs which Steiner had found.</li>
<li>Steiner disliked algebra and analysis and believed that calculation replaces thinking while geometry stimulates thinking.</li>
<li>Despite being a mathematical genius, in other ways Steiner was a difficult person.</li>
<li>The last ten years of Steiner's life were increasingly difficult through illness.</li>
<li>Steiner never married and, perhaps as a consequence, left a fortune on his death.</li>
<li>One third of this fortune went to the Berlin Academy to found the Steiner Prize.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 18 March 1796, Utzenstorf, Switzerland. Died 1 April 1863, Bern, Switzerland.</p>
