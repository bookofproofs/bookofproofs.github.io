<p><strong>Caroline Herschel</strong> recorded the observations and did the calculations on the data of her astronomer brother William.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Caroline could never have thought in her wildest dreams that one day she would make a major contribution to the study of comets.</li>
<li>In 1760 Isaac returned home in poor health and Caroline essentially lived the life of a servant until he died in 1767.</li>
<li>In 1766 William became an organist in Bath and, in 1772, Caroline joined him there.</li>
<li>William taught Caroline more than musical skills.</li>
<li>Now he began to teach Caroline English and mathematics while he himself became more and more involved with astronomy.</li>
<li>In addition to her singing, Caroline helped William with his musical activities and looked after him while he spent many hours with his new hobby of constructing telescopes.</li>
<li>Slowly Caroline turned more and more towards helping William with his astronomical activities while he continued to teach her algebra, geometry and trigonometry.</li>
<li>In particular Caroline studied spherical trigonometry which would be important for reducing astronomical observations.</li>
<li>Almost inevitably Caroline's role changed from looking after William to helping him with his scientific activities which soon occupied every available moment.</li>
<li>Giving up their musical activities the Herschels moved to Datchet in August 1782 where they remained until June 1785 when they moved again, this time into Clay Hall, near Windsor.</li>
<li>It was certainly not without many regrets that Caroline abandoned music and began to take an active part in astronomy.</li>
<li>Caroline found much less time than she expected to make her own observations as she became fully involved helping William with his astronomical projects.</li>
<li>By day Caroline would work on the results obtained by William while observing on the previous night.</li>
<li>Only when William was away from home was Caroline able to spend much time with her own program of research.</li>
<li>In April 1786 William and Caroline moved to a new home they called Observatory House which was in Slough and there, on 1 August 1786, Caroline discovered her first comet which was described by some as the "first lady's comet".</li>
<li>This discovery brought Caroline a certain degree of fame and articles were written about her.</li>
<li>Eventually the relationship between the two ladies - Mary and Caroline - warmed ...</li>
<li>However, as the relationship between the two ladies improved, Caroline regretted her bitter comments against Mary and she destroyed every page of her diary over this time in her life.</li>
<li>In total Caroline discovered eight comets between 1786 and 1797 and she then embarked on a new project of cross-referencing and correcting the star catalogue which had been produced by Flamsteed.</li>
<li>In 1798 Caroline submitted to the Royal Society an Index to Flamsteed's Observations of the Fixed Stars together with a list of 560 stars which had been omitted.</li>
<li>This period of 25 years was not one which lacked interest for Caroline.</li>
<li>John Herschel spent long periods with his aunt during the vacations and was greatly influenced by Caroline.</li>
<li>Caroline continued to assist William with his observations but her status had greatly improved from the housekeeper she had been in her young days.</li>
<li>Caroline returned to Hanover after William's death in 1822.</li>
<li>Although Caroline regretted spending her last 25 years in Hanover there were many compensations.</li>
<li>Caroline Herschel received many honours for her scientific achievements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 16 March 1750, Hannover, Hanover (now Germany). Died 9 January 1848, Hannover, Hanover (now Germany).</p>
