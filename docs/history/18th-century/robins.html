<p><strong>Benjamin Robins</strong> was an English engineer who wrote on Newton's mathematics and invented the ballistic pendulum.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>An answer was returned by Mr Robins that gave a very advantageous idea of his taste, as well as invention.</li>
<li>Pemberton soon had Robins reading, in English translations, the classic Greek texts on geometry by Apollonius, Archimedes and by Pappus.</li>
<li>Robins loved this geometrical approach to mathematics and retained a preference for geometry over algebra or analysis throughout his life.</li>
<li>Gradually Robins gave up teaching to become an engineer.</li>
<li>He replied in the November part of The Present State of the Republick of Letters arguing that Robins had not faithfully represented the concept of limit as used by Newton.</li>
<li>Robins also published Remarks on M Euler's Treatise of Motion in 1739.</li>
<li>Robins' attacks on Walpole meant that after Walpole was removed from office in 1741, Robins was in favour with the Tory Party and he was appointed as secretary to a secret committee set up to investigate Walpole's conduct.</li>
<li>The Royal Military Academy was founded at Woolwich, in south-east London, in 1741 with the purpose of educating "good officers of artillery and perfect engineers." Robins was a candidate for the position of professor of fortification at the Academy but failed to be appointed; the post was given to a Mr Muller.</li>
<li>It has been said that Mr Robins published his discoveries and improvements in gunnery, to show, it was thought, what sort of man had been overlooked on that occasion.</li>
<li>The work Robins published in 1742 was New Principles of Gunnery which formed the basis for all subsequent work on the theory of artillery and projectiles.</li>
<li>The work grew out of a course Robins intended to give, but changed his mind on not being appointed to the new Royal Military Academy.</li>
<li>This, and other work by Robins, would influence not only the British military but also that of other European countries.</li>
<li>Robins invented the ballistic pendulum which allowed precise measurements of the velocity of projectiles fired from guns.</li>
<li>As described by Robins, a large wooden block is suspended in front of a gun.</li>
<li>In 1747 Robins received the Copley medal of the Royal Society to recognise his achievement in developing the new science of ballistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 16 April 1706, Bath, England. Died 20 July 1751, Madras, (now Chennai) India.</p>
