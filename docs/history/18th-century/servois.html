<p><strong>François-Joseph Servois</strong> was a French mathematician who worked on projective geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Servois's first intention was to join the priesthood and he began by following this aim and was ordained at Besançon.</li>
<li>Servois soon changed his mind about following a career in the Church, and left in 1793 to join the army.</li>
<li>There were numerous military campaigns by the French army shortly after this and Servois was in the thick of the action serving as a staff officer.</li>
<li>However, he had a great love of mathematics and while on the military campaigns Servois spent all his free time studying.</li>
<li>Legendre realised that Servois had considerable mathematical talents and he supported a move to have him appointed to the artillery school of Besançon as professor of mathematics.</li>
<li>Appointed to this post in July 1801, Servois went on to hold similar positions over the next few years.</li>
<li>In comparison with his earlier appointments, Servois spent quite a while in Metz at the artillery school, remaining there until 1808.</li>
<li>Servois was appointed as curator in 1816 and he held this post until he retired in 1827.</li>
<li>After he retired Servois returned to his home town of Mont-de-Laval where he lived for nearly twenty further years.</li>
<li>Servois worked in projective geometry, functional equations and complex numbers.</li>
<li>Servois introduced the terms "commutative" and "distributive" in this paper describing properties of operators, and he also gave some examples of noncommutativity.</li>
<li>Servois was critical of Argand's geometric interpretation of the complex numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 July 1768, Mont-de-Laval (N of Morteau), Doubs, France. Died 17 April 1847, Mont-de-Laval, Doubs, France.</p>
