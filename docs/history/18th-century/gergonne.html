<h1>Person: Gergonne, Joseph Diaz</h1>

<p><strong>Joseph Gergonne</strong> was a French mathematician who published an influential journal and made contributions to duality theory in projective geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>However, he died when Joseph was twelve years old.</li>
<li>Joseph was educated at the Collège de Nancy which was a religious establishment.</li>
<li>Gergonne gave his support becoming a captain in the National Guard.</li>
<li>The Assembly called for 100,000 military volunteers and Gergonne joined the French army being assembled to defend Paris against the Prussians.</li>
<li>On 20 September 1792 Kellermann led the French forces at Valmy with Gergonne in his army.</li>
<li>Gergonne returned to the French army, this time as secretary to the general staff of the Moselle army.</li>
<li>Gergonne spent a month at the Châlons artillery school in 1794 and after this he was commissioned as a lieutenant.</li>
<li>Gergonne was attached to these forces which entered Spain and laid siege to the town of Figueras capturing it.</li>
<li>At this stage Gergonne was sent with his regiment to Nimes in southern France.</li>
<li>In that city the École Centrale had been set up shortly before and Gergonne was appointed to the chair of transcendental mathematics.</li>
<li>Gergonne, however, settled down at this point.</li>
<li>Finding problems getting his mathematics papers published, Gergonne established his own mathematics journal, the first part appearing in 1810.</li>
<li>The Journal was officially called the Annales de mathématiques pures et appliquées Ⓣ(Annals of Pure and Applied Mathematics) but became known as Annales de Gergonne .</li>
<li>Gergonne's mathematical interests were in geometry so it is not surprising that it was this topic which figured most prominently in his journal.</li>
<li>In fact many famous mathematicians published in the twenty-one volumes of the Annales de Gergonne which appeared during a period of twenty-two years.</li>
<li>In addition to Gergonne himself (who published around 200 articles), Poncelet, Servois, Bobillier, Steiner, Plücker, Chasles, Brianchon, Dupin, Lamé, Galois and many others had papers appear in the Journal.</li>
<li>In 1813 Gergonne wrote a prize winning essay for the Bordeaux Academy Methods of synthesis and analysis in mathematics.</li>
<li>The essay tells us a lot about Gergonne's mathematical ideas.</li>
<li>Perhaps surprisingly, since Gergonne was himself a geometer, he suggests that algebra is a more important topic than geometry.</li>
<li>We will examine Gergonne's contributions to geometry later in this article, but for the moment it is worth noting that he did publish on other topics.</li>
<li>Gergonne looked at how to estimate the values of the response function, and of its derivatives, at a point when there are random errors in the observed values.</li>
<li>Gergonne was appointed to the chair of astronomy at the University of Montpellier in 1816.</li>
<li>It was in 1830 that Gergonne became rector of the University of Montpellier.</li>
<li>Gergonne retired in 1844 at the age of 73.</li>
<li>Gergonne provided an elegant solution to the Problem of Apollonius in 1816.</li>
<li>Gergonne introduced the word polar and the principle of duality in projective geometry was one of his main contributions.</li>
<li>Gergonne's first contributions to duality appear in a series of papers beginning in 1810.</li>
<li>We have already illustrated Gergonne's interest in the philosophy of mathematics with a description of his unpublished essay on the topic in 1813.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 19 June 1771, Nancy, France. Died 4 May 1859, Montpellier, France.</p>
