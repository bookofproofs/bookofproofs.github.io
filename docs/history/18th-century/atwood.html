<p><strong>George Atwood</strong> was an English mathematician best known for his invention of a low-friction pulley system.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In his final year at the school in 1764 George was captain of the school.</li>
<li>Atwood was a very popular lecturer at Cambridge, giving many demonstrations in his lectures.</li>
<li>William Pitt, British prime minister (1783-1801, 1804-06), was one of the many students who attended Atwood's popular lectures and later, when Pitt had achieved high office, he employed Atwood in the Treasury.</li>
<li>However this was still some way into the future when Atwood gave up his position as tutor at Cambridge in 1779 and tried unsuccessfully to obtain a position with the board of longitude.</li>
<li>In the summer of 1781 Atwood sent the Royal Society details of his applications of geometry to the problems of correcting sightings through sextant mirrors.</li>
<li>Atwood supported Hutton, as did Maseres, Maskelyne, Landen, Glenie, Hornsby and others, accusing Banks of using excessive authority and of being "despotic".</li>
<li>Atwood, and the others in the mathematicians' mutiny, strongly supported this as we noted above.</li>
<li>In 1784 Pitt arranged that Atwood be given £500 a year and an office in the Treasury.</li>
<li>Atwood is best known for a work A Treatise on the Rectilinear Motion and Rotation of Bodies (published by Cambridge University Press in 1784) which is a textbook on Newtonian mechanics describing impact and simple harmonic motion.</li>
<li>It also describes in detail a machine, now known as Atwood's machine, to demonstrate the laws of uniformly accelerated motion due to gravity.</li>
<li>The machine had been constructed by George Adams, a London instrument maker, to Atwood's specification and the first description of it appeared in French in 1780.</li>
<li>Alessandro Volta had requested the machine, and copies had also been sent to Spain, but Atwood was pressed to publish a description.</li>
<li>Atwood also published on equations for the use of Hadley's quadrant.</li>
<li>Atwood was a renowned amateur chess-player and among other opponents played games against the famous French player Philidor, who was regarded as the unofficial world champion.</li>
<li>One of most interesting features of Atwood as a chess player is that he recorded and preserved some of his games, an unusual practice at that time.</li>
<li>These records have survived, among them the last games that Philidor played which were against Atwood at Parsloe's Club in London on 20 June 1795.</li>
<li>Atwood was highly involved with mathematical calculations which were needed by governments to run the country effectively.</li>
<li>It was said that this intense work and calculation had broken Atwood's health.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born October 1745, Westminster, London, England. Died 11 July 1807, Westminster, London, England.</p>
