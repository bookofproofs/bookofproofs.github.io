<h1>Person: Lloyd, Bartholomew</h1>

<p><strong>Bartholomew Lloyd</strong> was an Irish mathematician who became a bishop and provost of Trinity College Dublin.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although Lloyd entered Trinity without the award of a scholarship, his progress was excellent and in 1790 he was awarded a scholarship for his classical achievements.</li>
<li>We note that through Lloyd's time as an undergraduate at Trinity College, Dublin, Richard Murray was the Professor of Mathematics.</li>
<li>Lloyd continued to undertake research in mathematics despite having an extremely high teaching load.</li>
<li>Bartholomew and Eleanor Lloyd had four sons: Humphrey Lloyd (born 1800, who has a biography in this archive); Bartholomew Clifford Lloyd (born 1808); Robert Clifford Lloyd (born 1809); and John Frederick Lloyd (born 1810).</li>
<li>Certainly, despite having studied no calculus as an undergraduate, nevertheless Lloyd was now reading continental mathematics texts.</li>
<li>In 1813 Magee became Dean of Cork and, in the same year Lloyd was appointed to succeed him as Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College, Dublin.</li>
<li>This, we note, was quite remarkable since Lloyd had never been promoted to a senior fellowship and had remained a junior fellow from 1796 to 1813.</li>
<li>Lacroix had written the excellent textbook Traité élémentaire de calcul differéntiel et du calcul intégral (1802) to support his lectures and Lloyd now introduced this into the Trinity curriculum.</li>
<li>This work was also introduced into the Trinity curriculum by Lloyd.</li>
<li>Deeply impressed with this feeling, Dr Lloyd, singly and unassisted, conceived and executed the most rapid revolution ever effected in the details of a great public institution.</li>
<li>In fact in 1822, the year that Lardner wrote the above remarks, Lloyd moved from the Chair of Mathematics to the Erasmus Smith Chair of Natural and Experimental Philosophy which had become vacant on the death of William Davenport.</li>
<li>We should mention that, while professor of mathematics, Lloyd published A Treatise on Analytic Geometry (1819).</li>
<li>The work referred to in this quote is Lloyd's two-volume work An Elementary Treatise of Mechanical Philosophy, written for the use of the undergraduate students of the University of Dublin (1828).</li>
<li>Dr Lloyd, therefore, unites the highest claims to our gratitude for his bold and successful effort to supply, in an important part, this deficiency.</li>
<li>In 1831 Lloyd became Provost of Trinity College, Dublin.</li>
<li>One of Lloyd's first tasks as Provost was to improve the structure of Mathematics and of Natural Philosophy.</li>
<li>Lloyd separated these roles and made other improvements such as in the structure of the fellowship examinations.</li>
<li>Lloyd indicated that he wanted to see this rule changed for the newly restructured chairs but, seeing that there was strong opposition to this he dropped his proposal.</li>
<li>The first to benefit from Lloyd's changes to the chair of mathematics was James MacCullagh who filled this position in 1835.</li>
<li>In the thirteen years between Lloyd leaving the chair of mathematics and MacCullagh filling the chair there had been two professors, namely James Wilson, who had published First Elements of the Theory of Series and Differences (1822), and Franc Sadleir (1775-1851).</li>
<li>After the reforms of mathematics and physics, Lloyd turned his attention to reforming theology.</li>
<li>There are a few additional pieces of information about Lloyd that we should give.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 February 1772, New Ross, County Wexford, Ireland. Died 24 November 1837, Dublin, Ireland.</p>
