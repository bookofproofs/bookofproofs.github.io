<p><strong>Johann Castillon</strong> was an Italian mathematician and astronomer who wrote on the cardioid.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Johann Castillon was named Giovanni Francesco Melchiore Salvemini and was known by that name until he was over thirty years of age.</li>
<li>As a young man Castillon was irreligious.</li>
<li>His mother had admonished him not to dishonour the family name, so he took the name 'Castiglione' (in Italian; 'Castilloneus' in Latin and 'Castillon' in French) after 'Castiglion Fiorentino', the location of the family home.</li>
<li>Castillon taught at Vevey, a town on the north shore of Lake Geneva, where he became the director of the humanistic school.</li>
<li>Up to this time Castillon had been an atheist, but in 1744 he became a Calvinist.</li>
<li>Also in 1745 he published the correspondence between Johann Bernoulli and Gottfried Leibniz; then in 1748 he published the Introductio in analysin infinitorum auctore Leonhardo Eulero, the treatise by Euler which he had edited.</li>
<li>Between 1749 and 1751 Castillon taught both at Lausanne and also at Bern.</li>
<li>This proved a difficult decision for Castillon and he took several months to make up his mind.</li>
<li>He obtained a doctorate from Utrecht in 1754, being advised by Johannes Horthemels, and Castillon became an ordinary professor of mathematics and philosophy there in 1755.</li>
<li>Three years later Castillon became rector of the University.</li>
<li>During these years Castillon had received a number of distinctions being made a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and a member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, both in 1753.</li>
<li>In 1757 Castillon's wife Elisabeth died; he married to Madeleine Ravène two years later.</li>
<li>Castillon replied to Rousseau in Réponse Ⓣ(Response), giving his own defence of progress and modern civility.</li>
<li>Published in Amsterdam in 1756, Castillon's work was addressed to Maupertuis, as President of the Berlin Academy of Science.</li>
<li>Castillon opposed the views of Rousseau and his supporters, favouring the ideas of thinkers of the English Enlightenment.</li>
<li>James Boswell, the famous Scottish lawyer, diarist, and author, travelled in Holland in October 1763 and met with Castillon in Utrecht on several occasions.</li>
<li>Boswell recounts a number of incidents which give us some insight into Castillon at this time.</li>
<li>Monsieur Castillon said so, after having lived in Utrecht for several years.</li>
<li>Boswell and Castillon discussed free will while in Utrecht.</li>
<li>In 1763 Frederick the Great, the King of Prussia, invited Castillon to Berlin offering him the position of professor of mathematics at the Artillery School.</li>
<li>Also in that year Castillon, on the personal recommendation of Frederick the Great, was elected to the Mathematics Section of the Berlin Academy of Science.</li>
<li>When Boswell was with Castillon in Utrecht in October 1763 it was already known that he would be moving to Berlin in the following year.</li>
<li>In July 1764 Boswell was in Berlin and there met up again with Castillon who took him to a meeting of the Berlin Academy of Science.</li>
<li>Castillon gave me no bad answer to this.</li>
<li>In 1765 Frederick the Great named Castillon 'Royal Astronomer' at the Berlin Observatory.</li>
<li>At this time Castillon was appointed Director of the Mathematics Section, a role he kept until his death.</li>
<li>This problem was posed by Gabriel Cramer and solved by Castillon in 1776.</li>
<li>Finally let us examine the rather puzzling question about Castillon's religious beliefs.</li>
<li>In 1774 Castillon published his translation of the English translation (yes - it was a translation of a translation) by Charles Blount of Philostratus's Life of Apollonius of Tyane.</li>
<li>This was an extremely anti-Christian work and seen as such at the time that Castillon translated it.</li>
<li>By 1774 Castillon was working for Frederick the Great who believed in rational argument and was sceptical of religious beliefs.</li>
<li>It is also possible that once he went to Berlin, Castillon was influenced by Leonhard Euler who was a very devout Christian.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 January 1708, Castiglione, Tuscany (now Italy). Died 11 October 1791, Berlin (now Germany).</p>
