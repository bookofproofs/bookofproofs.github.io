<p><strong>Charles Dupin</strong> made contributions to differential geometry and in particular invented the 'Dupin indicatrix'.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In fact Dupin was both her married and maiden name.</li>
<li>Charles' father was a lawyer and Charles himself was brought up in Nivernais, the region of his birth.</li>
<li>Charles was the middle of the three sons of his parents; his older brother André also achieved fame in his profession as a lawyer.</li>
<li>Dupin was educated at the École Polytechnique in Paris, where he learnt geometry from Monge.</li>
<li>While an undergraduate he made his famous discovery of what are called today 'Dupin's cyclides' guided in this work by Monge.</li>
<li>It took him a while to recover from the illness, but Dupin was not idle while recovering in Pisa.</li>
<li>Other contributions to differential geometry which occur in this work include his invention of the 'Dupin indicatrix' which gives an indication of the local behaviour of a surface up to the terms of degree two.</li>
<li>The year 1813 saw Dupin elected to the Institut de France, the new organisation set up to replace the Académie des Sciences after the French Revolution.</li>
<li>With the reestablishment of the Académie des Sciences, Dupin was elected to that body in 1818.</li>
<li>Dupin was appointed professor at Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers in Paris in 1819.</li>
<li>These lectures proved extremely popular, mainly since Dupin was an exceptional lecturer.</li>
<li>In 1830, at the age of 45, Dupin married Rosalie Anne Joubert.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 6 October 1784, Varzy, France. Died 18 January 1873, Paris, France.</p>
