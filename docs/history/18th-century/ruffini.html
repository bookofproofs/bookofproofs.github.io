<h1>Person: Ruffini, Paolo</h1>

<p><strong>Paolo Ruffini</strong> was an Italian mathematician who gave a proof that the quintic equation could not be solved earlier than Abel.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The family moved to Reggio, near Modena in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy, when Paolo was a teenager.</li>
<li>Among his teachers of mathematics at Modena were Luigi Fantini, who taught Ruffini geometry, and Paolo Cassiani, who taught him calculus.</li>
<li>Cassiani's course at Modena on the foundations of analysis was taken over by Ruffini in 1787-88 although he was still a student at this time.</li>
<li>On 9 June 1788 Ruffini graduated with a degree in philosophy, medicine and surgery.</li>
<li>Ruffini must have made a good job of the foundations of analysis course he took over from Cassiani for, on 15 October 1788, he was appointed professor of the foundations of analysis.</li>
<li>Fantini, who had taught Ruffini geometry when he was an undergraduate, found his eyesight deteriorating and in 1791 he had to resign his post at Modena.</li>
<li>Ruffini was appointed to fill the position of Professor of the Elements of Mathematics in 1791.</li>
<li>However, Ruffini was not only a mathematician.</li>
<li>Napoleon's troops occupied Modena and, much against his wishes, Ruffini found himself in the middle of the political upheaval.</li>
<li>Although not wishing to get involved, Ruffini found himself appointed as a representative to the Junior Council of the Cisalpine Republic.</li>
<li>He was required to swear an oath of allegiance to the republic and this Ruffini found he could not bring himself to do on religious grounds.</li>
<li>Ruffini did not seem greatly disturbed by the loss of his chair, in fact he was a very calm man who took all the dramatic events around him in his stride.</li>
<li>It appears that nobody before Ruffini really believed that the quintic could not be solved by radicals.</li>
<li>In 1799 Ruffini published a book on the theory of equations with his claim that quintics could not be solved by radicals as the title shows: General theory of equations in which it is shown that the algebraic solution of the general equation of degree greater than four is impossible.</li>
<li>Ruffini used group theory in his work but he had to invent the subject for himself.</li>
<li>Ruffini is the first to introduce the notion of the order of an element, conjugacy, the cycle decomposition of elements of permutation groups and the notions of primitive and imprimitive.</li>
<li>It is remarkable work and, except for one gap, proves the theorem as Ruffini claimed.</li>
<li>However there was a strange lack of response to Ruffini's work from mathematicians.</li>
<li>In 1801 Ruffini sent a copy of his book to Lagrange.</li>
<li>This patriotic reaction apart, the world of mathematics seemed to almost ignore Ruffini's great result.</li>
<li>So how did Ruffini react?</li>
<li>At least Ruffini received comments from Malfatti concerning this paper, but unfortunately Malfatti had not understood Ruffini's arguments and raised a fallacious objection.</li>
<li>Ruffini published further proofs in 1808 and 1813.</li>
<li>Ruffini did not stop trying to have his work recognised by the mathematical community.</li>
<li>One has to feel desperately sorry for Ruffini.</li>
<li>If some mathematician had written to him showing him there was an error or even a gap in the proof, then at least Ruffini would have had the chance to correct it.</li>
<li>Ruffini asked the Institute in Paris to pronounce on the correctness of his proof and Lagrange, Legendre and Lacroix were appointed to examine it.</li>
<li>The Royal Society were also asked to pronounce on the correctness and Ruffini received a somewhat kinder reply which said that although they did not give approval of particular pieces of work they were quite sure that it proved what was claimed.</li>
<li>In fact Cauchy had written a major work on permutation groups between 1813 and 1815 and in it he generalised some of Ruffini's results.</li>
<li>He had certainly been greatly influenced by Ruffini's ideas.</li>
<li>This influence through Cauchy is perhaps the only way in which Ruffini's work was to make an impact on the development of mathematics.</li>
<li>We left the story of Ruffini's career around 1799 when he began his publications on the quintic.</li>
<li>After the fall of Napoleon, Ruffini became rector of the University of Modena in 1814.</li>
<li>As well as the rectorship, Ruffini held a chair of applied mathematics, a chair of practical medicine and a chair of clinical medicine in the University of Modena.</li>
<li>In 1817 there was a typhus epidemic and Ruffini continued to treat his patients until he caught the disease himself.</li>
<li>There are further aspects of Ruffini's work which should be mentioned.</li>
<li>Given the information in this article about the insolubility of the quintic, it is reasonable to ask why Abel has been credited with proving the theorem while Ruffini has not.</li>
<li>Then, too, the method of permutations was too exotic and, it must be conceeded, Ruffini's early account is not easy to follow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 22 September 1765, Valentano, Papal States (now Italy). Died 10 May 1822, Modena, Duchy of Modena (now Italy).</p>
