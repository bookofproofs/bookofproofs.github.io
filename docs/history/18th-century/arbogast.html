<p><strong>Louis Arbogast</strong> was a French mathematician who worked on the calculus of derivatives and the operational calculus.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>From this time on information on Arbogast becomes more plentiful.</li>
<li>While at the Collège de Colmar Arbogast entered a mathematical competition which was run by the St Petersburg Academy.</li>
<li>Arbogast submitted an essay to the St Petersburg Academy in which he came down firmly on the side of Euler.</li>
<li>Arbogast won the prize with his essay and his notion of discontinuous function became important in Cauchy's more rigorous approach to analysis.</li>
<li>In 1789 Arbogast moved from Colmar to Strasbourg where he taught mathematics at the École d'Artillerie.</li>
<li>Arbogast's career in Strasbourg reached new heights.</li>
<li>The formal algebraic manipulation of series investigated by Lagrange and Laplace in the 1770s was put in the form of operator equalities by Arbogast in 1800 in Calcul des dérivations.</li>
<li>Arbogast was interested in the history of mathematics and classified Mersenne's papers and collected manuscript copies of memoirs and letters of Fermat, Descartes, Johann Bernoulli, Varignon, de L'Hôpital and others.</li>
<li>Arbogast was friendly with François Français and together they worked on the calculus of derivations and the operational calculus.</li>
<li>After Arbogast died in 1803, François Français inherited his collection of manuscripts, and also his mathematical papers.</li>
<li>He continued Arbogast's work on the operational calculus and presented a memoir on this topic, in particular applying the methods to study projectiles in a resistant medium, to the Académie des Sciences in 1804.</li>
<li>The historical manuscripts which went to François Français on Arbogast's death were bought by Libri from a bookseller in Metz in 1839.</li>
<li>We should mention one other important contribution made by Arbogast.</li>
<li>Arbogast was elected to the Académie des Sciences in 1792 and the mathematics section of the Institut National in 1796.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 4 October 1759, Mutzig, Alsace. Died 18 April 1803, Strasbourg, France.</p>
