<h1>Person: Biot, Jean Baptiste</h1>

<p><strong>Jean-Baptiste Biot</strong> was a French mathematician who worked in astronomy, elasticity, electricity and magnetism, heat, optics and geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jean-Baptiste was educated at the college of Louis-le-Grand in Paris, where he specialised in classics.</li>
<li>His job there consisted of copying vast numbers of letters (we have to be thankful for photocopiers!) which bored Biot so much that he volunteered for the army.</li>
<li>After the battle Biot, suffering from an illness, decided to leave the army and return to his parents.</li>
<li>He took Biot in his carriage to Paris where he (Biot) was arrested as a deserter (he was still in uniform) and brought before a revolutionary committee.</li>
<li>This would have had serious consequences for Biot had not the stranger intervened and he was set free.</li>
<li>Despite Biot's efforts, he was not able to identify the important stranger and thank him.</li>
<li>It took Biot some months to recover from the illness during which time he continued with his studies of mathematics.</li>
<li>The École Polytechnique was founded later in 1794 (actually named 'École centrale des travaux publics' for its first year) and Biot transferred there in November of that year.</li>
<li>Gaspard Monge, one of the founders of l'École Polytechnique who taught the first intake of students, quickly realised Biot's potential.</li>
<li>There was an attempted insurrection by the royalists against the Convention and Biot took part.</li>
<li>He had found a patron in Sylvestre-François Lacroix who was highly influential in helping Biot develop his career.</li>
<li>It might seems remarkable that even someone as able as Biot could move from being an undergraduate straight into a professorship.</li>
<li>Biot taught Gabrielle mathematics and physics so that she might translate into French a German text by Ernst Gottfried Fischer.</li>
<li>It was Claude Louis Berthollet who had asked Biot to make the translation which was published as Physique mécanique Ⓣ(Mechanical Physics) in 1806.</li>
<li>However, in line with the practice of the time, the book records Biot himself as the translator rather than his wife.</li>
<li>It was largely through Lacroix that Biot had been appointed at Beauvais and Lacroix advised him frequently through the first years that he worked there.</li>
<li>In fact in late 1799 Biot approached Laplace, who had taught him at l'École Polytechnique, and offered to proof-read the Mécanique céleste Ⓣ(Celestial mechanics) which at that time was with the publisher.</li>
<li>Biot was, by this time, an entrance examiner at the École Polytechnique so was frequently in Paris.</li>
<li>Certainly the effort required by Biot was enormous.</li>
<li>Laplace was also interested in the research on mathematics which Biot was undertaking and gave him advice both on the material and on getting it published.</li>
<li>In 1800 Biot was elected an associate to the First Class of the Institute, replacing Jean Montucla who died in December 1799.</li>
<li>Again Laplace's support was important to Biot in this election.</li>
<li>Although Biot had produced excellent mathematics memoirs in the years up to 1800, he had concentrated on experimental physics from that time on.</li>
<li>The first balloon ascent made for scientific purposes was by Biot and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac from the garden of the Conservatoire des Arts on 24 August 1804.</li>
<li>In 1806, again with the support of Laplace, Biot was appointed as an assistant astronomer at the Bureau de Longitudes in addition to his other roles.</li>
<li>Biot and Arago must have looked extremely suspicious; two Frenchmen with sophisticated measuring instruments working on Spanish territory.</li>
<li>Biot fled back to France immediately.</li>
<li>Both Mathieu and Biot received a prize from the Académie des Sciences in 1809 for this highly accurate work, and in 1812 they received a second prize from the Academy for their achievements.</li>
<li>In 1809 Biot was appointed Professor of Physical Astronomy at the Faculty of Sciences.</li>
<li>Biot studied a wide range of mathematical topics, mostly on the applied mathematics side.</li>
<li>Biot, together with Felix Savart, discovered that the intensity of the magnetic field set up by a current flowing through a wire varies inversely with the distance from the wire.</li>
<li>This is now known as Biot-Savart's Law and is fundamental to modern electromagnetic theory.</li>
<li>Light was the topic on which Biot devoted most time, making the major discovery of the laws of rotary polarization by crystalline bodies.</li>
<li>Arago supported the Daguerre photographic process with silver plates while Biot championed an approach with paper soaked in a silver solution as developed by Henry Fox Talbot.</li>
<li>Biot also believed that the photographic process should be one reserved for scientific use and not made available for public use.</li>
<li>There was a period of collaboration between Biot and Talbot, the two exchanging letters frequently.</li>
<li>Basically the photographic process became another tool for Biot to use in his investigations of light which had always been a major interest to him.</li>
<li>As well as interests in almost every branch of science, Biot was interested in the history of the subject.</li>
<li>In addition to the honours we mentioned above, Biot was also honoured by being made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1814 and Commander in 1849.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 21 April 1774, Paris, France. Died 3 February 1862, Paris, France.</p>
