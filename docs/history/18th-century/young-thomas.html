<p><strong>Thomas Young</strong> was an English mathematician and physicist best known for <em>Young's modulus</em> and his work on interference.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>As a young boy, he did not find school very stimulating.</li>
<li>In 1782 he entered a school in Crompton, Dorset, which was more suitable for a young genius since pupils were given more freedom to progress at their own pace.</li>
<li>For Young this pace was very fast, for he was undoubtedly an infant prodigy.</li>
<li>Although only thirteen years old, Young now became a tutor to Hudson Gurney, the twelve year old grandson of David Barcley who lived in a country house near Ware in Hertfordshire.</li>
<li>Young spent five years to 1792 working in the country house or at Barcley's London home.</li>
<li>Young was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 19 June 1794.</li>
<li>Young continued his medical training, entering the University of Edinburgh in 1794.</li>
<li>After submitting a dissertation, Young was given an oral examination and passed on 30 April 1796.</li>
<li>The dissertation used Young's expertise in anatomy, language and sound.</li>
<li>Although enrolled in the medical course, Young did not study medicine at Cambridge, feeling that he already knew sufficient of that subject.</li>
<li>The Cambridge men thought little of Young in return.</li>
<li>Also in 1804 Young was made foreign secretary to the Royal Society of London, a post he filled for the rest of his life.</li>
<li>In 1807 Young published A course of lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts.</li>
<li>The book also contained a mechanics lecture dealing with elasticity where Young's modulus is introduced for the first time.</li>
<li>Young built up his medical practice but, although he was talented as a doctor, he had little of the manner that patients sought, so he did not have a great deal of success.</li>
<li>There is yet another side to Young's broad range of activities to which as yet we have made no mention.</li>
<li>The credit for deciphering hieroglyphic eventually went to the French linguist Champollion, but he benefited greatly from Young's efforts and the two corresponded at great length.</li>
<li>In the end national rivalry prevented Champollion giving Young the credit that he deserved.</li>
<li>However, it was Young who made the major contribution to deciphering demotic script.</li>
<li>In 1816 Arago visited Young to discuss Fresnel's experiments on the wave theory of light.</li>
<li>In the following year Young visited Paris and was welcomed by Arago to the Institute.</li>
<li>For someone as talented as Young, he received relatively few honours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 13 June 1773, Milverton, Somerset, England. Died 10 May 1829, London, England.</p>
