<p><strong>Christoph Gudermann</strong> worked on geometry and special functions. He taught Weierstrass.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Christoph was academically able in his schooling so, as many able boys at this time did, it was intended that he should train to became a priest.</li>
<li>Gudermann then followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a school teacher.</li>
<li>Gudermann worked almost exclusively on spherical geometry and special functions but he is not remembered for any original mathematical results in these areas.</li>
<li>For this reason and because of its constant curvature there exist many similarities between spherical geometry and plane geometry; yet at the same time Gudermann considered more interesting the study of cases where the similarity no longer holds.</li>
<li>In his more extensive work on the theory of special functions Gudermann published several papers beginning in 1830 which extended work which was developed by Euler, Landen, Legendre, Abel and Jacobi.</li>
<li>Gudermann is best known, however, as the teacher of Weierstrass between 1839 and 1841 while Weierstrass worked for his secondary school teacher's certificate.</li>
<li>Gudermann, at this time, was particularly interested in the theory of elliptic functions and in the expansion of functions by power series.</li>
<li>Not only did Gudermann undertake research in the theory of elliptic functions but he was one of the first to teach the topic.</li>
<li>Weierstrass spent the academic year 1839-1840 taking Gudermann's course on elliptic functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 March 1798, Vienenburg (near Hildesheim), Germany. Died 25 September 1852, Münster, Germany.</p>
