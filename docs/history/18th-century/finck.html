<h1>Person: Finck, Pierre-Joseph-Étienne</h1>

<p><strong>Pierre-Joseph-Étienne Finck</strong> wrote books on algebra, mechanics, geometry and analysis.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Finck was then adopted and brought up in the town of Landau in der Pfalz.</li>
<li>Finck entered the École Polytechnique in 1815, in sixth place in the ranking of students admitted that year.</li>
<li>The work of the Artillery School did not interest Finck and, in March 1818, he requested that he be allowed to enter the cavalry regiment of the Royal Guard.</li>
<li>Finck tried again with his request in July of the same year, this time saying that if he was not allowed the move he would resign.</li>
<li>His request was turned down and Finck resigned.</li>
<li>However, by March 1819 Finck seems to have decided that his actions had been mistaken since he wrote asking to be readmitted to the Artillery School.</li>
<li>This request was also turned down: Finck was clearly not very highly regarded at the Artillery School.</li>
<li>Returning to university, Finck entered the University of Strasbourg in 1821 studying mathematics in the Faculty of Science.</li>
<li>Before completing his doctoral work, Finck began teaching mathematics at the Artillery School of Strasbourg in 1825, which does have a certain irony after his own experiences as a student at Artillery School.</li>
<li>In 1842 Finck was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the University of Strasbourg.</li>
<li>Finck wrote over 20 papers and seven textbooks on mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 October 1797, Lauterbourg, France. Died 27 July 1870, Strasbourg, France.</p>
