<p><strong>Benjamin Gompertz</strong>  was an English self-educated mathematician and actuary, who is best known for his "law of mortality".</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Benjamin was self educated, learning mathematics by reading Newton and Maclaurin.</li>
<li>Gompertz himself joined the stock exchange in 1810 and he became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1819.</li>
<li>Gompertz applied the calculus to actuarial questions and he is best remembered for Gompertz's Law of Mortality.</li>
<li>Hence, when death rates are plotted on a logarithmic scale, a straight line known as the Gompertz function is obtained.</li>
<li>The slope of the Gompertz function line indicates the rate of actuarial ageing.</li>
<li>The differences in longevity between species are the result primarily of differences in the rate of ageing and are therefore expressed in differences in slope of the Gompertz function.</li>
<li>Gompertz also wrote about scientific instruments, writing Theory of astronomical instruments (1822), A new instrument called the differential sextant (1825) and On the converted pendulum (1829).</li>
<li>Gompertz assisted Baily in calculating positions of stars which was eventually published as Baily's Catalogue giving the constants for 3000 fixed stars.</li>
<li>Gompertz was a founder member of the Royal Statistical Society in 1834.</li>
<li>It was decided at this meeting that the Society would publish a journal, the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, and Gompertz began work on a paper which he intended to submit for publication.</li>
<li>Tables of lives and tables of stars were generated by the same qualities and both represented a rationalizing spirit which informed the social philosophy of Gompertz and his friends ...</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 March 1779, London, England. Died 14 July 1865, London, England.</p>
