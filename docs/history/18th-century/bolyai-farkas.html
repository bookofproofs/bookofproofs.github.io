<h1>Person: Bolyai, Farkas</h1>
<p><img alt="Bolyai_Farkas.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Bolyai_Farkas.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Farkas Bolyai</strong> was a mathematics teacher, best known as the father of János Bolyai.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>When Farkas was born Nagyszeben was the military centre of Transylvania and the capital of the region.</li>
<li>This meant that Bolyai was now treated as a member of one of the leading families in the country, and he became not only a tutor to Simon but a close friend.</li>
<li>In 1790 Bolyai and his pupil both entered the Calvinist College in Kolozsvár where they spent five years.</li>
<li>The time spent in Kolozsvár was important for Bolyai's development.</li>
<li>This meant that Bolyai was presented with its fundamental idea that reason was the route to understanding the universe and to improving the position of man.</li>
<li>There was an increasing resentment against the Habsburgs, particularly from the workers, and Bolyai too felt support for Hungarian culture, language, and nationality.</li>
<li>The professor of philosophy at the College in Kolozsvár was an impressive person, and he tried to turn Bolyai against mathematics and towards religious philosophy.</li>
<li>Bolyai on the other hand had wide ranging interests, science, mathematics, and literature all interested him and in 1795 after leaving the College he spent a few weeks considering a career as an actor.</li>
<li>First they reached Jena where Bolyai for the first time began to study mathematics systematically.</li>
<li>After six months in Jena Bolyai and Kemény went to Göttingen.</li>
<li>This was the time when one could say that Bolyai really became a mathematician.</li>
<li>Bolyai taught mathematics, physics and chemistry at Marosvásárhely for the rest of his life.</li>
<li>Life was not easy for Bolyai in Marosvásárhely.</li>
<li>Mathematics, the subject which Farkas Bolyai loved, was relegated to something to do for relaxation.</li>
<li>Through all these difficult years Bolyai was working on the Tentamen, his mathematical masterpiece published in 1832.</li>
<li>All his life Bolyai was interested in the foundations of geometry and the parallel axiom.</li>
<li>The Tentamen is built on Bolyai's belief that mathematics consists of arithmetic and geometry with arithmetic as the mathematics of time and geometry as the mathematics of space.</li>
<li>The problem which had perplexed Bolyai most in his study of mathematics had been the independence of Euclid's Fifth postulate.</li>
<li>There are other ideas in the Tentamen which show the quality of Bolyai as a mathematician.</li>
<li>At first Farkas Bolyai was not enthusiastic but certainly by 1830 he had become enthusiastic for at this stage he persuaded János to write up his discoveries.</li>
<li>Bolyai retired from his teaching in 1851 and after a number of strokes, died five years later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 9 February 1775, Bolya (near Nagyszeben), Transylvania, Hungary (now Sibiu, Romania). Died 20 November 1856, Marosvásárhely, Transylvania, Hungary (now Târgu-Mureș, Romania).</p>
