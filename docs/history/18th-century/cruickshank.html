<h1>Person: Cruickshank, John</h1>

<p><strong>John Cruickshank</strong> was a Scottish mathematician who reformed both the mathematics teaching and the degree structure at Marischal College, Aberdeen.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>John Cruickshank's first teacher at the local school was Margaret Brown.</li>
<li>It is highly likely that John would have heard about his teacher's famous relation and his fame as a lecturer and inventor of astronomical instruments.</li>
<li>Certainly John became interested in astronomy and, sent to work as a herd boy, he spent the nights watching the sky and observing the motions of the planets.</li>
<li>Two of the pupils that Cruickshank taught in the parish school at Ordiquhill were his cousins John and William Ogilvie.</li>
<li>John Ogilvie is, however, famed as a lexicographer publishing The Imperial Dictionary (1850-51), one of the most popular dictionaries of its day.</li>
<li>Returning to the life of John Cruickshank, after attending the parish school at Ordiquhill, he studied for a short time at the Grange school.</li>
<li>After graduating with his M.A., Cruickshank worked as a teacher at Boharm, and as a tutor at Haddo and then at Netherdale.</li>
<li>In 1817 Hamilton and Copland exchanged chairs and, on 9 July 1817, Cruickshank was appointed as "assistant and successor to Professor Hamilton", now the Professor of Mathematics.</li>
<li>Although Cruickshank was appointed as Hamilton's successor, in fact it was not until 1824 that Hamilton retired completely from teaching.</li>
<li>Once Cruickshank was secure in his position as Professor of Mathematics at Marischal College he was able to marry Janet Mitchell (22 July 1789 - 24 April 1879).</li>
<li>No more worthily-won distinction did his Alma Mater ever confer than when it made him LL.D. Few men knew so much, and fewer still made a better use of what they had than Dr Cruickshank.</li>
<li>The trust was further augmented on Anne Cruickshank's death to support several other University institutions including a lectureship in Astronomy, the Science Library and a prize in the Faculty of Law.</li>
<li>Cruickshank became involved with a Scottish trigonometrical survey and in particular with the Belhelvie baseline.</li>
<li>Another visitor to the measuring site was John Cruickshank, a former pupil of Copland who was later to occupy Copland's chair of mathematics at Marischal College.</li>
<li>In a short biography of Cruickshank there is an account of Colby's work at Belhelvie as observed by Cruickshank.</li>
<li>It would appear that the matter was not attended to immediately but was taken up again by John Cruickshank in 1820.</li>
<li>From 1848 the first three books of Euclid and elementary algebra became a prerequisite for the first mathematical class, enabling Cruickshank to introduce Leibniz' differential and integral calculus, which had replaced fluxions, in his second class.</li>
<li>Cruickshank corresponded with John Herschel and letters of 1843 and 1847 are extant.</li>
<li>James Clerk Maxwell was appointed as Professor of Natural Philosophy at Marischal College in 1856 and he and Cruickshank were colleagues for four years.</li>
<li>Cruickshank was 73, and the senior Professor of Mathematics, but he chose to retire at this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 5 July 1787, Milltown of Rothiemay, Moray, Scotland. Died 16 November 1875, Aberdeen, Scotland.</p>
