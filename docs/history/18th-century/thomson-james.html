<p><strong>James Thomson</strong> campaigned to reform Glasgow University. He wrote many textbooks. He was the father of Lord Kelvin.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thomson showed his mathematical skills and interests at a young age.</li>
<li>However events of the time were to create a strong impression on the young Thomson which greatly affected his outlook on life.</li>
<li>Two years later, in 1800, Thomson attended a new school opened by a secessionist Presbyterian minister Dr Edgar to train young men for the ministry.</li>
<li>Thomson's first appointment was to the school department where he taught arithmetic, geography, and bookkeeping for a year before moving to the college department where he became professor of mathematics.</li>
<li>The second son, born in 1824, is the famous William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin.</li>
<li>Two years after taking up the professorship his two sons James (then twelve years old) and William (then ten years old) began their university studies at Glasgow.</li>
<li>These two young men turned out to be Thomson's most talented mathematics students.</li>
<li>Thomson arrived in Glasgow in 1832 just after a cholera epidemic had passed but it was a second cholera epidemic in 1848 which took his life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 13 November 1786, Annaghmore, near Ballynahinch, Co. Down, Ireland. Died 12 January 1849, Glasgow, Scotland.</p>
