<p><strong>William Spence</strong> was a Scottish mathematician who worked on logarithmic functions.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the summer, together with his friends, Spence went fishing or looking for birds' nests.</li>
<li>As he grew up Spence turned from reading adventure stories to reading biography and history.</li>
<li>Eventually Spence gave up learning business skills and devoted himself entirely to the study of science.</li>
<li>The essays of William Spence were very astronomical, we thought them profound; they were all about planets and comets, the cosmogony of the earth, the infinite divisibility of matter, and the boundless of nature, premundane space; any thing of this world was too gross to enter into his speculative theories.</li>
<li>In 1805, in the company of his school friend James Park, Spence visited many places in England, spending some time with Galt, who was at that time living in London.</li>
<li>In 1808 Spence was again in London, and during the several months that he lived there, he published An Essay on the various Orders of logarithmic Transcendents; with an Inquiry into their Applications to the Integral Calculus, and the Summation of Series.</li>
<li>Spence gave the results to nine decimal places and we note that he did not round off his tables.</li>
<li>The first comprehensive detailed study of the function is the essay of Spence (1809), which was generally not referenced on the continent for several decades.</li>
<li>It is clear that Spence must have read Lagrange's 1770 paper Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations for he tries to make a systematic approach to solving equations of degree 2, 3 and 4 using symmetrical functions of the roots as does Lagrange.</li>
<li>This makes it sound as if Spence follows Lagrange rather closely but this is certainly not the case for he gives his own approach to solving these equations.</li>
<li>However Spence was taken ill at Glasgow, and died in the inn in which they had put up for the night.</li>
<li>After Spence died, John Herschel edited Mathematical Essays by the late William Spence which was published by Oliver and Boyd in Edinburgh in 1819.</li>
<li>The others were selected from Mr Spence's papers by the editor, J F W Herschel, Esq., who was pre-eminently qualified to judge the respective merits of the several pieces.</li>
<li>These papers clearly prove, that Mr Spence possessed both genius and industry in a high degree, and a force of intellect of a very superior kind.</li>
<li>Finally we should record Spence's musical abilities.</li>
<li>A few years after his death, a Marble Tablet bearing an inscription written by Galt, was erected to Spence's memory by several of his friends in the Middle Parish Church in Greenock.</li>
<li>The Spence library in Greenock was founded by Spence's widow and contains his books.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 31 July 1777, Greenock, Scotland. Died 22 May 1815, Glasgow, Scotland.</p>
