<p><strong>Francis Maseres</strong> was an English mathematician who wrote some influential text-books.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Peter Maseres was a doctor who first lived in Broad Street, Soho, London but then moved to Rathbourne Place.</li>
<li>Francis attended the Rev Richard Wooddeson's School in Kingston-upon-Thames before matriculating at Clare College, Cambridge, on 4 July 1748.</li>
<li>Francis was ranked as fourth wrangler meaning that he was fourth out of the students awarded a first class degree.</li>
<li>Francis was awarded the first chancellor's classical medal which was presented to him by the Duke of Newcastle.</li>
<li>In 1750 Maseres entered the Inner Temple meaning he was training to join the legal profession.</li>
<li>Maseres wrote many mathematical works which show a complete lack of creative ability.</li>
<li>It is probable that Maseres rejected all mathematics which he could not understand.</li>
<li>Maseres had an unfortunate influence on the teaching of algebra in Britain for several decades.</li>
<li>Of the reprints that Maseres made at his own expense, the most significant is the "Scriptores logarithmici" (1791-1807), six volumes devoted to the subject of logarithms, including works of Kepler, Napier, Snell, and others, interspersed with original tracts on related subjects.</li>
<li>Presumably a number of authors were indebted to Maseres for financial assistance of this sort.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 December 1731, London, England. Died 19 May 1824, Reigate, Surrey, England.</p>
