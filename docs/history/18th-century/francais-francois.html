<p><strong>François Français</strong> was one of a pair of French mathematical brothers who worked on partial differential equations.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The brothers were the children of Jacques Frédéric Français, who was a grocer in Saverne, and Maria Barbara Steib.</li>
<li>In 1789 François became a seminarist, that is a student in an institution for training candidates for the priesthood.</li>
<li>Political events produced an interlude in Français' career.</li>
<li>Français joined the government army in May 1793 which was moving to put down the rebellion.</li>
<li>Français continued to fight with the government forces and as the autumn approached they became a more cohesive force under a single command and heavily defeated the rebel army (by this time numbering around 65000) in October.</li>
<li>Français, however, left the government army in October and returned to teaching.</li>
<li>The period of army life must have been attractive to Français for he quickly rejoined the army as an officer and served for a further four years until October 1797 when he was appointed professor of mathematics at the École Centrale du Haut-Rhin in Colmar.</li>
<li>Français never seemed to be one to stay in any one post for long but this appointment in Colmar lasted longer than any of his others.</li>
<li>Much of François Français's work was published after his death by his brother who added to it in a way to make the contribution of each hard to distinguish.</li>
<li>François worked on partial differential equations and his memoir of 1795 on this topic was developed further and presented to the Académie des Sciences in 1797.</li>
<li>Lacroix praised Français' work and described it as making a major contribution to the study of partial differential equations; however, it was not published.</li>
<li>Français was friendly with Arbogast and together they worked on the calculus of derivations.</li>
<li>After Arbogast died in 1803, Français inherited his mathematical papers and continued to work on the calculus of derivations.</li>
<li>After this Français did work which was praised by Legendre, Lagrange, Lacroix and Biot but submitted no further memoirs during his lifetime.</li>
<li>However, as described above, his brother published much of his work after his death, publishing four memoirs of François Français's work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 7 April 1768, Saverne, Bas-Rhin, France. Died 30 October 1810, Mainz, Germany.</p>
