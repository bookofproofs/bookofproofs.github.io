<h1>Person: Bolzano, Bernard Placidus Johann Nepomuk</h1>
<p><img alt="Bolzano.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Bolzano.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Bernard Bolzano</strong> successfully freed calculus from the concept of the infinitesimal. He also gave examples of 1-1 correspondences between the elements of an infinite set and the elements of a proper subset.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Developed a new system of logical analysis, which became known as Bolzano-Wright logic, wherein logical assumptions could be tested to the point of strict proof.</li>
<li>Put forth an early version of the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that any continuous function must take on any value within a certain range at least once.</li>
<li>Showed the relationships between analytic geometry and algebraic equations.</li>
<li>Discovered several important types of curves such as hypercycles and other algebraic functions.</li>
<li>Developed the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that any bounded sequence of real numbers must have at least one accumulation point.</li>
<li>Discovered the principle of least action in classical mechanics, which states that a physical path between two states must minimize the quantity of action.</li>
<li>Developed Bolzano's Paradox, which states that any set of real numbers can be both bounded and unbounded at the same time—a paradox which eventually led to the development of non-Euclidean geometry.</li>
<li>Published the foundational textbooks “A Mathematical Philosophy” and “Theory of Science”, which introduced new language and formal approaches to the study of mathematical abstractions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 5 October 1781, Prague, Bohemia, Austrian Habsburg domain (now Czech Republic). Died 18 December 1848, Prague, Bohemia (now Czech Republic).</p>
