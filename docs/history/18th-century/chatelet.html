<p><strong>Émilie du Châtelet</strong> was a French noblewoman who became important to mathematics as the translator of Newton's <em>Principia</em>.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Before her marriage her name was Gabrielle-Émilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil and she was called Gabrielle-Émilie by her family but later she was called simply Émilie by Voltaire and others.</li>
<li>We should also note that her husband was the Marquis du Chastellet and her publications appear under the name Madame la Marquis du Chastellet.</li>
<li>The spelling "Châtelet" was introduced by Voltaire and has now become standard.</li>
<li>In this biography we will call her "Émilie" up to the time of her marriage, and from then "du Châtelet".</li>
<li>Émilie's father was Louis Nicolas Le Tonnelier de Breteuil.</li>
<li>His second wife, Gabrielle Anne de Froulay who was Émilie's mother, was brought up in a convent.</li>
<li>Le Tonnelier de Breteuil lived there with his wife and five children, one being Émilie who was about nine years old when they moved in.</li>
<li>It is rather remarkable that, in addition to the academic lessons provided by private tutors, Émilie was given lessons in fencing, riding, and gymnastics.</li>
<li>One might also wonder why she studied mathematics but this must be due at least in part to the fact that M de Mézières, a family friend, encouraged her.</li>
<li>Every night Émilie's parents entertained guests in their Paris house and she would have seen mathematicians like Bernard de Fontenelle there frequently.</li>
<li>Most of all, however, mathematics was a subject Émilie loved.</li>
<li>When she was sixteen years old Émilie was introduced to the Court at Versailles by her father.</li>
<li>After the marriage du Châtelet spent time in Semur-en-Auxois but she also lived in Paris and a number of other places.</li>
<li>Her husband spent most of his time on garrison duties which meant that he spent long periods away from his wife.</li>
<li>Du Châtelet's father died in 1728 and after that she made a number of visits to her mother at Créteil.</li>
<li>Before this, however, du Châtelet had met Voltaire.</li>
<li>Voltaire first met du Châtelet while she was still a child for he had been one of the many guests at their parents dinner parties.</li>
<li>They met again on one of the first occasions that du Châtelet went out after the birth of her second son.</li>
<li>How could a woman like du Châtelet participate in scientific discussions?</li>
<li>Du Châtelet, however, was prevented from entering on the grounds that women were not admitted but she was not one to allow convention to dictate what she might do.</li>
<li>In May 1734 Voltaire and du Châtelet attended the wedding of the Duc de Richelieu (who had been another of du Châtelet's lovers).</li>
<li>After that he went to live at Cirey, which was the remote house owned by du Châtelet's husband.</li>
<li>It was the marquise Du Châtelet, the woman who in all France had the greatest disposition for all the sciences.</li>
<li>Du Châtelet's husband does not seem to have been unhappy at this arrangement, for he certainly benefited from Voltaire spending large amounts of money improving the house and estate, and frequently the three were at Cirey together.</li>
<li>Soon du Châtelet was putting her mathematical knowledge to use although she continued to have mathematical tuition from experts.</li>
<li>It was a work which appeared under Voltaire's name in 1738 but one which he states clearly in the Preface was written jointly with du Châtelet.</li>
<li>Other work undertaken by du Châtelet was a translation of Mandeville's The fable of the bees which is a rather strange work on morals.</li>
<li>Let the reader ponder why, at no time in the course of so many centuries, a good tragedy, a good poem, a respected tale, a fine painting, a good book on physics has ever been produced by a woman.</li>
<li>Why these creatures whose understanding appears in every way similar to that of men, seem to be stopped by some irresistible force, but until they do, women will have reason to protest against their education.</li>
<li>Both Voltaire and du Châtelet submitted entries, although du Châtelet did not tell Voltaire until after the winners were announced that she had submitted an entry.</li>
<li>Although neither won, the prize was won by Euler, Du Châtelet's Dissertation sur la nature et la propagation du feu Ⓣ(Dissertation on the nature and spread of fire) was published by the Académie in 1744 along with the submissions of Voltaire and the winning entries.</li>
<li>In 1739 Voltaire and du Châtelet travelled to Brussels where they wanted to settle a law suit regarding some property of du Châtelet's husband.</li>
<li>Du Châtelet worked on a book, Institutions de physique Ⓣ(Physics Institutions) while on this trip and it was published in 1740.</li>
<li>Publication of Institutions de physique Ⓣ(Physics Institutions) led to a disagreement between du Châtelet and Samuel König who seems to have felt that the work was his.</li>
<li>Du Châtelet had learnt of Leibniz's philosophy from Samuel König and it had so interested her that she had decided to devote a section of her book to his theories of metaphysics.</li>
<li>To an extent, therefore, König was right for du Châtelet knew little of Leibniz's ideas before he taught her.</li>
<li>Du Châtelet's major work was a translation of Newton's Principia .</li>
<li>Mme du Châtelet based this part on the ideas of Clairaut.</li>
<li>Du Châtelet died in child birth at the court of the Duke of Lorraine.</li>
<li>It seemed for a few days that du Châtelet's fear that she would die would not be realised.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 17 December 1706, Paris, France. Died 10 September 1749, Lunéville, France.</p>
