<h1>Person: Chongzhi, Zu</h1>

<p><strong>Zu Chongzhi</strong> was a Chinese mathematician and astronomer. He introduced the approximation $\frac{355}{113}$ to $\pi$ which is correct to 6 decimal places.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Zu learnt other skills too for he excelled in engineering and was skilled in literary composition writing ten novels.</li>
<li>During this time Zu worked on mathematics and astronomy.</li>
<li>Zu, however, had an opponent at the court as far as his calendar was concerned.</li>
<li>Despite having such a powerful opponent as Tai Faxin, Zu won approval for his calendar from Emperor Xiao-wu and the Tam-ing calendar was due to come into use in 464.</li>
<li>Zu left the imperial service on the death of Emperor Xiao-wu and devoted himself entirely to his scientific studies.</li>
<li>Having accurate knowledge of the lengths of the year and the month were necessary, but it is still not clear how Zu translated this into a cycle of 391 years.</li>
<li>But Zu would know how to reduce fractions to their lowest terms by dividing top and bottom by the greatest common divisor.</li>
<li>Before we leave our discussion of Zu's astronomical work we give further details of his work in this area.</li>
<li>Zu's calculations of the length of the year were well within the range that allowed him to differentiate between the tropical and sidereal year.</li>
<li>Jupiter takes about 12 years to complete its orbit but Zu was able to give a much more accurate value than that.</li>
<li>Sadly Zu Chongzhi's book is lost.</li>
<li>To compute this accuracy for π, Zu must have used an inscribed regular 24,576-gon and undertaken the extremely lengthy calculations, involving hundereds of square roots, all to 9 decimal place accuracy.</li>
<li>However, given that Zu's work was considered very difficult and advanced, it is doubtful that it was found by a lucky numerical accident.</li>
<li>In the latter part of his life Zu Chongzhi collaborated with his son, Zu Geng (or Zu Xuan), who was also an outstanding mathematician.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 429, Jiankang, (now Nanjing, Kiangsu province), China. Died 501, China.</p>
