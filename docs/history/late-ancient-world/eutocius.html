<h1>Person: Eutocius Of Ascalon</h1>

<p><strong>Eutocius</strong> was a Greek mathematician who wrote commentaries on works of Archimedes and Apollonius.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eutocius wrote commentaries on three works of Archimedes.</li>
<li>From this it was thought that Eutocius was a pupil of Isidorus and his dates were deduced from this information.</li>
<li>However, further investigation showed that this contradicted other information such the dedications that Eutocius makes in some of his other works.</li>
<li>It was then realised that the comment at the end of Eutocius's commentary to Archimedes' On the Sphere and Cylinder was inserted by a later editor of the work who was indeed a pupil of Isidorus of Miletus.</li>
<li>It is thought that the first of Eutocius's commentaries on Archimedes was written around 510.</li>
<li>Ascalon, where Eutocius was born, had a long history and is mentioned in the Old Testament as Askelon.</li>
<li>It seems likely that Eutocius left Ascalon and went to Alexandria to study.</li>
<li>Certainly this reads as if Eutocius is addressing his teacher and Paul Tannery's deduction seems secure.</li>
<li>One has to assume that indeed Ammonius did approve, for Eutocius went on to write commentaries on other works by Archimedes, namely Measurement of the circle and On plane equilibria.</li>
<li>Eutocius also edited and wrote commentaries on the first 4 books of the Conics of Apollonius.</li>
<li>One sees immediately that commentators such as Eutocius are very important in the history of mathematics and many important works have only survived due to the work of the commentators.</li>
<li>Eutocius does not appear to have done any original work.</li>
<li>Obviously nothing of real astronomical interest has come down from Eutocius.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 480, Ascalon, Palestine (now Ashqelon, Israel). Died about 540.</p>
