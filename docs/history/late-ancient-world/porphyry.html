<h1>Person: Malchus, Porphyry</h1>
<p><img alt="Porphyry.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Porphyry.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Porphyry Malchus</strong> wrote a commentary on <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/elements-euclid.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Chapter: Euclid&amp;#x27;s “Elements”">Euclid's Elements</a> and a <em>Life of Pythagoras</em>.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Both Porphyry's parents were Syrian and he would only get the nickname Porphyry later in his life as we shall explain below.</li>
<li>As a young man Porphyry tried to gain as broad a knowledge as he possibly could by studying many languages and religions.</li>
<li>At that time Athens was the main centre for learning, so it was natural that someone with a thirst for knowledge as Porphyry had should travel there to continue his studies.</li>
<li>It was Longinus who gave Porphyry that nickname.</li>
<li>In about 263 Porphyry left Athens and went to Rome where he worked with Plotinus, the founder of Neoplatonism.</li>
<li>Porphyry had mixed feelings when he heard the teachings of Plotinus.</li>
<li>However Porphyry was very disappointed in the way that Plotinus expressed himself and he found Plotinus's lectures poorly structured and his arguments rather woolly.</li>
<li>It is not entirely clear why Porphyry left Rome but there does seem to have been disputes over doctrine between the philosophers who formed Plotinus's circle.</li>
<li>Porphyry went to Sicily where he wrote a text bringing the philosophies of Aristotle and Plato together.</li>
<li>Porphyry had a strong respect for the views of Aristotle and further work by Porphyry at this time led to a revival in studies of the works of Aristotle.</li>
<li>It would appear that Porphyry's views on Aristotle had something to do with the disputes in Plotinus's school which had led to the break-up.</li>
<li>Also while Porphyry was in Sicily, he wrote a work on vegetarianism and a critical work against Christian doctrines.</li>
<li>Porphyry did not break his links with Plotinus, however, and he continued to correspond with him on presenting his views in the most coherent fashion.</li>
<li>Despite the fact that Porphyry's views were not completely at one with those of Plotinus, this description by Heath is a fair one.</li>
<li>Porphyry certainly did go on to edit the works of Plotinus, for he returned to Rome in about 282 (which was about 12 years after Plotinus died).</li>
<li>Also while in Rome Porphyry taught Iamblichus who was another important developer of Neoplatonism.</li>
<li>However, Iamblichus developed his views away from those of Plotinus and soon found himself disagreeing with Porphyry.</li>
<li>We should make some comments as to the importance of Porphyry in the history of mathematics.</li>
<li>Proclus appears to have Porphyry's original comments to hand when he wrote his own commentary.</li>
<li>This is a point on which it is impossible to be certain for there is a slight possibility that all Proclus knew about Porphyry's commentary was what Pappus had written.</li>
<li>Another important contribution made by Porphyry was in writing his Life of Pythagoras.</li>
<li>Certain important fragments of other mathematician's writings have also been preserved in the works of Porphyry including Nicomachus and Eudemus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 233, Tyre (now Sur, Lebanon). Died 309, Rome.</p>
