<h1>Person: Qiujian, Zhang</h1>

<p><strong>Zhang Qiujian</strong> was a Chinese mathematician who wrote the text <em>Zhang Qiujian suanjing</em> (Zhang Qiujian's Mathematical Manual).</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Zhang Qiujian wrote his mathematical text Zhang Qiujian suanjing (Zhang Qiujian's Mathematical Manual) some time between 468 and 486.</li>
<li>No other work by Zhang Qiujian is known, and nothing about its author is known.</li>
<li>Although the dats we give are based on the best available evidence, some authors place Zhang Qiujian 100 years earlier than we have done.</li>
<li>In particular Zhang sees the reduction of fractions to a common denominator as hard.</li>
<li>The method Zhang gives is to find the greatest common divisor of 150, 120 and 90.</li>
<li>Zhang gives the solution by solving a quadratic equation, but his formulae are not particularly accurate.</li>
<li>The method Zhang uses is essentially Gaussian elimination on the matrix of coefficients.</li>
<li>Zhang gives three possible answers.</li>
<li>These are all the possible answers (one would not expect Zhang to come up with 0 cockerels, 25 hens and 75 chickens).</li>
<li>We do not know if Zhang had a systematic method to solve problems of this type or whether he solved them by trial and error.</li>
<li>In 656, after editing by Li Chunfeng, the treatise Zhang Qiujian suanjing (Zhang Qiujian's Mathematical Manual) became a text for the Imperial examinations and it became one of The Ten Classics when reprinted in 1084.</li>
<li>Can we say anything about Zhang himself?</li>
<li>Examples are well chosen to illustrate what Zhang is trying to teach rather than for particularly practical purposes.</li>
<li>We can certainly deduce that Zhang was a fine teacher and may well have had experience in teaching, to be able to write with so much knowledge of how students learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 430, China. Died about 490, China.</p>
