<h1>Person: Heng, Zhang</h1>

<p><strong>Zhang Heng</strong> was a Chinese mathematician, astronomer and geographer. He became chief astrologer and minister under the Emperor An'ti of China.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>At the time of Zhang Heng's birth the Emperor was Chang-ti, the third of the Eastern Han emperors.</li>
<li>Over the years that Zhang Heng grew up, Chinese influence and prestige were growing rapidly and reached their peak in around 90 when he was about 12 years old.</li>
<li>Zhang, who had been born into an important family, was educated in the moral and political philosophy of Confucianism.</li>
<li>We shall give more information below on these aspects of Zhang's achievements as well as examples of his poetry.</li>
<li>Zhang was thirty years old before his interests turned from literature to scientific matters, and at that time he became particularly interested in astronomy.</li>
<li>If China began to suffer due to ambitious people seeking to further their own influence, this was certainly not the case for Zhang.</li>
<li>We will describe below some of Zhang's outstanding scientific achievements.</li>
<li>Zhang wrote the Four Stanzas of Sorrow which is the first seven-syllabic poem which we know of in China.</li>
<li>It was natural therefore that Zhang having become an expert in astronomy should become involved in calendar reform by the year 123.</li>
<li>In 132 Zhang invented the first seismograph for measuring earthquakes.</li>
<li>Zhang's device, which he called Hou Feng Di Dong Yi, was made of copper.</li>
<li>In fact the seismograph detected an earthquake in February of 138 and Zhang reported this fact to the Emperor despite no other evidence of the earthquake being felt in the capital Lo-yang.</li>
<li>Zhang appears to have been the first person in China to construct an equatorial armillary sphere.</li>
<li>With this instrument Zhang was able to make more accurate star maps than earlier Chinese astronomers.</li>
<li>Only the first part of this text by Zhang has survived.</li>
<li>In mathematics Zhang studied 3 by 3 magic squares.</li>
<li>As Mo notes, the significance here is that all earlier attempts to calculate were based on practical measurement, whereas the work by Zhang was based on a theoretical calculation.</li>
<li>Zhang also gave formulae for the volume of a sphere in terms of the volume of the circumscribing cube.</li>
<li>One interesting point to note in some of Zhang's mathematical work is that he leaves square roots as unevaluated.</li>
<li>Some historians believe that Zhang understood the difference between rational and irrational numbers but this seems to be stretching things a bit too far.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born AD 78, Nan-yang, China. Died AD 139, China.</p>
