<h1>Person: Serenus</h1>

<p><strong>Serenus</strong> was a Greek geometer who wrote commentaries on other mathematicians' work as well as proving some geometric theorems of his own.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It can also be deduced from a copy of the second treatise of Serenus which has survived.</li>
<li>Serenus was a commentator on the texts of others but, unlike some commentators, he was a fine mathematician in his own right.</li>
<li>The two treatises by Serenus are On the Section of a Cylinder and On the Section of a Cone both of which have survived.</li>
<li>Serenus shows how to find the cylinder which is cut in the ellipse EEE.</li>
<li>It appears that Peithon's work treated as a bit of a joke and Serenus tries to in these propositions to show that Peithon's ideas are mathematically sound.</li>
<li>In the first 57 propositions in On the Section of a Cone Serenus examined triangular sections of right and scalene cones made by planes passing through the vertex.</li>
<li>Serenus wrote a commentary on Apollonius's Conics unfortunately is lost, except for a fragment preserved by Theon of Smyrna.</li>
<li>That he wrote such a work is confirmed by Serenus in his own writings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 300, Antinopolis, Egypt. Died about 360.</p>
