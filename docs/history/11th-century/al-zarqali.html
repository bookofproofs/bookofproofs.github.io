<h1>Person: Al-Zarqali</h1>
<p><img alt="avatar.png" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/avatar.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Al-Zarkali</strong> was a Spanish  Muslim instrument maker, astrologer and important astronomer. He invented a form of the astrolabe.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Before we give some details of al-Zarqali's life, we need to give some background to al-Andalus, Muslim Spain, in which he grew up.</li>
<li>It was in Córdoba that al-Zarqali grew up.</li>
<li>It was realised that al-Zarqali was not only expert as an instrument maker, but he was also highly intelligent.</li>
<li>We should now look at some of al-Zarqali's accomplishments.</li>
<li>The Spanish Arab Ibrahim ibn Yahya al-Zarqali (Azarquiel) invented a type of astrolabe known in Europe as the azafea (from Arabic al-safiha, plate) ...</li>
<li>These tables contained much copied from earlier tables such as those by al-Khwarizmi, al-Battani and Ptolemy, but they also contained the observations of al-Zarqali and the other members of Qadi ibn Said's large astronomy group which consisted of both Muslim and Jewish scholars.</li>
<li>It is claimed that al-Zarqali observed the sun for twenty-five years and the moon for thirty years.</li>
<li>It is interesting to compare work being carried out in Toledo by al-Zarqali and his group with that being carried out in Esfahan by the group set up there by Omar Khayyam who was about twenty years younger than al-Zarqali.</li>
<li>Let us look at some other of al-Zarqali's achievements.</li>
<li>We know from references in other sources that in this book al-Zarqali details the motion of the solar apogee, giving it a motion of 1° in 279 years.</li>
<li>This is based on an earlier work of the 3rd or 4th century, but has modified data from the observations of al-Zarqali and his colleagues in Toledo.</li>
<li>Al-Zarqali wrote one work on astrology, the main interest in this work being the magic squares which he used to make talismans.</li>
<li>It was here that al-Zarqali suggested that the centre of Mercury's epicycle followed an oval shaped path which he described as 'like a pine nut' in his book on the motion of the seven planets written about 1081.</li>
<li>Barbastro, not far south of the Pyrenees, fell to the Christians in 1063 so the process was going on throughout the time that al-Zarqali led the astronomers of Toledo.</li>
<li>At this time al-Zarqali fled from Toledo and returned to his home town of Córdoba which was further south and still under Muslim control.</li>
<li>Córdoba was controlled by al-Mutamid of Seville who supported al-Zarqali for a few years and he was able to continue his observations with the help of one of his students.</li>
<li>By that time al-Zarqali was no longer supported and it is unlikely that he did any scholarly work during the final ten years of his life.</li>
<li>A look at the references to this article shows at once that al-Zarqali's name and achievements have continued to be kept alive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1029, Córdoba, Spain. Died 15 October 1100, Córdoba, Spain.</p>
