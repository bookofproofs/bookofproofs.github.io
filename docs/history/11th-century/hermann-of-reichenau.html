<p><img alt="Hermann_of_Reichenau.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Hermann_of_Reichenau.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Hermann of Reichenau</strong> was a German mathematician who important for the transmission of Arabic mathematics, astronomy and scientific instruments into central Europe.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>He wrote a famous biography of the founder of trigonometry, Hipparchus, which became the world's most authoritative source for the study of trigonometry.</li>
<li>He was the first to recognize the importance of the zero numeral, necessary for the development of modern mathematics.</li>
<li>He also recognized and coined the mathematical term ratio.</li>
<li>He discovered and is credited with the rule of four, a mathematical principle which greatly simplified calculations.</li>
<li>He wrote a treatise on the Indian number system which enabled the use of Indian numerals and improved the accuracy of counting.</li>
<li>He made several important contributions to the science of astronomy, including his calculations of the principal solar features such as eclipse and opposition of the sun, and even advances in the theory of the precession of the equinoxes.</li>
<li>He developed a theory for the computation of the circumference of the Earth which was used by Christopher Columbus.</li>
<li>He was the first European to correctly calculate the circumference of the Earth within one percent of modern measurements.</li>
<li>He introduced Arabian numerals into Europe and wrote the first textbook on number theory which heavily influenced the work of Leonardo Fibonacci.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 18 July 1013, Saulgau, Swabia, Germany. Died 24 September 1054, Reichenau, Germany.</p>
