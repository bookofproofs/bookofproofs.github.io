<h1>Person: Al-Nasawi</h1>
<p><img alt="avatar.png" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/avatar.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Al-Nasawi</strong> was an Islamic mathematician who wrote summaries of some of <a href="https://bookofproofs.github.io/branches/geometry/elements-euclid/elements-euclid.html" title="Geometry / Elements Euclid / Chapter: Euclid&amp;#x27;s “Elements”">Euclid's Elements</a>.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Al-Nasawi had prepared an original version of it in Persian for the library of the Iranian prince Majd al-Dawlah, of the Buyid dynasty.</li>
<li>Before the work was completed, however, Majd al-Dawlah was deposed as ruler so, on completion of the work, al-Nasawi presented it to Sharaf al-Muluk who was the vizier of Jalal ad-Dawlah (Jalal ad-Dawlah was the ruler of Baghdad from 1025 to 1044).</li>
<li>Sharaf al-Muluk ordered al-Nasawi to rewrite the work in Arabic, and this he did.</li>
<li>From this description, and from the fact that al-Nasawi dedicated another work to a Shi'ite leader in Baghdad, we at least can deduce that al-Nasawi worked for part of his life in Baghdad.</li>
<li>A paragraph about al-Nasawi's life has been found in a manuscript and it tells us that he spent time in Rayy, and was visited by ibn Sina.</li>
<li>Tract 26 is a summary of Euclid's Elements by al-Nasawi.</li>
<li>The reasons which al-Nasawi gives for writing this summary are two-fold.</li>
<li>All al-Nasawi appears to have done is to omit some constructions and change a few of the proofs.</li>
<li>The arithmetic book by al-Nasawi is of this third "Indian numeral" type.</li>
<li>In each of the four cases al-Nasawi explains the four elementary arithmetical operations.</li>
<li>Each method for each of the four types is illustrated with worked examples and a checking procedure is explained which usually involves usually casting out nines The method al-Nasawi gives for taking cube roots is the same as the method described in the Chinese Mathematics in Nine Books, but quite how he learnt of this method is unknown.</li>
<li>Al-Nasawi is critical of works on arithmetic written by earlier authors.</li>
<li>In fact, in some respects, al-Nasawi does not rate too highly as a mathematician.</li>
<li>There seems nothing original in any of his works and, more significantly, there are several places where al-Nasawi presents pieces of mathematics which he fails to properly understand.</li>
<li>Two other works by al-Nasawi have survived.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 1010, possibly Nasa, Khurasan,Iran. Died about 1075, possibly Baghdad, Iraq.</p>
