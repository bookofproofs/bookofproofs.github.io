<h1>Person: Stampioen, Jan Jansz de Jonge</h1>

<p><strong>Jan Stampioen</strong> was a Dutch mathematician who published a work on spherical trigonometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>We know relatively little about the life of Jan Stampioen Jr, and essentially nothing about his early life, but he appears to have been brought up and educated in Rotterdam.</li>
<li>Stampioen taught mathematics in Rotterdam where, in 1632, he published his own treatment of spherical trigonometry appended to van Schooten's sine tables.</li>
<li>Descartes presented a solution but it was rejected by Stampioen as not being complete.</li>
<li>In fact Stampioen's criticism was fair for although Descartes had taken the geometric problem and derived the correct quartic equation, he left the problem there without solving the quartic.</li>
<li>Fair though Stampioen's criticism was, it was definitely unwise for he made an enemy of Descartes who was a very powerful figure.</li>
<li>In 1638 Stampioen moved from Rotterdam to The Hague on being appointed tutor to the twelve year old Prince William.</li>
<li>How successful Stampioen was in tutoring William, and whether this had any bearing on his years as Prince of Orange, we can only leave to the imagination.</li>
<li>The move to the Hague to become tutor to William, however, set Stampioen on a new career for, while in The Hague, he opened a printing shop in which he printed his own writings on mathematics.</li>
<li>In 1639 Stampioen published Algebra or the New Method , a work which he had written while still teaching in Rotterdam.</li>
<li>The problem which Stampioen was interested in came as a consequence of using the Cardan-Tartaglia formula to solve cubic equations.</li>
<li>Stampioen let this cube root be A+√BA + √BA+√B, where a,b,Aa, b, Aa,b,A and BBB are all natural numbers.</li>
<li>Since we know that Descartes described his rule in a letter to Waessenaer written on 1 February 1640, it looks as though Descartes was probably out to discredit Stampioen and realised that it would be even more telling if it came from a relatively unknown mathematician.</li>
<li>Stampioen rejected Waessenaer's solution which prompted Waessenaer to reply with a broadly based attack on the mathematics contained in Stampioen's Algebra or the New Method.</li>
<li>Was Stampioen correct?</li>
<li>In 1644 Stampioen was employed to tutor Huygens and his brother in mathematics.</li>
<li>This may be seen as slightly surprising given that Huygens' father Constantijn Huygens had corresponded with Descartes and the two agreed that Stampioen's behaviour during the dispute had been bad.</li>
<li>It may indicate that Descartes actually had a higher opinion of Stampioen than that which he showed in public.</li>
<li>Little else is known about Stampioen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1610, Rotterdam, Netherlands. Died 1690, The Hague, Netherlands.</p>
