<p><strong>William Brouncker</strong> was an Irish mathematician who was a founder and the first president of the Royal Society of London. He worked on continued fractions and calculated logarithms by infinite series.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>William Brouncker's mother was Winifred Leigh who came from Newenhan in Warwickshire.</li>
<li>In a time in England when King and Parliament would fight the Civil War, the Brouncker family were staunch Royalist supporters.</li>
<li>We know little of Brouncker's early life.</li>
<li>About the first we know for certain of Brouncker is that he entered Oxford University when he was sixteen years old and there he studied mathematics, languages and medicine.</li>
<li>This was a difficult time for Brouncker for the political situation in England was in turmoil.</li>
<li>Brouncker and his father were Royalists and were very definitely on the losing side.</li>
<li>On 12 September 1645 Brouncker's father became Viscount Brouncker of Castle Lyons.</li>
<li>The First Viscount Brouncker of Castle Lyons did not live long to enjoy the peerage he bought for he died two months later.</li>
<li>At this time William Brouncker, his mathematician son, succeeded him to the title becoming the Second Viscount Brouncker of Castle Lyons.</li>
<li>It was a time for Royalists to keep their heads down if they wanted to survive and that is exactly what Brouncker did.</li>
<li>These studies were mathematics and music, two topics which Brouncker loved.</li>
<li>In 1653 Brouncker published his English translation of Descartes' work but he added notes of his own which doubled the size of the work.</li>
<li>Mersenne had proposed a scale of 12 equal semitones after Descartes' manuscript had been written and in his notes Brouncker proposed a variation of Mersenne's ideas but he divided the scale into 17 equal semitones.</li>
<li>One should not be surprised that all these mathematicians were contributing to musical theory and indeed Brouncker's notes are highly mathematical using algebra and logarithms.</li>
<li>One might wonder why Brouncker chose 17 equal semitones and again the reason was a mathematical one for he derived this from taking ratios based on the golden section.</li>
<li>The years of the Protectorate were the most productive years for Brouncker in terms of mathematics.</li>
<li>Brouncker was one of those who signed a Declaration acknowledging Monck's rights.</li>
<li>Brouncker stood in the new parliamentary elections and was elected as Member for Westbury in 1660.</li>
<li>On Wednesday 28 November 1660 Brouncker was one of a dozen scientists at a meeting in Gresham College which constituted their Society for the Promoting of Physico-Mathematical Experimental Learning which they declared would promote experimental philosophy.</li>
<li>Brouncker's father had been vice-chamberlain to Charles when he was Prince of Wales and so Brouncker was well known to the new King who soon repaid him for his loyal support.</li>
<li>In 1662 the King appointed Brouncker as Chancellor to Queen Anne and Keeper of the Great Seal.</li>
<li>Brouncker worked hard for the Society ensuring that it was active.</li>
<li>The Royal Charter which was passed by the Great Seal on 15 July 1662 created the Royal Society of London and the Royal Charter nominated Brouncker as its first President.</li>
<li>Given the quality of the founder members of the Society, it might be considered slightly strange that Brouncker, certainly not the most eminent academically, was made President.</li>
<li>Well certainly Brouncker was on the best terms with the King and this must have been a major factor, but there were other reasons.</li>
<li>Brouncker was a man of independent means, and he was also unmarried, so he had time to devote to the Society which most others would not have had.</li>
<li>Again nobody could have been more enthusiastic in promoting the aims of the Society than Brouncker so he was a good choice.</li>
<li>Brouncker now took on a number of roles.</li>
<li>One of Brouncker's interests was in ships and he built, to his own design, a yacht for King Charles II.</li>
<li>In 1668 Brouncker was appointed as Controller of the Navy Accounts.</li>
<li>Things began to go less well for Brouncker from around 1675.</li>
<li>Brouncker seems to have only infrequent attended the Society in 1677 but he still seems to have wanted to continue as President.</li>
<li>Brouncker was not present at the November meeting which elected Sir Joseph Williamson to succeed him as President.</li>
<li>Brouncker's mathematical achievements includes work on continued fractions and calculating logarithms by infinite series.</li>
<li>However after Brouncker correctly computed the first 10 places in the decimal expansion of π using his continued fraction expansion, Huygens accepted the result.</li>
<li>Probably also in 1654 Brouncker computed the quadrature of the hyperbola although he did not publish this result until 1668.</li>
<li>It appeared in a paper published by Brouncker in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of 1668 but he clearly states that this result is the one referred to by Wallis in 1665.</li>
<li>It is believed that Euler made an error in naming the equation 'Pell's equation', and that he was intending to acknowledge the outstanding contribution made by Brouncker.</li>
<li>It is interesting to think that if Euler had not made this error then Brouncker, instead of being relatively unknown as a mathematician, would be universally known through 'Brouncker's equation'.</li>
<li>Brouncker has gained a somewhat unfortunate reputation.</li>
<li>There are other negative comments regarding his character which are believed to be unfair in that the writer has confused Brouncker with his brother Henry Brouncker.</li>
<li>It seems a cruel twist that two misidentifications, mistaking him for Pell and also for his brother Henry, has led to Brouncker receiving less than his just deserts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1620, Castlelyons (N of Cork), Ireland. Died 5 April 1684, Westminster. London, England.</p>
