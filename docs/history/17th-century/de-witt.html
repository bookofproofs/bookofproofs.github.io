<p><strong>Jan de Witt</strong> was a Dutch mathematician and statesman who wrote on geometry and finance.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>De Witt was an associate of van Schooten and lived for a while in his house.</li>
<li>His most important work Elementa curvarum linearum Ⓣ(Elements of curves) (1659-61)  was finished in 1649, and was the first systematic development of the analytic geometry of the straight line and conic.</li>
<li>It was published by van Schooten as part of his edition of Descartes' Géometrie (1660).</li>
<li>In 1650 de Witt was appointed Pensionary of Dordrecht, the leader of Dordrecht's deputation in the government of Holland.</li>
<li>As leader of Holland, de Witt applied his mathematical knowledge to the financial and budgetary problems of the republic.</li>
<li>He wrote The Worth of Life Annuities Compared to Redemption Bonds  which applied probability to questions of state finance.</li>
<li>De Witt brought about peace with England in 1654 and after this he was extremely successful in bringing prosperity to Holland.</li>
<li>When war broke out again with England in 1665 de Witt was able to bring about a very satisfactory settlement at the Treaty of Breda (1667).</li>
<li>In 1672 France invaded and there were demonstrations against de Witt.</li>
<li>When Jan came to visit Cornelius in prison they were attacked and killed by a large crowd.</li>
<li>Let us look now at de Witt's major mathematical work, the Elementa curvarum linearum Ⓣ(Elements of curves).</li>
<li>Let us point out that the word directrix  was first used by de Witt and appears in this work.</li>
<li>In the same letter Witt criticises Apollonius who, in his opinion, had made things much too complicated.</li>
<li>De Witt read the proofs and had the final say regarding changes to what van Schooten produced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 24 September 1625, Dordrecht, Netherlands. Died 20 August 1672, The Hague, Netherlands.</p>
