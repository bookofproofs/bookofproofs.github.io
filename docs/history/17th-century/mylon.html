<p><strong>Claude Mylon</strong> was a French mathematician important because of his correspondence with the leading mathematicians of the day.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Claude was his parent's third son and he was brought up in a well-off family.</li>
<li>Mylon is important in the history of mathematics, not for his own achievements, but for his role in the Académie Parisienne, the group of scholars which was a continuation of the group formed in Paris by Mersenne, which was to form the foundation on which the Paris Academy of Sciences was formed.</li>
<li>Mylon joined Mersenne's mathematical circle in around 1645 when he began to take careful notes of mathematical discussions in the group.</li>
<li>Mylon took on the role of secretary of the academy.</li>
<li>After the death of Le Pailleur in 1654, Mylon had access to all the correspondence between members of the Académie Parisienne and the numerous scientist with whom they had corresponded.</li>
<li>At this stage Mylon carried on the important task of making the discoveries of mathematicians available to other mathematicians.</li>
<li>Mylon also corresponded with van Schooten about the problems on games of chance, in particular the dice and points problems, that Fermat and Pascal were considering.</li>
<li>Mylon maintained contact with Pascal after he gave up his mathematical studies and corresponded with Roberval.</li>
<li>Mylon's attempts to contribute to mathematics were much less successful than he was as a communicator of the results of others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1618, Paris, France. Died 1660, Paris, France.</p>
