<h1>Person: Pascal (2), Blaise</h1>
<p><img alt="Pascal.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Pascal.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Blaise Pascal</strong> was a very influential French mathematician and philosopher who contributed to many areas of mathematics. He worked on conic sections and projective geometry and in correspondence with Fermat he laid the foundations for the theory of probability.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Pioneered the field of probability theory with his seminal work ‘Traité du triangle arithmétique’ (Essay on the Arithmetic Triangle).</li>
<li>Developed the earliest mechanical calculator to help his father, a tax clothier, with calculations. </li>
<li>Developed his famous quote "The more I study relationships, the more I am certain of the inexpressible mystery of existence". </li>
<li>Developed the Pascal Triangle, which shows the coefficients of Binomial expansion and can also be used to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. </li>
<li>Established a mathematical proof of the validity of Euclid's 5th postulate, known as Pascal's Theorem. </li>
<li>Set out the earliest forms of expectations analysis which is the basis of modern-day decision theory.</li>
<li>Discovered the law of descending permutations, now known as Pascal's theorem. </li>
<li>Developed statistics and the principle of least squares, ahead of other brilliant minds of the era. </li>
<li>Published his ‘Provincial Letters’ reflecting his theological beliefs and defended the Jesuit doctrine. </li>
<li>Identified principles of hydrostatics, or the study of fluids, which helped to pave the way for Isaac Newton’s work on gravity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 19 June 1623, Clermont (now Clermont-Ferrand), Auvergne, France. Died 19 August 1662, Paris, France.</p>
