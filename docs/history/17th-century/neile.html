<h1>Person: Neile, William</h1>

<p><strong>William Neile</strong> was an English mathematician who was the first to calculate the arc-length of the cubical parabola.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>We know little of Neile's life during the Commonwealth (1649-60) except that he was living at White Waltham near Maidenhead, evidently a man of means with an interest in astronomy and in the making of telescopes.</li>
<li>William Neile entered Wadham College, Oxford, in 1652 (but did not matriculate until 1655) where he was taught mathematics by John Wilkins and Seth Ward.</li>
<li>Paul Neile was also building a telescope for Gresham College at this time.</li>
<li>In 1657 William Neile became a pupil of law at the Middle Temple in London.</li>
<li>He communicated his results to William Brouncker and Christopher Wren at the Gresham College Society, the Society based at Gresham College, London, which a few years later became the Royal Society.</li>
<li>Neile's work on this appeared in John Wallis's De Cycloide in 1659.</li>
<li>Wallis was easily able to make Neile's proof algebraic using the notation defined in 'De sectionibus conicis', while William Brouncker went further and came up with a formula for the length of a portion of the curve in terms of its coordinates.</li>
<li>Neile was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 7 January 1663, one of the first members of this Society.</li>
<li>Oldenberg was the secretary of the Royal Society and his correspondence contains several letters from Neile.</li>
<li>In January 1668 Neile had written a letter to Oldenburg complaining that the country was putting far too much of its resources into military preparations rather than supporting science.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 16 December 1637, Bishopsthorpe (near York), England. Died 24 August 1670, White Waltham, Berkshire, England.</p>
