<p><strong>János Apáczai</strong> was born in Transylvania and wrote the <em>Hungarian Encyclopaedia</em>.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>This background information is necessary to understand Apáczai's aims.</li>
<li>Alsted and Bisterfeld were two German professors who had been appointed to Gyulafehérvár as part of the upgrading in 1629 and they were to have a big influence on Apáczai while he was a student there.</li>
<li>In this same year of 1648 Bisterfeld persuaded Bishop István Katona to award Apáczai a scholarship to allow him to study abroad, and he went to study in Franeker, Leiden and Utrecht.</li>
<li>Apáczai was awarded the degree of Doctor of Theology from the University of Harderwijk in April 1651.</li>
<li>While in Utrecht, Apáczai studied the works of Descartes.</li>
<li>Apáczai's Hungarian Encyclopaedia contains one section on arithmetic (Part Four of the Encyclopaedia) and one section on geometry (Part Five of the Encyclopaedia).</li>
<li>There is no attempt at originality, this was not Apáczai's aim, rather he wanted to present advanced mathematics in the Hungarian language.</li>
<li>Many of the Hungarian terms that Apáczai introduced for mathematical terms are still in use today.</li>
<li>These views put him at odds with many influential people, but while Bisterfeld was at the College in Gyulafehérvár, Apáczai's position there was safe.</li>
<li>After an open debate had been held, Apáczai was forbidden to teach.</li>
<li>Despite this many of the students from Gyulafehérvár, who had protested when he was banned from teaching, moved to Kolozsvár to complete their education with Apáczai.</li>
<li>We mentioned above that Apáczai wrote the text for teachers, but there were not the quality of teachers around to take the text and turn it into good lecture material.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 10 June 1625, Apáca, Transylvania, Hungary (now Romania). Died 31 December 1659, Kolozsvár, Hungary (now Cluj, Romania).</p>
