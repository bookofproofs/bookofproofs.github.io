<p><strong>John Colson</strong> was an English clergyman and mathematician who translated several of Newton's books into Engish.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His father, Francis Colson, was vicar-choral of Lichfield cathedral and his mother was Elizabeth.</li>
<li>The family were closely related to the historian John Strype (1643-1737).</li>
<li>John Colson attended Lichfield grammar school and we know from letters from Francis Colson written to John Strype in 1696 that his son John had visited London and called on John Strype but not found him at home.</li>
<li>John Colson matriculated at Christ Church College, Oxford, on 26 May 1699 but does not appear to have graduated with a degree.</li>
<li>In 1707 Colson published The universal resolution of cubic and biquadratic equations viz.</li>
<li>This was the most original piece of research that Colson produced in his whole career.</li>
<li>Now at this point Colson came up with a clever idea that nobody seems to have thought of before this time.</li>
<li>Colson tested each of these 9 possible solutions to see if it satisfies the original equation, and was able to identify the three actual solutions.</li>
<li>This paper by Colson was the first to give all three solutions to a cubic equation.</li>
<li>Colson was appointed as a master at the Sir Joseph Williamson Mathematical School in Rochester, Kent, in 1709.</li>
<li>Colson was awarded a Master's Degree by the University of Cambridge in 1728 and, on 23 April of that year, he was elected a member of Emmanuel College.</li>
<li>Colson continued as master at the Sir Joseph Williamson Mathematical School in Rochester and in 1737 he taught David Garrick (1717-1779) who went on to became a famous actor, producer, dramatist, and poet.</li>
<li>In March 1739 Colson left Rochester when he was appointed as Taylor lecturer at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.</li>
<li>There appears to have been only two candidates to fill the vacant Lucasian chair, Colson and Abraham De Moivre.</li>
<li>Robert Smith really decided the election, and as de Moivre was very old and almost in his dotage he pressed the claims of Colson.</li>
<li>Colson produced no further original mathematics, but did make a number of important translations and assisted in the publication of several texts.</li>
<li>Each of these translations contained substantial commentary by Colson.</li>
<li>In 1761, an edition of Newton's 'Arithmetica universalis' was published in Latin with Colson's commentary, also in Latin.</li>
<li>Colson showed himself to be ahead of his times by his translation of 'Analyitical Institutions' written originally in Italian by Donna Maria Agnesi, a professor of mathematics and philosophy at the University of Bolgna.</li>
<li>It was the first book on calculus written by a woman, and Colson intended the translation to make calculus more accessible to women.</li>
<li>Colson had published Newton's (Latin) Fluxions in English, in 1736.</li>
<li>It seems probable that Colson's two works of translation, of Newton and Agnesi, well served English students at large, and, despite opinions to the contrary, also provided a fluxional tool adequate for research.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1680, Lichfield, Staffordshire, England. Died 20 January 1760, Cambridge, England.</p>
