<p><strong>John Keill</strong> was a Scottish mathematician who acted as a propagator of Newton's philosophy.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>John attended school in Edinburgh, then studied at Edinburgh University under David Gregory obtaining his degree in 1692 with distinction in both mathematics and physics.</li>
<li>Keill went to Oxford with David Gregory in 1692 and, after obtaining a scholarship to finance his studies, studied at Balliol College.</li>
<li>Keill was appointed deputy to the Sedleian professor of natural philosophy in 1699, a post he held until 1704.</li>
<li>Keill was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1701 and remained at Balliol College until his scholarship ran out in 1703 when he transferred to Christ Church.</li>
<li>Many wished to settle in North America and Keill accompanied a party who sailed to New England.</li>
<li>In the following year the Savilian Professorship of Astronomy in Oxford became vacant again and this time Keill was appointed taking up the post in 1712.</li>
<li>Keill acted as a propagator of Newton's philosophy and argued against Whiston and others.</li>
<li>This did not provoke any reaction from Newton until 1711 when Keill suggested that this could be interpreted as suggesting that Newton's fluxions were a moving version of Leibniz's differentials.</li>
<li>Keill responded by accusing Leibniz of plagiarizing Newton in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society and Leibniz wrote to the Royal Society asking that he withdraw his accusation.</li>
<li>Keill maintained his position and Leibniz wrote to Newton asking him to tell Keill to withdraw his accusations.</li>
<li>Keill did write a reply in the Journal Litéraire which he intended as a defence of national honour.</li>
<li>Although Keill and Newton seemed very friendly at this time it appeared that Newton grew tired of Keill's stirring up trouble.</li>
<li>Newton made it up with Johann Bernoulli although Keill never did.</li>
<li>Perhaps the attraction for Keill was the fact that she was twenty-five years younger.</li>
<li>Keill's work Euclides elementorum libri priores sex Ⓣ(The first six books of Euclid's 'Elements') published in 1715 studies trigonometry and logarithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1 December 1671, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 31 August 1721, Oxford, England.</p>
