<p><strong>Johannes Widman</strong> was a German mathematician who is best remembered for an early arithmetic book which contains the first appearance of + and – signs.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Widman's 1486 algebra lecture is the first to be given in Germany on that topic, and amazingly still survives in a notebook of a student who attended.</li>
<li>Widman used Cossist notation, as was usual at that time, discussing 24 different types of equations.</li>
<li>It is, however, for an early arithmetic book Behende und hupsche Rechnung auf allen kauffmanschafft Ⓣ(Nimble and smart calculation for all merchants),  published in German in 1489, that Widman is best remembered.</li>
<li>in the treatises of Widman, Pellos, Pacioli, De la Roche, Ries, Rudolff, Tartaglia, and Cardan.</li>
<li>was also described by Widman.</li>
<li>The popularity of Widman's book can be seen from the fact that it was reprinted in 1508 in Pforzheim, in 1519 in Hagenau and in 1526 in Augsburg.</li>
<li>There are no direct references to Widman after 1489 but it is believed that he was still working on mathematical topics as late as 1498.</li>
<li>Widman was probably the author of the book Algorithmus Linealis published in Leipzig  in 1489.</li>
<li>Widman's importance is that he provided one of the first practical applications of mathematical knowledge which, because of the recent invention of printing, was made accessible to a very much wider circle of readers than had ever been achieved before.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1462, Eger, Bohemia (now Cheb, Czech Republic). Died 1498, Leipzig, Germany.</p>
