<h1>Person: Alberti, Leone Battista</h1>
<p><img alt="Alberti.jpg" src="https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/portraits/Alberti.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Leone Alberti</strong> was an Italian mathematician who wrote the first general treatise on the laws of perspective and also wrote a book on cryptography containing the first example of a frequency table.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>He was the first to develop a system of perspective that was used by artists to accurately depict depth and proportions in paintings. </li>
<li>He established two concepts related to number theory – he was the first to introduce the concept of ‘magic squares’ and used them in his design of churches, palaces and villas; and he also designed a polyhedron now known as the ‘Alberti polyhedron.’</li>
<li>He made a number of contributions to the field of mathematics, enhancing existing knowledge and contributing new ideas.</li>
<li>He published a number of mathematical treatises, which is believed to have aided in the later development of calculus. </li>
<li>He extended the power of the Roman numeral system to include fractions, complex arithmetical operations and the roots of equations.</li>
<li>He popularized the use of the abacus and greatly expanded the Roman modulary system.</li>
<li>He developed a method to use the mathematics of a diagram to study the shape of a Cubic Curve and defined the tangent of a curve.</li>
<li>He also established the idea of the prime numbers and explored the properties of diophantine equations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 18 February 1404, Genoa, French Empire (now Italy). Died 3 April 1472, Rome, Papal States (now Italy).</p>
