<p><strong>Dürer</strong> was a German artist who is known for his work as an engraver. The foundations of descriptive geometry are laid in Dürer's treatise on human proportions published in Nuremberg after his death in 1528.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Dürer developed the principle of congruence for triangles, now known as  Dürer's theorem. </li>
<li>He employed the use of nested polygons and trigonometry to construct regular polygons of any size.</li>
<li>Developed the concept of 'magnetic line of force' which is now known as a 'Dürer's solid'.</li>
<li>Established a method of calculating the proportions and positions of figures in a drawing, now known as the 'Dürer's Theory of Proportion'.</li>
<li>Wrote a book on geometry, 'Underweysung der Messung mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt', which became the standard work on mathematical drawing at the time. </li>
<li>In 1525, he published a mathematical treatise, 'Mysterium Cosmographicum', which explained the structure of the universe using mathematics.</li>
<li>He developed a system to use orthogonal coordinate axes, now known as 'Dürer's system of measurement'. </li>
<li>He used mathematics to solve problems related to painting, drawing, and engraving. </li>
<li>Dürer was the first to develop three-dimensional perspective in art. </li>
<li>He introduced a new method of regular division of the circle, which is still referred to as the 'Dürer's Polyhedra'.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 21 May1471, Imperial Free City of Nürnberg (now in Germany). Died 6 April 1528, Imperial Free City of Nürnberg (now in Germany).</p>
