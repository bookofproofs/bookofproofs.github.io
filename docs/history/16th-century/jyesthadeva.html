<h1>Person: Jyesthadeva</h1>

<p><strong>Jyesthadeva</strong> was a mathematician from South India who wrote an important work on mathematics and astronomy which summarises the work of the Kerala school.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jyesthadeva wrote a famous text Yuktibhasa which he wrote in Malayalam, the regional language of Kerala.</li>
<li>The Yuktibhasa is very important in terms of the mathematics Jyesthadeva presents.</li>
<li>Written in about 1550, Jyesthadeva's commentary contained proofs of the earlier results by Madhava and Nilakantha which these earlier authors did not give.</li>
<li>This is a remarkable passage describing Madhava's series, but remember that even this passage by Jyesthadeva was written more than 100 years before James Gregory rediscovered this series expansion.</li>
<li>Other mathematical results presented by Jyesthadeva include topics studied by earlier Indian mathematicians such as integer solutions of systems of first degree equation solved by the kuttaka method, and rules of finding the sines and the cosines of the sum and difference of two angles.</li>
<li>Not only does the mathematics anticipate work by European mathematicians a century later, but the planetary theory presented by Jyesthadeva is similar to that adopted by Tycho Brahe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born about 1500, Kerala, India. Died about 1575, Kerala, India.</p>
