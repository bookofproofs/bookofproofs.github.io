<p><strong>Christoph Scheiner</strong> was a German Jesuit priest, physicist and astronomer.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nothing is known of Scheiner's early life before he entered the Jesuit Latin School of St Salvator in Augsburg in May 1591.</li>
<li>In 1598 Scheiner went to the Jesuit University in Ingolstadt where he continued his long Jesuit education.</li>
<li>Scheiner had already become interested in constructing mathematical and astronomical instruments and he promised to construct a quadrant for Rader.</li>
<li>While in Dillingen Scheiner talked to a painter who used a mechanism to draw outlines on paper before he began to paint.</li>
<li>The painter kept the mechanism a secret by Scheiner was intrigued and worked out how to construct a pantograph, that is an instrument which allows the copying of a diagram in an enlarged or reduced form.</li>
<li>After two years teaching at Dillingen, Scheiner returned to the Jesuit University in Ingolstadt.</li>
<li>Scheiner's studies of theology lasted from 1605 to 1609: he was ordained a deacon by bishop Marcus Lyresius on 14 March 1609, and was awarded a doctorate in theology on 30 June 1609 for his Theses Theologicae which he had defended in a disputation in the usual manner.</li>
<li>Lantz had moved to Munich and Scheiner succeeded him in Ingolstadt as Professor of Mathematics and Hebrew, teaching geometry, astronomy and, in addition, his specialist subjects of sundials and telescopes.</li>
<li>Being fascinated by mathematical and astronomical instruments, Scheiner had quickly acquired a good quality telescope and we know that by the spring of 1611 he and his assistant Baptist Cysat were observing the moons of Jupiter.</li>
<li>In fact it was in March 1611 that Scheiner began to make the observations for which he is most famed, namely his observations of sunspots.</li>
<li>The fact that Scheiner has become important in the story of the discovery of sunspots is because of three letters he wrote to Marc Welser (1558-1614) in Augsburg in the autumn of 1611, describing his own observations of sunspots.</li>
<li>Welser was a scholar of Greek and Latin with a passion for history and philology who corresponded with many Jesuit scholars, including Christopher Clavius.</li>
<li>He published Scheiner's letters under the title Tres epistolae de Maculis Solaribus scriptae ad Marcum Velserium Ⓣ(Three letters by Christoph Scheiner written to Marc Welser) on 5 January 1612 although, since Scheiner wished to remain anonymous, he had signed the letters as 'Apelles latenspost tabulam' (Apelles hiding behind the painting).</li>
<li>Scheiner had drawn a series of diagrams showing sunspots on various days, made by putting dark coloured glass in front of his telescope.</li>
<li>Also Scheiner's theory of what the spots were was quite incorrect.</li>
<li>Certainly one can forgive Scheiner for not recognising the same spots after the sun had rotated for they change markedly.</li>
<li>In 1613 a dispute broke out between Galileo and Christoph Scheiner over sunspots.</li>
<li>Galileo unfairly accused Scheiner of plagiarism but, although Scheiner's discovery of sunspots was certainly independent of any work by Galileo, his explanation was quite wrong.</li>
<li>Giuseppe Biancani, however, defended his fellow Jesuit Scheiner and a considerable controversy ensued.</li>
<li>Throughout 1612 Galileo corresponded about sunspots with Welser and Scheiner continued making regular observations.</li>
<li>In September 1612 Welser published a second tract by Scheiner under the pseudonym Apelles entitled De maculis solaribus et stellis circa Jovem errantibus accuratior disquisitio Ⓣ(On Solar Spots and the Stars Wandering around Jupiter.</li>
<li>The controversy did not seem to cause problems for Scheiner who began publishing major works: (with Johann Georg Locher) Disquisitiones mathematicae Ⓣ(On  mathematical investigations) (1614); Sol ellipticus Ⓣ(The elliptical Sun) (1615); (with Georg Schönberger) Exegeses fundamentorum gnomonicorum Ⓣ(Exegeses foundations gnomonicorum) (1615); and Refractiones coelestes Ⓣ(Refraction in the sky) (1617).</li>
<li>In 1617 the Archduke requested Scheiner's permanent presence in Innsbruck as his advisor.</li>
<li>In 1624 Scheiner was called to Rome by the pope.</li>
<li>Although Galileo almost certainly did not have Scheiner in mind, Scheiner did not see it that way.</li>
<li>Galileo believed, correctly, that Scheiner's interpretation of sunspots was wrong and, by this time, Scheiner accepted Galileo's argument that they were on the surface of the sun.</li>
<li>However, Scheiner had every right to be upset over priority issues which he discussed in his most important work, Rosa Ursina sive Sol Ⓣ(Spots on the sun), published in 1630.</li>
<li>To his attack upon these conceptions Scheiner devoted fourteen chapters of 150 folio pages.</li>
<li>Scheiner claimed, correctly, that he was the first to make continuous observations of sunspots of scientific value.</li>
<li>It also contains Scheiner's argument in favour of a geocentric universe, which he supported with quotations from the scriptures.</li>
<li>While in Rome, Scheiner also published Pantographice seu ars delineandi Ⓣ(On the art of drawing with a Pantograph) (1631) describing the pantograph he had invented more than 25 years earlier.</li>
<li>In 1633 Scheiner left Rome and went to Vienna.</li>
<li>Although Scheiner probably intended to go to Neisse, in fact the war prevented him from doing so for around four years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 25 July 1573, Markt Wald, near Mindelheim in Swabia (now in Germany). Died 18 July 1650, Neisse, Silesia.</p>
