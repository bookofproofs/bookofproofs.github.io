<p><strong>Thomas Fincke</strong> was a Danish doctor who wrote a textbook on geometry.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His parents, Raadmand Jacob Fincke and Anna thor Smede (or Thorsmede), came from the most respected families in Flensburg.</li>
<li>Anna was from a rich middle-class Danish family but, sadly, she died six days after her son Thomas was born.</li>
<li>Thomas's father was described as a "learned merchant" who had been a student of Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon, the Professor of Greek in Wittenberg and one of Luther's first supporters.</li>
<li>Thomas, the subject of this biography, had been named after his grandfather, also named Thomas Fincke, who had been mayor of Flensburg.</li>
<li>When Thomas, the subject of this biography, was only nine years old, his father died and from that time he lived with his uncle Reinhold thor Smede (1532-1584), a wealthy well-educated local councillor.</li>
<li>Thomas attended a newly founded Lutheran Latin school in Flensburg from 1570 to 1577 when he was 16 years old.</li>
<li>As a consequence, mathematics was one of the major subjects that Fincke studied.</li>
<li>After leaving the Academy, Fincke enrolled at the University of Heidelberg in February 1582 and then, after a semester there, he enrolled for a semester at the University of Leipzig in the summer of 1582.</li>
<li>Having published such an important mathematical work, one might assume that Fincke would go on to still greater mathematical achievements.</li>
<li>Fincke made a big impression in Padua and, although he was only twenty-six years old when he left, his achievements in founding a medical library were so highly appreciated that a marble pillar with inscribed commemorative plaque was put in the local church 'Santa Sofia' in his honour.</li>
<li>Certainly Fincke did not return directly to Flensburg from Basel but rather made further study trips through Austria, Hungary and Bohemia before settling into a medical practise in his home town of Flensburg.</li>
<li>On 30 August 1590, Fincke married Söst Ivers (1574-1614) at the Ducal Palace in Tonder.</li>
<li>Fincke was twenty-nine years old when he married Söst the day after her sixteenth birthday.</li>
<li>Around the time of his marriage, Fincke received an offer of the Chair of Mathematics at the University of Copenhagen from Chancellor Niels Kaas, one of Fincke's patrons.</li>
<li>On the 28 July 1602, Peder Sørensen, the professor of medicine at Copenhagen died and in April of the following year Fincke was appointed to fill this chair.</li>
<li>The book introduces the terms 'tangents' and 'secants' and Fincke devised new formulae such as the law of tangents.</li>
<li>The abbreviations Fincke used for the standard trigonometric functions mark the beginning of the notation which is current today.</li>
<li>Fincke's book was recommended by Clavius, Napier and Pitiscus all of whom adopted much from it.</li>
<li>Finally let us look briefly at the Thomas and Söst Finckes' large family and the influence they had on the academic families of Denmark for many generations.</li>
<li>Their eldest son, Jacob Fincke (1592-1663), went on to become Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Copenhagen.</li>
<li>Anna (1594-1677), the eldest of the Finckes daughters, married Caspar Bartholin, a physician and theologian, and the famous mathematician Erasmus Bartholin was the second of their six sons.</li>
<li>The Finckes' daughters Margaret (1595-1665), Dorothea (1596-1628) and Drude (1604-1671) all married university professors.</li>
<li>When Thomas Fincke died he left seventy-nine descendants: children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 6 January 1561, Flensburg, Schleswig (now Germany). Died 24 April 1656, Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
