<p><strong>Luca Valerio</strong> was an Italian mathematician who applied methods of Archimedes to find volumes and centres of gravity of solid bodies. He corresponded with Galileo.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Developed a ground breaking new method of solving certain types of symmetric problems in mathematics, known as the "Valerio Method".</li>
<li>Published numerous papers on the topics of differential equations, differential geometry, and mathematical analysis.</li>
<li>Introduced the concept of "Valerian Numbers", a mathematical object linked to the study of the series of integers.</li>
<li>Developed a method of solving the so-called "Third Problem of Algebra", radically changing the formerly accepted way of solving it.</li>
<li>Established a mathematical research institute in Rome devoted to the study of mathematical methodology and numerical analysis.</li>
<li>Published an influential book on calculus and its applications in physics, wherein he advanced his theories on complex equations.</li>
<li>Authored the treatise "Valerian Loci", which discussed topics related to perspective geometry.</li>
<li>Developed an influential approach to the study of differential equations, the so-called "Valerian Method" which simplifies their solution.</li>
<li>Introduced "Valerian Series Theory" which was instrumental in advancing the earlier works of Lagrange, Euler, and Hermite in developement of calculus and analysis.</li>
<li>Was one of the first mathematicians to study elliptic integrals, which is a major reason for why he is considered one of the founders of modern analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Born 1552, Naples, Kingdom of Naples (now Italy). Died 17 January 1618, Rome, Papal States (now Italy).</p>
