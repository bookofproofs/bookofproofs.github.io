<p><strong>Joao Baptista Lavanha</strong> was a Portuguese engineer who wrote on mathematics and navigation.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>His father, Luis de Lavanha, was a gentleman in the Portuguese Court while nothing is known of his mother except her name, D Jerónima Dança.</li>
<li>Nothing is known of Lavanha's childhood or is youth but he is said to have been sent by his patron, the king of Portugal D Sebastian (1554-1578), to study in Rome under the professor of mathematics there.</li>
<li>In an attempt to correct this, Philip founded an Academy of Mathematics in Madrid with Lavanha as its first professor.</li>
<li>Lavanha was appointed cosmographer to the king in 1591 (although he did not assume the full duties of that position for a few years) and about the same time he moved from Madrid to Lisbon where he taught mathematics to sailors and navigators.</li>
<li>Lavanha was given a special task of writing the history of the Spanish royal family.</li>
<li>In fact Lavanha himself had married in the 1590s.</li>
<li>Lavanha is best known for his contributions to navigation.</li>
<li>a work printed by Lavanha shortly after being appointed chief cosmographer of Portugal.</li>
<li>Lavanha gives rules for determining latitude and tables of declination of the Sun.</li>
<li>Another work by Lavanha in this area is his Compendio de Geografia.</li>
<li>Lavanha also studied instruments used in navigation, constructing astrolabes, quadrants and compasses.</li>
<li>Lavanha taught mathematics to many leading people including Prince Emmanuel Filiberto of Sabóia (1528-1580) (who was Duke of Savoy from 1553 to 1580), the famous novelist, poet and playwright Miguel de Cervantes (1547-1616), the dramatist and poet Félix Arturo Lope de Vega (1562-1635), and Philip IV (1605-1665) of Spain before he ascended to the throne of Spain in 1621.</li>
<li>Among Lavanha's publications was a translation of Euclid (1584), the tables of the sun Taboas do lugar do So (1600), and a work containing all the mathematical facts a learned man needed to know, Descripción del Universo (1613).</li>
<li>In 1609, Lavanha joined the Order of Christ which, given his Jewish origins, caused some criticism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1555, Lisbon, Portugal. Died 31 March 1624, Madrid, Spain.</p>
