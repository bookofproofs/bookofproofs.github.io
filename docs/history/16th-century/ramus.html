<h1>Person: Ramus, Peter</h1>

<p><strong>Peter Ramus</strong> was a French mathematician who wrote a whole series of textbooks on logic and rhetoric, grammar, mathematics, astronomy and optics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Peter Ramus's father Jacques de la Ramée was a labourer and his mother was Jeanne Charpentier.</li>
<li>Ramus was educated at home until, in 1527 at the age of twelve years, he entered the Collège de Navarre in Paris.</li>
<li>After this Ramus taught, first at the Collège de Mans, then at the Collège de l'Ave Maria.</li>
<li>It was mathematics and the plague which came to Ramus's rescue.</li>
<li>Mathematics since when he was forbidden to teach and publish philosophy he turned to mathematics, and the plague for it created staff shortages which resulted in Ramus being reinstated as a teacher.</li>
<li>Not only was Ramus back as a teacher, but he also returned to publishing texts.</li>
<li>In 1562 Ramus, whose teaching were becoming more involved with political and religious issues, abandoned the Catholic Church and became a convert to Calvinism.</li>
<li>Other changes which Ramus proposed was the abolition of student fees (which 450 years later is again a topic of vigorous debate in Britain!).</li>
<li>Near the end of 1562, Ramus was forced to flee Paris for fear of his life as the Calvinists were ordered out of the city.</li>
<li>It granted certain rights of conscience to the Huguenots and Ramus saw it as sufficient to allow him to return to Paris.</li>
<li>For a while he tried to keep a low profile but when one of his opponents was appointed to the Regius Chair of Mathematics, Ramus opposed the appointment, but lost.</li>
<li>With tensions rising again in the religious wars, Ramus fled Paris for a second time in 1567.</li>
<li>Ramus returned briefly to Paris, found his library destroyed, and requested permission from the King to visit Germany.</li>
<li>This Ramus did from 1568 to 1570, but in that year another treaty, the Peace of Saint-Germain, was signed in August.</li>
<li>Feeling that it was again safe to return to Paris, Ramus gained the promise of protection from the King although he was again banned from teaching.</li>
<li>They were massacred on the eve of the feast St Bartholomew and, despite his royal protection, Ramus was murdered by hired assassins.</li>
<li>The changes which Ramus proposed to the Arts courses taught at universities at that time was a return to the seven classical liberal arts, but with the syllabus more based on applied topics.</li>
<li>Using this approach Ramus worked on many topics and wrote a whole series of textbooks on logic and rhetoric, grammar, mathematics, astronomy, and optics.</li>
<li>It is reasonable to ask how important Ramus is for mathematics.</li>
<li>Ramus believed that learning in mathematics had declined, and this was due in large part to Plato because of his refusal to consider applications of mathematics.</li>
<li>Having identified the problems, Ramus aimed to improve mathematical instruction.</li>
<li>Rigorous proof was of little importance to Ramus who preferred a "natural method".</li>
<li>One of the topics which Ramus believed that mathematics should be applied to was astronomy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 1515, Cuts (near Noyon), Vermandois, France. Died 26 August 1572, Paris, France.</p>
