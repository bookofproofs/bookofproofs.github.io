<p><strong>Pietro Cataldi</strong> was an Italian mathematician who wrote around 30 books on mathematics, and some on other topics.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pietro was educated in Bologna although he does not seem to have attended the university there; rather he began teaching mathematics at the age of seventeen.</li>
<li>Cataldi wrote around thirty books on mathematics, and some on other topics.</li>
<li>Cataldi calculated a list of all primes up to 750 and a list of the factorisation of all numbers up to 800.</li>
<li>Cataldi found square roots of numbers by use of an infinite series leading to an early investigation into continued fractions.</li>
<li>Cataldi begins this work with a commentary on a recently published work on the same topic, namely Pellegrino Borello's Regola e modo facilissimo di quadrare il cerchio (1609).</li>
<li>Cataldi, taking Van Ceulen's approximation, works hard at the finding of integers which nearly represent the ratio.</li>
<li>Cataldi then looks at the more general question of constructing squares and rectangles with an area equal to that of a number of given shapes with curved edges.</li>
<li>Cataldi also published an edition of Euclid's Elements.</li>
<li>It is in the definition which Cataldi gave of equidistant for this definition, which we quoted above, assumes that the given line is the locus of points at a constant distance from the second line and it also assumes that it is a straight line.</li>
<li>Cataldi tried, without success, to set up an academy of mathematics in Bologna.</li>
</ul>
<p>Born 15 April 1548, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy). Died 11 February 1626, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy).</p>
