**Qin Jiushao** was a Chinese mathematician who wrote an important study _Shushu Jiuzang_ on equations, including the [Chinese Remainder Theorem][bookofproofs$8182].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Compiled the mathematical treatise 'Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections' 
2. Compiled 'A Precious Mirror of the Four Elements' which was a textbook of mathematics for the Imperial Examination
3. Developed algebraic techniques for solving simultaneous equations, principles for solving equations involving coefficients and unknowns, and other mathematical methods
4. Pioneered the use of mathematical symbols in Chinese mathematical texts
5. Researched complex algorithms for solving simultaneous equations
6. Developed new geometry theories and methods
7. Developed an ingenious cyclic algorithm for solving polynomial equations
8. Established the principles of the mathematical calculation process
9. Introduced mathematic theories and methods from the West, applying them to Chinese mathematics

Born 1202, Puzhou (Anyue), Szechwan province, China. Died 1261, Meizhou (now Meixian), Guangtong province, China.
