**Albert** (or **Albertus Magnus**) was a German Dominican who wrote a commentary on [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621]. He was made a Saint in 1931 and, in 1941, was made patron of natural scientists.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the algebraic concepts of solving polynomial equations, including formulas for the solution of quadratic and cubic equations.
2. Established the basic rules for using the symbols +, -, ร, and รท in calculation.
3. Advanced the study of trigonometry, stating the size of the 12 main triangles and theorems to study their properties.
4. Pioneered the mathematical application of Latin squares, a concept used in basic puzzles and applied in statistics and cryptology.
5. Discovered the first proof of the result now generally known as the Fundamental theorem of algebra.
6. Comprehended the relationship between proportions and logarithms, although logarithms did not yet exist.
7. Defined the process used to find the surface area and the volume of a cone.
8. Advanced the work of Arabic mathematicians in the study of imaginary numbers, using the term amitus (Latin for "neglected").

Born about 1200, Lauingen an der Donau, Swabia (now Germany). Died 15 November 1280, Cologne, Prussia (now Germany).
