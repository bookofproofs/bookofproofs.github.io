**Yang Hui** was a Chinese mathematician who wrote several outstanding mathematical texts. These contained solutions of quadratic equations as well as Pascal's triangle and magic squares.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote《Yang Hui Suan Fa》(Triangle-Square Method or Yang Hui's Triangle), a mathematics book describing arranging magic squares mathematic processes.
2. Determined the best methods for solving problems concerning the “Pascal Triangle”.
3. Developed two variants of the ‘Pascal’ triangle, which imitated the traditional Chinese method of symbolising numbers.
4. Dealt extensively with the topics of binomial coefficients, mathematical series and Pythagorean triangles.
5. Put forward the principle of the "superposition of finite differences", which is a foundation of mathematical analysis.
6. Constructed mathematical examples to support the demonstration of certain theorems.
7. Developed methods of solving problems of cubic equations and their applications.
8. Established a four-step method to solve polynomials, including quadratic equations.
9. Introduced the “Horner's Method”, a mathematical way to simplify the process of finding roots of polynomials.
10. Circulated the concept of the ‘Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art’, a widely circulated mathematical manual in the imperial court.

Born about 1238, Qiantang (now Hangzhou), Chekiang province, China. Died about 1298, China.
