**Zhu Shijie** or **Chu Shih-Chieh** was a Chinese mathematician who developed methods for handling simultaneous equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Zhu Shijie wrote the book “Siyuan Yujian” (13th century), which was the first comprehensive algebraic work in the Chinese tradition. 
2. He introduced the magic square method for solving some problems in the Siyuan Yujian.
3. He is well known for his work on ‘Fundamental Principles of Astronomy and Mathematical Methods’ and ‘Square Arrays of Numbers and Books on the Theory of Divisors’.
4. His book was the first to discuss negative and complex numbers as solutions to algebraic problems. 
5. He also developed algorithms for a variety of mathematical problems, including the calculation of cubic equations, the calculation of spherical coordinates, and the calculation of areas.
6. He was the first to use Arabian numerals in a Chinese mathematical text. 
7. He solved the classical Chinese ‘Sunzi’ puzzle problem using the Pythagorean theorem. 
8. He invented mathematical methods for solving financial problems, such as taxation and allocation of funds.

Born about 1260, Yan-shan, near Peking (now Beijing) China. Died about 1320, Not known.
