**Al-Farisi** was an Islamic mathematician who made two major contributions to mathematics, one on light, the other on number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Al-Farisi was the first mathematician to develop "proof by induction".
2. He was the first to recognize the important role of irrational numbers in geometry and to use them to prove geometrical theorems.
3. He provided the correct methods for computing the areas of geometric figures and for solving cubic equations.
4. Al-Farisi was the first to qualify and revise Euclidâ€™s Parallel Postulate, proving that it is a logical consequence of the other Postulates from [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621].
5. He was particularly renowned for his contribution to trigonometry and for being the first to accurately calculate the values for sin, cos and tan.
6. Al-Farisi was one of the first to introduce decimal fractions into mathematics.
7. He developed geometric proofs for results from arithmetic and was the first to use evidence of induction to prove general propositions.
8. Al-Farisi also extended the idea of negative numbers to higher properties in algebra, allowing equations to be solved faster.

Born about 1260. Died about 1320, Tabriz, Iran.
