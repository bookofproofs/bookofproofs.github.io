## Chronology

### 1200
* Chinese start to use a symbol for zero.

### 1202
* [Fibonacci][bookofproofs$Fibonacci] writes "Liber abaci" Ⓣ(Book of the abacus) with arithmetic and algebra he had learnt in Arab countries. Introduces the sequence of numbers now called the "Fibonacci sequence".

### 1207
* [Bhaskara][bookofproofs$Bhaskara_II] sets up an educational institution to study Bhaskaracharya's works.

### 1217
* [Scot][bookofproofs$Scot] completes the translation from Arabic into Latin of al-Bitruji's Alpetragius the first work to present a non-Ptolemaic astronomical system.

### 1220
* [Fibonacci][bookofproofs$Fibonacci] writes "Practica geometriae" Ⓣ(Practical geometry) 


### 1225
* [Fibonacci][bookofproofs$Fibonacci] writes "Liber quadratorum" (The Book of the Square), his most impressive work. 
  * It is the first major European advance in number theory since the work of Diophantus a thousand years earlier.
* [Jordanus Nemorarius][bookofproofs$Jordanus] writes on astronomy. In mathematics he uses letters in an early form of algebraic notation.

### 1230
* [De Sacrobosco][bookofproofs$Sacrobosco] writes "Tractatus de Sphaera" a book on astronomy in four chapters, covering arithmetic, and calendar reform.

### 1247
* [Jinshao][bookofproofs$Qin_Jiushao] writes Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections containing simultaneous integer congruences and the Chinese Remainder Theorem. 
  * It considers indeterminate equations, Horner's method, areas of geometrical figures and linear simultaneous equations.

### 1248
* [Jinshao][bookofproofs$Qin_Jiushao] writes Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections containing simultaneous integer congruences and the Chinese Remainder Theorem. 
  * It considers indeterminate equations, Horner's method, areas of geometrical figures and linear simultaneous equations.
* Li Yeh writes a book which contains negative numbers, denoted by putting a diagonal stroke through the last digit.

### 1260
* [Campanus of Novara][bookofproofs$Campanus] 
  * Writes a Latin edition of "Euclid's Elements" in 15 books, becoming the standard Euclid for 200 years.
  * Writes on astronomy.

### 1261
* [Xian][bookofproofs$Jia_Xian] writes "Xiangjie Jiuzhang Suanfa" (A detailed analysis of the mathematical rules in the Nine Chapters) with the intention of explaining, and making better known, the work of Jia Xian.

### 1262
* [Al-Maghribi][bookofproofs$Al-Maghribi] lists precise astronomical observations made at the Maragha Observatory between 1262 and 1274.
* [Yang Hui][bookofproofs$Yang_Hui] writes an elementary texts on multiplication, division, root-extraction, quadratic and simultaneous equations, series, computations of areas of a rectangle, a trapezium, a circle, and other figures.

### 1264
* [Bacon][bookofproofs$Bacon] proposes to write a book on science which would be of benefit of the Church.

### 1275
* [Hui][bookofproofs$Yang_Hui] 
  * Practical mathematical rules for surveying and Continuation of ancient mathematical methods
  * writes "Cheng Chu Tong Bian Ben Mo" (Alpha and omega of variations on multiplication and division). 
  * It uses decimal fractions (in the modern form) and gives the first account of Pascal's triangle.

### 1283
* [Shoujing][bookofproofs$Guo_Shoujing] promoted to be director of the Observatory in Beijing.
