**Johannes Campanus** was an Italian mathematician who published a Latin edition of [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621]. He also wrote on astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the mathematical treatise Algorismus, which popularized Hindu-Arabic numerals in the Latin-speaking world.
2. Developed the influential Campanus of Novara theorem in spherical trigonometry, which enabled exact computation of the distance between two points on the Earth's surface.
3. Introduced the concept of the table of sines, which revolutionized the field of trigonometry.
4. Contributed to the development of the mean-speed theorem, which links the area of a plane figure to the time required to traverse that figure.
5. Improved the methods of abacus computation, speeding up the calculations of classical problems in mathematics.
6. Introduced a more efficient and accurate method of computing sections, also called the "Boethian Section."
7. Proposed a novel method of calculating the perimeter of polygon figures on the basis of circular arcs.
8. Published the influential astronomical tables in the book Theoricae novae planetarum, paving the way for accurate predictions of celestial events.

Born 1220, Novara (now Italy). Died 13 September 1296, Viterbo (now Italy).
