**Roger Bacon** was an English mathematician. His most important mathematical contribution is the application of geometry to optics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Invented a new notation of the arithmetic and geometric proportions by replacing the symbols of the Greek mathematicians.
2. Demonstrated the usefulness of issuing mathematical applications in the sciences, such as optics and perspective.
3. Used natural scientific reasoning to dispute Aristotelian philosophy.
4. Proposed a mixture of mathematics and philosophy to increase one's knowledge of the world.
5. Discovered the mean speed theorem, which can be used to calculate the speed of a body over a given time period.
6. Determined the formula for the area of a triangle, which is still used in geometry today.
7. Pioneered the use of empirical evidence to prove scientific theories.
8. Developed a new way of studying algebra patterns with the use of Hindu-Arabic numerals.
9. Discovered new ways to use trigonometry to solve navigation problems in astronomy.
10. Created the most accurate estimate of the circumference of the earth at the time.

Born 1214, Ilchester, Somerset, England. Died June 1292, Oxford, England.
