**Jordanus Nemorarius** was a German scholar who wrote several books on arithmetic, algebra, geometry and astronomy. He was among the first to use letters to replace numbers in algebraic calculations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote ‘Chapters on the Books of Numbers and Geometry’ which first systematized and documented the relationship between algebra and geometry.
2. Developed the method of solving equations by reducing them to quadratic ones.
3. Proved that the roots of a quadratic equation can be derived analytically.
4. Developed a new method of calculating polygonal numbers.
5. Developed a new method for calculating the areas of regular polygons.
6. Discovered the formula for calculating areas of polygons inscribed in circles.
7. Wrote a commentary on [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621], the first systematic commentary on any of the Greek mathematician's works.
8. Played a key role in introducing Indian numerical notations into Europe.
9. Reconstructed Euclid's Lemma 18, which was lost in its Greek translation.
10. Wrote ‘Secunda pars Algebre’ which was the first systematic treatment of algebra as a separate subject.

Born 1225, Borgentreich (near Warburg), Germany. Died 1260, At sea.
