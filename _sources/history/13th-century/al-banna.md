**Ibn al-Banna** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote a large number of works including an introduction to [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621], an algebra text and various works on astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Ibn al-Banna developed algorithms for mentally calculating the square root of certain numbers. 
2. He was the first to introduce the idea of using algebra as a tool to solve arithmetical problems. 
3. He developed the concept of “negative numbers” in order to help simplify algebraic calculations. 
4. He developed a method for solving cubic equations. 
5. He successfully applied his understanding of algebra to geometry. 
6. He introduced the concept of the sine for trigonometric calculations. 
7. He devised a new formula for calculating the volume of a pyramid and a sphere. 
8. He developed a method for calculating the surface area of an ellipse. 
9. He contributed to the development of “analytic geometry”, a method of representing algebraic equations through geometric shapes. 
10. He created a universal system to record data more accurately and improved existing systems of accounting.

Born 29 December 1256, Marrakesh, Morocco. Died 13 July 1321, Marrakesh, Morocco.
