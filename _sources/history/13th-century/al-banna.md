**Ibn al-Banna** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote a large number of works including an introduction to [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621], an algebra text and various works on astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* There is a claim that al-Banna was born in Granada in Spain and moved to North Africa for his education.
* The strong link between Granada and Morocco may account for the confusion as to which country al-Banna was a native.
* Morocco was certainly the country that al-Banna was educated in, learning the leading mathematical skills of the period.
* At the university in Fez Al-Banna taught all branches of mathematics, which at this time included arithmetic, algebra, geometry and astronomy.
* Many students studied under al-Banna in this thriving academic community.
* One difficulty with the works on mathematics is knowing how much of the material which al-Banna presents is original and how much is simply his version of work by earlier Arab mathematicians which has been lost.
* We should certainly say that al-Banna does not claim any originality and, indeed, the style of his writing would suggest that he is collecting together ideas that he has learnt from other mathematicians.
* Perhaps al-Banna's most famous work is Talkhis amal al-hisab (Summary of arithmetical operations) and the Raf al-Hijab which is al-Banna's own commentary on the Talkhis amal al-hisab.
* We refer the reader to the biography of al-Qalasadi where we present arguments to show that neither al-Banna nor al-Qalasadi were the inventors of mathematical notation.

Born 29 December 1256, Marrakesh, Morocco. Died 13 July 1321, Marrakesh, Morocco.
