**William of Ockham** was an English mathematician and philosopher best known for _Ockham's razor_, one version of which is: _It is vain to do with more what can be done with less_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the famous Occam's Razor (also known as Ockham's Razor) principle, which states that entities must not be unnecessarily multiplied beyond what is necessary.
2. Proposed the concept of relative motion in the context of physics and natural philosophy.
3. Postulated that the universe was composed of nothing but matter and motion.
4. Applied modern logical principles to philosophical debates, introducing the notion of logical atomism.
5. Developed a sophisticated algebraic analysis that combines elementary algebra and geometry.
6. Expanded on the rule of proportionality which would later form the basis of calculus.
7. Demonstrated the primacy of thought over sensory experience in understanding reality with his Theory of Formal Distinction.

Born about 1288, Ockham (near Ripley, Surrey), England. Died 9 April 1348, Munich, Bavaria (now Germany).
