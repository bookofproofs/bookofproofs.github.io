**Zhao Youqin** was a Chinese mathematician and astronomer who published work on the structure of the universe. He described how to calculate `$\pi$`.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* One source suggests that Zhao was injured in the fighting surrounding these dramatic events.
* This suggestion is reinforced by Zhao Youqin's remark in the section entitled 'Li fa gai ge' ('On Changes and Alterations (ge) of Calendrical Methods') of the first chapter of the treatise.
* In this treatise, Zhao is concerned with the structure of the universe.
* Zhao also looks at various instruments which can be used for surveying.
* One of the most interesting features of the book, however, relates to Zhao's calculation of π.

Born 26 July 1271, Poyang, now Jiangxi province, China. Died about 1335, Longyou Mountains, Zhejiang province, China.
