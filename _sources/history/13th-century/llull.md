**Ramon Llull** was a Majorcan philosopher whose logical methods influenced Leibniz.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote multiple books exploring the union of philosophy and mathematics; this included the Ars Magna and Algorithmi.
2. Developed the concept of "combinatorial analysis", a technique used to address the combination of symbols.
3. Developed logical systems which encouraged the acceptance of plurality and logical reasoning.
4. Introduced the zero symbol in Europe, allowing for significantly easier calculations and solving.
5. Was the first to propose the use of mathematical methods in arriving at religious and philosophical truth.
6. Formulated the root-squaring method, making it easier to solve quadratic equations.
7. Developed the principles of permutation and the doctrine of temporal continuity. 
8. Introduced a counting board with which to perform calculations.
9. Proposed a notation to reflect progress in the understanding and practice of algebra.
10. Was the first to recognize and prove the validity of the law of continuity and the law of homogeneity.

Born 1235, Majorca (now Spain). Died 1316, (probably) Tunis, Tunisia.
