**Shams al-Samarqandi** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote works on theology, logic, philosophy, mathematics and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Nothing is known of al-Samarqandi's life except that he composed his most important works around 1276.
* Al-Samarqandi wrote a work Risala fi adab al-bahth which discussed the method of intellectual investigation of reasoning using dialogue.
* In mathematics al-Samarqandi is famous for a short work of only 20 pages which discusses 35 of Euclid's propositions.
* Although a short work, al-Samarqandi consulted widely the works of other Islamic mathematicians before writing it.
* For example he refers to writings by al-Haytham, Omar Khayyam, al-Jawhari, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and al-Abhari.
* Not only did al-Samarqandi consult the writings of many other mathematicians before writing his short work, in turn several later mathematicians read al-Samarqandi's 20 page work and referred to it in their own writings.
* For example Qadi Zada mentions al-Samarqandi's short work on Euclid's propositions.

Born about 1250, Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Died about 1310.
