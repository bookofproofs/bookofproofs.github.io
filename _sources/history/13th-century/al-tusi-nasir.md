**Nasir al-Tusi** was an Islamic astronomer and mathematician who joined the Mongols who conquered Baghdad. He made important contributions to astronomy and wrote many commentaries on Greek texts.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a whole new scientific tradition based on logic and mathematical proofs, rather than merely copying the works of ancient Greeks.
2. Made seminal contributions to trigonometry, resulting in the development of logarithms, the sine theorem, and spherical geometry.
3. Was the first to explain the motion of the Moon in terms of uniform circular motion combined with a linear motion.
4. Developed the "Tusi Couple", a mathematical device related to the epicyclic motions of planets.
5. Known as the father of algebraic geometry, he also wrote a treatise known as "The Elements of Astronomy".
6. Developed a series of numerical astronomical tables, known as al-Tusi's Tables.
7. Pioneered a method of constructing images from curved lines to solve cubic equations and associated it with a geometric construction now known as a Tusi Couple.

Born 18 February 1201, Tus, Khorasan (now Iran). Died 26 June 1274, Kadhimain (near Baghdad now in Iraq).
