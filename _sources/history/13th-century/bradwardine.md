**Thomas Bradwardine** was an English mathematician and theologian who examined Aristotle's theories of dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theorem of mean speed in motion, showing that under uniform acceleration, the distance covered is proportional to the square of the elapsed time. 
2. Developed a formula for the sum of a geometric series. 
3. Expressed the infinite series (1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7....) in a closed form. 
4. Developed a formula for the area of a segment of a circle. 
5. Developed the first known law of motion of objects, giving rise to the modern kinematics branch of mathematics. 
6. Developed an approach to solving a cubic equation, which became the basis for the development of the modern calculus of variations. 
7. Contributed significantly to the knowledge of acceleration of bodies in the field of dynamics. 
8. Initiated the first use of ‘limits’, the theoretical basis for calculus. 
9. Wrote a treatise on logic, wherein he proved the validity of the “Law of Excluded Middle,” which expressed that a valid statement must either be true or false. 
10. Explored and clarified the concepts of “prime” and “ultimate” ratio.

Born about 1295, Chichester, England. Died 26 August 1349, Lambeth, London, England.
