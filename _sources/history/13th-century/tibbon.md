**Jacob ben Tibbon** was a French Jewish medical doctor who translated Arabic versions of Greek mathematics into Hebrew.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The Almohads expelled the Jews from Muslim Spain in 1148, and Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon together with many other learned refugees, went to the south of France.
* Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon's son, Moses ben Samuel ibn Tibbon, was born in Marseilles.
* Jacob was educated in Lunel and then studied medicine in the medical faculty of the University of Montpellier.
* Jacob ben Tibbon is himself known as a translator as well as a mathematician and an astronomer.
* Now Tibbon was much more than a translator, for he was a fine mathematician and astronomer writing original works in addition to the translations.
* For example, he wrote Jacob's Quadrant  in which he describes a quadrant of his own invention.
* Jacob ben Tibbon also wrote Luhot (Tables) a book of astronomical tables giving ascensions of certain stars at Paris.
* The Italian astronomer Andalo di Negro wrote Canones Super Almanach Profatii  in 1323 which dealt with Jacob ben Tibbon's tables in Luhot .
* Another work by Jacob ben Tibbon was Almanach Perpetuum  which, as the title indicates, was a work on the almanac.
* At the time Tibbon wrote the work both the Toledan Tables of Arzachel and the newer Alfonsine Tables created for King Alfonso X of Castile were in use.
* Tibbon appears to state that he used the Toledan Tables but Pierre Duhem criticised him for using 'old' tables instead of the latest available to him.
* Tibbon's work was used by Copernicus in forming his theories.

Born 1236, Marseilles, Spain (now France). Died 1305, Montpellier, France.
