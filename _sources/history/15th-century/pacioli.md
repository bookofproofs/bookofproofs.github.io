**Luca Pacioli** was an Italian mathematician who published the influential book _Summa_ in 1494 giving a summary of all the mathematics known at that time.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the book "Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita" (1494), which was the first published work on the double-entry bookkeeping system.
2. Was the first to describe the concept of debit and credit in accounting.
3. Presented the geometric concept of the golden ratio in his book "De Divina Proportione" (1509).
4. Contributed to the development of algebra, including introducing symbols to denote unknown numbers, demonstrating how to solve cubic equations, and introducing concepts such as the Rule of Three and the Law of Cosines.
5. Developed a mathematical language, used in his book “Particella” (1509), that could be used to solve mathematical problems.
6. Developed methods for calculating bookkeeping and trade related calculations, such as profit and loss, rate of interest, the amount of a purchase, etc.
7. Introduced the use of Roman numerals in mathematical notations. 
8. Pioneered the use of letters to represent unknowns in mathematical equations.

Born 1445, Sansepolcro (now Italy). Died 1517, Sansepolcro (now Italy).
