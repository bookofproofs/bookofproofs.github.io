**Petrus Apianus** was a German mathematician who published important popular works on astronomy and geography.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Apian wrote the influential book titled "I mprativvm astronomiae, liber primvs" which laid the foundation for modern trigonometry
2. His first printing press book, "Astronomicum Caesareum", dealt with the topics of astronomy and trigonometry
3. He wrote "Euclides' Elements in Geometria", which introduced geometry concepts to a wider audience
4. He was an editor and annotator of Clavius' commentary on [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621]
5. He invented the Apianus Planetary Calendar, which made more accurate astronomical calculations than before
6. His most famous work is the "Instrumentum Primi Mobilis". It was a treatise on astronomy and astrological computation
7. He was the first to employ decimal fractions in trigonometric calculations
