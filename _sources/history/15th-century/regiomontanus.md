**Regiomontanus** or **Johann Müller** was a German scholar who made important contributions to trigonometry and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Completion of the tables of sines, cosines and tangents in 1463.
2. Published the first book on algebra, Libellus de numerorum decimalibus, in 1472.
3. Developed an innovative planetary theory based on Copernicus's heliocentric system in 1475.
4. Conducted the reform of the Julian calendar in 1475.
5. Devised the rudiments of modern trigonometry in 1463.
6. Constructed a more advanced astronomical clock in 1471.
7. Sought to develop a mathematical solution that reconciled Plato’s geocentric system with Copernicus's heliocentric system in 1472.
8. Developed a new type of astronomical instrument called an astrolabe in 1476.

Born 6 June 1436, Unfinden (near Königsberg), Lower Franconia (now in Bayern, Germany). Died 6 July 1476, Rome (now Italy).
