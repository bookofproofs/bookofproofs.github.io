**Charles de Bouvelles** was a French priest who wrote works on geometry and philosophy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was a political leader and mathematician who developed a new form of geometry in the 17th century.
2. He introduced the theory of triangular and trapezoidal numbers which provided a means of calculating areas and lines.
3. He was the first to connect algebraic notation with geometrical diagrams.
4. He developed the concept of equation's coefficients.
5. He was the first to construct equations with irrational and imaginary numbers.
6. He solved the problem of curves of double curvature and developed a new method for solving higher-order equations.
7. He devised a method for calculating the area of any triangular figure.
8. He was the first to use infinitesimals in terms of mathematical functions.

Born 1471, Soyecourt, near Amiens, Picardy, France. Died 1553, Noyon, Picardy, France.
