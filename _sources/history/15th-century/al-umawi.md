**Al-Umawi** was a Spanish-born Islamic mathematician who wrote works on mensuration and arithmetic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Al-Umawi developed a vertical version of the astrolabe, an astronomical instrument for measuring the positions of the stars, planets and other celestial bodies.
2. He also developed a new method for equating the two parts of a chord.
3. He wrote several works on mathematics and astronomy, including a treatise entitled "Al-Tuhfa ila Usul al-Hind" ("A Gift to the Principles of Indian Mathematics").
4. He also wrote a treatise on mathematics entitled "Al-Mulakhkhas fi al-Hind" ("The Final Touch on Indian Mathematics").
5. He is credited with developing the use of sine, cosine and tangent for trigonometric calculations.
6. He is credited with introducing the concepts of spherical trigonometry to Arabic mathematics.
7. He was one of the first mathematicians to use Euclidean geometry for measuring angles, distances and areas.
8. He also developed a method for finding the solutions of equations with multiple variables.
9. He is famous for his work on quadratic equations, developing new methods for solving them.
10. He is also credited with developing various algebraic equations and inequalities.

Born about 1400, possibly Andalusia (now Spain). Died 1489, possibly Damascus, Syria.
