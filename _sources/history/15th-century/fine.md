**Oronce Fine** was a French mathematician who published a major work on mathematics and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. In 1536, Fine constructed a geometric-based representation of ellipses that enabled their easier reproduction and manipulation.
2. He also developed an early trigonometric table which he used to calculate astronomic tables.
3. Fine advanced the concept of Perspective Geometry, creating diagrams and graphs to explain the principles of perspective drawing.
4. He used his inventions to create a series of maps and illustrations of the heavens and Earth.
5. He was one of the first to realize that Earth had a spherical shape.
6. Fine wrote several treaties on geometry, mechanics, and bookkeeping, which included examples and explanations on how to use the trigonometric table.
7. He developed methods to compute the area of multiple-sided figures, which advanced the technique of integral calculus. 
8. He proposed the use of decimal fractions to replace the traditional sexagesimal fractions in order to more accurately solve mathematical problems. 
9. In 1544 he devised a way to determine the accuracy of longitude estimates. 
10. He published a work termed Stratioticum, which contained an original method of solving military problems using infinitesimal calculus.

Born 20 December 1494, Brian√ßon, France. Died 8 August 1555, Paris, France.
