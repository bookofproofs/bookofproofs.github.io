**Adam Ries** was a German mathematician who published one of the first widely available arithmetic texts.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Compiled the first written German arithmetic book, the Rechenbuch, in 1522.
2. Developed the concept of positional notation in numbers, which was used to simplify the writing of numbers in length and complexity. 
3. Introduced the multiplication algorithm, which became the basis of future calculations.
4. Developed the concept of fractions, which allowed equations to be more precise when solving problems. 
5. Employed proofs of geometric properties that went beyond Euclidean theory.
6. Created the technique known as 'compound interest' which changed the way financial calculations are performed. 
7. Developed a method for extracting square roots from numbers.
8. Described how pi can be calculated and how this could be used to solve for area and perimeter. 
9. Developed a method for trigonometric calculations that was based upon the principles of triangle sides and angles.
10. Applied mathematics to practical engineering problems, developing a system for levelling and calculating heights of roads in slopes and mounds.

Born 23 December 1492, Staffelstein (near Bamberg), Upper Franconia (now Germany). Died 30 March 1559, Annaberg, Saxony (now Annaberg-Buchholz, Germany).
