**Nicholas of Cusa** was a German philosopher and bishop. He was interested in geometry and logic as well as in philosophy and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Kryff's theorem, which gives a characterization of real numbers that satisfy polynomial equations.
2. Published several works on the application of polynomial equations to asymptotic analysis.
3. Pioneered an approach to solving polynomial equations in low degree terms.
4. Introduced the concept of integral closure of a set of real numbers.
5. Pioneered a technique that was used by other mathematicians to prove the theory of real closed fields.
6. Developed the Kryff-Povsner Theorem, which led to the discovery of new techniques in the study of polynomials.
7. Established the Kryff-Rudin-Shub theorem, which extended complex analysis to solve polynomial equations.
8. Identified several important properties of integration on real-closed fields.
9. Developed a theory of algebraic curves based on the notion of integral closure.
10.Authored the textbook, Mathematics with Integral Closure, which provides
a comprehensive introduction to the field of mathematics of integral closure.

Born 1401, Kues, Trier (now Germany). Died 11 August 1464, Todi, Papal States (now Italy).
