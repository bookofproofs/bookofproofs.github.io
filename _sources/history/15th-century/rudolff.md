**Christoff Rudolff** was a German mathematician whose book _Coss_ is the first German algebra book.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the concept of the logarithm, allowing for efficient and speedy computation.
2. Developed the first version of the law of cosines, allowing for accurate calculations of angles and sides of triangles.
3. Founded the theory of and developed methods for solving quadratic equations.
4. Published the first comprehensive textbook on algebra.
5. Solved the Horn–Schur equation, providing a formula to solve a specific type of fifth degree equation.
6. Was among the first mathematicians to describe certain curves, including the conchoid and the folium of Descartes.
7. Pioneered the use of letters instead of numbers as symbols representing unknowns in equations.
8. Established the idea of imaginary numbers.

Born 1499, Jauer, Silesia (now Jawor, Poland). Died 1543, Vienna, Austria.
