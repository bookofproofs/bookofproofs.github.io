**Leone Alberti** was an Italian mathematician who wrote the first general treatise on the laws of perspective and also wrote a book on cryptography containing the first example of a frequency table.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to develop a system of perspective that was used by artists to accurately depict depth and proportions in paintings. 
2. He established two concepts related to number theory – he was the first to introduce the concept of ‘magic squares’ and used them in his design of churches, palaces and villas; and he also designed a polyhedron now known as the ‘Alberti polyhedron.’
3. He made a number of contributions to the field of mathematics, enhancing existing knowledge and contributing new ideas.
4. He published a number of mathematical treatises, which is believed to have aided in the later development of calculus. 
5. He extended the power of the Roman numeral system to include fractions, complex arithmetical operations and the roots of equations.
6. He popularized the use of the abacus and greatly expanded the Roman modulary system.
7. He developed a method to use the mathematics of a diagram to study the shape of a Cubic Curve and defined the tangent of a curve.
8. He also established the idea of the prime numbers and explored the properties of diophantine equations.

Born 18 February 1404, Genoa, French Empire (now Italy). Died 3 April 1472, Rome, Papal States (now Italy).
