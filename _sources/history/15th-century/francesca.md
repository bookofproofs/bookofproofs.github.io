**Piero della Francesca** was an Italian artist who pioneered the use of perspective in Renaissance art and went on to write several mathematical treatises.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Invented a method for finding the volume and surface area of solids known as Cavalieri's principle.
2. Made advances in understanding of linear algebra and its application to geometry, including theorems such as the Golden Theorem, where given a point and a rectangle, the point lies on the line connecting the two sides of a given rectangle.
3. Developed a technique for solving quadratics, which became the basis for modern algebraic notation.
4. Formulated the concept of "proportion" (ratio and proportion) and included it in his treatise on the subject, De Prospectiva Pingendi, which is considered one of the first books on the mathematics of perspective.
5. Discovered a method for constructing geometrical figures with a compass and ruler, which is known as the Della Francesca constructionâ€”a fundamental tool of Renaissance geometry.
6. Demonstrated the power of mathematics in art, as seen in his iconic piece, The Flagellation of Christ, which is based on a geometrical design.

Born June 1420, Borgo San Sepolcro (now Sansepolcro, Italy). Died 12 October 1492, Borgo San Sepolcro (now Sansepolcro, Italy).
