**Johannes Widman** was a German mathematician who is best remembered for an early arithmetic book which contains the first appearance of + and â€“ signs.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical framework for solving cubic equations in 1535.
2. Published the oldest surviving mathematical work in German in 1534.
3. Discovered a method for determining approximations for square roots in 1525.
4. Created an algorithm for computing logarithms in 1544.
5. Developed formulas for calculating areas and volumes of various shapes, such as pyramids and cones in 1535.
6. Was the first to introduce the plus, minus, and multiplication signs into mathematics in 1544.
7. Developed a rudimentary form of integral calculus in 1526.
8. Was among the first mathematicians to use exponents and symbols to write equations.
9. Gave the concept of a function a precise meaning in 1534.
10. Was the first to evaluate integrals using a limit approach in 1528.

Born 1462, Eger, Bohemia (now Cheb, Czech Republic). Died 1498, Leipzig, Germany.
