**Nicolas Chuquet** was a French mathematician who wrote the earliest French algebra book.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Created the concept of what we now know as decimal fractions and decimal notation.
2. Developed a comprehensive algebraic notation that made it possible to express arithmetic operations.
3. Developed a special trigonometric formula to calculate a right triangleâ€™s unknown side lengths.
4. Proposed a method for calculating the area of figures composed of regular polygons with curved sides like the circle.
5. Constructed a geometrical method for solving cubic equations.
6. Discovered a new rule for solving certain simultaneous equations.
7. Discovered a method of determining the geometric properties of other conic sections.
8. Discovered a formula for finding the square root of any number.

Born 1445, Paris, France. Died 1488, Lyon, France.
