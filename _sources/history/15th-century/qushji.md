### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He wrote a text titled Al-Kashi which discussed arithmetic, algebra, and geometry topics.  
2. He wrote a text titled Sharh That, which included topics related to trigonometry. 
3. He wrote a text titled Sanat al-Ashkal, which discussed topics related to spherical astronomy, such as the shapes of the heavenly bodies. 
4. He wrote a text titled Tazsir al-Shakl, which discussed topics related to observational astronomy. 
5. He wrote a text titled Al-Turuq al-Saniya, which was a pioneering work in the field of observational astronomy. 
6. He solved a polynomial equation of degree 14 and composed a book on algebra named Muhammas, which was improved on by later mathematicians. 
7. He introduced the use of decimal fractions in Persian geography, alongside other topics such as time measurement and barometry.
