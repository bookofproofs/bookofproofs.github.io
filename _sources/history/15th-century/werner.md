### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered a method of determining longitude at sea using the positions of known stars. 
2. Established a modern system of geographical coordinates based on latitudes and longitudes. 
3. Introduced ‘Projective Geometry’ and developed the concept of a spherical triangle.
4. Created the first model of a rotating Earth in astronomy.
5. Published his famous book ‘On the Beautiful and Perfect Motion of the World’ in 1522.
