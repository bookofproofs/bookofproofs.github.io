**Leonardo da Vinci** was an Italian artist and scholar who had many talents in addition to his painting. He worked on mechanics, though geometry was his main love. He was involved in hydrodynamics, anatomy, mechanics, mathematics and optics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Created detailed drawings of mathematics and geometric principles.
2. Developed new techniques for solving mathematical problems.
3. Devised a system of mathematical proportions and measurements.
4. Developed a method of indeterminate analysis to facilitate mathematical operations.
5. Outlined a new approach to perspective that incorporated mathematical concepts.
6. Was the first to demonstrate the application of mathematics to the physical sciences.
7. Discovered the logarithmic law of refraction of light.
8. Was one of the first to recognize the concepts of mathematical law and order in nature.
9. Suggested the principle of the golden ratio in his drawings.
10. Investigated mathematical theories of propulsion for air and water travel.

Born 15 April 1452, Vinci, near Empolia (now Italy). Died 2 May 1519, Cloux, Amboise, France.
