Copernicus was a Polish astronomer and mathematician who was a proponent of the view of an Earth in daily motion about its axis and in yearly motion around a stationary sun. This theory profoundly altered later workers' view of the universe, but was rejected by the Catholic church.

Born 19 February 1473 ToruÅ, Poland. Died 24 May 1543 Frauenburg (now Frombork), Poland.
