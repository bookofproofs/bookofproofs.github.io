**Copernicus** was a Polish astronomer and mathematician whose theory that the Earth moved around the Sun profoundly altered later workers' view of the universe, but was rejected by the Catholic church.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a model of the solar system where the Sun, not the Earth, is at the center, which was foundational to the subsequent development of modern astronomy.
2. Introduced a mathematical technique of describing the motion of celestial bodies by making use of uniform, or constant-speeded, circular motions.
3. Demonstrated that the apparent amplitude of the planets' revolutions could be explained using calculations of orbital times and distances.
4. Developed an equation that relates the frequency of a planet's orbit to its mean distance from the Sun.
5. Published a work titled "De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium" ("On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres"), which allowed for a comprehensive understanding of how the universe works and helped popularize the heliocentric model of the universe.

Born 19 February 1473, Toru≈Ñ, Poland. Died 24 May1543, Frauenburg (now Frombork), Poland.
