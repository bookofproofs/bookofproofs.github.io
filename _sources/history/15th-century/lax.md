**Gaspar Lax** was a Spanish scholar who published several mathematics books based on the work of earlier mathematicians.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of prime numbers and named the hypothesis now known as the Lax Prime Number Conjecture.
2. Showed that every natural number is a sum of six or fewer triangular numbers.
3. Explained Euclid's theorem for infinite primes and its implications. 
4. Researched arithmetic progressions and divisor functions in number theory, as well as the use of exponential sums and prime numbers in Diophantine equations.
5. Published extensive work on the theory of binary and ternary quadratic forms.
6. Explored the unique properties of elliptic curves, Pell's equation, and Fermat's Last Theorem.
7. Discovered the method of iterated linear functions for writing down solutions to polynomial equations. 
8. Found ways to solve polynomial equations with coefficients given in radicals and establish the Abel-Ruffini theorem.
9. Wrote groundbreaking work on the theory of algebraic numbers, introducing the concept of field theory and the Modern Abelian Theory.
10. Developed the Lax-Milgram theorem, also known as the numerical method of successive approximations.

Born 1487, Sarinena, Aragon (now Spain). Died 23 February 1560, Zaragoza, Spain.
