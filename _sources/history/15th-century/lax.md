**Gaspar Lax** was a Spanish scholar who published several mathematics books based on the work of earlier mathematicians.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Lax remained in Paris and taught there at the Collège de Calvi during 1507 and 1508.
* After these two years at the Collège de Calvi, Lax transferred to the Collège de Montaigu, one of the leading theological colleges of Paris, where he studied under Maior but also was an important teacher at the College.
* In 1517 Lax returned to teach again at the Collège de Calvi which he did for the next six years.
* In that year foreigners were asked to leave the Collège de Calvi and shortly after this Lax decided to return to his native land.
* In 1524 Lax left France and returned to Spain.
* Lax published several good mathematics books based on works by Boethius, Euclid, Jordanus and Campanus.
* This school seems to have originated with Lax and other students of Maior who studied in Paris, then returned to Spain.
* Lax was also known as a philosopher, often called the 'Prince of Sophists'.
* However, one of Lax's students wrote that he heard Lax express regret late in his career that he had spent so much time on 'such trivialities'.

Born 1487, Sarinena, Aragon (now Spain). Died 23 February 1560, Zaragoza, Spain.
