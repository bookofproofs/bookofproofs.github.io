**Georg Peurbach** was an Austrian astronomer who published observations as well as a textbook on trigonometric calculation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a detailed series of astronomical tables and planetary models that accurately tracked the motion of the planets across the sky.
2. Composed an influential treatise on astronomy, the 'Theoricae novae planetarum', which became a major source of mathemtical astronomy in the following centuries.
3. Produced a book in trigonometry, the 'Tabulae directionum' which dealt with the computation of tangents and other operations related to trigonometry.
4. Created elegant mathematical proofs of the conditions for the cycloid and the parabola, the latter with the assumption of a constant acceleration for falling bodies. 
5. Advanced the practice of astronomy and mathematics through his teachings and his collaboration with the famous mathematician and astronomer, Regiomontanus.

Born 30 May1423, Peuerbach, Austria. Died 8 April 1461, Vienna, Austria.
