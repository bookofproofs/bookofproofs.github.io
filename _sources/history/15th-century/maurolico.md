**Francisco Maurolico** was an Italian Benedictine who wrote important books on Greek mathematics. He also worked on geometry, the theory of numbers, optics, conics and mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a comprehensive list of Euclidean axioms which set the foundation for modern geometry.
2. Wrote the influential work “Trattato dei Triangoli”, which was the first to consider the properties of logarithms.
3. Published the first proof of the square root of two being irrational.
4. Wrote influential works on solid geometry and developed technics later used to explore conic sections.
5. Discovered the so-called “Maurolico’s Theorem”, an algebraic formula for the solution of determinants.
6. Made various breakthroughs in the fields of analysis and applied mathematics.
7. Wrote a treatise on arithmetical progressions and created several popular mathematical theorems.
8. Provided the first accurate methods to calculate the value of pi.
9. Developed mathematical methods used to measure the earth’s circumference.
10. Established numerous relationships between algebra and trigonometry.

Born 16 September 1494, Messina, Kingdom of Sicily (now Italy). Died 22 July 1575, Messina, Kingdom of Sicily (now Italy).
