**Estienne de la Roche** as a French mathematician who published an arithmetic book with good notation for powers and roots.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the first school of Mathematics in France and trained many students.
2. Authored ‘Tables of Arithmetic’ which was the first attempt to arrange the fundamentals of mathematics in the form of tables.
3. Authored ‘French Advantages’, a version of Euclid’s Elements which had data presented in a more simplified form.
4. Proposed the geometric construction of Regular Polygons using an unmarked straight edge.
5. Composer of ‘The New Science’, where the theory of the decimal fractions was discussed.
6. Created the Paris Meridian, a standard of time measurement and thereby laid the foundation for the modern metre bar. 
7. Developed mathematical tables for conversions of measurements between units of measurement. 
8. Assisted in the creation of a model for a calculating clock where logarithms were applied to solve arithmetic problems.

Born about 1470, Lyon, France. Died about 1530, France.
