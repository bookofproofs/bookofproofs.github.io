**Scipione del Ferro** was an Italian mathematician who is famous for being the first to find a formula to solve a cubic equation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Successfully found a clever way to solve cubic equations by employing the techniques of algebraic completeness that was later known as “del Ferro’s square root algorithm.”
2. Showed that although the familiar rule for solving quadratic equations- the “rule of double false position”- is accurate, a more efficient method exists that uses the rearrangement of terms and divisions.
3. Developed an algebraic technique to solve binomial equations which was known as “del Ferro’s rule.”
4. Successfully found the numerical value before others to the positive root of one of the cubic equations proposed by Cardano in 1545.
5. Demonstrated how to approximate roots of equations, making approximations closer and closer without having to actually solve the equations.

Born 6 February 1465, Bologna (now Italy). Died 5 November 1526, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy).
