**Michael Stifel** was a German mathematician who invented logarithms independently of Napier using a totally different approach.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the book Arithmetica integra in 1544, which was the first book to define the concept of exponentiation.
2. Provided proofs for many algebraic and trigonometric equations, including the law of cosines, and showed that by using three points defining a triangle it is possible to solve for the third side of the triangle.
3. Published a book in 1553 which was a comprehensive survey of all the mathematics known at the time, which enabled students to get a comprehensive idea of the mathematical world.
4. Discovered and investigated the divisibility properties of integers.
5. Proposed the use of decimal fractions instead of fractions with a numerator and denominator.
6. Solved cubic equations using the identities of reduplication and cubation.
7. Developed the concept of logarithms, which helped simplify calculations.
8. Established a way to calculate the surface area of a sphere using integral calculus.
9. Outlined how related rates could be used to solve a variety of mathematical problems.
10. Created the concept of continuity in calculus, which was eventually formulated into the theory of the calculus.

Born 1487, Esslingen, Germany. Died 19 April 1567, Jena, Germany.
