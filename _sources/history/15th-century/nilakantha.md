**Nilakantha** was a mathematician and astronomer from South India who wrote texts on both astronomy and infinite series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an approximation for the value of pi—known as the Nilakantha Series—as “3 + 4/(2 × 3 × 4) - 4/(4 × 5 × 6) + 4/(6 × 7 × 8) - 4/(8 × 9 × 10) ... + (-1)n-1(4n-2 x 4n-1 x 4n)".
2. Resolved a number of trigonometric equations and formulae related to Surya Siddhanta, an ancient astronomical text.
3. Derived three laws of planetary motion with respect to eclipses, referred to as Nilakantha's law of eclipses.
4. Described a geocentric cosmology with an intricate system of system of spherical layers around earth with celestial bodies travelling along the outermost layer.
5. Came up with the idea of heliocentric cosmology with the Earth and all other planets revolving around the Sun.

Born 14 June 1444, Trikkantiyur (near Tirur), Kerala, India. Died 1544, India.
