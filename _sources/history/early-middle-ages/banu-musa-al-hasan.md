**Al-Hasan Banu Musa** was one of the three Bana Musa brothers. He wrote about the ellipse.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the earliest known paper-based mathematical treatise, entitled Book of Total Explanation of the Science of Convention (Kitab al-Istikmâl fî 'ilm al-Hisâb).
2. Developed a unique notation for fractional expressions, enabling more precise computation.
3. Developed a method for solving cubic equations.
4. Developed a set of three rules for the construction of a parabola by intersecting two circles and constructing a segment from a given point.
5. Constructed a two-dimensional model for solving a case of Diophantine terms.
6. Created a number of statements that relate to Euclidean geometry.
7. Constructed a procedure for calculating the volume of a sphere.
8. Developed a technique for calculating the area of any triangle.
9. Solved a number of geometrical problems by applying purely algebraic means.
10. Wrote an essay that uses trigonometry to determine acute angles on three-dimensional figures.

Born about 810, Baghdad, Iraq. Died after 873, Baghdad, Iraq.
