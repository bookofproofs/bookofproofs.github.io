**Al-Baghdadi** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote about different systems of arithmetic in a work of great importance in the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored Introduction to the Science of Jurisprudence, a compendium of Islamic legal scholarship which contributed to the development of Islamic jurisprudence.
2. Deployed geometrical reasoning and linear algebra to address the study of inheritance laws in Islamic law.
3. Authored Sermon on Calculating Inheritance Law, one of the earliest Arabic works on the mathematics of inheritance, which has become a foundational text amongst subsequent Islamic scholars. 
4. Developed new models for processing financial transactions involving Islamic legal principles.
5. Produced several mathematical treatises and commentaries on Euclid’s Elements, helping to expand the existing knowledge around algebraic theories.
6. Maintained a deep interest in mathematical sciences and even adopted geometric theories and equations in his commentaries on Islamic law.
7. Constructed new concepts of mathematical analysis and computations based on ancient Islamic texts.
8. Demonstrated a keen interest in problems related to Islamic inheritance, and Arabic geometry, where he directed different applications to solve complicated issues.

Born about 980, Baghdad, Iraq. Died 1037.
