   * Gives a description of the universe which is of historical importance in understanding Jaina cosmology and mathematics.

### 575
* [Varahamihira][bookofproofs$Varahamihira] discovers a version of Pascal's triangle and works on magic squares.
   * Writes "Pancasiddhantika" (The Five Astronomical Canons) treatise on mathematical astronomy which summarizes five lost earlier astronomical treatises, namely the Surya, Romaka, Paulisa, Vasistha and Paitamaha siddhantas. 

### 609
* [Yativrsabha][bookofproofs$Yativrsabha]'s work "Tiloyapannatti" gives various units for measuring distances and time and also describes the system of infinite time measures.

* [Brahmagupta][bookofproofs$Brahmagupta] 
   * Writes "Brahmasphutasiddhanta" and "Khandakhadyaka" 
   * Understanding of arithmetics beyond that of others of the period, e.g. "The product or quotient of two debts is one fortune.", "When zero is added to a number or subtracted from a number, the number remains unchanged; and a number multiplied by zero becomes zero."
   * Trials to extend arithmetics: "Zero divided by zero is zero."

   * Writes "Commentary on Euclid's Elements" 
   * Examples of early attempts by Muslim mathematicians to adopt Euclid's methods (tries to "prove" Euclid's definition 5 (equal ratio) and definition 7 (greater ratio)).
* [Govindasvami][bookofproofs$Govindasvami] writes the "Bhasya", a commentary on the "Mahabhaskariya" Ⓣ(The big book of [Bhaskara][bookofproofs$Bhaskara_I]).
   * Approximation to the trigonometric sine function by means of a rational fraction.

   * Claims to have proven that `$x^3+y^3=z^3$` is impossible for whole numbers `$x,y,z$`, later becoming known as a special case of Fermat's Last Theorem.
