**Al-Khujandi** was an Islamic astronomer and mathematician. He made accurate astronomical observations and may have made some advances in trigonometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theorem known as Al-Khujandi’s Inequality, which is still taught today.
2. Constructed a table of sine and cosine values for angles with a given vertex of 1/2 degree.
3. Developed a new method for calculating π (pi) to two decimal places in accuracy, which was more accurate than any previous method.
4. Performed advanced geometric calculations and computed an estimate of the apex angle of a 36-sided figure.
5. Discovered that two simple geometric figures - the equilateral triangle and the regular hexagon - were related to one another mathematically.
6. Demonstrated how the paths of the stars could be used to calculate longitude and time.
7. Demonstrated how certain problems in optics could be solved using mathematics.
8. Constructed the first quadrant of a large astronomical table including the right ascension and declination of the stars in the sky.

Born about 940, Khujand, Tajikistan. Died 1000.
