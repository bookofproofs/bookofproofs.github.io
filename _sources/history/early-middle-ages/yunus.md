**Ibn Yunus** was an Islamic mathematician known for his astronomical observations and for his many trigonometrical and astronomical tables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ibn Yunus was closely connected with the Fatimids and two Caliphs supported his scientific work.
* Although there is uncertainty about the instruments that ibn Yunus used, it is claimed by early writers that al-Aziz provided ibn Yunus with at least some instruments.
* Famed for his astronomical observations, ibn Yunus was also an astrologer but he is most famous for his many trigonometrical and astronomical tables.
* Of course it was very reasonable for a Caliph to support the type of astronomical work that ibn Yunus was undertaking.
* For most of his 20 year reign he worked towards this aim while ibn Yunus toiled on his astronomical work.
* Certainly al-Hakim supported ibn Yunus in his astronomical work, although it is hard to determine the strength of that support.
* Perhaps al-Hakim's interest in astrology meant that he favoured ibn Yunus who is reported by his biographers to have devoted considerable amounts of time to making astrological predictions.
* Ibn Yunus and al-Hakim were both eccentrics, although al-Hakim's eccentricities were more damaging, while ibn Yunus's sound rather typical of someone totally absorbed in academic pursuits.
* However, probably because of his interest in astrology, al-Hakim kept some astronomical instruments in his house overlooking Cairo and we know that on at least one occasion ibn Yunus observed Venus from al-Hakim's house.
* Ibn Yunus's major work, an astronomical handbook, was al-Zij al-Hakimi al-kabir.
* 'Al-kabir' means 'large' which is apt and 'al-Hakimi' means that the work is dedicated to Caliph al-Hakim who certainly supported ibn Yunus.
* There are lists of observations made by Yunus and also observations made by his predecessors.
* We can confirm, using modern knowledge of the positions of the planets, that ibn Yunus was exactly right in his description and that the distance of one third of a degree that he gives is again exactly right.
* We gathered to observe this eclipse at al-Qarafa, in the Mosque of Ibn Nasr al Maghribi.
* Ibn Yunus gives tables to convert dates between these calendars.
* Many other tables have been attriributed to ibn Yunus.
* Ibn Yunus's tables, if such they are, contain over 34000 entries ...
* The author notes that ibn Yunus used data for these tables that he had collected for the Hakimi Zij.
* The high degree of accuracy displayed by these tables suggests to D A King that ibn Yunus used systems of nonlinear interpolation.
* Perhaps it is worth mentioning that, contrary to claims which are often made, there is no evidence to suggest that ibn Yunus used a pendulum for time measurements.
* Ibn Yunus predicted the date of his own death to be in seven days time when he was in good health.

Born 950, Egypt. Died 1009, Fustat, Egypt.
