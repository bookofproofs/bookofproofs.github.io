**Ibn Yunus** was an Islamic mathematician known for his astronomical observations and for his many trigonometrical and astronomical tables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He made significant progress in trigonometry, discovering the sine functions, tables of tangents and cotangents, and the use of sine and other trigonometric functions in astronomical calculations.
2. He accurately measured the Earth's radius and circumference, refining existing knowledge of spherical geometry and the practical application of these calculations.
3. He pioneered methods of calculating pi accurately, contributing to the development of the approximate formula 3.1416 (often used to calculate the circumference of a circle).
4. He was the first to apply the mathematical principles of combination to astronomy, enabling astrological observations to be made with more accuracy.
5. He also helped develop methods for calculating the position of stars and planets, thus enabling more accurate navigation of sea vessels.
6. He made significant advancements in interpolation techniques and was the first to calculate the difference between the mean tropical year and the sidereal year, which is the length of time it takes the Earth to make a full rotation on its axis.

Born 950, Egypt. Died 1009, Fustat, Egypt.
