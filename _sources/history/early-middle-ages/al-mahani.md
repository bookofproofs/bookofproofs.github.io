**Al-Mahani** was an Islamic mathematician who tried to solve some of Archimedes' problems on cutting up spheres.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He wrote a work entitled Maqalat al-Jabr wa 'l-Muqabalah, which contained the first systematic treatment of quadratic equations. 
2. He also wrote a treatise on Euclidean geometry which contained the theorem known as "al-Mahani's theorem".
3. He developed a novel method of extracting the cube root of numbers.
4. He was the first to use integral calculus in order to find the area under a curve. 
5. He developed a general formula for solving algebraic equations of the form Ax2 + Bx = C. 
6. He discovered an infinite geometric series that converges to a sum. 
7. He derived a formula for dividing a line segment into two parts with given ratios
8. He wrote a treatise on circles and spherical geometry.

Born about 820, Mahan, Kerman, Persia (now Iran). Died 880, Baghdad, Iraq.
