**Al-Mahani** was an Islamic mathematician who tried to solve some of Archimedes' problems on cutting up spheres.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We do know a little about al-Mahani's work in astronomy from Ibn Yunus's astronomical handbook al-Zij al-Hakimi al-kabir.
* In this work Ibn Yunus quotes from writings by al-Mahani, which have since been lost, which describe observations which al-Mahani made between the years 853 and 866.
* At least we have accurate dating of al-Mahani's life from this source.
* It gives a full account of the Arabic literature which was available in the 10th  century and in particular mentions al-Mahani, not for his work in astronomy, but rather for his work in geometry and arithmetic.
* However the work which al-Mahani did in mathematics may well have been motivated by various problems of an astronomical nature.
* We know that some of al-Mahani's work in algebra was motivated by trying to solve problems due to Archimedes.
* It was Omar Khayyam, giving an important historical description of algebra, who puts al-Mahani's work into context.
* It would be too easy to say that since al-Mahani has proposed a method of solution which he could not carry through then his work was of little value.
* However, this, as Omar Khayyam is well aware, is not so at all and the fact that al-Mahani conceived the idea of reducing problems such as duplicating the cube to problems in algebra was an important step forward.
* A number of works by al-Mahani have survived, in particular commentaries which he wrote on parts of Euclid's Elements.

Born about 820, Mahan, Kerman, Persia (now Iran). Died 880, Baghdad, Iraq.
