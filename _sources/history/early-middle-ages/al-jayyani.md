**Al-Jayyani** was an Islamic mathematician working in Spain. He wrote important commentaries on [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621] and he wrote the first treatise on spherical trigonometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the concept of mathematical induction and created the famous geometric series and its proof.
2. Developed a systematic method for solving linear and quadratic equations.
3. Discovered a method for extracting roots, now known as the 'method of al-Jayyani'.
4. Found a method for determining all the real zeroes of any third order polynomial.
5. Discovered the law of cosines in spherical trigonometry.
6. Wrote a detailed work on Euclidean geometry, including theorems and proofs of geometric objects such as circles and triangles.
7. Proposed a set of geometric problems, including one related to the trisector theorem.
8. Formulated a version of Pascal's triangle.
9. Calibrated an astrolabe, a type of astronomical tool.
10. Compiled an extensive work on arithmetic, algebra, and geometry.

Born 989, Cordoba, Andalusia (now Spain). Died after 1079, possibly Ja√©n, Andalusia (now Spain).
