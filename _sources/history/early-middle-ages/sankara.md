**Sankara Narayana** was an Indian astronomer and mathematician. He wrote a commentary on the work of Bhaskara I.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Sankara-Narayana method of extracting square roots of higher degree equations.
2. Contributed to the field of applied number theory by resolving problems related to indeterminate equations.
3. Developed a general numerical method to find the solutions of linear and quadratic equations with an unlimited number of variables.
4. Defined the Mathematical Theory of Probability, formulating the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion.
5. Extended the techniques of harmonic analysis to analyze non-linear phenomena.
6. Developed a new type of binomial congruence theory and also developed the theory of quadratic congruences.
7. Developed solutions for unstable and regular periodic solutions for functional equations, known as the Sankara-Narayana method.

Born about 840, India. Died about 900, India.
