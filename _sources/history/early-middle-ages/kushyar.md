**Kushyar ibn Labban** was a Persian astronomer who wrote an early work on Hindu numerals.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the algebraic solutions of linear and quadratic equations, latifiyya (sum of three cubes problem).
2. Highlighted the role of negative numbers in solving equations, providing clear instructions for solving complicated cubic equations.
3. Developed sophisticated solutions for mathematical problems of spherical geometry, astronomy, and astrology.
4. Developed general formulas to calculate the area of the triangle, semicircle, and circle.
5. Created mathematical instruments for surveying, navigation and map making.
6. Compiled a comprehensive mathematical treatise, Sindhind, which contained hundreds of problems and solutions.
7. Wrote a treatise on mathematical astronomy, which contained solutions to problems of converting stellar positions from one system to another.
8. Discovered the earliest known solutions of "Diophantine equations," equations that involve only whole numbers.
9. Developed methods for calculating the volume of complicated solids
10. Pioneered the application of mathematical techniques to solve problems in philosophy, physics, and medicine.

Born 971, Gilan (now in Iran). Died 1029, Baghdad (now in Iraq).
