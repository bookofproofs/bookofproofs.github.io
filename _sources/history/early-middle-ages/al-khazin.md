**Al-Khazin** was an Islamic mathematician who worked on number theory and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He wrote a commentary on [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621] with an additional volume on the fourth book of Euclid's work.
2. He composed the most comprehensive and accurate Islamic geometry textbook, an edited version of Euclid's works.
3. He improved some of Euclid's theorems, particularly those that were related to the theory of proportions. 
4. He developed the concept of summing a geometric series.
5. He developed algebraic and geometrical solutions to quadratic equations. 
6. He explained irrationality and formulated a mathematical proof of the Pythagorean theorem. 
7. He is credited with first using a decimal numbering system.
8. He showed that the angles in a quadrilateral are greater than two right angles and gave a formula to calculate them. 
9. He provided the basis for modern trigonometry by inventing a table of sine values and introducing versa sines and cotangents. 
10. He studied various numerical substitution techniques and used them to solve polynomial equations.

Born about 900, Khurasan (eastern Iran). Died about 971, possibly Rayy.
