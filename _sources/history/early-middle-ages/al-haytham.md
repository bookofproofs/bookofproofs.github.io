**Al-Haytham** is also known as **Alhazen**. He was an Islamic mathematician who wrote early works on optics as well as geometry and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the foundation for the science of optics with his groundbreaking work on vision and optical illusions, which included the principle of the pinhole camera.
2. Discovered the laws of refraction and deduced that the eye sees objects based on the reception of light rays.
3. Developed a scientific approach to experimentally test hypotheses, allowing him to accurately measure the density and transmittance of light.
4. Developed the concept of the scientific method and stressed the importance of experimentation and observation in the pursuit of knowledge.
5. Investigated the effects of light on the eye and established that light travels in straight lines.
6. Developed a system for determining the intensity of light at different points in a medium, using the concept of the current of color.
7. Developed the first description of the modern camera obscura, which is used to explain the formation of images on planes.
8. Initiated the field of physical astronomy with his work on celestial mechanics, which sought to explain and examine the motion of celestial bodies.
9. Demonstrated the mechanics of the rainbow formation, becoming the first scientist to explain the phenomenon and its colors.
10. Demonstrated the phenomenon of infinitesimal calculus and applied it to the analysis of shape, size and motion.

Born 965, (possibly) Basra, Persia (now Iraq). Died 1040, (possibly) Cairo, Egypt.
