**Sinan ibn Thabit** was the son and father of other Islamic mathematicians. He is more important for his contributions to medicine than to mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Sinan ibn Thabit ibn Qurra was the first to treat geometry as an independent branch of mathematics.
2. He introduced the concepts of the musculoskeletal theorem, the sine-sine theorem, and the proof of theta identities.
3. He was the first to identify the nine sections of a quadrilateral and the three primary types of conic sections.
4. He gave a general algorithm for solving all types of third-order equations.
5. He was the first to discover generalizations of theorems of Pythagoras, such as the Pythagorean-like theorem for three-dimensional spaces and the reduced Pythagorean theorem.
6. He was involved in the development of method of exhaustion, which was used to approximate the formulas for areas and volumes.
7. He also devised fundamental formulas for trigonometric functions and studied surface integrals.
8. He was the first to introduce a conceptual overview of quadratic equations.
9. He proved the equality of the parallelogram and trapezoid areas.
10. He derived the formula for the sum of the series of squares and cubes of natural numbers.

Born about 880. Died 943, Baghdad, (now in Iraq).
