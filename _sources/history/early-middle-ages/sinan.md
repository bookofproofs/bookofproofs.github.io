**Sinan ibn Thabit** was the son and father of other Islamic mathematicians. He is more important for his contributions to medicine than to mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Although Sinan was extremely eminent in medicine his contributions to mathematics were somewhat less major but he still deserves a place in this archive as a contributor to mathematics in this remarkable family of scholars.
* Thabit ibn Qurra, Sinan's father, was a member of the Sabian sect.
* Of course being worshipers of the stars meant that there was strong motivation for the study of astronomy and the sect produced many quality astronomers and mathematicians such as Thabit himself.
* Sinan was trained in medicine, a topic which his father had studied in Baghdad.
* His father's patron was the Caliph, al-Mu'tadid, one of the greatest of the 'Abbasid caliphs, and Sinan was brought up at the court where his father held the role of court astronomer.
* Sinan's father Thabit died in 901 and the caliph al-Mu'tadid died the following year.
* Historians argue whether al-Mu'tadid was poisoned in a palace intrigue, but even if he was not this is an indication of the atmosphere in the court where Sinan lived.
* By this time Sinan was a man of about 22 years of age but, despite having great medical skills, he seems to have held no positions at this time.
* He ruled until 908 and Sinan certainly enjoyed a period of great cultural activity in Baghdad which was home to many intellectuals.
* He was a weak leader but his coming to power saw Sinan achieve his first major position in which he directed the hospitals and all medical activities in Baghdad.
* Although the government in Baghdad slowly lost control, Sinan achieved the respect of all the factions.
* Sinan faced a totally different type of regime, for al-Qahir persecuted the Sabians.
* Sinan tried to preserve his position by becoming Muslim but this was not sufficient to allow him to continue in Baghdad and he fled to Khurasan.
* This allowed Sinan to return to Baghdad but, in 935, the final political crisis occurred and ar-Radi was forced to hand over most of his power to the ambitious general ibn Ra'iq.
* Sinan left Baghdad again to move this time to Wasit on the Tigris.
* Despite his high profile medical career, Sinan seems not to have written any works on medicine.
* However Sinan's political work in which he set out his ideas for a government modelled on Plato's Republic were criticised by the historian and traveller al-Mas'udi who known as the "Herodotus of the Arabs".

Born about 880. Died 943, Baghdad, (now in Iraq).
