**Thabit ibn Qurra** was an important Islamic mathematician who worked on number theory, astronomy and statics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the law of angular velocity change for a rotating part of a sphere.
2. Developed geometric theorems including the theorem of Thabit ibn Qurra, which allows one to find the area of any triangle.
3. Devised a simple equation to calculate the surface of an ellipse.
4. Discovered a method to precisely calculate the value of pi (3.14159265358979).
5. Wrote extensively on the geometric figures called Reuleaux polygons, outlining their properties and applications.
6. Developed numerous hyperbolic curves termed Thabit curves.
7. Invented a mechanical device for generating solid figures related to geometry.
8. Established algebraic rules for understanding and calculating the volume of a cone.
9. Determined that any whole number could be expressed as a sum of a square, a cube, and a fourth power.
10. Conducted pioneering work on Diophantine equations, finding solutions to problems of higher order.

Born 836, Harran, Mesopotamia (now Turkey). Died 18 February 901, Baghdad, (now in Iraq).
