**Abu Kamil Shuja** was an Islamic mathematician. He was one of Al-Khwarismi's successors and applied algebraic methods to geometric problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. First to give a comprehensive mathematical explanation of the algebraic equation system known as "al-jabr wa-al-muqabala";
2. Demonstrated a method of solving quadratic equations;
3. Introduced the concept of square root;
4. Developed the theory of algebraic equations from the ground up using algebraic methods, removing the need to use geometrical methods;
5. Established formulas for representing arithmetic, algebraic, and geometric progressions;
6. Provided a comprehensive geometrical and trigonometric treatment of conic sections;
7. Advanced the sine and cosine by introducing new notations and discoveries;
8. Invented the Fibonacci sequence;
9. Established a sophisticated theory of mathematical induction;
10. Developed various methods of computing areas and volumes;
11. Developed a novel number system based on decimal fractions.

Born about 850, (possibly) Egypt. Died about 930.
