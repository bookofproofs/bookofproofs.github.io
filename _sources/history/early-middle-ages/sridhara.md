**Sridhara** was an Indian mathematician who wrote on practical applications of algebra and was one of the first to give a formula for solving quadratic equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However, there has been much dispute over his date and in different works the dates of the life of Sridhara have been placed from the seventh century to the eleventh century.
* We do know that Sridhara was a Hindu but little else is known.
* Some historians give Bengal as the place of his birth while other historians believe that Sridhara was born in southern India.
* Sridhara is known as the author of two mathematical treatises, namely the Trisatika (sometimes called the Patiganitasara ) and the Patiganita.
* We give details below of Sridhara's rule for solving quadratic equations as given by Bhaskara II.
* There is another mathematical treatise Ganitapancavimsi which some historians believe was written by Sridhara.
* Through the whole book Sridhara gives methods to solve problems in terse rules in verse form which was the typical style of Indian texts at this time.
* Indeed there is no suggestion that Sridhara realised that proofs are in any way necessary.
* Often after stating a rule Sridhara gives one or more numerical examples, but he does not give solutions to these example nor does he even give answers in this work.
* After giving the rules for computing with natural numbers, Sridhara gives rules for operating with rational fractions.
* Sridhara was one of the first mathematicians to give a rule to solve a quadratic equation.
* There is no suggestion that Sridhara took two values when he took the square root.

Born about 870, possibly Bengal, India. Died about 930, India.
