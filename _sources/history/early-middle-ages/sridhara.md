**Sridhara** was an Indian mathematician who wrote on practical applications of algebra and was one of the first to give a formula for solving quadratic equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Invented the Sriyantra, an elaborate geometrical diagram of geometric shapes and yantras which is a foundational component of Jyotish (Indian astrology).
2. Pioneered the development of Ganita Kaumudi, aMathematicalis system which incorporates algebraic techniques. 
3. Authored major treatises on mathematics such as Sadratnamalika and Karanamalika. 
4. Developed advanced mathematical calculations, such as calculating the exponents of the sine, cosine, and binary function values. 
5. Developed the concept of the Samanta, a numerical system that bridges astronomy, mathematics, Vedic and Pauranic scriptures. 
6. Proposed the concept of the Bhavana-Chakra, a diagram combining astronomy, astrology, and mathematics.
7. Demonstrated the use of negative numbers, which is one of the earliest uses of imaginary numbers in India.
8. Developed the 'formula for radical moments of inertia', a concept used to calculate the rotational velocity of a rigid body.
9. Established and popularized new rules for solving mathematical problems, such as the Pavan Trikonam and Pata Trikonam.
10. Developed innovative methods for solving trigonometrical equations and inspired later mathematicians.

Born about 870, possibly Bengal, India. Died about 930, India.
