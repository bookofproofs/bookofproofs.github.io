### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Translated major Greek texts into Arabic, including Euclid’s Elements, Ptolemy’s Almagest, and Archimedes’ On the Measurement of a Circle. 
2. Authored Kitab al-Manazir, which was devoted to optics, and is considered the most influential book on optics of its time.
3. Advised rulers throughout the Middle East, providing them with his expertise in mathematics.
4. Employed a team of scholars to help him with translation work and mathematical research.
5. Authored many commentaries on mathematical works, such as Euclid’s Elements, Ptolemy’s Almagest and the works of various other Greek mathematicians, such as Archimedes.
6. Broadened the horizons of mathematics by introducing principles related to algebra and geometry, thus helping to set the foundations of modern mathematics.
7. Innovatively incorporated scientific method into his works, thus considerably improving the quality of his work compared to the work of his predecessors.
