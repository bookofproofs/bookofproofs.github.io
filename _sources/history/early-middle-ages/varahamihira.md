**Varahamihira** was an Indian astrologer whose main work was a treatise on mathematical astronomy which summarised earlier astronomical treatises. He discovered a version of Pascal's triangle and worked on magic squares.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The school of mathematics at Ujjain was increased in importance due to Varahamihira working there and it continued for a long period to be one of the two leading mathematical centres in India, in particular having Brahmagupta as its next major figure.
* The most famous work by Varahamihira is the Pancasiddhantika (The Five Astronomical Canons) dated 575 AD.
* One treatise which Varahamihira summarises was the Romaka-Siddhanta which itself was based on the epicycle theory of the motions of the Sun and the Moon given by the Greeks in the 1st  century AD.
* Other works which Varahamihira summarises are also based on the Greek epicycle theory of the motions of the heavenly bodies.
* There is, however, quite a debate about interpreting data from Varahamihira's astronomical texts and from other similar works.
* Varahamihira made some important mathematical discoveries.
* In particular he examines a pandiagonal magic square of order four which occurs in Varahamihira's work.

Born 505, Kapitthaka, India. Died 587, India.
