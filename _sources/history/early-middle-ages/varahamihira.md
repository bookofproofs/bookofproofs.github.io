**Varahamihira** was an Indian astrologer whose main work was a treatise on mathematical astronomy which summarised earlier astronomical treatises. He discovered a version of Pascal's triangle and worked on magic squares.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Varahamihira wrote the famous astronomical work called Pancasiddhantika, which brings together five earlier astronomical treatises including the Paulisa Siddhanta, Romaka Siddhanta, Surya Siddhanta, Vasishtha Siddhanta, and Paitamaha Siddhanta.
2. Varahamihira established mathematical equations, enabling the accurate prediction of planetary positions, eclipses, and solstices.
3. He proposed the ‘Vakya Panchanga’ system, a combination of mathematics and astronomy that determines the position of planets, the timing of eclipses, and other phenomena.
4. He also wrote the Brhat Samhita, a seminal work on topics including astrology, agriculture, architecture, garden design, gemology, medicine, axiology, and military science.
5. Varahamihira formulated mathematical formulae for trigonometry in the Brhat Samhita in order to calculate the heights of mountains, distances of places, and relative positions of mountains, rivers, seas, and towns.
6. He also developed the concept of trigonometry and the beginnings of what later became calculus.
7. Varahamihira developed the value of ‘pi’ with an accuracy of up to 4 decimal places in the Brhat Samhita.

Born 505, Kapitthaka, India. Died 587, India.
