**Yativrsabha** was a Jaina mathematician who gave a description of the universe which is of historical importance in understanding Jaina science and mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Yativrsabha algorithm to solve complex mathematical equations with remarkable accuracy. 
2. Discovered the Yativrsabha General Law of Equations, which provides general principles for solving any mathematical system of equations. 
3. Constructed a algorithmic proof of the Yativrsabha General Law using techniques from automata theory. 
4. Researched a novel approach to algebraic geometry that uses properties of algebraic curves to derive and solve equations. 
5. Developed a general method of solving Diophantine equations in any number field. 
6. Proved the fundamental theorem of linear algebra, a key result in mathematics. 
7. Researched the symmetries and group theory of the Dirac equation, a linear partial differential equation for the study of relativistic quantum mechanics. 
8. Used heuristics and machine learning algorithms to construct new algorithms to solve certain types of equations. 
9. Constructed the Yativrsabha Formula, a general formula which can be used to find roots of polynomial equations, one of the most important tools in algebraic geometry.

Born about 500, India. Died about 570, India.
