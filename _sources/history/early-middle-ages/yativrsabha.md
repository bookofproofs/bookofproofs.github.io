**Yativrsabha** was a Jaina mathematician who gave a description of the universe which is of historical importance in understanding Jaina science and mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We know nothing of Yativrsabha's dates except for a reference which he makes to the end of the Gupta dynasty which he says was after 231 years of ruling.
* This ended in 551 so we must assume that 551 AD is a date which occurred during Yativrsabha's lifetime.
* This fits with the only other information regarding his dates which are that his work is referenced by Jinabhadra Ksamasramana in 609 and that Yativrsabha himself refers to a work written by Sarvanandin in 458.
* Yativrsabha's work Tiloyapannatti gives various units for measuring distances and time and also describes the system of infinite time measures.

Born about 500, India. Died about 570, India.
