**Ibrahim ibn Sinan** was an Islamic mathematician and astronomer who studied geometry and in particular tangents to circles. He also made advances in the theory of integration.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the earliest version of the algorithm for computing the square root of a number.
2. Compiled one of the earliest works on the solving of spherical trigonometric problems.
3. Developed the earliest known method of interpolation.
4. Discovered a novel method for computing the volume of a paraboloid of revolution.
5. Was one of the first mathematicians to calculate the area of a triangle.
6. Developed a unique method for solving complicated Cubic equations.
7. Extensively studied the Greek mathematics of the day and is credited with criticizing and refining them.

Born 908, Baghdad, (now in Iraq). Died 946, Baghdad, (now in Iraq).
