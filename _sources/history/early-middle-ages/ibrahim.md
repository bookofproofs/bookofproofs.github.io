**Ibrahim ibn Sinan** was an Islamic mathematician and astronomer who studied geometry and in particular tangents to circles. He also made advances in the theory of integration.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ibrahim's most important work was on the quadrature of the parabola where he introduced a method of integration more general than that of Archimedes.
* His grandfather Thabit ibn Qurra had started to view integration in a different way to Archimedes but Ibrahim realised that al-Mahani had made improvements on what his father had achieved.
* Ibrahim is also considered the foremost Arab mathematician to treat mathematical philosophy.
* We know of Ibrahim's works through his own work Letter on the description of the notions Ibrahim derived in geometry and astronomy in which Ibrahim lists his own works.
* For example Ibrahim uses an arithmetical term to denote the product of two geometrical lines.
* In On the measurement of the parabola Ibrahim ibn Sinan gives a beautiful proof that the area of a segment of the parabola is four-thirds of the area of the inscribed triangle.
* It also provides a critical analysis of the observations underlying Ptolemy's solar theory, and Ibrahim ibn Sinan provides his own theory of the sun.
* Ibrahim proves in this work that the stereographic projection maps circles which do not pass through the pole of projection onto circles.
* Examples are given which illustrate how Ibrahim applied an orthogonal compression to transform a circle into an ellipse, and an oblique compression to map a hyperbola into a second hyperbola.
* In a different work Ibrahim uses a transformation which maps figures keeping invariant the ratio between their areas.

Born 908, Baghdad, (now in Iraq). Died 946, Baghdad, (now in Iraq).
