**Al-Battani** or **Albategnius** was an Islamic astronomer and mathematician. He made important accurate measurements of the stars, moon and planets. His measurements and methods were used by later astronomers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Accurately calculated the length of the solar year as 365.242 days. 
2. Invented a new trigonometric table for calculating sine and cosine values. 
3. Identified 3 astronomical and trigonometrical equations for the sine of an arc. 
4. Provided accurate measurements of the precession of the equinoxes. 
5. Discovered the basis of what is now known as the Saxon-Cottingham rule of trigonometry. 
6. Developed parameters to approximate the positions of the planets. 
7. Reported the circumference of a circle with a remarkable accuracy of 99.9%. 
8. Modified the traditional calendar and determined the time of the new moon. 
9. Demonstrated that the Sun and the Moon must have a common center of gravity. 
10. Identified some fundamental properties of the spherical astrolabe.

Born about 850, Harran (near Urfa), Mesopotamia (now Turkey). Died 929, Qasr al-Jiss, Iraq.
