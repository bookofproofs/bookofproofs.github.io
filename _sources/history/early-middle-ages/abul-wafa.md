**Abu'l-Wafa** was an Islamic astronomer and mathematician who wrote commentaries on the works of earlier mathematicians. He made astronomical observations and constructed accurate trigonometric tables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed the idea of reduction of cubic and quartic equations to the solution of a quadratic equation and is thus credited with the development of the first algorithm for solving cubics and quartics.
2. He refined the methods used to calculate the sine tables with cotangent-based interpolations.
3. He discovered the Pascal's theorem and contributed to its proof
4. He made significant contributions to geometrical trigonometry and developed methods for calculating the sum of various arithmetic and geometric series, as well as for determining the volume for particular geometrical shapes such as cuboids and cylinders.
5. He developed the use of a decimal point notation in Arabic numerals and is often credited with being the first to use the decimal point in this way.
6. He established the "Father of Surveying" or the "Father of Geodesy" is credited with inventing the tools used for surveying and the calculation of various dimensions and shapes of land.
7. He wrote several treatises on astronomy, including one that proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system.
8. He was the first mathematician to compile and systematize all geometrical knowledge which was previously known to his Islamic predecessors.
9. He contributed to the invention of the three-legged astrolabe.
10. He discovered the Law of Sines and established a formal proof of the theorem.

Born 10 June 0940, Buzjan (near Jam), Khorasan region (now in Iran). Died 15 July 998, Baghdad (now in Iraq).
