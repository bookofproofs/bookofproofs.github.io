**Abu'l-Wafa** was an Islamic astronomer and mathematician who wrote commentaries on the works of earlier mathematicians. He made astronomical observations and constructed accurate trigonometric tables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* A great patron of science and the arts, 'Adud ad-Dawlah supported a number of mathematicians and Abu'l-Wafa moved to 'Adud ad-Dawlah's court in Baghdad in 959.
* Abu'l-Wafa was not the only distinguished scientist at the Caliph's court in Baghdad, for outstanding mathematicians such as al-Quhi and al-Sijzi also worked there.
* He continued to support mathematics and astronomy and Abu'l-Wafa and al-Quhi remained at the court in Baghdad working for the new Caliph.
* The observatory was officially opened in June 988 with a number of famous scientists present such as al-Quhi and Abu'l-Wafa.
* Abu'l-Wafa is said to have been the first to build a wall quadrant to observe the stars.
* Like many scientist of his period, Abu'l-Wafa translated and wrote commentaries, which have since been lost, on the works of Euclid, Diophantus and al-Khwarizmi.
* Abu'l-Wafa's text is of this second type with no numerals; all the numbers are written in words and all calculations are performed mentally.
* Abu'l-Wafa gives a general rule and gives a special case of this where subtraction of 5 from 3 gives a "debt" of 2.
* Another text written by Abu'l-Wafa for practical use was A book on those geometric constructions which are necessary for a craftsman.
* Another interesting aspect of this particular work of Abu'l-Wafa's is that he tries where possible to solve his problems with ruler and compass constructions.
* Abu'l-Wafa is best known for the first use of the tan function and compiling tables of sines and tangents at 15' intervals.
* Abu'l-Wafa devised a new method of calculating sine tables.

Born 10 June 940, Buzjan (near Jam), Khorasan region (now in Iran). Died 15 July 998, Baghdad (now in Iraq).
