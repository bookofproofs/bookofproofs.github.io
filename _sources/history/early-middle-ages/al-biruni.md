**Al-Biruni** is one of the major figures of Islamic mathematics. He contributed to astronomy, mathematics, physics, medicine and history.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He wrote two important books on mathematics: the Maqala fi-l-Hind and al-Qanun al-Mas'udi. 
2. He used a Unique Indian Mathematical System known as the "Jati Siddhanta" where he calculated the circumference of the Earth with a high degree of accuracy. 
3. He wrote an influential treatise on Spherical Astronomy which explored the geometric shape of the universe and discussed orbits of the planets. 
4. He developed a new type of astrolabe which used trigonometric functions to measure the stars’ positions. 
5. He made significant contributions to the areas of mathematics such as trigonometry, algebra, and trigonometric tables.
6. He detailed the use of irrational numbers, squared numbers, and sine, cosine, and tangent equations. 
7. He invented a series of geometrical formulas for calculating the surface areas and volumes of various solids including elliptical cylinders.
8. He solved equations up to the fourth order. 
9. He also developed methods to calculate specific trigonometric values.
10. He contributed to the development of the tangent calculation and the value of pi.

Born 15 September 973, Kath, Khwarazm (now Kara-Kalpakskaya, Uzbekistan). Died 13 December 1048, Ghazna (now Ghazni, Afganistan).
