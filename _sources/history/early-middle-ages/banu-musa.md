The **Bana Musa brothers** were Islamic mathematicians whose work is almost indistinguishable.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the influential Book of Ingenious Devices, the earliest known work on robotics and automata. 
2. Developed geometrical techniques for calculating volumes and areas of figures. 
3. Developed a technique for calculating the square root of negative numbers. 
4. Constructed the "plane astrolabe" to solve astronomical problems. 
5. Described several ways to approximate the area under a curve using geometric shapes, making integration easier. 
6. Conducted research on the heliocentric model of the solar system and developed theories that predicted lunar and solar eclipses. 
7. Developed the concept of the mean speed theorem and discovered the law of sines, which relates the sine of an angle in a triangle to the ratio of the sides of the triangle. 
8. Established the early foundations of trigonometry using spherical triangles.

Born about 800, Baghdad, (now in Iraq). Died 860, Iraq.
