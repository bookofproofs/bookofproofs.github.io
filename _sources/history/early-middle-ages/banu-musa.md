The **Bana Musa brothers** were Islamic mathematicians whose work is almost indistinguishable.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The three links above give details specific to each of the brothers but most of the information about them is on this page.
* It is quite impossible to write separate biographies of the three brother, who are usually known as the Banu Musa, and we shall not attempt to do so.
* The Banu Musa brothers were among the first group of mathematicians to begin to carry forward the mathematical developments begun by the ancient Greeks.
* Harun al-Rashid became the fifth Caliph of the Abbasid dynasty on 14 September 786, not long after Musa ibn Shakir, the father of the Banu Musa brothers, was born.
* An example of this change is seen in the life of Musa ibn Shakir, the father of the Banu Musa brothers, who was a robber in his youth but turned to science, becoming highly proficient in astronomy.
* Even before this time Musa ibn Shakir had become a close friend of al-Ma'mun and when Musa ibn Shakir died, al-Ma'mun became the guardian of the Banu Musa brothers.
* The brothers were given the best education in Baghdad, studying geometry, mechanics, music, mathematics and astronomy.
* Al-Ma'mun recruited the most talented men for the House of Wisdom and appointed the Banu Musa brothers whose talents he had quickly come to appreciate.
* Hunayn ibn Ishaq and later Thabit ibn Qurra also worked in the House of Wisdom with the Banu Musa brothers.
* Under both these Caliphs internal arguments and rivalry arose between the scholars in the House of Wisdom and the Banu Musa brothers were certainly involved in this rivalry.
* became enemies of the famous philosopher al-Kindi and caused him to lose favour with al-Mutawakkil, who ordered him to be beaten and allowed the brothers to confiscate his library.
* We now turn to the important mathematical contributions made by the Banu Musa brothers.
* The most studied treatise written by the Banu Musa is Kitab marifat masakhat al-ashkal Ⓣ(The Book of the Measurement of Plane and Spherical Figures).
* This work became well known through the translation into Latin by Gherard of Cremona entitled Liber trium fratum de geometria Ⓣ(The geometry book of the three brothers).
* There are many similarities in the methods employed by the Banu Musa and those employed by Archimedes.
* The Banu Musa apply the method of exhaustion invented by Eudoxus and used so effectively by Archimedes.
* As used by the Banu Musa the "method of exhaustion" loses most of its subtlety and power.
* In another aspect, however, the Banu Musa made a definite step forward.
* The Banu Musa's concept of number is broader than that of the Greeks.
* The Banu Musa also introduce geometrical proofs which involve thinking of the geometric objects as moving.
* In astronomy the brothers made many contributions.
* Observations of the star Regulus were made by the three brothers from their house on a bridge in Baghdad in 840-41, 847-48, and 850-51.

Born about 800, Baghdad, (now in Iraq). Died 860, Iraq.
