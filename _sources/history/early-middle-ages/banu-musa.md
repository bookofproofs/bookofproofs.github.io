The **Bana Musa brothers** were Islamic mathematicians whose work is almost indistinguishable.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The most studied treatise written by the Banu Musa is Kitab marifat masakhat al-ashkal â“‰(The Book of the Measurement of Plane and Spherical Figures).
* There are many similarities in the methods employed by the Banu Musa and those employed by Archimedes.
* The Banu Musa apply the method of exhaustion invented by Eudoxus and used so effectively by Archimedes.
* As used by the Banu Musa the "method of exhaustion" loses most of its subtlety and power.
* In another aspect, however, the Banu Musa made a definite step forward.
* The Banu Musa's concept of number is broader than that of the Greeks.
* The Banu Musa also introduce geometrical proofs which involve thinking of the geometric objects as moving.

Born about 800, Baghdad, (now in Iraq). Died 860, Iraq.
