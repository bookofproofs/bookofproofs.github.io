**Govindasvami** was an Indian mathematical astronomer whose most famous treatise was a commentary on work of Bhaskara I.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a method for solving indeterminate problems of Diophantine equations.
2. He also developed a method of solving indeterminate systems of two equations in two variables.
3. He introduced the new concepts of the power-sum equation, homogeneous symmetric identity systems, and the complexity of solving these equations.
4. He formulated new methods for solving indeterminate quadratic equations.
5. He introduced the method of summing the squares of the factors of a number, known as the sum of the squares of its divisors.
6. He introduced the rule of partitions of a number, and became the first to develop an algorithm to calculate the number of partitions of a number.
7. He also introduced the method of deriving the equations of higher degree polynomials from equations of lower degree polynomials.
8. He was the first to expand the use of Î¼-operators.
9. He provided an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
10. He formulated an algorithm for the solution of the Pellian equation and proved the converse theorem related to this equation.

Born about 800, India. Died about 860, India.
