**Govindasvami** was an Indian mathematical astronomer whose most famous treatise was a commentary on work of Bhaskara I.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Govindasvami wrote the Bhasya in about 830 which was a commentary on the Mahabhaskariya Ⓣ(The big book of Bhaskara).
* In Govindasvami's commentary there appear many examples of using a place-value Sanskrit system of numerals.
* One of the most interesting aspects of the commentary, however, is Govindasvami's construction of a sine table.
* Govindasvami considered the sexagesimal fractional parts of the twenty-four tabular sine differences from the Aryabhatiya Ⓣ(The work of Aryabhata).
* In the commentary Govindasvami found certain other empirical rules relating to computations of sine differences in the argumental range of 60 to 90 degrees.

Born about 800, India. Died about 860, India.
