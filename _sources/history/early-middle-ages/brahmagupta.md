**Brahmagupta** was the foremost Indian mathematician of his time. He made advances in astronomy and most importantly in number systems including algorithms for square roots and the solution of quadratic equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the influential book Brahmasphutasiddhanta, which expounded the mathematical system of the ancient Hindus and provided the first ever use of zero and negative numbers.
2. Developed the notion of an algorithm and expressed fractions as sums of unit fractions.
3. Established the basic number theory and arithmetic, including the rules of the add, multiply, subtract and divide operations.
4. Discovered the Brahmaguptaâ€™s formula for area of cyclic quadrilateral, formulas for right and oblique triangles, formulas for perimeter, area and surface area of a sphere.
5. Devised the rule of three and the use of the quadratic equation.
6. Defined the concept of place value in the decimal numbering system and developed modern methods for simplifying and solving linear and quadratic equations.
7. Developed and extended the use of base-10 numerals.
8. Developed rules for handling zero or negative numbers.
9. Derived the integral form of the volume of a pyramidal frustum.
10. Solved quadratic equations with positive and negative values.

Born 598, (possibly) Ujjain, India. Died 670, India.
