**Al-Nayrizi** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote commentaries on work by Ptolemy and Euclid.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a technique for calculating the surface area of any polygon regardless of the number of its sides. 
2. He developed a system for solving cubic equations using interpolation. 
3. He was able to convert a right triangle into a square and vice versa, leading to a rule for finding out the diagonal of a square. 
4. He made advances in the progressions of arithmetic, algebra and trigonometry.
5. He developed a method of calculating the fourth root of a number. 
6. He created an equation for calculating the sums of the squares of two numbers. 
7. He wrote a book on spherical trigonometry in which he described a spherical triangle as the intersection of the three great circles of a sphere. 
8. He developed the ingenious device of using indeterminate equation for subtraction and multiplication.
9. He developed a technique for multiplying and dividing numbers without using the common methods. 
10. He made further advances in astronomical calculations and geometry.

Born about 865, possibly Nayriz, Iran. Died about 922, possibly Baghdad, Iraq.
