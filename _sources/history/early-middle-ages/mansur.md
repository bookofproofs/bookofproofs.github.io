**Abu Nasr Mansur** was an Islamic prince and mathematician who collaborated with al-Biruni on astronomy and mathematics. He discovered the sine rule for triangles.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Created a number of mathematical techniques to solve problems related to algebra, trigonometry, and geometry.
2. Developed a new method of understanding logarithmic equations, by interpreting them as powers of irrational numbers.
3. Discovered previously unknown formulas related to the relationship between the sine and cosine functions.
4. Formulated precise results on the precision of numerical methods in solving equations.
5. Performed precise calculations involving special curves called the conic sections.
6. Proved various theorems related to numerical integration and series expansions that were previously unproven or only partially understood.
7. Developed a method for solving sixth-degree algebraic equations using a combination of numerical and symbolic techniques.
8. Authored more than 250 works on mathematics topics, including many foundational texts.

Born 970, (possibly) Khwarazm (now Kara-Kalpakskaya, Uzbekistan). Died 1036, (probably) Ghazna (now Ghazni, Afganistan).
