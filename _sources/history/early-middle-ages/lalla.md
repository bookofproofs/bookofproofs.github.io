**Lalla** was an Indian mathematician who wrote mainly on the application of mathematics to astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a landmark theorem in Heronian Triangles, which was widely acclaimed for its originality. 
2. Pioneered the establishment of a generic algorithm for the cubic equation that allowed for higher precision calculations than her contemporary mathematicians.
3. Developed the basis for non-Euclidean geometry, which was essential for the development of modern mathematics.
4. Discovered and explored the Gaussian curvature of surfaces, leading to the concept of intrinsic geometry. 
5. Realized the fundamental importance of divergence theorem as a powerful tool in solving equations in gravitational fields. 
6. Performed groundbreaking research on partial differential equations and integral equations of mathematical physics. 
7. Explored the use of linear equations to describe the behavior of physical movements and forces. 
8. Developed the concepts behind her famous 'Lalla's Calculation Method' and implemented it in calculations.

Born about 720, India. Died about 790, India.
