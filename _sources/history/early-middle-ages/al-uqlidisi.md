**Al-Uqlidisi** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote two works on arithmetic. He may have anticipated the invention of decimals.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The manuscript gives al-Uqlidisi's full name on the front page as well as the information that he composed the text in Damascus in 952-53.
* In the introduction al-Uqlidisi writes that he travelled widely and learnt from all the mathematicians he met on his travels.
* Other than being able to deduce a little of al-Uqlidisi's character from his writing, we have no other information on his life.
* The Kitab al-fusul fi al-hisab al-Hindi of al-Uqlidisi is the earliest surviving book that presents the Hindu system.
* There is plenty of evidence here that al-Uqlidisi must have been a teacher, for only a teacher would know understand the type of problem that a beginning student would encounter.
* The fourth part has considerable interest for it claims that up to this work by al-Uqlidisi the Indian methods had been used with a dust board.
* However, al-Uqlidisi showed how to modify the methods for pen and paper use.
* Al-Uqlidisi's work is historically important as it is the earliest known text offering a direct treatment of decimal fractions.
* Al-Uqlidisi uses decimal fractions as such, appreciates the importance of a decimal sign, and suggests a good one.
* 1436/7) who treated decimal fractions in his "Miftah al-Hisab", but al-Uqlidisi, who lived five centuries earlier, is the first Muslim mathematician so far known to write about decimal fractions.
* Following Saidan's paper, some historians went even further in attributing to al-Uqlidisi the complete credit for giving the first complete description and applications of decimal fractions.
* The argument depends on how one interprets the following passage in al-Uqlidisi's treatise.
* unlike al-Samawal, al-Uqlidisi never formulates the idea of completing the sequence of powers of ten by that of their inverse after having defined the zero power.
* There is no disagreement on the fact that al-Uqlidisi made a major step forward.

Born about 920, possibly Damascus, Syria. Died about 980, possibly Damascus, Syria.
