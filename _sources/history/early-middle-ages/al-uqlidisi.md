**Al-Uqlidisi** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote two works on arithmetic. He may have anticipated the invention of decimals.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Al-Uqlidisi developed a positional notation system inspired by the Indian numerical system, allowing calculation with fractions to be carried out as easily as with integers.
2. He pioneered the introduction of decimal fractions, as opposed to the earlier fractional system of numeration, suggesting the arithmetic use of a zero symbol. 
3. He wrote the first book dealing entirely with decimal fractions, titled Kitab al-Fusul fi al-Hisab al-Hindi, or Book of Chapters on Hindu Arithmetic. 
4. He was the first to find the solution of a quadratic equation and to give procedures for solving equations of higher degrees. 
5. He wrote Kitab Hekm Al-Misaha, or Book of Line Measurement, a treatise on geometry, in which he also laid down the basic rules of algebra. 
6. He wrote Kitab Mafatih Al-Hasil, or Book of the Keys to Accomplishment, which remains an important authority on algebra and algebraic analysis.
7. He proposed methods to solve cubic equations, mostly using geometrical constructions partially and a general approach, the most general one for that time. 
8. He developed many numerical methods for solving equations using iteration. 
9. He introduced sophisticated techniques for curvilinear figures, for which he constructed specific tools for computation.
10. He also made great contributions to trigonometry and developed sophisticated techniques for both spherical and linear trigonometry.

Born about 920, possibly Damascus, Syria. Died about 980, possibly Damascus, Syria.
