**Al-Sijzi** was an Islamic astronomer and mathematician who wrote on the geometry of spheres.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method to construct a parabolic line using intersecting circles.
2. Developed a number of equations to demonstrate problems related to conic sections, cylindrical helix, and cubic equations.
3. Developed a method to calculate the area of any inscribed quadrilateral.
4. Created a solar model complete with a six-part symmetrical planetary system.
5. Maintained a comprehensive list of various geometric transformations.
6. Wrote a treatise on fundamental principles of geometrical sociology.
7. Discovered and formulated three lenstriction equations for the connection between algebra, geometry, and physics.
8. Developed a physical model of the universe to prove his theories on planetary motion. 
9. Explained the relations between circumference and area of circles based on the sizes of circles inscribed in similar polygons. 
10. Conducted extensive studies on the use of chords and secants in circles, as well as their intersection points, and resulting chords.

Born about 945, Sijistan, Persia (now Iran). Died about 1020.
