**Al'Khwarizmi** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote on Hindu-Arabic numerals. The word _algorithm_ derives from his name. His algebra treatise _Hisab al-jabr w'al-muqabala_ gives us the word _algebra_ and can be considered as the first book to be written on algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first algorithm for solving linear and quadratic equations. 
2. Developed the concept of algorithms and algorithmic procedures. 
3. Developed the arithmetic of (Hindu-Arabic) numerals, which is still in use today. 
4. Developed systematic methods for performing arithmetic calculations in decimals and fractions. 
5. Produced a correctly calculated calendar with an error rate of only one day in 3,000 years.
6. Compiled astronomical tables based on Indian and Babylonian sources. 
7. Helped to spread Islamic knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, and science to Europe. 
8. Wrote algebra texts that were used as foundational texts in Europe for over 700 years. 
9. Constructed the mechanical geared astrolabe, a precursor of the modern-day clock. 
10. Invested in solving equations with multiple unknowns.

Born about 780, possibly Baghdad (now in Iraq). Died about 850.
