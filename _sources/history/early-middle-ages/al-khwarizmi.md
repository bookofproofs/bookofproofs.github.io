**Al-Khwarizmi** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote on Hindu-Arabic numerals. The word algorithm derives from his name. His algebra treatise "Hisab al-jabr w'al-muqabala" gives us the word algebra and can be considered as the first book to be written on algebra.

Born about 780, possibly in Baghdad (now in Iraq). Died about 850.
