**Bhaskara I** was an Indian mathematicians who wrote commentaries on the work of Aryabhata I.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concepts of the mathematical operations of addition and subtraction of fractions.
2. Discovered the value of the sine table, known as the Bijaganita Table.
3. Established the rule for calculating the area of a cyclic quadrilateral.
4. Determined a rule for finding the sum of consecutive numbers from any starting value.
5. Accurately calculated the value of π .
6. Applied the concepts of differentiation and integration for the first time to calculate the area under a curve and calculate the radius of a circle.
7. Used algorithms to accurately calculate the square root of a number.
8. Proposed a mathematical model of the solar system which was the first of its kind.
9. Proved the theorem of the spherical triangle.
10. Showed that the sum of two odd numbers yields an even number.

Born about 600, (possibly) Saurastra (modern Gujarat state), India. Died about 680, (possibly) Asmaka, India.
