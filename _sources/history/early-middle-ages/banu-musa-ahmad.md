**Ahmad Banu Musa** was one of the three Bana Musa brothers. He wrote about mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the seminal books Kitab al-Jabr wa-al-Muqābala (Algebra) and Kitab al-Hisab al-Hindi (Indian Arithmetic).
2. Developed systematic approaches to solving linear equations, quadratic equations and cubic equations.
3. Investigated the principles of Indian numerals, decimal fractions, and the Hindu–Arabic numerals.
4. Developed a technique called 'reduction', which allows one to solve equations involving multiple terms that are higher than second order.
5. Discovered several techniques of cubical root extraction and proved the general rule for higher roots.
6. Advanced the algorithmic theory of congruences, which is the foundation of themodular arithmetic.
7. Investigated the values of gamma function and discovered solutions for different cases of cubic equations.
8. Developed a technique for calculating square roots, similar to the one used in present day.
9. Was the first mathematician to understand the importance of irrational and imaginary numbers.
10. Established a correspondence between algebraic equations and geometric curves, which served as the basis for the development of analytic geometry.

Born about 805, Baghdad, Iraq. Died after 873, Baghdad, Iraq.
