**Al-Karaji** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote about the work of earlier mathematicians and who can be regarded as the first person to free algebra from geometrical operations and replace them with the type of operations which are at the core of algebra today.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the binomial theorem for any power greater than two.
2. Developed the theory of algebraic calculus, making it possible to solve equations of any degree.
3. Identified the arithmetic progression, as well as several geometric progressions.
4. Developed the geometric theory of numbers.
5. Discovered Pascal's Triangle.
6. Used mathematical induction to prove a number of results in algebra.
7. Developed the algebraic notation used today in mathematics.
8. Established a formula for the sum of cubes and fourth powers.
9. Discovered the law of recurrence.
10. Developed methods of solving linear equations.

Born 13 April 953, Baghdad (now in Iraq). Died about 1029.
