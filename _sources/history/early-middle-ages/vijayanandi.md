**Vijayanandi** was an Indian mathematician and astronomer who made some contributions to trigonometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We should note that there was another astronomer named Vijayanandi who was mentioned by Varahamihira in one of his works.
* Since Varahamihira wrote around 550 and the Karanatilaka was written around 966, there must be two astronomers both named "Vijayanandi".
* However Vijayanandi changed these numbers to 488211 and 232234.
* Like other Indian astronomers, Vijayanandi made contributions to trigonometry and it appears that his calculation of the periods was computed by using tables of sines and versed sines.

Born about 940, Benares (now Varanasi), India. Died about 1010, India.
