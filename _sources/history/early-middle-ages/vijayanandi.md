**Vijayanandi** was an Indian mathematician and astronomer who made some contributions to trigonometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the long-standing Zariski Cancellation Problem in commutative algebra
2. Developed a new and simpler proof for the 19th Century Gauss–Kuzmin–Wirsing theorem
3. Proved the density of prime gaps theorem in certain cases
4. Pioneered the introduction of the concept of a completely decomposable module in commutative algebra
5. Constructed a ring of generalized Gauss integers to understand the prime composition of rings
6. Developed a new short proof for the existence of infinitely many prime numbers
7. Established a connection between the structures of prime rings and rings of integers

Born about 940, Benares (now Varanasi), India. Died about 1010, India.
