**Aryabhata II** was an Indian mathematician who wrote about astronomy as well as geometry. He constructed tables of sines accurate up to about 5 figures.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the continued fraction expansion for pi and a version of the Gregorian Calendar.
2. Introduced the concept of power series expansion and decimal fractions.
3. Developed methods for calculating approximations of sine and cosine functions, in addition to mathematical concepts such as amicable numbers, arithmetical exponentials, the concept of trisection of an angle and combining fractions of unlike denominations.
4. Formulated the computational formula to calculate the cubical volume of a sphere.
5. Proposed the quadratic equation and its solution.
6. Developed various approximations to pi, including an approximation of 3.1416.
7. Developed algorithms to accurately detect the tangent of a given angle.
8. Wrote "Mahabhaskariya", a book relating to mathematical astronomy.
9. Proposed the Pascal Triangle.

Born about 920, India. Died about 1000, India.
