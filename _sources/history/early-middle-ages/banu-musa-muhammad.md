**Jafar Muhammad Banu Musa** was one of the three Bana Musa brothers. He wrote about conics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However, there is some information specific to the eldest: Jafar Muhammad ibn Musa ibn Shakir.
* In addition to making perhaps the major contribution to the geometry text described above, Jafar Muhammad also wrote Premises of the book of conics which was a critical revision of Apollonius's Conics.
* However, Jafar Muhammad was also the most politically active of the brothers, particularly in the last part of his life when the Turks were gaining control of the empire.
* It appears that his dispute with al-Kindi coloured Jafar Muhammad actions and he opposed anyone who had been a friend of al-Kindi's.
* In fact Jafar Muhammad was sent by al-Musta'in to negotiate the terms of his surrender with the besieging forces.

Born about 800, Baghdad, Iraq. Died after 873, Iraq.
