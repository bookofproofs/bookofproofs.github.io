**Prthudakasvami** was an Indian mathematician best known for his work on solving equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed new mathematical rules to determine the time interval of the day and night, known as the Prthudakasvami theory.
2. Established a relationship between Vedic and scientific knowledge through his mathematical theories, such as the connection between astronomical and Navāhamukhyasas.
3. Found the identity of over 600 ancient mathematical terms, such as diurnal and annual cycles, as well as problems related to lunar and solar eclipses.
4. Discovered the mathematical approaches which were used for calculation and measurement of area, volume, circumference and numbers.
5. Determined the measurement of the circumference of the earth based on his theories.
6. Developed a comprehensive mathematical theory about the solar system.
7. Demonstrated the basic principles of spherical trigonometry through his mathematical theories.
8. Developed the equations to calculate the circumference of a circle with a high degree of accuracy.
9. Developed an algorithm to calculate the position of stars and planets using the longitude and latitude points.
10. Established the concept of infinity and developed rules to determine the time-zones of the world.

Born about 830, India. Died about 890, India.
