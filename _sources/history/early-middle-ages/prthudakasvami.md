**Prthudakasvami** was an Indian mathematician best known for his work on solving equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Prthudakasvami's commentary on Brahmagupta's work is helpful in showing how "algebra", that is the method of calculating with the unknown, was developing in India.
* Prthudakasvami discussed the kuttaka method which he renamed as "bijagnita" which means the method of calculating with unknown elements.
* To see just how this new idea of algebra was developing in India, we look at the notation which was being used by Prthudakasvami in his commentary on Brahmagupta's Brahma Sputa Siddhanta â“‰(Correctly Established Doctrine of Brahma).

Born about 830, India. Died about 890, India.
