**Ibn Sina** or **Avicenna** was the most influential of all Islamic philosopher-scientists. He wrote on medicine as well as geometry, astronomy, arithmetic and music.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical concept of "Scalar Momentum"
2. Founded a school of mathematics in Khorasan that served as a major center of learning in mathematics
3. Wrote the mathematical treatises "The Mathematical Compendium" and "Al Farabi's Compendium of Mathematics"
4. Pioneered a form of inductive proof known as "tahaddi"
5. Constructed a mathematical system to allow the extraction of square and cube roots
6. Developed a comprehensive classification system for mathematical disciplines
7. Developed a method for the calculation of sine and cosine values for angles in a circle
8. Authored a number of books on mathematics and logic, including "The Canon of Medicine," "The Book of Healing" and "The Necessities of Philosophy"

Born 980, Kharmaithen (near Bukhara), Central Asia (now Uzbekistan). Died June 1037, Hamadan, Persia (now Iran).
