**Li Chunfeng** was a Chinese mathematician who worked in astronomy and calendar reform.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Li Chunfeng wrote the book “The Manual of the Youtiao” which contained mathematical methods used to predict astronomical events. 
2. Li Chunfeng is also credited with creating the Double False Position Method of solving equations.
3. He used his mathematical skills to make combined astrological and astronomical predictions known as the system of gnomons. 
4. Li Chunfeng also developed a calendar that calculated the winter solstices and summer solstices.
5. He discovered a formula for the volume of a frustum of a cone and made possible the development of first mechanical clock in the 7th century. 
6. He also developed an innovative method for calculating the solar year and the lunar month using a mathematical equation.
7. He proposed a mathematical formula for interpreting astrology and calculating the planetary positions. 
8. Li Chunfeng is credited with developing an equation for the volume of an ellipsoid. 
9. He also developed a method for finding the root of equations by successive approximation. 
10. He devised a method of mathematical calculation called the system of "five time equations," which is used to calculate the movement of the planets and stars.

Born 602, Shaanxi province, China. Died 670, Chang'an, China.
