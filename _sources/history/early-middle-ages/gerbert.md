**Gerbert of Aurillac** or **Pope Syvester II** was a talented French mathematics teacher who popularised the Indo-Arabic numerals.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Advanced knowledge of Euclidean geometry and trigonometry, which he applied to astronomical problems.
2. Designed and built the armillary sphere, a mechanical device that models the celestial sphere and enabled the study of the movements of known stars and planets through the sky. 
3. Innovated the use of Arabic numeral system and developed new methods of calculation.
4. Taught mathematical principles and methods of calculation to all his students, including the use of Arabic numerals, aiding the spread of mathematical knowledge throughout western Europe.
5. Realized the importance of geometry for solving various practical problems, such as the construction of fortifications. 
6. Incorporated the use of positional notation, which enabled easier computations that did not rely on memorization of tables. 
7. Assisted Pope Sylvester II in reconstructing the calendar, leading to the Gregorian calendar which is still in use today. 
8. Introduced the cross-staff and astrolabe, used by mariners and navigators to measure the angular altitude of the sun and stars.

Born 946, Belliac, (now St-Simon) Auvergne, France. Died 12 May 1003, Rome (now Italy).
