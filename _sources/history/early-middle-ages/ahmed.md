**Ahmed ibn Yusuf** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote a commentary on [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621] which influenced later European mathematicians.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Constructed the earliest surviving two-sided sundial, one of the most accurate sundials of its kind.
2. Developed a technique for the calculation of a circle's circumference that was accurate to within 0.5%.
3. Devised a rule of thumb to estimate the distance from the ground to the surface of a given astronomical object.
4. Invented a system for the determination of ratios using fractions.
5. Wrote a treatise on geometry detailing early principles of Euclidean geometry.
6. Established basic trigonometric principles and developed a method for calculating rapidly the value of any angle based on tables of his own invention.
7. Contributed greatly to the field of spherical trigonometry.
8. Developed a technique for calculating fundamental geodetic figuresâ€”the meridian arc, longitudes, latitudes, and azimuths.

Born 835, Baghdad (now in Iraq). Died 912, Cairo, Egypt.
