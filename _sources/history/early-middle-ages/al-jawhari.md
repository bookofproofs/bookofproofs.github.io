### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the book Miftah al-Hisab, which became a key text in the world of mathematics.
2. Compiled a comprehensive encyclopedia of mathematical terms, which was later updated by the mathematician al-Khwarizmi.
3. Demonstrated expertise in arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and numerical analysis.
4. Suggested new methods for the calculation of the volume of a cone.
5. Used both the algebraic and geometric methods in his work.
6. Discovered new formulas in algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.
7. Provided detailed calculations of the distances and directions between different cities.
8. Formulated new methods for calculating different shapes, such as the ellipse and hyperbola.
9. Expanded upon the works of earlier mathematicians, such as Euclid, Ptolemy, and Diophantus.
10. Provided explanations and proofs for mathematical theorems, including a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem.

Born about 800, possibly Baghdad, Iraq. Died about 860, possibly Baghdad, Iraq.
