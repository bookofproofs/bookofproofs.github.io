**Moritz Cantor** was a German historian of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the theory of transfinite numbers (1874).
2. Discovered a rule of mathematical induction which can be used to prove statements about infinite series (1890).
3. Resolved the problem of finding a basis for number theory based on Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers (1885-1887).
 4. Discovered the late development of set theory as a mathematical discipline (1874-1895).
5. Developed an increasingly abstract algebraic theory of infinite numbers which established the theory of cardinal numbers and ordinal numbers (1894).
6. Devised an axiomatic theory of cardinality which led to the development of the theory of the continuum hypothesis (1897).
7. Formulated the principle of the well-ordered sets, which provided a mathematical foundation for the theory of abstract algebra (1905).
8. Wrote a major monograph on the theory of sets (1908).

Born 23 August 1829, Mannheim, Baden (now Germany). Died 9 April 1920, Heidelberg, Germany.
