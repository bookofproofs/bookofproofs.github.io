**Geoffrey Taylor** was a British physicist and mathematician who worked in fluid dynamics and wave theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Geoffrey Taylor attended school in Hampstead, and there he began to find his love of science.
* In 1899 Taylor went to University College School and in 1905 he won a scholarship to study at Trinity College, Cambridge.
* The ship the Scotia was the first vessel sent on such a patrol in 1913, and Taylor served as meteorologist on the ship.
* Taylor did not treat this as an office job for a researcher, however, for he took a very active part learning to fly aeroplanes and make parachute jumps.
* In 1923 Taylor was appointed to a Royal Society research professorship as a Yarrow Research Professor.
* At this stage Taylor made a great many fundamental steps in the study of fluids.
* Taylor continued his research after the end of the War, taking the opportunity to complete some more thorough investigations into problems where previously the pressure of finding solutions had prevented him from taking his study further.
* Taylor received many honours during his life.
* No biography of Geoffrey Taylor would be complete without describing some of his interests outside mathematics.

Born 7 March 1886, St John's Wood, London, England. Died 27 June 1975, Cambridge, England.
