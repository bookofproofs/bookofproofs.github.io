**Geoffrey Taylor** was a British physicist and mathematician who worked in fluid dynamics and wave theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of Crystal World for analyzing two-dimensional crystal lattices. 
2. Published revolutionary papers on the optical properties of liquid surfaces. 
3. Discovered the importance of convective turbulence in understanding the Earthâ€™s geophysical environment. 
4. Proposed the Taylor-Couette Flow as a dynamics model of spiraling hurricanes. 
5. Focused on studying the physics of galactic rotation and stellar structure. 
6. Demonstrated the peculiar effects of surface tension on drops, bubbles and streamlines. 
7. Pioneered the technique of statistical mechanics in studying the atomic, chemical and electrical properties of matter. 
8. Advanced the theory of fluids, viscosity and particle diffusion. 
9. Helped with the development of calculations about the structure of liquid mercury at high magnetic fields. 
10. Developed the kinetic theory of gases and explained the relation between temperature and pressure of gas particles.

Born 7 March 1886, St John's Wood, London, England. Died 27 June 1975, Cambridge, England.
