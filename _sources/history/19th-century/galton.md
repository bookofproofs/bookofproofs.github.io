**Francis Galton** was an English polymath, explorer, anthropologist and statistician. He invented the concept of "regression to the mean" and is famous as "the father of eugenics".

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of correlation and the use of covariance to measure the relationship between two variables.
2. Extended the concept of regression to a multiple regression model.
3. Developed the Galton Board, an apparatus for studying heredity.
4. Introduced the concept of standard deviation as a measure of dispersion of a population or sample.
5. Coined the term eugenics and studied the inheritance of physical traits, such as height and pigmentation.
6. Created a close approximation to the normal distribution, now known as the Galton distribution.
7. Was an early adopter and proponent of the theory of natural selection.
8. Created the quincunx, an apparatus that could demonstrate the principles of probability.

Born 16 February 1822, Sparkbrook (near Birmingham), England. Died 17 January 1911, Grayshott House, Haslemere, Surrey, England.
