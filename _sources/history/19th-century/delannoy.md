**Henri Delannoy** was a French mathematician who worked on probability and recreational mathematics. He was also intersted inthe history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Delannoy numbers, a sequence of numbers that is related to the number of paths from one corner of a lattice to another.
2. Made contributions to the study of continued fractions, algebraic equations and binary decision diagrams.
3. Proved the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root.
4. Formulated the Delannoy's Conjecture which states that in any Delannoy array, the number of paths from the lower left corner to any higher left corner is equal to the number of paths from lower right corner to the same higher left corner.
5. Introduced the Casorati-Delannoy theorem which states that a polynomial with real coefficients are equal to a constant if and only if the sum of its roots and the sum of the deviations of its roots form a real number.

Born 28 September 1833, Bourbonne-les-Bains, Haute-Marne, France. Died 5 February 1915, Gu√©ret, La Creuse, France.
