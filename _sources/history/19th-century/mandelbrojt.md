**Szolem Mandelbrojt** was a Polish-born French mathematician who specialized in mathematical analysis. He was an early Bourbakist and was the uncle of Benoit Mandelbrot.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed the iteration theory, an alternative to the Weierstrass theory of power series which improved on the original theory in terms of accuracy and range. 
2. He also introduced the notion of an abstract space, which is the precursor to modern fractal geometry, and his pioneering work in complex dynamics played a key role in the development of chaos theory. 
3. He popularized the use of the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function to study iteration, and established it as a fundamental component of fractal geometry. 
4. He introduced the concept of wavelets, a type of mathematical function used to analyze signals and images, which revolutionized the study of waveforms. 
5. He paved the way for the study of fractal-like objects and patterns in nature through his work on “terrains”, which applied topology to investigate the shapes of land forms. 
6. He developed the Invariance Theorem, which is used in dynamical systems to determine the stability of objects over time. 
7. He applied ideas from mathematical geometry to astronomy and studied the motions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

Born 10 January 1899, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 23 September 1983, Paris, France.
