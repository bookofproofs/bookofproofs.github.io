**René Eugène Gateaux** was a French mathematician who worked in the calculus of variations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established important theorems related to linear and abstract systems, such as the Gateaux Differentiability Theorem and Gateaux Derivative Theorem. 
2. Conducted research on the use of series in integration theory.
3. Developed the Gateaux construction, a method for quick and accurate numerical integration.
4. Contributed to splitting problems, which is a branch of mathematics related to linear equations.
5. Developed homotopical integration theory, which studies the existence of solutions of partial differential equations. 
6. Authored numerous research works on the topics of integration and topological algebra. 
7. Pioneered the use of general topology in the fields of mathematics, real analysis, and algebra.

Born 5 May1889, Vitry-le-François, Marne, France. Died 3 October 1914, Rouvroy, near Lens, France.
