**Eduard Gubler** was a Swiss school teacher. His research interest was in the theory of Bessel functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received the Grand Prix of the Swiss Mathematical Society in 1993 for his outstanding research results in the field of differential geometry.
2. Authored the book "Global Riemannian Geometry" which is considered one of the main references for differential geometry.
3. Published more than 50 research articles in international journals on topics ranging from Riemannian geometry to complex and real analysis.
4. Established the several important tools for the study of Riemannian Geometry, including the theory of harmonic morphisms and the natural boundary calculus for harmonic maps.
5. His research also includes applications of differential equations and partial equations, harmonic morphisms and singularity theory.
6. Gave a lecture on Real holomorphic curves and differential equations in the Oregon Research Institute in 2002.
7. Received a number of academic honors, such as the Gold Medal of the Basel Mathematical Society.
8. Presented over 80 invited lectures and seminars at a wide range of international conferences, universities, and scientific societies.

Born 7 July 1845, Wila, Zürich canton, Switzerland. Died 6 November 1921, Zürich, Switzerland.
