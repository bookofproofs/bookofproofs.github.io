**Eduard Gubler** was a Swiss school teacher. His research interest was in the theory of Bessel functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His supervisor was Graf, which suggests that Gubler received his doctorate from the University of Bern.
* In 1896 Gubler habilitated as Privatdozent at the University of Zürich with the paper Über ein discontinuirliches Integral Ⓣ(On a discontinuous integral) .
* At the university, Gubler mainly lectured on algebraic analysis, number theory, higher algebra, planar and spherical trigonometry, integral calculus, and methodology of mathematics teaching at secondary schools.
* Gubler's research interest was in the theory of Bessel functions, following the school of thought established by Schläfli's student Graf.
* Together with Graf, Gubler published Einleitung in die Theorie der Bessel'schen Funktionen Ⓣ(Introduction to the theory of Bessel functions) (1898-1900).
* Gubler co-founded the Swiss Society of Mathematics Teachers in 1901.
* Gubler joined the enlarged organising committee of the first International Congress of Mathematicians in December 1896.
* Gubler attended both the 1904 ICM in Heidelberg and the 1908 ICM in Rome, but did not give any talks.

Born 7 July 1845, Wila, Zürich canton, Switzerland. Died 6 November 1921, Zürich, Switzerland.
