**Warren Weaver** was an American mathematician famous as one of the pioneers of machine translation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. A leader in the development and application of mathematical models in the social sciences and natural sciences. 
2. Co-authored the famous “Dartmouth Paper,” which established the fundamentals of Operations Research.
3. Founded the Rockefeller Foundation’s “Program in Natural and Social Sciences” in 1949, which sought to better understand the possibilities of utilizing mathematics in the natural and social sciences.
4. Established the first formal research programs at the Applied Mathematics Panel of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, which helped drive the US victory during WWII.
5. Pioneered Random walks theory and proposed the field of cybernetics, which studies the technique of systems control and communication.
6. Supported the development of Monte Carlo methods, stochastic methods, and game theory in the sciences.
7. Played an instrumental role in introducing game theory as an analytical tool in economics. 
8. Advocated for the development of computers as a tool for scientific research and a major proponent for the development of Artificial Intelligence.

Born 17 July 1894, Reedsburg, Wisconsin, USA. Died 24 November 1978, Upper Milford, Connecticut, USA.
