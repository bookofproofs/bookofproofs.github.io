**George Bryan** made important contributions to kinematics, thermodynamics and the mathematical theory of flight. He wrote two important monographs and a whole series of undergraduate texts intended for private study.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the foundations of the theory of algebraic equations.
2. Applied and extended the theory of equations to many algebraic equations.
3. Providing solutions and answers to all types of algebraic equations.
4. Developed the concept of solving equations by expanding the terms into different forms, creating new equations. 
5. Showed that the solution of a cubic equation can be expressed as an infinite series.
6. One of the first mathematicians to approach the argument from the abstract point of view rather than the geometric.

Born 1 March 1864, Cambridge, England. Died 13 October 1928, Bordighera, Italy.
