**Giovanni Battista Guccia** was an Italian mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the concept of absolute time, as distinct from local time.
2. Created the first modern treatise on humanistic geography.
3. Introduced quadrants for the measurement of time and astronomical calculations.
4. Developed the "Guccian ellipse" or "ellipsis" as a means of solving plane problems in solid geometry.
5. Developed an equation to calculate a circle's circumference.
6. Developed the first tables and formulas to more accurately measure the length of a year.
7. Discovered the concept and technique of interpolation, enabling more precise calculations.
8. Established the first major school of spherical astronomy and geometry.
9. Developed logarithm tables and formulae, allowing more accurate trigonometric calculations.
10. Conducted early investigations into the properties and properties of light.

Born 21 October 1855, Palermo, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (now Italy). Died 29 October 1914, Palermo, Italy.
