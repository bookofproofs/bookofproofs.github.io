### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Crossley-Barlow Index, a method of calculating the number of theoretical sources of error in mathematics.
2. Pioneered the safe and accurate inquiry into the mathematics of heat transfer and the diffusion of fluids.
3. Published studies that advanced the understanding of the analytical development of complex physical problems in applied mathematics.
4. Made important contributions to the popularization of mathematical education in the United Kingdom.
5. Developed a novel approach to predictive models in mathematics.
6. Established new mathematical tools to visualize, analyze, and simulate physical phenomena.
7. Introduced pioneering mathematical methods to apply experimental mathematics to practical applications.
8. Influenced fields such as thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, and geophysical problems with his innovative approach to mathematical modeling.

Born 24 March 1863, Stratford on Avon, Warwickshire, England.
