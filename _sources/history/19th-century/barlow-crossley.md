**Crossley Barlow** was a mathematical tutor at the University Correspondence College in London who co-authored various publications about mathematical astronomy and geometry together with George Hartley Bryan.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Crossley William Crosby Barlow was born on 24 March 1863 in Stratford on Avon, Warwickshire, the son of the Swedenborgian minister William Crosby.
* For the purpose of explaining the traditional terminology and fundamental notions of the science for the benefit of elementary students Barlow and Bryan's work is admirably adapted.
* For half a century "Barlow and Bryan" has remained one of the standard textbooks on elementary mathematical astronomy.
* "Barlow and Bryan" is in essentials the same book as it was on its first appearance over half a century ago: an excellent introduction to the general mathematical and dynamical structure of astronomy.

Born 24 March 1863, Stratford on Avon, Warwickshire, England.
