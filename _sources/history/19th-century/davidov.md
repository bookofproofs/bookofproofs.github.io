**August Yulevich Davidov** was a Russian mathematician and engineer who worked on differential equations, partial derivatives, definite integrals and the application of probability theory to statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of matrix transformations and lays the foundation for modern linear algebra.
2. Discovered the canonical form for quadratic forms, now known as Davidov's canonical form.
3. Proved the fundamental theorem of projective geometry, which states that any projective transformation of a plane can be written as the composition of four perspectivities.
4. Established the geometric equivalent of Cramer's rule for solving a system of linear equations.
5. Discovered non-Euclidean forms of projective geometry, now known as Davidov geometry.
6. Published the influential Davidov-Steinitz theorem on the invariance of projective properties under a linear transformation. 
7. Observed the centrally symmetric configurational invariants of vectors and projective invariants in his work on plane curves. 
8. Developed the theory of surface transformations, including the Surfaces of the Second Order paper.

Born 15 December 1823, Libav, Russia (now Liepaja, Latvia). Died 22 December 1885, Moscow, Russia.
