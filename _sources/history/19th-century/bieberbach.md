**Ludwig Bieberbach** was a German mathematician best known for his conjecture on holomorphic functions. He was an enthusuastic supporter of the Nazis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the $n$-dimensional version of the Riemann Mapping Theorem (1909).
2. Introduced Bieberbach’s theorem of analytic functions (Bieberbach conjecture, 1916).
3. Developed the theory of Jacobi functions in several variables (1912-1920).
4. Established a number of important theorems related to Möbius transformations and hyperbolic geometry (1911-1912).
5. Discovered the relation between Hölder conditions and boundedness of the modulus of the derivatives for a field of analytic functions (1911).
6. Developed the theory of conformal representation of surfaces (1912-1924).
7. Published major works on differential equations of the second and third orders (1912, 1914).
8. Contributed to the study of the Euler, Catalan and Gauss hypergeometric equations (1914).
9. Pioneered the abstract theory of groups and fields (after 1917).
10. Developed the Bieberbach Conjecture about holomorphic functions in several variables (after 1912).

Born 4 December 1886, Goddelau, Darmstadt in Hessen, Germany. Died 1 September 1982, Oberaudorf in Oberbayern, Germany.
