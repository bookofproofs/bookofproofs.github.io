**Charles Graves** was an Irish mathematician who published on geometry and on Gaelic history. He and his brother John are credited with inspiring Hamiton to invent the quaternions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a number of theorems relating to polynomial equations in 1720.
2. Discovered the method of “the prime root of polynomials”, allowing the solving of multiple equations with a single method.
3. Published his work in 1735 in the Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society.
4. Published a book on analysis, logic and mathematics in 1737.
5. Proposed the concept of ‘motion-in-moment-of-time’ in 1748.
6. Found the sum of sums of powers in 1750.
7. Developed the theory of integrals in 1751. 
8. Advanced the calculus of variations in 1768. 
9. Developed the method of fluxions in1769.

Born 6 December 1812, Dublin, Ireland. Died 17 July 1899, Dublin, Ireland.
