**Heinrich Hertz** was a German physicist and mathematician best known for his discovery of what became known as wireless waves.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed key equations for the propagation of electromagnetic waves, referred to as Hertz's Law.
2. Established the basis for Maxwell's Equations, one of the most important equations of electromagnetism.
3. Shown experimentally that a magnetic field is produced when an electrical current flows in a conductor.
4. Demonstrated the existence of “displacement currents”, which can propagate electromagnetic waves.
5. Demonstrated the validity of the inverse-square law for electrically charged particles.
6. Clarified the behavior of electric potentials and currents in electrical circuits by introducing a number of pioneering mathematical methods.
7. Published several mathematical works, including the 1889 book on optics, Electric Waves.

Born 22 February 1857, Hamburg, Germany. Died 1 January 1894, Bonn, Germany.
