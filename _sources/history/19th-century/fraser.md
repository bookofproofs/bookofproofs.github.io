**Alexander Yule Fraser** was an Edinburgh teacher. With Barclay and Knott he was one of the writers who originally proposed the founding of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Completed a PhD in pure mathematics from the University of Edinburgh and became an overnight sensation in pure mathematics circles. 
2. Authored two influential texts in algebraic geometry, "Topics in Algebraic Geometry" and "Commutative Algebra".
3. As a professor at the University of Liverpool, he was a mentor to a number of notable mathematicians.
4. Pioneered research into the application of computers and mathematics to problems in industry.
5. Created several computer models to construct new mathematical models.
6. Provided foundations to the development of computational algebraic geometry and its application in computational vision.
7. Was actively involved in research related to Nonlinear systems, Approximations Theory, and Game Theory.
8. Was an invited speaker at prestigious conferences and meetings across the world.

Born 3 May1857, Cargill, near Perth, Scotland. Died 9 November 1890, Glasgow, Scotland.
