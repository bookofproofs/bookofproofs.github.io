**Alexander Yule Fraser** was an Edinburgh teacher. With Barclay and Knott he was one of the writers who originally proposed the founding of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His mother was  Elisabeth Fraser (born in Little Dunkeld, Perthshire about 1832).
* Alexander  had three younger siblings: Jessie (born about 1860), Donald (born about 1862), and Frederick  (born about 1877).
* Alexander Fraser's was educated at the University of Aberdeen where he specialised in mathematics and physics.
* Mr Fraser was entrusted with the charge of the Mathematical and Physical departments; and it is not too much to say that not a little of the success of this school is due to the energy with which he threw himself into the work of his department.
* In 1889 Fraser was appointed as Headmaster of Allen Glen's Institution in Glasgow.
* The Edinburgh Mathematical Society was founded in February 1883 and it was Fraser together with Andrew Jeffrey Gunion Barclay, also a mathematics master at George Watson's College at the time, together with Cargill Gilston Knott, an Assistant to the Professor of Natural Philosophy in Edinburgh University, who issued a circular 'to gentlemen in Edinburgh, in Cambridge and throughout Scotland generally whom they deemed likely to take an interest in such a Society' calling for a Mathematical Society to be set up.
* FRASER, M.A.(Aberdeen).
* Fraser became a founder member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society and was Secretary during 1883-88, and Treasurer during 1883-85.
* At the meeting on Friday 8 January 1886 Fraser gave an account of the methods for the quadrature of areas, especially by planimeters.
* On the opening of George Heriot's Hospital as a day school, Mr Fraser was appointed head of the mathematical and physical departments, to the equipment and organisation of which be devoted himself with energy and success.
* A little over a year ago Mr Fraser was appointed to the headmaster-ship of Allan Glen's Institution in Glasgow, but failing health compelled him to give it up, and be resigned with the intention of going to South Africa.
* While Mr Fraser was still a junior master at Watson's College, the idea occurred to him that there was room in Edinburgh for a Mathematical Society.
* In fact Fraser had been intending to address the meeting of the Society on Friday 14 November 1890 on the topic of the history of the controversy concerning the differential calculus.
* Fraser was elected to a fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 1 June 1885.

Born 3 May 1857, Cargill, near Perth, Scotland. Died 9 November 1890, Glasgow, Scotland.
