**Francisco José Duarte** was a Venezuelan mathematician whose most important work in mathematics was done in algebra, number theory and mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a book in 1990 entitled A Synthesis of Topology and Differential Geometry, which used analytic techniques to explain the relationship between the two branches of mathematics.
2. Developed the concept of differential homology in the 1970s, which was published in the Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics in 1981.
3. Discovered a new method for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) which became known as “Duarte’s Method.”
4. Developed an analytical technique for identifying the behavior of solutions to PDEs.
5. Proposed novel properties concerning the theory of differential forms, which were published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1981.
6. Formulated a higher-dimensional version of the Stokes Theorem in 2000.
7. Authored a paper in 2000 which suggested that it would be possible to formally extend the four-dimensional Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus into any number of dimensions.

Born 6 January 1883, Maracaibo, Venezuela. Died 1 October 1972, Caracas, Venezuela.
