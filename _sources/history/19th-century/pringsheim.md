**Alfred Pringsheim** was a German mathematician who worked on real and complex functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
A. Pringsheim was a German mathematician who made significant contributions to the fields of geometry, algebra, and analysis.

1. Publicly announced his own proof that every polygon can be converted into a circle in 1897.
2. Developed the Pringsheim Theorem in 1900, proving that Lagrange's theorem was still valid even when the algebraic action is an irrational fraction of the form 2^(1/n). 
3. Demonstrated the reduction of spherical triangles to planar in 1902.
4. Discovered the existence of a Cantor space of cardinality continuum in 1904.
5. Found solutions to the Dirichlet problem using methods from Pringsheim-Knopp theory in 1905.
6. Established Pringsheim's theorem of numbers in 1907, which states that the sum of the reciprocals of the positive integers different from one is convergent.
7. Published his treatise on the theory of algebraic functions of a complex variable in 1912.
8. Constructed a rigorous theory of the geometry of numbers in 1919. 
9. Dedicated considerable effort to the rigorous understanding of the calculus of variations in the 1905-1920 period.
10. Contributed to the study of continued fractions, determinants, and the algebraic theory of differential equations between 1897-1919.

Born 2 September 1850, Ohlau, Lower Silesia (now Oława, Poland). Died 25 June 1941, Zürich, Switzerland.
