**Christian Adolph Mayer** was a German mathematician who worked on differential equations, the calculus of variations and mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the science of crystallography, by factoring out the mathematical principles governing crystal growth from the random patterns of observation.
2. Discovered the mathematical process that described the external form of particular crystal classes.
3. Discovered and classified the five basic crystal forms known as the five crystal classes.
4. Produced the first scientific tables to aid in the classification of minerals and crystals.
5. Developed the mathematical theory that related the angles at which planes intersected to their physical characteristics.
6. Pioneered the field of geometrical crystallography and crystallomatrix.

Born 15 February 1839, Leipzig, Germany. Died 11 April 1908, Gries bei Bozen, Austria (now Bolzano, Italy).
