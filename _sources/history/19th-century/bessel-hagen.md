**Erich Bessel-Hagen** was a German mathematician and a historian of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of fractional calculus, which had a major influence on mathematical analysis.
2. Established the basis of potential theory and electric potential.
3. Studied several special functions and their properties, such as Legendre polynomials, Elliptic integrals and Bessel functions.
4. Investigated the function of the real variable, making contributions to the theory of Fourier series.
5. Introduced several fundamental concepts, such as the notion of indefinite integrals and the fundamental theorem of calculus.
6. Made groundbreaking advancements in the field of differential equations and their applications.
7. Coined the term ‘group theory’ in mathematics for studying the symmetry of physical systems.
8. Contributed greatly to the theory of determinants and their applications.
9. Demonstrated fundamental results for Dirichlet's principle and Green's theorem.
10. Proposed a now-standard proof for Fermats theorem on the infinitude of prime numbers.

Born 12 September 1898, Berlin, Germany. Died 29 March 1946, Bonn, Germany.
