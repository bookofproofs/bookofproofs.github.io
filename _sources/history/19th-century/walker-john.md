**John James Walker** was an English mathematician whose work was mainly in analysis of plane curves and in quaternions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Walker completed his school education at Plymouth New Grammar School before entering Trinity College Dublin as an undergraduate.
* Walker returned to England and, from 1865, he worked in London as a lecturer in applied mathematics and physics at University College.
* Walker was honoured with election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1883.
* The range of Walker's mathematical research was quite impressive.
* Walker was a strong advocate of Hamilton's quaternions and strongly believed that they had not been given as wide a use as they merited.
* The three most important papers that Walker wrote were on the analysis of plane curves and curved lines.
* It is an interesting thought what someone writing in 1901 about 'courtesy of manner which seemed to belong to a bygone generation' might think of Walker now, almost 100 years later.

Born 2 October 1825, Kennington, Surrey, England. Died 15 February 1900, Hampstead, England.
