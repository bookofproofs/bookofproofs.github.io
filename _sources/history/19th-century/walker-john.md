**John James Walker** was an English mathematician whose work was mainly in analysis of plane curves and in quaternions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
John James Walker was an American mathematician, known for his works in the field of number theory. He made important contributions to many areas of mathematics, including the study of Diophantine equations, the theory of quadratic forms, and the theory of prime numbers.

1. Developed new techniques for solving Diophantine equations. 
2. Systematically studied the theory of quadratic forms.
3. Developed theorems that reveal relationships between prime numbers.
4. Established new rules and methods for doing computations with prime numbers. 
5. Published a number of influential treatises on the topics of Diophantine equations and prime numbers. 
6. Discovered the quadratic reciprocity law. 
7. Developed a generalized form of the Kronecker-Weber theorem. 
8. Demonstrated the existence of infinitely many primes of the form 2^n -1. 
9. Developed an algorithm for computing prime numbers. 
10. Solved problems related to the normal distribution of prime numbers.

Born 2 October 1825, Kennington, Surrey, England. Died 15 February 1900, Hampstead, England.
