**John James Walker** was an English mathematician whose work was mainly in analysis of plane curves and in quaternions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In fact Walker attended London High School, the school at which his father was then headmaster until his father moved to become headmaster of Plymouth New Grammar School.
* Walker completed his school education at Plymouth New Grammar School before entering Trinity College Dublin as an undergraduate.
* His mother's family were English but Walker followed his father's family tradition in attending Trinity College Dublin.
* Walker's grandfather had been a fellow of Trinity and published classical texts as well as elementary mathematics and logic texts.
* Things were not entirely straightforward for Walker at Dublin for his family had ceased to be conformists so he was debarred from holding a scholarship.
* To add to his problems his father died young and Walker was left having little in the way of funds to see out his education.
* After Walker graduated he became tutor to the Guinness family, a wealthy Irish family who had made their money from brewing.
* Walker became a private tutor to the family in 1853, two years before the death of the founder Arthur Guinness, and he continued as a tutor until 1862.
* Walker returned to England and, from 1865, he worked in London as a lecturer in applied mathematics and physics at University College.
* Walker was honoured with election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1883.
* The range of Walker's mathematical research was quite impressive.
* Walker was a strong advocate of Hamilton's quaternions and strongly believed that they had not been given as wide a use as they merited.
* The three most important papers that Walker wrote were on the analysis of plane curves and curved lines.
* It is an interesting thought what someone writing in 1901 about 'courtesy of manner which seemed to belong to a bygone generation' might think of Walker now, almost 100 years later.

Born 2 October 1825, Kennington, Surrey, England. Died 15 February 1900, Hampstead, England.
