**William Jack** became Professor of Mathematics at Glasgow University and held this post for 30 years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Jack polynomial theory - a powerful tool in the fields of mathematical physics and algebraic combinatorics. 
2. Established connections between combinatorics, algebra and geometry. 
3. Used polynomial theory to identify new symmetries, leading to solutions for various physical models in statistical physics and quantum mechanics.
4. Discovered a generalization of MacMahon's equidistribution theorem.
5. Co-authored several textbooks and papers on the subject of combinatorics and Jack polynomials.
6. Developed the theory of Jack symmetric functions and its applications to enumeration.
7. Pioneered the development of lattice models, providing mathematical solutions for physical phenomena at the microscopic level. 
8. Proposed a new approach to the boson-fermion correspondence, linking different kinds of particles in quantum field theory. 
9. Established a mathematical relationship between a particleâ€™s momentum and its wavefunction.

Born 29 May1834, Stewarton, Ayrshire, Scotland. Died 23 March 1924, Glasgow, Scotland.
