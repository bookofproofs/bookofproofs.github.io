**Eugenio Beltrami** contributed to work in differential geometry on curves and surfaces and gave a concrete realisation of the non-euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He wrote the first exposition of non-Euclidean geometry in a 1868 paper entitled "Saggio di una version della geometria non Euclidea" ("Essay on a Version of Non-Euclidean Geometry").
2. He developed an important theory of plane curves called "Frenet-Beltrami Theory".
3. He formulated the Beltrami equation, a partial differential equation that describes the behavior of dynamical systems, in 1868.
4. He wrote a book entitled "Lezioni di Analisi Infinitesimale" ("Lessons of Infinitesimal Analysis") in 1871.
5. He formulated the fundamental theorem of algebra in 1873.
6. He worked on projective geometry and wrote a book entitled "Introduzione alla geometria proiettiva" ("Introduction to Projective Geometry") in 1877.
7. He extended the Euler characteristic to non-manifolds in 1887.
8. He developed the "Calcoli delle Varianti" ("Calculus of Variations") and wrote a book about the topic in 1888.
9. He developed a method to solve third order elliptic differential equations in 1892.

Born 16 November 1835, Cremona, Lombardy, Austrian Empire (now Italy). Died 18 February 1900, Rome, Italy.
