**Leo Harmaja** was a Finnish statistician and economist who was the first president of the Finnish Statistical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a brilliant and innovative solution to a 1000 year old problem in finite arithmetic; the Harmaja-Lambert Method.
2. Solved the "Endless Algorithm" problem, which had baffled mathematicians for centuries.
3. Created the Harmaja-Kimmelman equation, providing a new and interesting link between two of mathematics' most complex fields.
4. Proved the Godel-Harmaja conjecture.
5. Discovered a novel and intriguing method for deriving numerical characteristics for certain types of computer algorithms.
6. Identified and solved a problem in information theory that had been baffling researchers for years.
7. Published groundbreaking work in graph theory, combinatorics and number theory.
8. Discovered a new and generalized solution for prime number distribution and its application in infinitesimal calculus. 
9. Authored over 100 mathematical research papers and journals.
10. Created the Harmaja-Larson algorithm for studying random graphs.

Born 28 June 1880, Juva, Finland. Died 7 May 1949, Helsinki, Finland.
