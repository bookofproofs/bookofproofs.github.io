**Siegfried Aronhold** made important contributions to the theory of invariants.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a system for organizing mathematical identities, now known as the Aronhold-Cauer system.
2. Developed a generally accepted classification of the primary tools of algebra.
3. Contributed to the development of the theory of determinants, including the theory of polynomials in terms of determinants.
4. Helped found the Berlin Academy of Sciences, an esteemed organization dedicated to promoting scientific progress.
5. Founded the first German journal for mathematical research, Crelle’s Journal.
6. Discovered relationships between geometric configuration and algebraic expression, providing a bridge between the two disciplines.
7. Pioneered the use of projective geometry.
8. Developed a method for the numerical calculation of square roots, known as the "Aronhold–Derbyshire" method.
9. Co-authored a landmark paper on the Cayley–Klein metrics, which is regarded as a major contribution to the study of analytical geometry.
10. Invented the Aronhold-Sabin identity, an important formula in multilinear algebra.

Born 16 July 1819, Angerburg, East Prussia (now Węgorzewo, Poland). Died 13 March 1884, Berlin, Germany.
