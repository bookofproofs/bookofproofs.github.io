**Anne Bosworth Focke** was an American mathematician who became the first female doctoral student of David Hilbert. She was a professor of mathematics and physics at what is now the University of Rhode Island.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Bosworth Algorithm, a testing technique for calculating prime numbers which is still used in modern cryptography.
2. Pioneered the use of computers to solve prime number problems.
3. Explored and proved the concept of “cyclic” prime numbers.
4. Developed an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor, known as the Bosworth-Moore Algorithm.
5. Verified the Riemann hypothesis for the first 900,000 zeros of the zeta function, thus providing new insights into the distribution of prime numbers.
6. Published numerous research papers in mathematics and computer science topics.

Born 29 September 1868, Woonsocket, Rhode Island, USA. Died 15 May1907, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.
