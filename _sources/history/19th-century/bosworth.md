**Anne Bosworth Focke** was an American mathematician who became the first female doctoral student of David Hilbert. She was a professor of mathematics and physics at what is now the University of Rhode Island.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Woonsocket, the town in which Anne was born, was only established one year before her birth when three villages combined to form the town.
* It was in her home town of Woonsocket that Anne Bosworth attended school.
* The year in which Bosworth joined the College was the first in which it had begun to teach courses beyond the secondary school level.
* Bosworth's department consisted of just herself in 1892 but, in 1893, William Elisha Drake was appointed as Professor of Mechanical Engineering.
* Bosworth wanted to study more advanced mathematics and, in the summer of 1894 and of 1896, she studied with Eliakim Hastings Moore and Oskar Bolza for a Master's Degree at the University of Chicago.
* In April 1898, Bosworth was granted leave of absence so that she might attend lectures at the University of Göttingen in Germany.
* Bosworth submitted her 57-page thesis Begründung einer vom Parallelenaxiome unabhängigen Streckenrechnung to the University of Göttingen and her oral examination took place on 31 July 1899.
* Back at Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Bosworth again took up her role as Professor of Mathematics.
* While in Göttingen he and Bosworth had met.
* It is with regret that the institution loses Miss Bosworth from the faculty.
* Alfred Bosworth Focke was born on 30 September 1906.
* Anne Focke contacted pneumonia and died at the age of thirty-eight.
