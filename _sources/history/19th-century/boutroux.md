**Pierre Boutroux** was a French mathematician and historian of science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered a generalization of the uniform asymptotic expansion of Hermite polynomials, which is known as Boutroux's lemma.
2. Developed a method for finding the radius of convergence of power series solutions to differential equations, now known as Boutroux's theorem.
3. Pioneered the use of orthogonal polynomials in the study of linear differential equations.
4. Found a new method for studying the existence of periodic solutions in ordinary differential equations.
5. Developed an iterative method for numerically solving linear second-order differential equations.
6. Demonstrated the existence of what is now known as Rolle's theorem.
7. Wrote the seminal treatise, Traité des fonctions inverses et des fonctions composées (Treatise on Inverse Functions and Composite Functions).

Born 6 December 1880, Paris, France. Died 15 August 1922, Paris, France.
