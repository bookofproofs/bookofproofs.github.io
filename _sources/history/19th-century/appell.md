**Paul Appell** was a French mathematician who worked in analysis, geometry and mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Appell rejected the Catholic views of his parents but he retained their strong patriotic French views.
* The Germans captured Strasbourg after a 50-day siege in which Appell suffered greatly.
* Strasbourg was annexed by the Germans and Appell moved to Nancy to become a French citizen and prepare himself to study at university in Paris.
* Appell became a life-long friend of Poincaré while at Nancy.
* Appell now worked in Paris but returned for each vacation to German held Alsace.
* In 1892 Appell was elected to the Académie des Sciences.
* Dreyfus, like Appell, came from Alsace.
* Appell was very much involved with the case.
* When Dreyfus was granted a retrial in 1904, Appell served as an expert on the commission that, by July 1906, had cleared Dreyfus and reversed all previous convictions.
* After the war Appell had the ambition of his life fulfilled when his homeland of Alsace was returned to France.
* Also following the war the League of Nations was set up by the Allies at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, and Appell served as secretary-general for the French Association during the 1920s when the League had its headquarters at Geneva.
* Appell's first paper in 1876 was based on projective geometry continuing work of Chasles.
* In 1880 Appell defined a series of functions satisfying the condition that the derivative of the nnnth function is nnn times the (n−1)(n - 1)(n−1)th function.
* These are now called the Appell polynomials.
* There is an obvious question that we must ask ourselves about Appell.
* This is a pretty accurate assessment: Appell was one of the finest problem solvers there has been in mathematics.

Born 27 September 1855, Strasbourg, France. Died 24 October 1930, Paris, France.
