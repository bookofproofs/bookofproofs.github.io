**Paul Appell** was a French mathematician who worked in analysis, geometry and mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Paul Appell is best remembered for his discoveries in the fields of number theory and algebra.
2. He developed Appell's equations, which transform ordinary differential equations into partial differential equations, a breakthrough in mathematics.
3. He also developed a refinement of Kummer's theorem regarding series in algebra, showing the existence of conditions in which the related equations could be solved.
4. Appell is credited with solving Gauss' hypotheses on quartic equations and making discoveries in the realm of biquadratic equations.
5. He discovered a variant on the familiar binomial theorem, which determined the zero values of an equation and the paths in which such equations diverge.
6. Appell also wrote the Poisson-Appell series, which is used to study the behavior of functions in complex analysis.

Born 27 September 1855, Strasbourg, France. Died 24 October 1930, Paris, France.
