**Eugenio Levi** was an Italian mathematician who worked in complex analysis, differential geometry, Lie groups, partial differential equations and the minimum principle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed novel techniques for solving the biharmonic problem, a difficult mathematical problem involving the minimum potential of a certain type of partial-differential equations.
2. Obtained solutions to Riemann problems and Cauchy problems in nonlinear partial differential equations.
3. Established the necessary and sufficient conditions for well-posedness of the Dirichlet problem in the elliptic equation.
4. Established unique means of studying the more general and difficult inverse problems such as those related to the determination of boundary conditions by measuring boundary values.
5. Discovered a fundamental connection between boundary-value problems and integral equations, showing that a mixed boundary value problem can be converted into an equivalent integral equation of the second kind.
6. Showed that the solution to an elliptic boundary-value problem can be written as an expansion in terms of trigonometric functions and then using that expansion to solve the Cauchy problem.
7. Developed and solved the Dirichlet problem for domains defined by twisted curves.
8. Authored seminal works on partial differential equations and integral equations, including "The Theory of the Dirichlet Problem" and "Integral Equations and Their Applications".

Born 18 October 1883, Turin, Italy. Died 28 October 1917, Cormons, Italy.
