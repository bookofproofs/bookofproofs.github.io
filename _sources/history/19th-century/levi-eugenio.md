**Eugenio Levi** was an Italian mathematician who worked in complex analysis, differential geometry, Lie groups, partial differential equations and the minimum principle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Eugenio attended the Azeglio High School in Turin where he showed that he was an extremely gifted pupil.
* Two aspects of Bianchi's work would be particularly significant in his influences on Levi.
* He had published two important works before Levi began to study with him, namely Lectures on differential geometry (1894) and Lectures on the theory of groups of substitutions (1900).
* The other mathematician in Pisa who had a major influence on Levi's research was Ulisse Dini who held two chairs at the University of Pisa, the chair of analysis and higher geometry, and the chair of infinitesimal analysis.
* In 1904 Levi graduated from the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa with the award of his laurea.
* Levi published Sulla struttura dei gruppi finiti e continui â“‰(On the structure of finite and continuous groups) in 1905, the paper having been presented to Academy of Science of Turin on 2 April of that year by Bianchi.
* In 1906 Levi submitted his habilitation thesis Sulle equazioni lineari totalmente ellittiche alle derivate parziali to the Scuola Normale Superiore.
* Levi became interested in the Cauchy problem.
* Levi's remarkable mathematical career came to an end with the outbreak of World War I.
* It was over one year later, in October 1916, that Levi entered military service in, as a lieutenant in the 1st  Regiment of Engineers stationed at their headquarters in Pavia.
* Levi, however, was highly patriotic wished to return to military service.
* Decio Levi, who was a major in the Italian army, was killed on 15 September as fighting continued in the Monte Santo area.
* Eugenio Levi was a captain in charge of a company of engineers in the same general area.
* During the retreat, Eugenio Levi was hit in the forehead by a stray bullet.

Born 18 October 1883, Turin, Italy. Died 28 October 1917, Cormons, Italy.
