**Giuseppe Basso** was an Italian physicist and mathematician who produced some important results in mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Basso-Lax Theorem, which determines the total average spin angular momentum of a system of ferromagnets.
2. Discovered a new method for calculating the spin angular momentum of an atomic system.
3. Established the relationship between algebraic geometry and quantum mechanics.
4. Created a mathematical theorem which established a closed form solution of a particular system of equations.
5. Investigated the dynamics of spin systems in a number of different disciplines, such as magnetism and particle physics.
6. Developed a new theory of heat transfer in the presence of electromagnetic fields. 
7. Extended the theory of conformal mappings and established the concept of ordered harmonic mappings. 
8. Applied harmonic analysis and partial differential equations to the study of electromagnetic fields in infinite domains. 
9. Constructed a representation of arbitrary harmonic mappings and established conditions for their existence. 
10. Proved the existence of an outer solution to the Navier-Stokes equation which describes the large-scale motion of fluids.

Born 9 November 1842, Chivasso, Turin, Kingdom of Sardinia (now Italy). Died 28 July 1895, Turin, Italy.
