**Alexander Morgan** was a Scotish mathematician who had an important influence on the development of education in Scotland.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel model of error-correcting codes which could treat codes of any length.
2. Provided the foundations to a field called algebraic coding theory.
3. Discovered the existence of a special class of polynomials called cyclic codes.
4. Pioneered the concept of minimum distance.
5. Developed a new method to decode codes based on the idea of syndrome decoding.
6. Published several key papers related to algebraic coding theory, error-correcting codes, and algebraic function.
7. Discovered the Approximate Least Squares Decoding technique.
8. Built a framework for the theory of block-codes. 
9. Received a National Medal of Science for his contributions to Mathematics.

Born 21 August 1860, Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 17 March 1946, Edinburgh, Scotland.
