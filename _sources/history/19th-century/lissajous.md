**Jules Lissajous** was a French mathematician best known for the Lissajous figures produced from a pair of sine waves.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a graphic technique for depicting the infinitely complex lines known as “Lissajous curves”. 
2. He discovered the mathematical law for the formation of these curves, known as Lissajous' Law. 
3. He discovered the relationships between beat frequency, the frequency of oscillation and the motion of each of the curves. 
4. He proposed a mechanical harmonograph as an instrument to make the curves visible. 
5. He developed a Fourier Analyzer which could accurately measure the exact frequencies of signals, based on Fourier's integrals. 
6. He formulated a theory of resonance which helped explain why some sounds reverberate. 
7. He also discovered various mathematical identities and algorithms which are still used today.

Born 4 March 1822, Versailles, France. Died 24 June 1880, Plombières, France.
