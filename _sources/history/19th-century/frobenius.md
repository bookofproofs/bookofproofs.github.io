**Georg Frobenius** combined results from the theory of algebraic equations, geometry, and number theory, which led him to the study of abstract groups, the representation theory of groups and the character theory of groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Frobenius theorem, which established the necessity of a mathematical grouping of linear transformations.
2. Pioneered the modern algebraic treatment of linear differential equations.
3. Advanced the theory of partial differential equations.
4. Developed the general theory of determinants.
5. Established the theory of integral equations.
6. Discovered the Reciprocity Law for binary quadratic forms.
7. Proved that the necessary and sufficient condition for the solvability of a diophantine equation is the existence of an integer solution.
8. Established the first basic algebraic theory of elliptic functions.

Born 26 October 1849, Berlin-Charlottenburg, Prussia (now Germany). Died 3 August 1917, Berlin, Germany.
