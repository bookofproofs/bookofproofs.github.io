**William Burnside** wrote the first treatise on groups in English and was the first to develop the theory of groups from a modern abstract point of view.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first topic of "modern algebra" in 1902 and wrote the textbook "Theory of Groups of Finite Order".
2. Came up with the "Burnside's Lemma" which is an important tool in group theory.
3. Proved the "Burnside's Problem", which states that any finitely generated periodic group is finite.
4. Developed the well-known "Burnside Basis theorem" which states that any finite group of order n is a subgroup of the symmetric group of permutations of n letters.
5. Discovered the Burnside’s Matrix-Tree theorem which helps calculate the number of distinct spanning trees of a graph.
6. Introduced the Burnside’s Critical Pair Theorem which allows one to quickly reduce a system of equations to a much smaller set.
7. Developed Burnside's Normal Basis theorem which states that any finite group of order n is equivalent to a product of up to n cyclic groups.
8. Established Burnside's Theorem on Transfer which states that if a set of relations between variables forms an ideal then the corresponding transfer homomorphism is an isomorphism.

Born 2 July 1852, Paddington, London, England. Died 21 August 1927, Cotleigh, West Wickham, Kent, England.
