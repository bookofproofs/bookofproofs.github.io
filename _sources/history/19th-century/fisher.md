**Ronald Aylmer Fisher** was a British statistician and geneticist important in developing the use of statistics in genetics and biomathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Fisher's fundamental contribution to mathematics was the development of the theory of maximum likelihood. He established the basis for the analysis of numerical data, enabling scientists to solve real-world problems and make predictions from their data.
2. He is credited with the discovery of Fisher's z-test, which was crucial to the development of modern statistical tests.
3. He was instrumental in the development of null hypothesis testing and created the F-ratio and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) which are still widely used in statistical analysis.
4. He is known for coining the terms variance and bias and for the concept of sufficiency in statistics.
5. He is also credited with developing the concept of confidence intervals, which are commonly used in the evaluation of data.

Born 17 February 1890, London, England. Died 29 July 1962, Adelaide, Australia.
