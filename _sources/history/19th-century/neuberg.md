**Joseph  Neuberg**  was a Luxembourg mathematician who worked primarily in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the textbook Theory of Algebraic Equations in 1885.
2. Developed the theory of solvable equations.
3. Proved the existence of one-sided ideals in rings of algebraic integers.
4. Solved the 36 officer problem from matching theory using the method of ‘tabu’ assignments.
5. Formulated a version of the prime number theorem and proved it using the Chebyshev's method.
6. Published the first proofs of the existence of algebraic functions with multiple Puiseux series expansions.
7. Constructed the first exact solution of the linear equation system.
8. Discovered the theory of elliptic divisibility sequences.
9. Founded the theory of symmetric functions and proved the Kostka numbers.
