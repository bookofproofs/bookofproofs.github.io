**Joseph  Neuberg**  was a Luxembourg mathematician who worked primarily in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After completing his school education in Luxembourg, Neuberg went to Belgium to undertake his university studies.
* He graduated in July 1862 and so did not meet his future collaborator Paul Mansion who began his studies to the École normale des Sciences three months after Neuberg graduated.
* The first part of Neuberg's career was spent in various colleges.
* Neuberg was a teacher at the Athénée Royal and the École Normale at Bruges from January 1868 to April 1878.
* These tragedies were not the only ones to bring deep sadness to Neuberg's life for Maria, his second wife, died in 1904.
* After leaving Bruges in 1878, Neuberg was appointed as a teacher at the Athénée Royal of Liège, holding this position from May 1878 to December 1884.
* After nearly twenty years of wanting to become a university teacher, during which time he had produced a huge research output, Neuberg was appointed as an extraordinary professor at the University of Liège in 1884 and was promoted to ordinary professor there in 1887, holding this chair until he retired on 30 October 1910.
* In 1874 Neuberg, together with Eugène Catalan and Paul Mansion, founded a journal Nouvelle correspondance mathématique named by Neuberg to honour the earlier Correspondance mathématique et physique.
* The Nouvelle correspondance mathématique founded by Mansion, Catalan and Neuberg was published between 1874 and 1880.
* After this Catalan encouraged Mansion and Neuberg to collaborate in publishing a new journal and, indeed, they did precisely this, publishing Mathesis from 1881 onwards.
* Neuberg worked on the geometry of the triangle, showing great ingenuity, discovering many interesting new details but developing no large new theory.
* During the years that Nouvelle correspondance mathématique appeared (1874-1880), Neuberg published 24 papers in the journal such as Sur les polygones circonscrits à une conique et inscrits à une seconde conique Ⓣ(On polygons circumscribed to a conic and enscribed in a second conical), Quelques propriétés du triangle, Sur les triangles homologiques Ⓣ(Some properties of the triangle, On homological triangles), and Sur les points de Brocard Ⓣ(, On the Brocard points).
* Although he was a citizen of Luxembourg, Neuberg took Belgium nationality in 1866 and was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Belgium  Academy of Sciences in 1891 and a full member in 1897.

Born 30 October 1840, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg. Died 22 March 1926, Liège, Belgium.
