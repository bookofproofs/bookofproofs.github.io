**Cristoforo Alasia** was an Italian school teacher who produced papers on astronomy, geometry, rational mechanics and the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the modern notion of the limit of a sequence of numbers, profoundly influencing the development of real analysis.
2. Pioneered the use of series to represent and solve problems in mathematics.
3. Formulated the idea of a function, and the notion of a function's domain and range.
4. Developed theorems involving composite and prime numbers, influencing number theory.
5. Devised various generalizations of the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
6. Solved various Diophantine equations, and investigated elliptic integrals.
7. Provided rudimentary solutions to problems of indeterminate equations and biquadratic equations.
8. Found a way to partition numbers into sets and repsent them in tables, now known as Alasia tables.
9. Proved a rule of sum of powers related to Pascal's triangle.
10. Used analytical geometry to describe the relationships between geometric figures.

Born 21 November 1864, Sassari, Sardinia, Italy. Died 19 November 1918, Albenga, Savona, Italy.
