**Alicia Boole Stott** was a daughter of George Boole who made some discoveries in four-dimensional geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Here are some quotes which are relevant to Alicia's education.
* Alicia Boole experimented with the cubes and soon developed an amazing feel for four dimensional geometry.
* Alicia Boole wrote part of the preface of this book and also wrote some of the chapters on sections of 3-dimensional solids.
* Schoute was amazed to see Stott's models and immediately proposed meeting her in England.
* He came to England for his summer holidays over the next few years and stayed with Stott at the home of her maternal cousin in Hever.
* Schoute worked with Alicia Stott for almost 20 years, persuading her to publish her results which she did in two papers published in Amsterdam.
* Alicia Stott made two further important discoveries relating to constructions for polyhedra related to the golden section.
* Schoute died in April 1913 and at this point Stott's work on polytopes seems to stop.
* Three of these papers are written jointly with late Professor Dr P H Schoute connected during so many years to the University of Groningen; And this fruitful cooperation with the professor that she lost, is the reason for the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics to propose Mrs A Boole Stott for the doctorate honoris causa in Mathematics and Physics, to confer on the occasion of the coming festive commemoration of the 300th  birthday of the University.
* It was arranged for Stott to say with Schoute's widow when she came to Groningen to attend the celebrations and receive the honorary degree.
* When Coxeter left England to take up a post in Toronto in 1936 he received a present from Stott in the form of an antique stained-glass Archimedian solid lampshade.

Born 8 June 1860, Cork, Ireland. Died 17 December 1940, Highgate Middlesex, England.
