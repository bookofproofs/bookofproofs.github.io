**Alicia Boole Stott** was a daughter of George Boole who made some discoveries in four-dimensional geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1852 George Boole became her tutor and, following the death of her father, they married in 1855 and went to live in Castle Road, near Cork, Ireland.
* George and Mary Boole had five daughters, Mary Ellen Boole (1856-1900) who married the mathematician Charles Howard Hinton (1853-1907), Margaret Boole (1858-1935) who married Edward Taylor and was the mother of Geoffrey Ingram Taylor, Alicia Boole the subject of this biography known to her friends as Alice, Lucy Everest Boole (1862-1905) who became a chemist and the first woman to be elected a fellow of the Institute of Chemistry, and Ethel Lilian Boole (1864-1960) who became an author.
* Let us note the surprising fact that Charles Howard Hinton, who played a part in Alicia's mathematical education which we describe below, was convicted of bigamy after he married Maud Florence in 1883.
* George Boole died when his daughter Alicia was only four years old and, unable to support herself without a husband, his widow Mary left Ireland with four of her five daughters to live in London.
* However, she left Alicia in Cork to live with her maternal grandmother.
* Alicia she was brought up partly by her grandmother, partly by her great-uncle, but these were years when she felt repressed and unhappy.
* Mary Boole was forced to leave her job as a librarian and became a secretary to James Hinton (1822-1875), a surgeon and author, and father of the mathematician Charles Howard Hinton who married Alicia's oldest sister Mary Ellen in 1880.
* When Alicia was sixteen, in 1876, she returned to Cork for a short while where she worked in a children's hospital.
* Although Alicia had no formal education, she was taught by her mother Mary.
* If we are to gain some idea about the teaching that Alicia received from her mother, we must look at Mary Boole's ideas about teaching.
* Here are some quotes which are relevant to Alicia's education.
* Alicia Boole experimented with the cubes and soon developed an amazing feel for four dimensional geometry.
* Alicia Boole wrote part of the preface of this book and also wrote some of the chapters on sections of 3-dimensional solids.
* After taking up secretarial work near Liverpool in 1889 Alicia Boole met and married the actuary Walter Stott in 1890; they had two children, Mary Stott (1891-1982) and Leonard Stott (1892-1963).
* Through her husband, Stott learned of Pieter Hendrik Schoute's work on central sections of the regular polytopes in 1895 and Alicia Stott sent him photographs of her cardboard models.
* Schoute was amazed to see Stott's models and immediately proposed meeting her in England.
* He came to England for his summer holidays over the next few years and stayed with Stott at the home of her maternal cousin in Hever.
* Schoute worked with Alicia Stott for almost 20 years, persuading her to publish her results which she did in two papers published in Amsterdam.
* Alicia Stott made two further important discoveries relating to constructions for polyhedra related to the golden section.
* Schoute died in April 1913 and at this point Stott's work on polytopes seems to stop.
* Three of these papers are written jointly with late Professor Dr P H Schoute connected during so many years to the University of Groningen; And this fruitful cooperation with the professor that she lost, is the reason for the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics to propose Mrs A Boole Stott for the doctorate honoris causa in Mathematics and Physics, to confer on the occasion of the coming festive commemoration of the 300th  birthday of the University.
* It was arranged for Stott to say with Schoute's widow when she came to Groningen to attend the celebrations and receive the honorary degree.
* When Coxeter left England to take up a post in Toronto in 1936 he received a present from Stott in the form of an antique stained-glass Archimedian solid lampshade.

Born 8 June 1860, Cork, Ireland. Died 17 December 1940, Highgate Middlesex, England.
