**Salvatore Pincherle** was an Italian mathematician who can claim to be one of the founders of functional analysis. He established the Italian Mathematical Union.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made significant contributions to several areas of mathematics, including number theory, differential geometry, mathematical analysis and the calculus of variations. 
2. Developed a version of the Riemann-Roch theorem, which is now known as the Pincherle theorem.
3. Demonstrated a fundamental expansion of the Euler-Poisson series in a memoir presented in 1897 to the Belle Arti of Rome.
4. Published several notable works on the theory of complex numbers and the algebraic equations.
5. Established the basis of theorems on non-euclidean arithmetic geometry and linear algebra, which led to him being awarded the French Legion of Honor in 1912.
6. Contributed to the developments of quadrature formulas and the theory of elliptic functions. 
7. As well as being a Professor at the University of Bologna and University of Rome, he held positions of strength in numerous Italian academies and learned societies.

Born 11 March 1853, Trieste, Austria (now Italy). Died 10 July 1936, Bologna, Italy.
