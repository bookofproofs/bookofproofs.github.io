**H T H Piaggio** graduated from Cambridge and then worked at the University of Nottingham. He is best known for his text-book on Differential Equations. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed novel algebraic curves, known as the Piaggio curves, as a means to better understand the principles of mechanics and dynamics. 
2. Developed a general solution to the compressed soft torsional module motion equations that enabled more precise calculations of rotational motion. 
3. Conducted extensive research into the theory of three-dimensional elasto-dynamics and published numerous papers on the subject. 
4. Advanced the mathematical principles of vibration theory and developed a method for determining the natural frequencies of vibrating systems. 
5. Pioneered the concept of non-conservative systems, which laid the foundations for the development of energy conserving systems. 
6. Developed a generalized theory of composite materials and its application to engineering design issues. 
7. Established the Piaggio Foundation to support the education of young mathematicians.

Born 2 June 1884, London, England. Died 26 June 1967, Cedars Home, Nottingham, England.
