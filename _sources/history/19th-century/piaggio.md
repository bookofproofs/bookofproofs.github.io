**H T H Piaggio** graduated from Cambridge and then worked at the University of Nottingham. He is best known for his text-book on Differential Equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* H T H Piaggio was educated at the City of London School and at St John's College, Cambridge.
* In 1908 he was appointed Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Nottingham although at that time there was no separate Department of Mathematics there.
* A chair of mathematics was created at Nottingham and Piaggio was appointed to it in 1919.
* His most famous work, An Elementary Treatise on Differential Equations, was published by G Bell & Sons in 1920.
* Full details of his life appear in the obituary by D A Young.
* Here list a few articles which Piaggio published in The Mathematical Gazette: Relativity rhymes with a mathematical commentary (January 1922); Geometry and relativity (July 1922); Mathematics for evening technical students (July 1924); Mathematical physics in university and school (October 1924); Probability and its applications (July 1931); Three Sadleirian professors: A R Forsyth, E W Hobson and G H Hardy (October 1931); Mathematics and psychology (February 1933); Lagrange's equation (May 1935); Fallacies concerning averages (December 1937); and The incompleteness of "complete" primitives of differential equations (February 1939).
* In Nature  Piaggio published articles such as The operational calculus (1943) and The significance and development of Hamilton's quaternions (1943).
* In the Proceedings of the Glasgow Mathematical Association he published Exceptional integrals of a not completely integrable total differential equation (1953).
* The author effectively remarks that this is not a necessary condition for the existence of a solution.
* Piaggio was a member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, joining the Society in May 1912.
* He read papers to the Society such as Note on Linear Differential Equations with constant coefficients  on 10 May 1912.

Born 2 June 1884, London, England. Died 26 June 1967, Cedars Home, Nottingham, England.
