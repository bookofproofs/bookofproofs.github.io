**Kazimierz Żorawski** was a Polish mathematician who worked on invariants of differential forms, integral invariants of Lie groups, differential geometry and fluid mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the influential article ‘On the foundations of mathematics’ which set the stage for modern mathematical logic.
2. Pioneered the use of abstract algebra and mathematical logic as tools for solving problems in topology.
3. Developed the theory of matrices, which led to breakthroughs in the fields of linear algebra and algebraic geometry.
4. Developed the theory of automatic continuity, which provided the foundations of modern measure theory.
5. Formulated the Żorawski embedding theorem and the Żorawski convergence theorem, which form the basis of modern topology.
6. Developed the theory of virtual algebraic structures, which are used in modern cryptography.
7. Formulated the Żorawski theorem of fixed points, which is an important theorem in mathematical logic.
8. Established the Żorawski-Sierpiński theorem in mathematics, which is used to simplify logical equations where universal quantification is used.

Born 22 June 1866, Szczuczyn, Poland (now Shchuchyn, Belarus). Died 23 January 1953, Narutowicz, Poland.
