**Winifred Edgerton**  was the first woman to receive a degree from Columbia University and the first American woman to receive a PhD in mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* This was a fantastic achievement and Merrill became the first American woman to obtain a Ph.D. in mathematics.
* Winifred Haring Edgerton was born on 24 September 1862 in Ripon, Wisconsin.
* Her parents were Emmet Edgerton and Clara Cooper.
* In August 1850, at the time of the US census, he was living in Dix, Schuyler County, New York with his mother Ann (who was widowed), and his sister Mary Edgerton aged 17.
* Let us note that Winifred was given Haring as a middle name.
* It was while Emmet and Clara Edgerton were living in Ripon that Winifred Edgerton, the subject of this biography, was born.
* By 1870 Winifred appears to be living with Edward Edgerton, a real estate agent, and his wife Eva, in New York city.
* Her parents Emmet and Clara Edgerton are living near by.
* Emmet is also a real estate agent but what relation he is to Edward Edgerton is not clear.
* In the 1880 census Winifred Edgerton, now 17 years old, is living with her parents Emmet, with occupation real estate agent, and Clara.
* We have also failed to see how 8 year old Eber Edgerton, who was living with the family at the time of the 1860 census, fits into the picture since we can find no further record of him.
* We learn that private tutors provided Winifred's early education, that the authors James Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Thomas Bailey Aldrich were friends of the Edgerton family, and that Winifred's love of mathematics and astronomy when she was young led to her parents having an observatory built for her at one of their homes.
* Winifred decided that she wanted a college education and, in 1879 she entered Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts.
* It was predicted to return in about 70 years so, in 1883, Edgerton obtained data from Harvard College Observatory and did her own calculations of the orbit of the comet.
* Edgerton was excited by her work on the comet and was very keen to become an undergraduate at Columbia University since this would give her access to the Columbia University telescope.
* In January 1884 Edgerton applied to Columbia University, in New York, to be allowed to study mathematics and astronomy.
* Up until this time Columbia University was an institute for men only and due to this being the case Edgerton's initial request was refused.
* However, with the support and advice of Frederick A P Barnard, the 10th president of Columbia University who was a campaigner for women's education, Edgerton visited each trustee individually to plead her case.
* At the next meeting of the Committee on the Course and Statutes of Columbia College on 18 January, they voted to allow Edgerton to use their telescope.
* Edgerton, however, did unofficially attend graduate courses in both astronomy and pure mathematics.
* Edgerton wrote two dissertations, one on astronomy and one on mathematics.
* She was offered a position as a professor of mathematics at Smith College in 1887, which she declined, as in that year she married Frederick James Hamilton Merrill (1861-1916), an 1885 graduate of Columbia's School of Mines who received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1890.
* They were married on 1 September 1887 and had four children: Louise Merrill (1888-1982); Hamilton "Jim" Merrill (1890-1982); Winifred "Kit" Merrill (1897-1943); and Edgerton "Pete" Merrill (1901-1960).
* Frederick Merrill served as the New York State geologist from 1899 to 1904.
* Marriage took Merrill from her pursuit of a scholarly career.
* Merrill withdrew from the campaign when her husband objected to what he saw as the impropriety of committee meetings being held in men's offices in the city.
* In 1890 the family moved to Albany when Frederick Merrill was appointed as Assistant State Geologist of New York.
* At this time the family were wealthy having received two large inheritances, one from Frederick Merrill's mother and one from an uncle.
* The Merrills entertained leading people in their fine homes.
* Mrs Merrill took her seat as a member of the Board at the called meeting September 29, 1898.
* The financial problems became very serious, Frederick Merrill was declared bankrupt and as a consequence was forced to resign as State Geologist of New York.
* The problems culminated in Frederick and Winifred Merrill separating in 1904.
* Frederick Merrill left Albany and became a mining geologist in New York City.
* Winifred Merrill resumed her academic career in New York City, becoming Principal of Highcliffe Hall, at Park Hill, Younkers, New York.
* The school closed in 1902 but, in 1904, she established the day and boarding school Highcliffe Hall with Merrill as its Principal.
* In 1906 Winifred Merrill founded the Oaksmere School for Girls in New Rochelle, Westchester County, New York.
* At the time of the 1910 census Winifred Merrill was living in New Rochelle with her four children and nine others described as 'servants'.
* Merrill was the Principal of Oaksmere School for Girls, while her four children have 'occupation - none'.
* Soon after this the school moved to Merrill's estate on Long Island Sound in the village of Larchmont, Mamaroneck, New York.
* In 1918 Merrill published Musical Autograms.
* The school, however, continued to operate and announced:" Oaksmere Mrs Merrill's School for Girls.
* Mrs Merrill, Orienta Point, Mamaroneck, N.Y.".
* In 1926 Merrill tried to found another school in Larchmont but she was not successful.
* On the 50th anniversary of Merrill's graduation from Wellesley, 31 March 1933, a portrait of her by Helena E Ogden Campbell was presented to Columbia by the Wellesley class of 1883 and the Columbia Women's Graduate Club.
* It was with her elder son, Hamilton Merrill, that Merrill lived during the last two years of her life.

Born 24 September 1862, Ripon, Wisconsin, USA. Died 6 September 1951, Fairfield, Connecticut, USA.
