**Lewis Fry Richardson** was an English mathematician, physicist and meteorologist who pioneered modern mathematical techniques of weather forecasting.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first mathematical study of the long-range behaviour of the weather, leading to the development of numerical weather prediction. 
2. Published the first work using integral equations to describe the particle distributions in gases. 
3. Discovered a deterministic chaos, now known as Richardson's chaos, in the soil-water pressure system.
4. Published over 200 mathematical papers, making contributions to the fields of electrodynamics, aerodynamics, the theory of probability and the mathematical modelling of physical processes. 
5. Used mathematical methods to analyze and validate statistical data, allowing for consensus among statisticians.
6. Applied mathematical theory to mathematical operations management, providing crucial input in the management of resources and the more efficient allocation of resources.
7. Pioneered the study of pacifism and non-violence, inspired by love and understanding, as a model of social change.
8. Developed mathematical models of population growth, demonstrating the powerful effects of population on resource consumption.

Born 11 October 1881, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, England. Died 30 September 1953, Kilmun, Argyll, Scotland.
