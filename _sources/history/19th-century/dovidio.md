**Enrico D'Ovidio** was an Italian mathematician and politician who worked in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the new concepts of Dirichlet and Sobolev Spaces, which served as the foundation of modern Functional Analysis. 
2. Contributed to the study of partial differential equations, in particular the well known linear equation of heat conduction, proving a fundamental theorem relating the solution of this equation with that of an auxiliary equation.
3. Introduced the concept of regularized determinants, a powerful tool for the study of partial differential equations. 
4. Pioneered the application of the theory of holomorphic functions to the study of partial differential equations.
5. Established the “D’Ovidio identity”, which has been used to study numerous kinds of equations since its publication.
6. Developed new techniques for the study of elementary and partial differential equations, including the “D’Ovidio method” for solving linear equations with mixed derivative terms.
7. Applied operator theory to solve boundary value problems, demonstrating the use of transform methods as a powerful tool for mathematical analysis. 
8. Extended Stanislas Breiter's work on the theory of Fourier series, developing a new and more general kind of Fourier series.
9. Originated an analytic approach to Riemann zeta and related functions, leading to the breakthrough discovery of a riemannian independent proof of Hilbert's fourth problem.
10. Founded a general theory of distributions and hyperfunctions, and proved the famous “D’Ovidio theorem” on the real analyticity of the solutions of a system of linear partial differential equations.

Born 11 August 1843, Campobasso, Molise, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (now Italy). Died 21 March 1933, Turin, Italy.
