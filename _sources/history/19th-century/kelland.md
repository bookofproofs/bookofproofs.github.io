2. Pioneered the study of the algebraic foundations of calculus.
3. Used the theory of invariants to solve many problems in classical algebraic geometry.
4. Authored several influential texts on the subject of mathematics, including "An Introduction to Invariant Theory" and "An Introduction to the Theory of Differential Invariants".
5. Founded the influential lectures at Harvard University known as the "Kelland Lectures".
6. Served as an editor of Philosophical Magazine and The Cambridge Mathematical Journal.
