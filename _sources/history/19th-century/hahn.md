**Hans Hahn** was an Austrian mathematician who is best remembered for the Hahn-Banach theorem. He also made important contributions to the calculus of variations, developing ideas of Weierstrass.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the field of modern mathematical analysis with his book, "The Set Function Calculus".
2. Developed the concept of "Vienna Circle", a group of prominent logical positivists.
3. Pioneered the Hahn-Banach theorem, a fundamental theorem in functional analysis.
4. Pioneered the theory of group algebras in mathematics.
5. Solved the Problem of Plateau, a long-standing mathematical problem.
6. Developed the Hahn Polynomial for algebraic analysis.
7. Made major contributions to the fields of topology and set theory.
8. Introduced the modern theory of permutation groups in mathematics.
9. Co-developed the KÃ–the-Hahn Differentiation Theorem.
10. Pioneered the theory of von Neumann algebras and algebraic logic.

Born 27 September 1879, Vienna, Austria. Died 24 July 1934, Vienna, Austria.
