**Adam Günther** wa a German mathematician who published on pure mathematics and its history, and physics, geophysics, meteorology, geography, and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Günther began his university studies of mathematics and physics in 1865.
* It was common at this time for students in Germany to study at several different universities, and indeed Günther carried this out with enthusiam for he studied at the universities of Erlangen, Heidelberg, Leipzig, Berlin and Göttingen.
* Günther participated in the war which ended in the defeat of France in 1871.
* At the end of the war Günther returned to complete his doctoral dissertation and the degree was awarded by Erlangen for Studien zur theoretischen Photometrie Ⓣ(Studies in theoretical photometry) in 1872.
* With his qualification to teach in universities, Günther became a docent at Munich Polytechnicum in 1874.
* After holding this position for ten years, Günther moved back to Munich in 1886 when he was appointed as professor of geograghy at the Technische Hochschule there.
