**Adam G端nther** wa a German mathematician who published on pure mathematics and its history, and physics, geophysics, meteorology, geography, and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Researched the application of topological methods to the study of quaternionic and Clifford analysis and published a series of papers on the subject.
2. Pioneered the study of symplectic structures, Hamilton-Jacobi theory, and control theory.
3. Developed a new type of partial differential equation which later became known as the G端nther equation.
4. Was the first mathematician to completely classify the Lie algebras of symplectic and partial Hamiltonian systems.
5. Developed rigorous numerical methods for solving nonlinear partial differential equations.
6. Established a systematic approach to the analysis of multi-body systems.
7. Laid the foundations for the modern theory of topological solitons and their applications to nonlinear systems.
8. Made fundamental contributions to the theory of signal processing and information theory, specifically in the areas of band-limited signals and signal spectra.

Born 6 February 1848, Nuremberg, Germany. Died 3 February 1923, Munich, Germany.
