**Heinrich Weber** was a German mathematician whose main work was in algebra, number theory, analysis and applications of analysis to mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Provided the first rigorous proof of what is now known as Weber’s theorem in 1876. 
2. Developed the foundation for the study of vector analysis and analytical dynamics. 
3. Founded a unified theory of gravitation—unsupported by the earlier work of Isaac Newton. 
4. Discovered several relations for abelian integrals in 1891.
5. Contributed to the field of differential geometry. 
6. Authored groundbreaking books such as Elliptic Functions (1891) and Differential and Integral Calculus (1906). 
7. Pioneered the development of an axiom system for geometry and formulated the first axiomatic development of projective geometry. 
8. Established the first textbook on linear algebra. 
9. Developed three important theorems related to determinants and polynomials. 
10. Introduced the concept of homogeneous coordinates into mathematics.

Born 5 March 1842, Heidelberg, Germany. Died 17 May 1913, Strasbourg, Germany (now France).
