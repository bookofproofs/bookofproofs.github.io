**Ferdinand Minding** worked in differential geometry and the theory of surfaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of differential and integral calculus in Germany.
2. Discovered the principle of wave motion used in wave mechanics.
3. Developed the theory of Jupiter's moons, which allowed the construction of a predictive model of the behavior of multiple bodies.
4. Provided the first proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
5. Solved the wave equation.
6. Found the basic principles of relativity.
7. Published several papers on the mathematical theory of energy conservation.
8. Pioneered the use of mathematical equations to explain physical phenomena.
9. Proved the Reciprocity Theorem.
10. Developed the concept of a group and symmetry of a group.

Born 23 January 1806, Kalisz, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 3 May 1885, Dorpat, Russia (now Tartu, Estonia).
