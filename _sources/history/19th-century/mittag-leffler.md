**Gösta Mittag-Leffler** was a Swedish mathematician who worked on the general theory of functions. His best known work concerned the analytic representation of a one-valued function.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The reader will have noticed that Gösta Mittag-Leffler had a surname which combined both his mother's name Mittag and his father's name Leffler so might suppose that when his parents married they combined their names; however this was not so.
* Gösta's mother took the name Gustava Wilhelmina Leffler on her marriage and when their first child Gösta was born, he took the name Gösta Leffler.
* It was not until Gösta Leffler was a twenty year old student that he decided to add "Mittag" to his name.
* Gösta's father was a school teacher who became a headmaster of a high school in Stockholm.
* As we mentioned, Gösta was the eldest of the family and he was born in the schoolhouse at the school where his father taught.
* After a while his parents bought a house of their own and in this new home Gösta's sister and two brothers were born; none of them would follow Gösta in adding Mittag to their names.
* Gösta's grandfather on his father's side was a sail maker who, like his son would do, served for a time as a member of parliament.
* Gösta's grandfather on his mother's side was a dean in the church, living in a country area of Sweden.
* As a young boy Gösta spent each summer holiday with his mother's parents and he had a great affection for his mother's family.
* It was clear from his later life that Mittag-Leffler had many talents in addition to his mathematics and it was his upbringing that did much to foster these talents.
* His parents house was frequently filled with their friends and it provided an environment in which Gösta, together with his brothers and sister, learnt much in addition to their schooling.
* Mittag-Leffler trained as an actuary but later took up mathematics.
* As a result Mittag-Leffler was appointed as a Docent at the University of Uppsala in 1872.
* In October 1873 Mittag-Leffler set off for Paris.
* Although Mittag-Leffler met many mathematicians in Paris, such as Bouquet, Briot, Chasles, Darboux, and Liouville, the main aim of the visit was to learn from Hermite.
* Mittag-Leffler attended Hermite's lectures on elliptic functions but found them hard going.
* Certainly Hermite spoke in glowing terms about Weierstrass and the contributions he and other German mathematicians were making, so Mittag-Leffler made a decision to go to Berlin in the spring of 1875.
* There he attended Weierstrass's lectures which proved to be extremely influential in setting the direction of Mittag-Leffler's subsequent mathematical work.
* While Mittag-Leffler was in Berlin he learnt that the professor of mathematics at Helsingfors (today called Helsinki), Lorenz Lindelöf, the father of Ernst Lindelöf, was leaving the chair to take up an administrative post.
* We have quoted extensively from Mittag-Leffler's writing about this overseas trip and his reaction to national rivalries.
* We have done so because it is important in determining the international role which Mittag-Leffler went on to play, for his passion for international cooperation in mathematics was a direct consequence of what he saw on his three year trip abroad.
* Mittag-Leffler was appointed to a chair at the University of Helsinki in 1876 and, five years later, he returned to his home town of Stockholm to take up a chair at the University.
* They had met while Mittag-Leffler was living in Helsinki and, although Signe was from a Swedish family, they too were living in Finland.
* Mittag-Leffler made numerous contributions to mathematical analysis particularly in areas concerned with limits and including calculus, analytic geometry and probability theory.
* His best known work concerned the analytic representation of a one-valued function, this work culminated in the Mittag-Leffler theorem.
* Mittag-Leffler tried to generalise this result to meromorphic function while he was studying in Berlin.
* Mittag-Leffler became the sole proprietor of a theorem that later became widely known and with this he took his place in the circle of internationally known mathematicians.
* Mittag-Leffler was one of the first mathematicians to support Cantor's theory of sets but, one has to remark, a consequence of this was that Kronecker refused to publish in Acta Mathematica .
* Between 1900 and 1905 Mittag-Leffler published a series of five papers which he called "Notes" on the summation of divergent series.
* The region in which he was able to do this is now called Mittag-Leffler's star.
* In 1882 Mittag-Leffler founded Acta Mathematica and served as chief editor of the journal for 45 years.
* The original idea for such a journal came from Sophus Lie in 1881, but it was Mittag-Leffler's understanding of the European mathematical scene, together with his political skills, which ensured its success.
* It required an international base and certainly Mittag-Leffler fully understood this.
* Mittag-Leffler was always a good judge of the quality of the work submitted to him for publication.
* In 1884, the year Mittag-Leffler published his masterpiece, Kovalevskaya arrived in Stockholm at his invitation.
* By the early 1890s Mittag-Leffler had built for his family a wonderful new home in Djursholm in the suburbs of Stockholm.
* there Mittag-Leffler appeared at his best, a most entertaining mixture of the great international mathematician and the rather naive country squire.
* Mittag-Leffler and his wife bequeathed their library and estate at Djursholm in Sweden to the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1916.
* However, eventually the Mittag-Leffler Institute was set up based on the house and today is a major mathematical research centre.
* Mittag-Leffler received many honours.

Born 16 March 1846, Stockholm, Sweden. Died 7 July 1927, Stockholm, Sweden.
