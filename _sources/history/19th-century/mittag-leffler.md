**Gösta Mittag-Leffler** was a Swedish mathematician who worked on the general theory of functions. His best known work concerned the analytic representation of a one-valued function.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Acta Mathematica journal, which is still the leading journal in mathematics.
2. His contributions to mathematical analysis helped make it the foremost subject of study in mathematics.
3. He was the first to prove the convergence of Fourier series for non-periodic functions.
4. Solved the Goursat problem by introducing the theory of fractional integration.
5. Developed the Mittag-Leffler theorem, which is a method of analyzing a power series in terms of series of constants.
6. Established a new journal, Arkiv för Matematik, which published papers dealing with applied mathematics.
7. His contributions to algebra included papers on the theory of matrices, determinants, and the theory of forms.
8. Used remarkable methods in the theory of functions, particularly the theory of entire functions, including elliptic moduli.
9. Made major contributions to the theory of integro-differential equations.
10. Developed the incomplete Gamma function and its application to the solution of linear difference equations.

Born 16 March 1846, Stockholm, Sweden. Died 7 July 1927, Stockholm, Sweden.
