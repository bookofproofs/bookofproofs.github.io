**Harold Hotelling** was an American mathematical statistician who wrote important papers on economics as well as on statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Now the year Harold was born marks the beginning of automobile production in the United States and soon it became clear that automobiles were going to replace horses as a means of transport.
* The young Hotelling was an avid reader, making great use of the Seattle Public Library.
* Following the award of his doctorate, Hotelling was appointed as a junior associate at the Food Research Institute attached to Stanford University.
* The year 1931 was significant for Hotelling in another way for, in that year, he left Stanford University to take up a professorship in the Economics Department of Columbia University.
* Hotelling then met Susanna Porter Edmonson who was a student in a statistics course he was teaching.
* Hotelling was passionately against all that Hitler stood for and strongly argued for the United States to enter the war long before the country did.
* Hotelling pressed Columbia University to set up an independent department of statistics with its own permanent staff.
* Hotelling received an offer from the University of North Carolina to start a statistics programme there.
* Hotelling, therefore, left Columbia in 1946 to start up a Department of Mathematical Statistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
* Hotelling drew together a group of statisticians at the Institute, a list of whom reads like a role call of honour.
* In creating a world centre of excellence in mathematical statistical research Hotelling surely had no equal.
* Now Hotelling wrote, as we have already indicated, important papers on economics as well as on statistics.
* Finally, we should also examine Hotelling's ideas on teaching mathematics and statistics.

Born 29 September 1895, Fulda, Minnesota, USA. Died 26 December 1973, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.
