**Harold Hotelling** was an American mathematical statistician who wrote important papers on economics as well as on statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Harold's mother was Lucy Amelia Rawson who was descended from Edward Rawson who was Secretary of the Massachusetts Bay colony soon after it was founded by English Puritan settlers in 1630.
* In fact Hotelling could trace his family back much further than the seventeenth century, to important people in England and Holland.
* Harold was the oldest of his parents' six children who were brought up according to strict Methodist principles.
* Now the year Harold was born marks the beginning of automobile production in the United States and soon it became clear that automobiles were going to replace horses as a means of transport.
* The Ford Motor Company began selling cars in 1903 and Harold's father soon realised that selling hay for horses was going to be a thing of the past.
* The Methodist Church in Seattle became a major focus for the family and, although later in his life Hotelling would not be religious, nevertheless he retained the strong beliefs in social justice, and the abhorrence of alcohol and tobacco, which came from the Church.
* The young Hotelling was an avid reader, making great use of the Seattle Public Library.
* Later that year he married Floy Tracy; they had two children, the first born in 1923 being named Eric Bell Hotelling showing his appreciation of E T Bell.
* Following the award of his doctorate, Hotelling was appointed as a junior associate at the Food Research Institute attached to Stanford University.
* The year 1931 was significant for Hotelling in another way for, in that year, he left Stanford University to take up a professorship in the Economics Department of Columbia University.
* Hotelling then met Susanna Porter Edmonson who was a student in a statistics course he was teaching.
* We note that Harold and Susanna Hotelling had six children.
* Hotelling was passionately against all that Hitler stood for and strongly argued for the United States to enter the war long before the country did.
* Hotelling pressed Columbia University to set up an independent department of statistics with its own permanent staff.
* Hotelling received an offer from the University of North Carolina to start a statistics programme there.
* Hotelling, therefore, left Columbia in 1946 to start up a Department of Mathematical Statistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
* Hotelling drew together a group of statisticians at the Institute, a list of whom reads like a role call of honour.
* In creating a world centre of excellence in mathematical statistical research Hotelling surely had no equal.
* Now Hotelling wrote, as we have already indicated, important papers on economics as well as on statistics.
* Finally, we should also examine Hotelling's ideas on teaching mathematics and statistics.

Born 29 September 1895, Fulda, Minnesota, USA. Died 26 December 1973, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.
