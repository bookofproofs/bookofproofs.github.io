**William Thomson** (Lord Kelvin) became Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow at a very young age. He made important contributions to many areas of Physics including electricity, magnetism and thermodynamics. His work on the first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable made his fortune.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical system of vector analysis. 
2. Founded and developed the mathematical theory of thermodynamics. 
3. Worked on the mathematical representation of Maxwell's equations and the electromagnetic field.
4. Investigated the theories of elliptic functions, harmonic functions, and integrals of the calculus of variations.
5. Made contributions to the mathematical analysis of electricity and hydrodynamics.
6. Co-created the two-fluid theory of electricity. 
7. Made major contributions to the mathematical theory of heat flow and conduction. 
8. Founded the theory of elasticity, or elasticity theory.
9. Developed the mathematical theory of pliable materials, i.e. deformable bodies.
