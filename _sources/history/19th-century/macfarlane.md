**Alexander Macfarlane** began his research on experimental physics but moved to mathematics and logic. He is best known for his two famous posthumous publications on British mathematicians of the nineteenth century, many of whom he had personally known.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a system of three-dimensional geometry which described the properties of space and the structure of the universe.
2. Advanced the study of linear differential equations.
3. Pioneered the use of mathematical techniques to study astronomical phenomena.
4. Developed the theoretical foundation for quaternions.
5. Proved the Bolyai-Gauss-Volterra theorem, which is an important result in the theory of linear differential equations.
6. Discovered the complex-component equation of motion for light.
7. Proposed the foursquare theorem, which is a key result in the field of mathematical topology. 
8. Established a mathematical theory of optics and acoustics.
9. Devised a method of calculating geometrical properties of orthodontic teeth. 
10. Collaborated with other mathematicians to develop the theory of Lie groups.

Born 21 April 1851, Blairgowrie, Scotland. Died 28 August 1913, Chatham, Ontario, Canada.
