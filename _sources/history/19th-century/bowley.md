**Arthur Bowley** was a leading statistician with an international reputation for his work on poverty. His expertise in mathematics meant that he played an important part in developing the mathematical basis of economics. He was a prolific author publishing many influential books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical model for the movement of capital from one sector of the economy to another.
2. Established the fundamentals for utilitarianism in the mathematical field.
3. Co-authored a milestone book on mathematical economics titled ‘Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices’.
4. Coined the term 'utility' to describe the benefits derived from goods and services.
5. Pioneered the development of empirical and mathematical analysis for the quantification of economic relationships.
6. Introduced the concept of an index number to measure changes in the level of prices of various goods and services.
7. Proposed a new approach towards "multiple correlation" which was later used to measure economic spillover effects.
8. Introduced multiple regression analysis which is still used in economics today.
9. Conducted pioneering research on the subject of economic statistics.
10. Was instrumental in developing indices to measure changes in the real value of money.

Born 6 November 1869, Bristol, England. Died 21 January 1957, Fernhurst, Surrey, England.
