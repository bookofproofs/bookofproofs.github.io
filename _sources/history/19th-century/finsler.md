**Paul Finsler** was a German mathematician who worked on set theory, differential geometry, number theory, probability theory and the foundations of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of abstract differential geometry with the publication of "Grundlagen der differentialgeometrie" in 1942.
2. Influenced the development of modern differential geometry with his contributions to the theory of basic forms.
3. Developed the theory of variational calculus which is important for the differential geometry of surfaces and many other topics in mathematics.
4. Expanded the subject of convexity and related it to the theory of spaces, closed surfaces and manifolds.
5. Published several important works on symmetries, linear connections, and Riemannian geometry.
6. Discovered the concept of torsion which enabled the mathematical analysis of physical processes in nature.
7. Demonstrated that the mathematics of Finsler geometry can be applied to relativity and general relativity.
8. Proposed an extension of the space-time continuum based on the mathematics of Finsler geometry.
9. Developed the mathematics of Finsler manifolds which encompasses classic mathematical applications and real-life physical applications.
10. Established the Finsler-Hadamard theorem which applies to shortest paths in space-time.

Born 11 April 1894, Heilbronn, Neckar, Germany. Died 29 April 1970, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.
