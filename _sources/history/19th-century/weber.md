**Wilhelm Weber** was a German physicist who did important work on electricity. He collaborated with Gauss.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a unit system of measurement for electricity, now known as the "Weber," which helped further the development of electrical engineering.
2. Pioneered the field of spectral analysis, making advances in the use of Fourier equations.
3. Solved the biquadratic equation and was the first to prove the Binomial Theorem for a tetrahedron.
4. Perfected the technique of plane surveying and applied trigonometry to geodesy for the development of the metric system.
5. Developed theories of differential calculus, the calculus of variations and elliptic functions.
6. Developed methods to measure the speed of light and electric current.
7. Proved that algebraic equations of the fifth degree are solvable by radicals.

Born 4 October 1804, Wittenberg, Saxony (now Germany). Died 23 June 1891, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany.
