**Giuseppe Veronese** was an Italian mathematician who worked on the geometry of multidimensional spaces, model theory and transfinite numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a positive solution to a sixth-order equation, now known as Veronese's thirteenth theorem.
2. Edited the collection of works by Euclid and other Greek mathematicians, "Adelardus Venetus".
3. Introduced the concept of imaginary numbers, laying the foundations of algebraic solutions.
4. Carried out investigations into the mathematical properties of surfaces and volumes with work on the arithmetical triangle.
5. Made several advances to spherical trigonometry, including the discovery of the Sine law.
6. Authored several important maths books, including "Analysis Elementorum" and "Practica Geometrica".
7. Conducted pioneering experiments in calculus.
8. Solved mathematical problems related to the logarithm of certain trigonometric functions.
9. Demonstrated a knowledge of negative numbers as an extension of zero.
10. Discovered the law of constant and periodic number-lines.

Born 7 May1854, Chioggia (now Italy). Died 17 July 1917, Padua, Italy.
