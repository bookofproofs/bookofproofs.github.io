**Giuseppe Veronese** was an Italian mathematician who worked on the geometry of multidimensional spaces, model theory and transfinite numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1872, at age eighteen, Veronese had give up his education to take a job in Vienna.
* Veronese was fortunate, however, and the following year he was able to begin his studies again.
* In 1876 Veronese was appointed as assistant in analytical geometry on the strength of his paper on Pascal's hexagram which he had completed by this time.
* This is quite remarkable for one should remember that at this point Veronese was still studying the undergraduate course in Rome.
* Veronese was in contact with Klein who was about to take up a chair of geometry at the University of Leipzig.
* It was arranged that Veronese would go to Leipzig in 1880 and to spend the year 1880-81 undertaking research under Klein.
* The chair was filled by holding a competition which Veronese won and he was appointed to the chair in 1881.
* In 1880 Veronese described an nnn-dimensional projective geometry, showing that simplifications could be obtained in passing to higher dimensions.
* This was a very original approach to higher-dimensional projective geometry that Veronese developed.
* Veronese provided both logical and psychological motivations for his approach which greatly influenced the Italian school of geometry for many years.
* Veronese invented non-Archimedean geometries which he proposed around 1890.
* However Peano strongly criticised the notion due to the lack of rigour of Veronese's description and also for the fact that he did not justify his use of infinitesimal and infinite segments.
* We should mention one or two further aspects of Veronese's life.

Born 7 May 1854, Chioggia (now Italy). Died 17 July 1917, Padua, Italy.
