**Hendrik Lorentz** is best known for his work on electromagnetic radiation and the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction. He developed the mathematical theory of the electron.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the Lorentz transformation which connected time and space between inertial frames of reference. 
2. Discovered the contraction in length and time dilation between inertial frames of reference. 
3. Proved the correctness of the Michelson–Morley experiment, leading to the modern understanding of the relationship between motion and the speed of light. 
4. Developed the first mathematical theory of electron beams and their application in electron microscopy. 
5. Founded the Zeeman effect, describing the splitting of spectral lines in a field. 
6. Proved that the electron has a non-zero size and associated magnetic moment. 
7. Founded magneto-ionic theory, which is used to describe the linear absorption of electromagnetic waves by ionized gases. 
8. Co-discovered the frequency dependence of the electron conductivity of metals. 
9. Proposed the action–reaction law between particles, which is the foundation of the classical understanding of the interactions between particles. 
10. Demonstrated the ability to produce charged particles using a discharge tube, which is now called the Lorentz–Levy effect.

Born 18 July 1853, Arnhem, Netherlands. Died 4 February 1928, Haarlem, Netherlands.
