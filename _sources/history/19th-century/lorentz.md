**Hendrik Lorentz** is best known for his work on electromagnetic radiation and the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction. He developed the mathematical theory of the electron.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Lorentz refined Maxwell's electromagnetic theory in his doctoral thesis The theory of the reflection and refraction of light presented in 1875.
* After retiring from this chair, Lorentz was appointed director of research at the Teyler Institute, Haarlem.
* Before the existence of electrons was proved, Lorentz proposed that light waves were due to oscillations of an electric charge in the atom.
* Lorentz developed his mathematical theory of the electron for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1902.
* The Nobel prize was awarded jointly to Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman, a student of Lorentz.
* Zeeman had verified experimentally Lorentz's theoretical work on atomic structure, demonstrating the effect of a strong magnetic field on the oscillations by measuring the change in the wavelength of the light produced.
* Lorentz is also famed for his work on the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction, which is a contraction in the length of an object at relativistic speeds.
* Lorentz transformations, which he introduced in 1904, form the basis of Einstein's special theory of relativity.
* Lorentz was chairman of the first Solvay Conference held in Brussels in the autumn of 1911.
* However Lorentz never fully accepted quantum theory and always hoped that it would be possible to incorporate it back into the classical approach.
* Lorentz received a great many honours for his outstanding work.

Born 18 July 1853, Arnhem, Netherlands. Died 4 February 1928, Haarlem, Netherlands.
