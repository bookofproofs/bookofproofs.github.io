**George Darwin** was an English mathematician who was a son of Charles Darwin and studied the three-body-problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Darwin excelled at Pritchard's school and he won a scholarship to study at Trinity College, Cambridge.
* Many top graduates from Cambridge from this period entered the legal profession and that indeed is what Darwin did, being called to the Bar in 1874.
* However it was not uncommon for some to return to mathematical or other scientific study and Darwin followed this route returning to Trinity where he still held his fellowship.
* Darwin studied tidal effects on the planets.
* Darwin made a major study of the three-body problem in the case of the orbits of the Sun-Earth-Moon system.
* Despite the fact that we do not accept Darwin's conclusions today, he is important in being the first to apply mathematical techniques to study the evolution of the Sun-Earth-Moon system.
* Darwin was President of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1899-1900 and won the Gold Medal from that Society 1892.

Born 9 July 1845, Downe, Kent, England. Died 7 December 1912, Cambridge, England.
