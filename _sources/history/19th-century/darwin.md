**George Darwin** was an English mathematician who was a son of Charles Darwin and studied the three-body-problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Devised the principle of the transfer of energy in tidal waves.
2. Developed theories on how volcanoes are formed.
3. Proposed a thesis on tidal convergence and retention.
4. Developed the theories of tidal friction and tidal period.
5. Published a series of articles on the theories of volcano formation and the effect of the moon upon the Earth’s tides.
6. Envisioned the centrifugal force idea which lead to him explaining the origin of the moon.
7. Established the mathematical equation for understanding the shapes curves assume with the conditions of constant force.
8. Calculated the secular acceleration of the Moon’s mean motion.
9. Discovered the orbits of binary stars by applying Newton's laws of motion and gravity to two objects. 
10. Published a book titled "Tidal Theory" in 1883 which contributed to the understanding of tides in astronomy.

Born 9 July 1845, Downe, Kent, England. Died 7 December 1912, Cambridge, England.
