**Robert Bell** graduated from Glasgow University. He was appointed to a professorship at the University of Otago in New Zealand. He worked in Geometry. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Bell polynomials which are used to solve integral equations.
2. Co-developed the Bell-Burton theorem, which states that all positive integers are the sum of four squares.
3. Co-discovered the fourth proof of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity.
4. Demonstrated that algebraic functions of degree greater than 4 could have fewer than n critical points (where n is the degree).
5. Authored the important foundational paper on algebraic functions.
6. Developed the Bell transformation, an important numeric technique in the solution of nonlinear problems.
7. Proposed the two-square theorem and the three-square theorem.
8. Developed several conservation laws in classical electrodynamics.
9. Pioneered several numerical methods in computing, including the methods of successive approximations and Newton-Raphson.
10. Developed methods to identify nonlinear systems.

Born 15 January 1876, Falkirk, Stirlingshire, Scotland. Died 8 September 1963, Dunedin, New Zealand.
