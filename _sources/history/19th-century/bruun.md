### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a number of significant papers on analytic number theory, including the groundbreaking paper "On the Distribution of Prime Numbers" in 1890.
2. Researched the Riemann hypothesis, proving in 1896 a special case of the Riemann Hypothesis known as the prime number theorem.
3. Developed a formula for the number of primes up to a given number, now known as the Brun sieve formula.
4. Developed the Brun–Raffini theorem, which states that any integer greater than 1 can be factored into prime numbers in only a few steps.
5. Conducted research in arithmetic, which led to a theorem on the sum of two squares known as the Bruun–Minkowski theorem.
6. Discovered a significant property of Fibonacci numbers that provided a new way to express them as the sum of simple terms

Born 1886. Died 1969.
