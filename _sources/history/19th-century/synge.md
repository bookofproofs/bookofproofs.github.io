**John Synge** was an Irish mathematician whose most important contributions were to theoretical physics. He wrote over 400 papers and 11 books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. John Synge made important contributions to the foundations of modern differential geometry, particularly the field of finite topology and the principle of least action.
2. He provided a systematic solution to the convergence of geometric series and established an analytic connection between the notion of potential theory and geometry.
3. Synge developed analytical theories of topology and harmonic analysis, providing a formal approach to the characterization of curved surfaces and geodesics.
4. He developed a rigorous mathematical framework to define and describe the movement of liquids in a rotational field.
5. He introduced the concept of Riemann geometry and derived equations which could be applied in gravitational theory.
6. Synge constructed a mathematical model which accounted for the behavior of electric fields, providing an early example of field theory.
7. He proposed an early version of the Einstein field equations and explored the properties of curved space-time.
8. He developed general proofs for Fubini's theorem, extending the theory of integration to cover multiple variables.
9. Synge wrote several papers on the use of matrices in conjunction with differential equations, paving the way for the development of numerical analysis.
10. He identified a number of general principles which could be used to classify symmetric equations and developed methods for computing multidimensional integrations.

Born 23 March 1897, Dublin, Ireland. Died 30 March 1995, Dublin, Ireland.
