**Oskar Klein** was a Swedish theoretical physicist whose ideas were important in the development of string theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the quantum mechanical theory of the electron spin in 1924, providing the first description of electron spin as an intrinsic quantum mechanical degree of freedom.
2. Proposed the first version of a model of the modern quark theory of hadrons in 1926.
3. Proposed a five-dimensional model of space-time in 1926.
4. Contributed to the development of the wave equation theory.
5. Co-created the Dirac equation with Paul Dirac and Enrico Fermi, illustrating the principles of quantum mechanics.
6. Helped create the quantum field theory and advance the understanding of nuclear forces.
7. Conducted research into the wave functions of particles and matter waves.
8. Wrote important papers on the mathematics of quantum mechanics, relativity and cosmology.

Born 15 September 1894, MÃ¶rby, Stockholm, Sweden. Died 5 February 1977, Stockholm, Sweden.
