**Henry Watson** was an English mathematician who wrote some influential text-books on electricity and magnetism.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed and proved the so-called Watson's Lemma, a theorem of mathematical inequality.
2. Developed a method of representing solutions to algebraic equations in terms of trigonometric functions.
3. Studied elliptic integrals and devised an important generalization of the Fresnel Integrals.
4. Provided a detailed study to the numerical integration of certain classes of differential equations.
5. Investigated the applications of harmonic analysis to the solution of differential equations.
6. Developed a method for treating partial differential equations.
7. Showed the equivalence of certain infinite series.
8. Invented the modern N-method for approximating solutions of differential equations.

Born 25 February 1827, Marylebone, London, England. Died 11 January 1903, Berkswell (near Coventry), England.
