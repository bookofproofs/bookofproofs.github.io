**Umberto Puppini** was an Italian mathematical physicist who worked in hydraulics and became a member of the fascist govermant in the 1920s and 1930s.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a framework for the construction of numerical solutions of partial differential equations.
2. Established a new class of boundary value problems related to stochastic analysis.
3. Developed a numerical method based on the Wiener-Hopf technique for the evaluation of solutions of certain classes of partial differential equations.
4. Introduced a new approach to numerical solution of linear two point boundary value problems using a combination of stochastic analysis and numerical methods.
5. Demonstrated the usefulness of Wiener-Hopf technique for solving certain classes of partial differential equations.
6. Successfully developed novel numerical schemes for the solution of certain classes of integro-partial differential equations.
7. Proposed a generalization of the Wiener-Hopf technique to address variational problems.
8. Discovered a method to obtain an exact solution of a class of semilinear partial differential equations.
9. Developed a numerical method based on stochastic calculus to solve certain types of partial differential equations.
10. Proposed a novel method to reduce the order of certain nonlinear, systems of differential equations.

Born 16 August 1884, Bologna, Italy. Died 21 May 1946, Bologna, Italy.
