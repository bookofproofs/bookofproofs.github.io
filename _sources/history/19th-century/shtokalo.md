**Josif Shtokalo** was a Ukrainian mathematician who worked in the areas of differential equations, operational calculus and the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* There Shtokalo completed his secondary education at the Katerinoslav Classical Gymnasium.
* Shtokalo studied at Dnipropetrovsk University in south-central Ukraine, beginning his studies there in 1927.
* Shtokalo had been given the task of evacuating the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences from Kharkov to the Urals so by the time Kharkov fell to the Germans, Shtokalo and the Academy had moved far towards the east.
* Shtokalo had moved to Ufa, the capital of the Bashkortostan republic in western Russia, where the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences had been relocated.
* Shtokalo continued to undertake research on differential equations while in Ufa, but the direction of his research was at this time influenced by the joint work of Bogolyubov with Nikolai Mitrofanovich Krylov in which they developed a theory of non-linear oscillations; they called their topic 'non-linear mechanics'.
* In 1943 Shtokalo left Ufa and moved to Moscow where the Institute of Mathematics of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences had been moved.
* Many had insufficient background to begin their university studies and Shtokalo had to organise the Department to cope with difficulties of this kind.
* Shtokalo was also greatly assisted by Nikolai Nikolaevich Bogolyubov who worked at Kiev State University from 1946 to 1949.
* As examples of Shtokalo's work at this time we note his remarkable publication record.
* In 1956 Shtokalo returned to Kiev where he again took up his posts at the Institute of Mathematics of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and his chair at Kiev University.
* At the Institute of Mathematics Shtokalo set up a seminar on the history of mathematics and was head of the Department of History of Mathematics from 1956 to 1963.
* On 30 November 1989 a bronze plaque was put up on the apartment to mark the place where Shtokalo had lived.
* Shtokalo worked mainly in the areas of differential equations, operational calculus and the history of mathematics.
* Shtokalo's work had a particular impact on linear ordinary differential equations with almost periodic and quasi-periodic solutions.
* Shtokalo has received many honours.

Born 16 November 1897, Skomorokhy, Sokal, Galicia (now Ukraine). Died 5 January 1987, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine).
