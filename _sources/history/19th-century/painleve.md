**Paul Painlevé** worked on differential equations. He served twice as prime-minister of France.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Painlevé–Gambier classification of second order differential equations.
2. Developed the Painlevé analysis of singularities of solutions of equations of mathematical physics.
3. Established the Painlevé test, a method for non-linear ordinary differential equations to assess whether solutions exist in the form of series.
4. Introduced a method of implementation of the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics in space of more than three dimensions.
5. Founded the Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées, one of the oldest mathematical journals still in publication.
6. Proved that a system of two coupled oscillators possesses invariance properties under certain transformations. 
7. Developed the Painlevé Conjecture, a conjecture in number theory that claims that any irrational algebraic number is either a transcendental number or a quadratic surd.
8. Constructed the Painlevé transcendental functions, solutions of certain non-linear differential equations.

Born 5 December 1863, Paris, France. Died 29 October 1933, Paris, France.
