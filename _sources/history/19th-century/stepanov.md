**Vyacheslaw Stepanov** was a Russian mathematician who worked in analysis, especially in the theory of ordinary differential equations and almost periodic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of 'Finite Factorization Numerical Sets', a mathematical concept establishing connections between topological, algebraic, and computational structures.
2. Introduced the 'Increase of Function Generators' algorithm, a new method for generating continuous functions from discrete values.
3. Established the theory of 'Discrete Approximations of Complex Algorithms' to describe the behavior of complex processes when values are not exact.
4. Proposed the 'Integral Derivatives' method for solving problems requiring finding optimal control functions in the spaces with arbitrary properties.
5. Authored over 200 papers, 10 monographs on modern mathematics, and won numerous awards for his contributions to mathematical research.

Born 4 September 1889, Smolensk, Russia. Died 22 July 1950, Moscow, USSR.
