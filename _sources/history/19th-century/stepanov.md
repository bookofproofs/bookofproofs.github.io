**Vyacheslaw Stepanov** was a Russian mathematician who worked in analysis, especially in the theory of ordinary differential equations and almost periodic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Stepanov was educated at the Smolensk High School and he graduated from the school in 1908 having excelled in science in general and mathematics in particular.
* In 1912 Stepanov completed his first degree, but Egorov encouraged him to continue his studies so that he might prepare for a professorship.
* Luzin, who was a little ahead of Stepanov, had travelled abroad visiting Göttingen where he had been inspired by Edmund Landau.
* Stepanov also spent some time in Göttingen where he attended lectures by both David Hilbert and Edmund Landau.
* Stepanov was appointed as lecturer in Moscow in 1915, then from 1921 he was involved in training young scientists at the Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics which had been founded in that year.
* Egorov was appointed Director of the Research Institute in 1923 and Stepanov assisted his former research supervisor in running the Institute until Egorov was dismissed from his role in 1929.
* In 1928 Stepanov became professor at Moscow University.
* Stepanov was appointed Director of the Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics in 1939, continuing to hold this post until his death.
* Harald Bohr had introduced the notion of an almost periodic function and Stepanov constructed and investigated new classes of generalised almost periodic functions.
* A graduate-level text Qualitative Theory of Differential Equations by Stepanov and his student Viktor V Nemytskii became a classic, the 1960 edition being reprinted in 1989.
* Four years before his death, Stepanov was honoured with election to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.

Born 4 September 1889, Smolensk, Russia. Died 22 July 1950, Moscow, USSR.
