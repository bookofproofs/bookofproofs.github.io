**Sophus Lie** was a Norwegian mathematician who made major advances in the theory of continuous groups of transformations and differential equations. Lie groups and Lie algebras are named after him.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of continuous groups of transformations, now known as Lie groups. 
2. Foundation of the theory of algebraic transformation groups, the foundation of modern group theory. 
3. Described the geometry of space of more than three dimensions and developed the theory of non-Euclidean geometry.
4. His work in differential equations predicted Lie algebras which are now used as fundamental mathematical tools in particle physics. 
5. Significant progress in the theory of differential equations, especially the recognition of the importance of the symmetry of linear partial differential equations. 
6. Investigations of the geometry underlying calculus and projective geometry, the foundations of rational mechanics, and the domain of thermodynamics. 
7. Contributions to the early study of Riemann surfaces, the classification of second order linear partial differential equations, and the enumeration of quantic invariants.
8. Co-authored the book Theorie der Transformations Gruppen which was a precusor for the modern study of Representation Theory.

Born 17 December 1842, Nordfjordeide, Norway. Died 18 February 1899, Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway.
