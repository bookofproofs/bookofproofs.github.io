**Julia** was one of the forefathers of modern dynamical systems theory and is best remembered for what is now called the Julia set.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of a Julia set of points in the complex plane in 1917.
2. Discovered the properties of a whole family of functions, now known as Julia Sets, which are widely used in chaos theory.
3. Developed novel notation for defining irrational numbers. 
4. Introduced the parametric representation of a function. 
5. Discovered profound relationships between the iteration of polynomials and trigonometric functions. 
6. Discovered the Mandelbrot set in 1980, which is one of the most complex mathematical objects known to date. 
7. Introduced the related Möbius transformations and developed the concept of group theory in 1935. 
8. Resolved the problem of noise in the radio wave transmission by introducing an integral equation based on the theory of functions in 1926. 
9. Worked extensively on Fourier series expansions and was one of the first to use the more general form of the series as a tool to solve problems in physics. 
10. Developed the exponentials, logarithmic and trigonometric functions as we use them today.

Born 3 February 1893, Sidi bel Abbès, Algeria. Died 19 March 1978, Paris, France.
