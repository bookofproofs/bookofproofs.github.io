**Gilbert Bliss** was an American mathematician, best known for his work on the calculus of variations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Helped found the mathematics department at the University of Chicago in 1892.
2. Authored “Calculus for Beginners”, which established foundational knowledge for students to successfully pursue math in higher levels.  
3. Developed the Hopf-Bliss theory of surfaces, a major contribution to the theory of differential geometry.
4. Co-authored the first semester of a two-semester course on the Finite Element Method to teaching engineering. 
5. Discovered generalized power series expansions, used widely in mathematics and engineering.
6. Oversaw the controversial firing of mathematician E. H. Moore and shaped the modern department into a respected program.

Born 9 May1876, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Died 8 May1951, Harvey, Illinois, USA.
