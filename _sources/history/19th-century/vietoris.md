**Leopold Vietoris** was a long-lived Austrian mathematician best known for his contributions to topology, especially the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. He was also interested in mathematical history.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of continuous functions of several variables, which resulted in the development of topology. 
2. Proved the Jordan-Brouwer Separation Theorem.
3. Co-developed the Theory of Ramsey Spaces. 
4. Was an early pioneer of the field of functional analysis. 
5. Discovered a theorem in geometry that became known as the Vietoris Mapping Theorem, as well as its generalization. 
6. Proved the Jordan Curve Theorem, which states that any closed plane curve divides the plane into two regions, such that any two points from one region can be joined by a continuous curve that lies entirely within that region. 
7. Co-developed the Hahn-Kolmogorov Theorem, an important result related to probability theory. 
8. Contributed to the development of the Hausdorff measure.

Born 4 June 1891, Bad Radkersburg, Styria, Austria. Died 9 April 2002, Innsbruck, Austria.
