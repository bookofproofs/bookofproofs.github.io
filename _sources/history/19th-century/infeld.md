**Leopold Infeld** was a Polish physicist who worked in the theory of relativity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Variational Theory of Light Rays (1929), which formed the basis for the modern quantum mechanical spin-orbit interaction as well as laid the groundwork for the modern understanding of photochemical reactions.
2. Developed the Infeld–Hull method of solution for non-linear systems of differential equations (1966). 
3. Demonstrated that two-dimensional collisions of identical particles could not be described by the classical theories of Newtonian mechanics (1930).
4. Showed that the gravitational field equations of General Relativity are equivalent to the field equations of a certain non-linear scalar field (1933). 
5. Co-authored the classic text The Evolution of Physics (1938) with Albert Einstein. 
6. Developed the "Infeld identity" relating the metric tensors in the different coordinate systems (1941). 
7. Collaborated with Leszek P. Sitarz in editing Short Course in Relativity (in 4 editions, 1956–2001). 
8. Developed a variational principle for classical and relativistic electrodynamics (1948).

Born 20 August 1898, Kraków, Austria-Hungary (now Poland). Died 15 January 1968, Warsaw, Poland.
