**Friedrich Engel** worked on Lie algebras as well as continuous groups and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Engel expansion, a powerful algebraic technique for solving Diophantine equations.
2. Published a major work on linear algebra related to the Engel expansion.
3. Pioneered the use of multiple algebraic equations to describe 3D geometry.
4. Named and characterized the Engel group, a set of mathematical functions important in invariant theory.
5. Discovered a property of the Engel group that allowed the complete solution of invariant equations.
6. Solved five problems posed by the Academy of Sciences of Copenhagen in 1887.
7. Applied his findings to the study of quaternions, a type of hyper-complex numbers.
8. Developed a novel approach to graph theory using matrix notation.

Born 26 December 1861, Lugau (near Chemnitz), Germany. Died 29 September 1941, Giessen, Germany.
