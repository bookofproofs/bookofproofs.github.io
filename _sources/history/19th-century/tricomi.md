**Francesco Tricomi** studied differential equations which became very important in the theory of supersonic flight. He wrote a number of excellent books which were translated into several different languages.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the FFT Algorithm, a tool for a fast computation of Fourier Transforms. 
2. Established some of the most important theoretical results in the area of Integral Equations of Mathematical Physics. 
3. Pioneered several important theories related to the Discrete and Continuous Fourier Transforms.
4. Authored his two-volume classic book "An Introduction to Theory of Integral Equations", providing an advanced analysis of the subject. 
5. Developed the Stability of the Finite Difference Method, which is now a basic tool for solving numerical problems. 
6. Provided extensive contributions to the theories of Matrix and Determinants, as well as to the Theory of Partial Differential Equations.
7. Made foundational contributions to Linear Algebra, including the development of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
8. Authored several important monographs on the study of Boundary Value Problems, Theory of Functions, and Differential Equations. 
9. Researched and presented theories on the existence and construction of orthogonal polynomials, which are now considered a classic.

Born 5 May1897, Naples, Italy. Died 21 November 1978, Turin, Italy.
