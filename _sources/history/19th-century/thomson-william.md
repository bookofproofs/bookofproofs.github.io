**William Thomson** was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Victoria College Stellenbosch in South Africa and went on to become Principal of the University of South Africa in Pretoria.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical techniques of vector analysis and Fourier analysis. 
2. Founded the branch of mathematics known as thermodynamics.  
3. Demonstrated that heat is a form of energy.
4. Proposed the absolute temperature scale. 
5. Developed the Thomson effect, which explains how an electric current can produce a temperature difference in a conductor. 
6. Deduced the Second Law of Thermodynamics from his equations of motion. 
7. Researched the properties of the gyroscope. 
8. Made advances in hydrodynamics. 
9. Established a comprehensive mathematical theory of electricity called the electromotive series. 
10. Applied mathematical principles to the study of magnetism.

Born 31 December 1856, Kirkton of Mailer, Perthshire, Scotland. Died 6 August 1947, Dunedin, Glencairn, Simonstown, South Africa.
