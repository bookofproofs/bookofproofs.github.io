**Heinrich Maschke** was a German mathematician born in what is now Poland who worked on group theory and on differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved a special case of Schur's theorem in 1898, the first mathematician to do so.
2. Proved the Maschke’s theorem in 1902, a result that enables the representation of linear transformations in finite-dimensional vector spaces. 
3. Contributed to the volume of invariant theory, including formulating the Maschke reciprocity law.
4. Developed the concept of ‘separability’ and wrote papers on the spinor calculus.
5. Published several papers on group representations that served as an important building block of the representation theory.
6. Published a number of papers on hypercomplex numbers and related subjects.
7. Worked on theorem-proving validity of proofs utilizing a mixture of different logical methods.
8. Produced insights into the theory of projective geometries and applications of non-Euclidean geometry.

Born 24 October 1853, Breslau, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 1 March 1908, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
