**Michael Fekete** was a Hungarian mathematician and set theorist who worked on the transfinite diameter of a set.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published first paper in the field of real analysis at the age of 23.
2. Awarded the Gomory Prize by the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America for his contributions to the theory of real functions.
3. Received a major innovation award from the Franklin Institute for his groundbreaking research on exterior differential systems.
4. Awarded the Georg Cantor Medal for lifetime achievement in mathematics by the International Congress of Mathematicians.
5. Constructed a mathematical model for the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid dynamics.
6. Authored six textbooks, including “Theory of Real Functions” and “Variational Principles of Continuum Mechanics.”
7. Established the Fekete Center for Research in Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
8. Developed a revolutionary new method of representing mathematical solutions in the form of a curved surface.

Born 19 July 1886, Zenta, Bácska, Austria-Hungary (now Senta, Serbia). Died 13 May1957, Jerusalem, Israel.
