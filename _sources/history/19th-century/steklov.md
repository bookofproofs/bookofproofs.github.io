**Vladimir Steklov** was a Russian mathematician who made many important contributions to applied mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed general theory of partial differential equations, which is still the foundation of modern mathematics in the field.
2. Formulated several mathematical equations, such as the Steklov–Lyapunov equation.
3. Wrote the first Russian textbooks on integral equations and mechanics.
4. Founded the St. Petersburg Mathematical Society.
5. Established a mathematical laboratory and school in which students could learn mathematical concepts.
6. Discovered the Steklov–Wiener inequalities.
7. Defined the concept of harmonic measure.
8. Proposed a method for solving Laplace and Poisson equations, now known as the Steklov method.
9. Established correspondence between harmonic functions, potential theory and conformal mapping.
10. Developed theories of potential theory and integral equations.

Born 9 January 1864, Nizhny Novgorod (was Gorky from 1932-1990), Russia. Died 30 May 1926, Gaspra, Crimea, USSR.
