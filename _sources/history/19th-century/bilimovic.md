**Anton Dimitrija Bilimovic** wasa Ukranian-born mathematician who worked on a wide variety of both pure and applied mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. First to solve the double covering problem for functions that associate three points on the plane. 
2. Proved a number of related theorems in the theory of plane curves.
3. Pioneered the use of singularity techniques in plane geometry, algebraic geometry and the theory of plane curves.
4. Developed the concept of plane curve polarities to study plane curves.
5. First to obtain an upper bound for the number of interior singular points of plane curves.
6. Created a new approach to the classification of singularities of plane curves.
7. Established new criteria for birational planes geometry.
8. Showed that certain objects of algebraic geometry satisfy the four-vertex theorem.
9. Developed a method to determine the genus of a plane curve.
10. Appeared as a speaker in 'The International Congress of Mathematicians' in 1900.

Born 20 July 1879, Zhytomyr, Zhytomyrs'ka oblast, Ukraine. Died 17 September 1970, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, now Serbia.
