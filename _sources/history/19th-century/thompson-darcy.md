**D'Arcy Thompson** was a Greek scholar, a naturalist and a mathematician. He was the first biomathematician. His book _On Growth and Form_ had a great influence on both biologists and mathematicians.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical model known as the "kinematics of deformation" which allowed for the analysis of deformations in organisms.
2. Pioneered the field of mathematical biology by creating a mathematical basis for understanding the changes in organisms.
3. Wrote the book On Growth and Form which influenced many fields such as theoretical biology, evolution, genetics, and morphology.
4. Established the mathematical basis for the theory of transformations of shapes and deformations in animals.
5. Analyzed the mathematical principles behind the shapes and sizes of organisms, and the forces that govern such changes.
6. Pioneered the application of mathematical principles to the study of organisms.
7. Devised an innovative system of mathematical transformation which can be used to calculate the mathematical relationship between the shape of a morphological form and the forces that cause its being.
8. Discovered the mathematical relationships between images and their transformations.
9. Developed methods to compare the size and shape of organisms of different species.
10. Developed methods to accurately compare the size and shapes of organisms to draw evolutionary conclusions.

Born 2 May1860, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 21 June 1948, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.
