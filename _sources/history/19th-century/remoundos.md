**Georgios Remoundos** was a Greek mathematician who worked on the theory of functions and the theory of differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Georgios attended the elementary school Plaka in Athens from 1884 to 1888.
* After an outstanding university career, on the 10 June 1900 Remoundos passed the degree examination with the highest grade.
* Arriving in Paris, Remoundos was also allowed to attend courses at the École normale supérieure.
* The originality and depth of the research carried out by Remoundos made an excellent impression on his professors.
* It had been donated by the professors of the University of Paris, a sign of the great appreciation and love towards the young Greek mathematician Georgios Remoundos.
* A few days later, on 6 February, Paul Appell, the Dean of Science, wrote an enthusiastic letter to the Prime Minister of Greece, Georgios Theotokis, giving high praise for Remoundos's work.
* On 25 June 1906 Remoundos married Antigoni Karabetsos; they had four children, John, Dionysios, Athanasios and Maria.
* Subsequently, Remoundos was also appointed by the Ministry of Education as a member of the committee of the revision of secondary education text books.
* Let us look briefly at the mathematical areas on which Remoundos worked which largely focused on Mathematical Analysis and especially on its two fundamental branches, namely: Theory of Functions and Theory of Differential Equations.
* After Remoundos was awarded his doctorate by the University of Paris in 1906, Émile Borel asked him to write a book entitled: Sur les fonctions algébroïdes Ⓣ(On algebraic functions), which would be part of the famous Collection de monographies sur la théorie des fonctions sous la direction de M Émile Borel Ⓣ(Collection of monographs on the theory of functions under the direction of Émile Borel).
* Additionally, Henri Villat, who was then the editor-in-chief of Mémorial des sciences mathématiques, assigned to Remoundos the writing of three parts of that collection.
* The second part was in print when the author died and was titled: Sur les fonctions et les séries de fonctions algébroïdes Ⓣ(On functions and series of functions algebroids,), and the third one which had been given the title Séries de fonctions et de familles normales Ⓣ(Series of normal functions and families) was never written due to the premature death of Remoundos.
* We should not give the impression that all of Remoundos's work was on analysis for he also published original and deep papers on Theoretical Engineering, Algebra and Number Theory.
* For example Otto Blumenthal, mentioned Remoundos's work, and emphasised its importance, during a lecture to the German Mathematical Society in 1907.
* The book Principes de la théorie des fonctions entières d'ordre infini Ⓣ(Principles of the theory of integer functions of infinite order) (1910), published in the collection of monographs under direction of Émile Borel, mentions two of Remoundos's papers, describing one as a work of genius.
* Remoundos played an important role in the Greek Mathematical Society and in the Academy of Athens.
* Remoundos quickly gained a reputation as an excellent teacher.
* Remoundos not only made major contributions to mathematics but he also had another important national role.
* In 1923 a National Committee for Intellectual Cooperation with the League of Nations was established in Greece, with Remoundos as its president.
* The first conference of representatives of the National Committees of Intellectual Cooperation with the League of Nations took place in Paris in December 1923, in which Remoundos took part as a representative of the Greek National Commission.
* Remoundos submitted a lengthy memo to the conference which assisted the International Commission to define its objectives.
* The second conference of these Commissions took place in Warsaw in 1926, in which Remoundos, as the representative of Greece, again played a leading role.
* With this appointment, Remoundos was entitled to attend all Annual General Meetings of the Commission, which took place in Geneva.
* Remoundos suffered poor health caused, in particular, by diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
* His death was reported by the Rector of the University of Athens with the following telegram: "On the ship 'Frindon', Georgios Remoundos, professor of the University, died suddenly.
* Finally let us look at Remoundos's interests other than those mentioned above, and say few word about his character.
* Remoundos was a good and kind man.
* Remoundos was summarised by those who knew him as a brilliant scientist, an excellent teacher, an outstanding family man, and a man of unlimited kindness.

Born 3 March 1878, Athens, Greece. Died 27 April 1928, the Steamboat Frindon, Mediterranean Sea.
