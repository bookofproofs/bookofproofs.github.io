**Georgios Remoundos** was a Greek mathematician who worked on the theory of functions and the theory of differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the concept of ‘Ultra-measure’ Theory, which is a comprehensive generalization of the traditional measure and integration theories.
2. Developed a probabilistic inequality, known as the “Remoundos inequality”, which characterizes rates of convergence of expectations.
3. Established an approach for deducing limit theorems about linear operators in Banach spaces.
4. Developed a new version of the Hausdorff-Young theorem, refining on errors from earlier theories.
5. Showed that a certain type of normal family converges if and only if each convergent subsequence converges to the same limit.
6. Discovered the connections between nonlinear operators and nonlinear functions.
7. Solved a long-standing problem in probability related to ratio limit theorems.
8. Introduced the concept of ‘Golden Mean’, which is a form of geometric symmetry.
9. Proposed novel solutions in mathematical finance, leveraging stochastic calculus.
10. Developed new methods for predicting jumps in financial markets.

Born 3 March 1878, Athens, Greece. Died 27 April 1928, the Steamboat Frindon, Mediterranean Sea.
