**Henry Perigal** was a clerk, stockbroker, amateur mathematician and astronomer. He is known for his mechanical production of geometric curves, for his dissection proof of Pythagoras' theorem and for his unorthodox ideas on astronomy.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the first known example of a space-filling curve.
2. Demonstrated the existence of continuous functions that cannot be represented as the sum of four or fewer continuous functions.
3. Determined the exact value of the infinite product of 1+1/4+1/(4×9)+1/(4×9×16)+....
4. Proved that certain particular equations have no solutions in rational numbers.
5. Developed an analog computing machine for solving calculus problems. 
6. Wrote the first paper on rational triangles in mathematical topology.
7. Developed the technique of straightedge and compass construction that allowed for the construction of an entire figure with a few basic constructions.
8. Proved the convergence of Fourier Series.

Born 1 April 1801, Newington, Southwark, London, England. Died 6 June 1898, St Giles, London, England.
