**Édouard Goursat** was a French mathematician who is best known for his version of the Cauchy-Goursat theorem stating that the integral of a function round a simple closed contour is zero if the function is analytic inside the contour.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the methods of "exterior calculus," which unified the theories of ordinary and partial differential equations.
2. Introduced the concept of "singular points" for describing discontinuous functions.
3. Developed the theory of the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem, which is a powerful tool for solving certain types of linear partial differential equations.
4. Founded the journal Annals of Calculus and Analysis, which continues to this day.
5. Enriched the theory of multivariable calculus through his work on multiple integrals and surfaces of second order.
6. Contributed to the theorems of Abel and Liouville which describe the structure of solutions to certain partial differential equations.
7. Providing the first full account of the theory of differential equations with discontinuous coefficients.

Born 21 May 1858, Lanzac, Lot, France. Died 25 November 1936, Paris, France.
