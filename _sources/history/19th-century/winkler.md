**Wilhelm Winkler** was a Czech-born statistician and politician whose work covered a wide field of theoretical and applied statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the so-called "Winkler's theorem" which established the connection between Gaussian normal distribution and the binomial distribution.
2. Developed the "Winklerâ€™s ratio test" which is used to determine whether or not two distributions (such as two normal distributions) are the same.
3. Developed the "Winkler-Wolfowitz algorithm" which is used for conducting non-parametric tests of similarity between two samples.
4. Collaborated with colleagues and published the first article presenting the idea of linear regression.
5. Published a well-known paper in 1880 laying down the principles of the statistical method of least squares.

Born 29 June 1884, Prague, Bohemia, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Czech Republic). Died 3 September 1984, Vienna, Austria.
