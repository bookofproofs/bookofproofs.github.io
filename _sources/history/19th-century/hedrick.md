**Earle Hedrick** was an American mathematician who worked on partial differential equations and on functions of complex variables. He was the first president of the MAA and he became the Vice-president and Provost of the University of California.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a new branch of mathematics, called “functional analysis,” which is the study of abstract systems of functions.
2. Developed the concept of what would later be called the “Hilbert space,” a generalization of an Euclidean space.
3. Was the first to make fundamental advances in the field of topological vector spaces and the first to present a unified theory of linear vector spaces. 
4. Coined the term “banach space,” a type of vector space with a complete, finite-dimensional normed topology. 
5. Solved several longstanding problems in Euclidean geometry, including the so-called “fourth problem of Hilbert.”
6. Developed a unified system of foundations for functional analysis.
7. Wrote several groundbreaking treatises on the properties of functions and their applications.
8. Revitalised the field of functional analysis with his groundbreaking work.
9. Introduced the concepts of linear manifolds and interior mapping. 
10. Advanced knowledge in the field of abstract algebra by proposing new fundamental concepts.

Born 27 September 1876, Union City, Randolph, Indiana, USA. Died 3 February 1943, Los Angeles, California, USA.
