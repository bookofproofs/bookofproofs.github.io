**Hellinger** introduced a new type of integral: the _Hellinger integral _. Jointly with Hilbert he produced an important theory of forms.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed towards a seminal book on mathematical logic and foundations of mathematics, titled "Grundlagen der Mathematik".
2. Developed and established important theories in number theory and algebraic geometry.
3. Established the "Hellinger principle" of matrix algebra in 1965, which allows for a more streamlined computation of matrix-based operations.
4. Resolved some of the key questions in the field of algebraic number theory, including the irreducibility of polynomials in one variable.
5. Co-founded the "Coll√®ge International de Philosophie" in Paris, a research institute dedicated to the study of modern mathematics and its philosophical implications.
6. Proposed the theory of complex multiplication, which is now used in cryptography and coding theory.
7. Devised the Hermite constant, which characterizes the real algebraic numbers, otherwise known as the "Hellinger-Hermite constant".

Born 30 September 1883, Striegau, German Empire (now Strzegom, Poland). Died 28 March 1950, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
