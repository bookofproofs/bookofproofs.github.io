**Hellinger** introduced a new type of integral: the _Hellinger integral _. Jointly with Hilbert he produced an important theory of forms.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ernst grew up in Breslau where he attended school, graduating from the Gymnasium there in 1902.
* It was at the Breslau Gymnasium that Hellinger first became fascinated in mathematics, and this was the result of an excellent mathematics teacher at the school.
* Hellinger entered the University of Heidelberg but, following the tradition in Germany at that time, he did not complete his studies at a single university but moved to several different universities during the course of his studies.
* Hellinger would keep in touch with Born and developments in quantum mechanics for much of his life.
* In Göttingen Hellinger was a student of Hilbert and, not long after he began his studies there, he was joined by Courant and Toeplitz who had been his fellow students at Breslau.
* Hellinger was awarded his doctorate by the University of Göttingen in 1907 for a thesis entitled Die Orthogonalinvarianten quadratischer Formen von unendlich vielen Variablen Ⓣ(The Orthogonallly invariant quadratic forms in an infinite number of variables).
* He introduced a new type of integral, the Hellinger integral in his doctoral thesis and, jointly with Hilbert, he produced the important Hilbert-Hellinger theory of forms.
* From Göttingen Hellinger went to Marburg where he was a Privatdozent from 1909 to 1914.
* Hellinger certainly qualified under this clause and this allowed him to keep his lecturing post in Frankfurt in 1933.
* Hellinger continued to live in Frankfurt.
* Fortunately friends were able to arrange a temporary job for Hellinger at Northwestern University at Evanston in the United States.
* Hellinger's position at Evanston throughout the war was precarious with a series of one-year appointments but he acquired American citizenship in 1944 and worked at Evanston until 1949 when he retired.
* At Frankfurt, Hellinger had continued his mathematical work on the spectral theory of Jacobi forms and continued fractions.
* Hellinger also worked on the history of mathematics and, while at Frankfurt, he wrote an important paper on James Gregory.
