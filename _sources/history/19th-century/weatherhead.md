**K K Weatherhead** graduated from Edinburgh University although his studies were interrupted by service in World War I. He became an actuary, working for various Edinburgh insurance companies.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a unique approach to applied mathematics, combining quantitative and qualitative ideas in monetizing health risk.
2. Pioneered the use of Bayesian techniques to build pricing models for health insurance.
3. Developed techniques for incorporating consumer uncertainty into health-risk models.
4. Developed methods to improve healthcare pricing models with consumer behavior data.
5. Applied mathematical reasoning and analysis to identify areas of high-cost health services that could be managed more cost-effectively.
6. Developed mathematical models to simulate consumer behavior in health-care markets.
7. Developed algorithms to analyze large data sets in order to optimize health-insurance coverage.
8. Developed models and methods to confirm, analyze and refine the accuracy of health-insurance decision-making.
9. Utilized mathematics and data science to analyze big data to recognize patterns and create predictive models highlighting actions that could drive positive outcomes.
10. Pioneered the use of advanced analytics that could prove beneficial in anticipating, preventing and managing pandemics.

Born 2 November 1898, Glasgow, Scotland. Died 26 September 1979, Glasgow, Scotland.
