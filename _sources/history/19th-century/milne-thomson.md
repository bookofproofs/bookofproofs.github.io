**Louis Milne-Thomson** was an English applied mathematician best known for his textbooks on applied mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Louis was the eldest of his parents' sons.
* Milne-Thomson entered Clifton College in Bristol in 1906 as a classical scholar and in his final year at the College he won a scholarship to study mathematics at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.
* Milne-Thomson was appointed as an assistant mathematics master at Winchester College in 1914.
* After teaching for seven years at Winchester College, Milne-Thomson left in 1921 to take up an appointment as professor of mathematics at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich.
* The most important topic that Milne-Thomson undertook research on near the start of his career was compiling tables.
* Of course the main mathematical tool used in constructing tables was the method of finite differences and in 1933 Milne-Thomson published his first textbook, The Calculus of Finite Differences, a text in which he set out to explain to students the techniques which he used in table making.
* His next text was also to become a classic but it marked a change in direction in Milne-Thomson's research interests.
* In 1956 Milne-Thomson reached the age of sixty-five years and retired from the Royal Naval College in Greenwich.
* Let us now look briefly at some papers which Milne-Thomson published between 1940 and his final paper in 1972.
* Two years later Milne-Thomson published a sequel entitled Antiplane elastic systems.

Born 1 May 1891, Ealing, London, England. Died 21 August 1974, Sevenoaks, Kent, England.
