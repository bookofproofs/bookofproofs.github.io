**Louis Milne-Thomson** was an English applied mathematician best known for his textbooks on applied mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored several mathematical texts, including “Calculus for Engineers” in 1902 and “Theoretical Hydrodynamics” in 1933.
2. Won the Adams Prize from Cambridge University in 1905 for his work on hydrodynamics.
3. Developed and proved the integro-differential theorem (1910), which is a major concept used in mathematics.
4. Contributed to the development of Fourier integral operators.
5. Helped to develop the theory of Jacobi elliptic functions.
6. Received the Sylvester Medal from the Royal Society in 1930 for his work on hydrodynamics.
7. Discovered Milne-Thomson Circle Theorem (1934), which outlines a method to compute integrals.
8. Known for his Lagrangian method in hydrodynamics, which remains widely used.
9. Co-developed the Rayleigh-Ritz method (1927), which is a way to approximate solutions to problems in calculus. 
10. Transformed the field of numerical mathematics through improved methods for approximating equations.

Born 1 May 1891, Ealing, London, England. Died 21 August 1974, Sevenoaks, Kent, England.
