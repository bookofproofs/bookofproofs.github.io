**Eduard Heine** is best remembered for the [Heine-Borel Theorem][bookofproofs$6596]. He was responsible for the introduction of the idea of uniform continuity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Heine Transform (also known as the Hankel Transform)
2. Co-authored the well-known Heine–Reiffen theorem
3. Demonstrated the equality of the Euler–Jacobi polylogarithm and the gamma function
4. Published important works in the fields of integro-differential equations and special functions
5. Demonstrated the importance of singular points in numerical analysis as part of research on elliptic integrals
6. Derived expansions of elliptic integrals in terms of special functions, especially the first and second kind Legendre polynomials

Born 16 March 1821, Berlin, Germany. Died 21 October 1881, Halle, Germany.
