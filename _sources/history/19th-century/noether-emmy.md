**Emmy Noether** is best known for her contributions to abstract algebra, in particular, her study of chain conditions on ideals of rings.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed significant contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics, such as the deep mathematical underpinnings of the physical concept of "conserved quantities";
2. Worked on topics such as ring theory, number theory and hypercomplex numbers;
3. Coined the term ‘ideal theory’ and established its significance in commutative algebra;
4. Proved the ‘Noether’s theorem,’ a key theorem in mathematics and physics;
5. Was the first to prove the ‘Invariant theorem’, which was later credited to Albert Einstein due to its significance in theoretical physics;
 6. Proved the ‘Infinitesimal theorem’ and ‘Theorem of continuity’;
7. Developed a deeper understanding of the concept of ‘symmetry’, which not only applied to mathematics but also physics due to its profound implications;
8. Played an important role in finding structure hidden in deeper mathematical proofs;
9. Established the significance of ‘variations in parameters’ as a technique in solving differential equations;
10. Was one of the founding members of the mathematical discipline ‘modern algebra’ with E. Artin and B. L. van der Waerden.

Born 23 March 1882, Erlangen, Bavaria, Germany. Died 14 April 1935, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, USA.
