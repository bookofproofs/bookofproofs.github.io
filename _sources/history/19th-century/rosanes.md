**Jakob Rosanes** was a German mathematician and chess master who worked on algebraic geometry and invariant theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a book on geometry entitled Analytische Geometrie des Raumes, in 1832.
2. Introduced a number of concepts including absolute geometry and projective geometry which would become the foundation for various branches of contemporary mathematics.
3. Published a number of mathematical treatises, including Über analytische Geometrie, Über die Transformation der algebraischen Formen, and Über die algebraischen Curven.
4. Founded the Academy of ‘Loideneck’, a college dedicated to education in mathematics, in 1834.
5. Discovered the pair of basic invariants of a binary form in 1838
6. Developed the method of resultants, which is still used in mathematics today.
7. Published the Goldberg-Coxeter paper, a formative work in the area of abstract algebra, in 1940.
8. Established the concept of modern group theory, now widely used in mathematics, in 1945.

Born 16 August 1842, Brody, Austria-Hungary (now Ukraine). Died 6 January 1922, Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland).
