**Jakob Rosanes** was a German mathematician and chess master who worked on algebraic geometry and invariant theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Jakob's education was not quite what one would have expected of someone who would go on to an academic career.
* Rosanes, however, wanted to attend university and between 1858 and 1860 he prepared himself to enter the University of Breslau.
* In addition to Schroeter, Rosanes had been taught by some excellent lecturers at Breslau such as Ferdinand Joachimsthal, Rudolf Lipschitz, O E Meyer, and Paul Bachmann.
* He formed a close friendship with his fellow student Moritz Pasch, who also had Heinrich Schroeter as a thesis advisor and was awarded his doctorate in the same year as Rosanes.
* Following the award of his doctorate, Rosanes went to Berlin to continue his studies.
* There were gaps in both Rosanes' and Max Noether's proofs, and these were not filled until the first years of the 20th  century by Guido Castelnuovo.
* Rosanes taught at Breslau for the rest of his life.
* Rosanes wrote on many aspects of algebraic geometry and invariant theory (particularly between 1870 and 1890) which were in fashion at that time.
* Max Born attended Rosanes' course on linear algebra, which introduced him to matrix theory, in the first years of the 20th  century.
* Not everyone was an enthusiastic as Born, however, for Rosanes had a mixed reputation as a lecturer.
* Rosanes' rectorial address, however, everyone agreed was inspirational.
* Perhaps Rosanes' main interest outside mathematics was chess.
