**Escher** is an artist whose works have included a considerable mathematical content.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published two books titled 'Symmetry As An Art' and 'Regular Division of the Plane' that presented his research on geometric tessellations and polyhedra.
2. Published works on hyperbolic geometry, thus establishing hyperbolic tessellations and hyperbolic symmetry.
3. Collaborated with mathematician Hendrik Lenstra to investigate the concept of aperiodic tiling. 
4. Showcased his work on Möbius strips, Presburger arithmetic and infinity. 
5. Created art pieces that feature transformed shapes, such as the Metamorphosis engraving set and his Circle Limit prints. 
6. Utilized mathematical models and equations in his artwork to create visual illusions. 
7. Created a highly precise set of woodcuts which illustrated hyperbolic tessellations. 
8. Explored and reshaped classic mathematical principles such as the Platonic Solids, hyperbolic and spherical geometry.  
9. Introduced metamorphosis as a concept within art, and conducted a lecture tour on crystallography at universities in Northern Europe during the 1960s. 
10. Developed a mathematical construction that allowed him to calculate several visual illusions in his artwork, such as his ‘Circle Limit’ series.

Born 17 June 1898, Leeuwarden, Netherlands. Died 27 March 1972, Laren, Netherlands.
