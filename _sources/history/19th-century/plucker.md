**Julius Pl端cker** was a German mathematician who made important contributions to analytic geometry and physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of geometric probability and studied the graphical representation of polynomial equations.
2. Discovered the formula for calculating the area of a triangle in coordinates.
3. Found the first solution to the problem of three bodies.
4. Established a fundamental principle of geometric optics.
5. Developed Plucker Coordinates, a set of equations for describing curved lines in space.
6. Established the link between geometry and projective algebra.
7. Established the foundations of modern algebraic geometry.
8. Found ways of proving Descartes' theorem.
9. Solved the invariant problem of second-order binary forms with 12 parameters.
10. Found new applications of the calculus of variations.

Born 16 July 1801, Elberfeld (now Wuppertal), Duchy of Berg (now Germany). Died 22 May1868, Bonn, Germany.
