**Hermann Wiener** was a German mathematician who worked on the foundations of geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of quadratic forms, which became one of the most useful tools for analyzing higher-dimensional geometries.
2. Made important contributions to abstract algebra and algebraic geometry.
3. Developed basic analogues of the fundamental operations of addition and multiplication for matrices, known as the Wiener-Hopf algebra.
4. Established the existence of pseudorandom numbers.
5.Developed the notion of harmonic functions and their applications to physics. 
6. Established the Wiener-NÃ¶bel theorem in algebraic number theory.
7. Pioneered the development of numerical analysis and founded the subject of functional analysis. 
8. Was an early contributor to group theory.
9. Discovered the mathematical foundations of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, an important concept in the field of communication technology
10. Developed the Hardy-Wiener theorem, a result in the field of Fourier analysis.

Born 15 May1857, Karlsruhe, Germany. Died 13 June 1939, Darmstadt, Germany.
