**Dénes König** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the König's theorem in mathematics in 1904, which states that the number of edges in any finite bipartite graph is equal to the number of vertices in the smaller of the two sides.
2. Introduced the idea of graph coloring in an equivalent way as the Fulkerson–Chen–Anstee theorem in 1936.
3. Independently discovered Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 or K3,3 in 1930.
4. Proved Hall's marriage theorem in 1935, which states that in any finite set of m men and n women, there exists a straight pairing such that any man is paired with no more than one woman.
5. Pioneered in game theory, his most notable contribution being that of perfect zero-sum games, as introduced in 1928.
6. Established several results and theories related to infinite matchings and infinite graphs in his doctoral dissertation "Theorie der endlichen und unendlichen Graphen" (Theory of Finite and Infinite Graphs) in 1935.

Born 21 September 1884, Budapest, Hungary. Died 19 October 1944, Budapest, Hungary.
