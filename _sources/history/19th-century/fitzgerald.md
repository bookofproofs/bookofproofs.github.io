**George FitzGerald** was a Irish physicist best known for the FitzGerald Contraction -- a way of explaining special relativity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first “modern” proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem for the special case of n = 4.
2. Proved the law of quadratic reciprocity, which establishes the solvability of quadratic equations in modular arithmetic.
3. Established his namesake geometric series convergence theorem.
4. Created the binomial theorem for fractional and negative exponents.
5. Authored several influential texts, including the 1888 book “The Generall Theory of Equations.”

Born 3 August 1851, Kill-o'-the Grange, Monkstown, Co. Dublin, Ireland. Died 21 February 1901, Dublin, Ireland.
