Dublin, Ireland. George FitzGerald was a Irish physicist best known for the FitzGerald Contraction ("The Ether and the Earth's Atmosphere" (1889)) conjecturing  that if all moving objects were foreshortened in the direction of their motion, it would account for the curious null-results of the Michelsonâ€“Morley experiment. This was the first way of explaining special relativity.

Born 3 August 1851 Kill-o'-the Grange, Monkstown, Co. Dublin, Ireland. Died 21 February 1901 Dublin, Ireland.
