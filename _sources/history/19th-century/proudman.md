**Joseph Proudman** was a mathematician who made major contributions to oceanography, particularly to the theory of tides. He was Professor of Applied Mathematics, then Professor of Oceanography at the University of Liverpool. He headed the Liverpool Tidal Institute, now called the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed his own mathematical theory, which predicted the motion of short gravity waves in the ocean and has been used in meteorological and oceanic research since then.
2. Made significant contributions to the field of internal waves through his observations and calculations of their properties.
3. Pioneered research in the field of ocean-wave dynamics and subsequently published numerous articles on the subject.
4. Developed the Proudman theorem which states that the form of the internal waves is determined by the vertical stratification of the ocean.
5. Identified the concept of group velocity, which is the velocity of energy transfer within groups of waves.
6. Demonstrated the existence of shallow-water waves, which are propagating waves that move more slowly than deep-water gravity waves.
7. Demonstrated the tidal and storm surge effects on ocean waves and the characteristics of ocean acoustics.
8. Discovered seiche waves, which are standing waves in enclosed bodies such as lakes and bays.
9. Wrote over 100 scientific papers, several of which related to his discoveries in the field of oceanography.
10. Received the William Speirs Bruce Medal in 1934 for his work on oceanography.

Born 30 December 1888, Unsworth, near Bury, Lancashire, England. Died 26 June 1975, Fordingbridge, Hampshire, England.
