**Raymond Brink** was an American mathematician who studied at Kansas State University, Harvard and Paris. He taught at the University of Minnesota though he spent a year in Edinburgh in 1919. He worked on the convergence of series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Brink entered Kansas State University in 1904 at the remarkably young age of fourteen.
* Following the award of his doctorate Brink studied at the Coll√®ge de France and the Sorbonne in Paris spending the academic year 1916-17 financed by the prestigious Sheldon Travelling Fellowship.
* Brink fell in love with France and he had a passion for the country for the rest of his life.
* Brink spent the academic year 1919-20 at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland where he was appointed as a lecturer in Mathematics.
* Except for two further periods of study leave spent in Paris (1924-25 and 1932-33) Brink continued to teach at the University of Minnesota.
* Dinner at the Brink house was a formal event, with conversations often focusing on spelling and grammar.
* After a break from his Chairman role for a few years, Brink became Chairman again in 1939 and continued to lead the department until he retired in 1957.
* These included Professor Raymond W Brink who was Chairman of the department, and had been President of the Mathematical Association of America.
* As this quote indicates, Brink was much involved with the Mathematical Association of America.
* Brink gave his retiring presidential address entitled 'College Mathematics during Reconstruction' in November 1943.
* Finally we give some examples of Brink's papers: A new integral test for the convergence and divergence of infinite series (1918); A new sequence of integral tests for the convergence and divergence of infinite series (1919); The May Meeting of the Minnesota Section (1927); Recent Publications: Reviews: Studies in the History of Statistical Method - With Special Reference to Certain Education Problems (1929); The May Meeting of the Minnesota Section (1930); A Simplified Integral Test for the Convergence of Infinite Series (1931); Recent Publications: Reviews: Differential Equations (1932); The Annual Meeting of the Minnesota Section (1937); College Mathematics During Reconstruction (1944), and A Course in Mathematics for the Purpose of General Education (1947).
* We see from this list that, other than the papers which resulted from his thesis, most of Brink's papers relate to teaching, mathematical education or reports of meetings.
* The greatest contribution that Brink made is considered by most to be his textbooks.
* We noted above that Brink retired from the University of Minnesota in 1957.
* She was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Idaho in 1965 and the university named Brink Hall after her.

Born 4 January 1890, Newark, New Jersey, USA. Died 27 December 1973, La Jolla, California, USA.
