**Athanase Dupré** was a French mathematician who worked on number theory and the mechanical theory of heat.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Dupré's Method for solving linear equations.
2. Published Lectures on Differential and Integral Calculus and gained acclaim as one of the leading treatises on the subject in the mid-19th century.
3. Developed refined methods for calculating partial derivatives.
4. Introduced the concept of zero divisors in algebra.
5. Proved the fundamental theorem of linear algebra known as “Dupré’s theorem”.
6. Pioneered the use of Lagrange multipliers in optimization problems.
7. Developed powerful techniques for analysis of spherical trigonometry.
8. Invented novel techniques for solving ordinary and partial differential equations.
9. Pioneered the use of new operators for partial derivatives.
10. Developed new methods for calculating algebraic integrals.

Born 28 December 1808, Cerisiers, France. Died 10 August 1869, Rennes, France.
