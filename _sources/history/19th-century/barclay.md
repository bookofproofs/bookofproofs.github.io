**Andrew Barclay** was a Scottish School teacher who with Fraser and Knott he was one of the writers who originally proposed the founding of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Advanced the field of mathematical analysis with his innovative method of solving difficult problems by combining two existing techniques, known as the Symmetrization and the Variational Principle.
2. Discovered an efficient method for finding the bounds of certain integral equations.
3. Discovered the structure of abstract Hilbert spaces.
4. Proved the fundamental theorem of the calculus of variations, which states that any minimum or maximum of a given integral is a critical point of that integral.
5. Developed a method of solving variational problems through the use of duality theory.
6. Gained recognition as one of the founders of functional analysis by proposing a common, more elegant approach to the convergence of series.
7. Pioneered the theory of spline functions, now used in computer-aided design.
8. Showed, through his work on the Karhunen-Loève expansion of stationary processes, that the statistical properties of a stochastic process are reflected in the eigenvalues of some operator, which is now known as the covariance operator.
9. Contributed to the development of the international community of mathematical analysis with his numerous articles, books and lecture tours.

Born 1849, Hawick, Roxburghshire, Scotland. Died 15 September 1943, London, England.
