**Aleksandr Kotelnikov** was a Russian mathematician who worked on non-Euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of linear programming, the mathematical technique for maximizing a given linear function subject to linear constraints.
2. Constructed the first analog-to-digital converter, allowing the connection between electronic circuits and digital processing systems.
3. Designed a servomechanism, which is the basis for modern control systems.
4. Established the field of mathematical cybernetics, focusing primarily on optimization problems and control systems.
5. Developed the mathematical description of communication systems, which laid the foundations for digital signal processing.
6. Discovered the sampling theorem, commonly known as the Nyquistâ€“Shannon theorem, which is used to optimize the data rate transmitted in a communications channel.
7. Proposed the Mallat algorithm, which is used to reconstruct signals from their samples and is important in signal processing.
8. Introduced the concept of minimum-shift keying, which describes how to vary the frequency of a signal to transmit digital data without distortion.

Born 20 October 1865, Kazan, Russia. Died 6 March 1944, Moscow, USSR.
