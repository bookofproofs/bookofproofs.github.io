**Rudolf Lipschitz** is remembered for the "Lipschitz condition", an inequality that guarantees a unique solution to the differential equation _y_' = _f_ (_x, y_).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Lipschitz Condition as a tool in differential equations which established sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to partial differential equations.
2. Co-authored the textbook "Functional Analysis" with mathematician Felix Hausdorff in which he provided the foundations of modern analysis.
3. Derived the Lipschitz continuity theorem, a mathematical property of functions.
4. Introduced solutions for infinitesimal problems, such as the Riemann-Stieltjes integral.
5. Established that second-order differential equations have a unique solution for given initial conditions.
6. Gave the first rigorous proofs of Dirichlet's principle, which suggested that the solutions to certain differential equations always exist, validating the methods of mathematical physics.
7. Established a basis for calculus and the principles of mathematical independence.
8. Published more than sixty papers and one book, Foundations of Mathematical Analysis.

Born 14 May1832, KÃ¶nigsberg, East Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 7 October 1903, Bonn, Germany.
