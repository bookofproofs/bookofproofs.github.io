**Landau** gave the first systematic presentation of analytic number theory and wrote important works on the theory of analytic functions of a single variable.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of prime numbers, including the prime number theorem.
2. Developed the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, one of the most important works in its field.
3. Contributed to the areas of analytic number theory, trigonometry, and statistics.
4. Proved theorems about non-integral polynomials.
5. Established the foundations of modern asymptotic analysis.
6. Established the strong law of small numbers.
7. Solved the Hilbert-PÃ³lya conjecture.
8. Solved the Mertens conjecture.
9. Gave the first proof of the Brauer-Siegel theorem.
10. Formulated the Landau-Kolmogorov inequality.

Born 14, Feb 1877, Berlin, Germany. Died 19, Feb 1938, Berlin, Germany.
