**Pierre Verhulst** was a Belgian statistician who worked on population growth.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-developed the Logistic Growth Model to describe the population growth rate of populations with a carrying capacity limit. 
2. Developed the Nonlinear Curve Fitting Technique, which allowed scientists to evaluate the behavior of complex systems more accurately.
3. Established the mathematical basis for studying the stability of certain systems with respect to perturbations in initial conditions.
4. Identified the concept of self-organizing criticality. 
5. Developed the concept of Catastrophe Theory. 
6. Proposed the Verhulst–Pearl Logistic Discontinuous Model for population growth. 
7. Utilized Poincaré-Bendixson Theorem to explain the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems. 
8. Developed stochastic models, leading to the definition of an exact definition of stochastic limit. 
9. Wrote a mathematical theory of castastrophic" avalanches".

Born 28 October 1804, Brussels, French Empire (now Belgium). Died 15 February 1849, Brussels, Belgium.
