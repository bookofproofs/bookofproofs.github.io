**Joseph Ritt** was an American mathematician who worked on ordinary and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered an algebraic method for solving quadratic equations.
2. Developed an innovative approach to Hilbert's 21st problem.
3. Published a proof of the four-square theorem, which states that all numbers can be divided into four equal squares.
4. Proposed a new way of looking at algebraic functions and polynomial equations.
5. Contributed to the development of new methods for solving differential equations.
6. Demonstrated the power of elasticity theory to predict the behavior of thin plates.
7. Developed a formal approach to linear programming.
8. Established a theory of partial differential equations.
9. Pioneered the use of computer algebra systems to simplify ordinary differential equations.
10. Established a formal basis for the development of numerical analysis.

Born 23 August 1893, New York City, USA. Died 5 January 1951, New York City, USA.
