2. Proved a theorem regarding mappings between invariant subspaces of matrix pairs.
3. Developed a method for efficiently solving linear algebraic equations.
4. Investigated the properties of various classes of matrices and vector spaces.
5. Discovered the properties of abstract topological spaces and their associated linear spaces.
6. Characterized the structure and geometry of algebraic varieties.
7. Identified and solved more than a dozen computational problems in mathematics.
8. Helped develop new algorithms for use in data analysis and Decision Science.
9. Studied the relationships between algebraic structures and invariant subspaces.
10. Discovered a method for computing the general solutions of a system of linear equations.

Born 7 February 1862, Lausanne, Switzerland. Died 19 March 1938, Chexbres, Vaud canton, Switzerland.
