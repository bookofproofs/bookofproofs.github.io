**Heinrich Suter** was a Swiss historian of science specializing in Islamic mathematics and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Achieved the title of 'instructor' at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, where he introduced the subject of differential equations to students.
2. Published a paper in 1885 on what would become known as Suter's Formula, a solution to a nonlinear differential equation which had puzzled mathematicians for centuries.
3. Organized and conducted research on the use of mathematics to study the behavior of future trajectories of celestial bodies.
4. Created and mathematically described an entire branch of mathematics, known as the “unilateral theory of aerial navigation”, which is still widely used today in relation to aircraft and rocket navigation.
5. Supported and fostered the development of modern mathematics in Switzerland by founding the Swiss Mathematical Society and serving as its first president.
6. Published papers and articles on analytical geometry, mechanics, and integral equations.
7. Collaborated with other mathematicians of his time, including Roger Cotes and Joseph-Louis Lagrange.

Born 4 January 1848, Hedingen (2, km N of Affoltern), Zürich Canton, Switzerland. Died 17 March 1922, Dornach, Switzerland.
