**Alfréd Haar** was a Hungarian mathematician who is best remembered for his work on analysis on groups, introducing a measure on groups, now called the _Haar measure_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a measure theory in 1909 which led to the invention of the integral with respect to the Lebesgue outer measure. 
2. Developed the Haar system, a basis in the space of continuous functions which today is used extensively in functional analysis. 
3. Proved the spectral theorem for self-adjoint unbounded operators in Hilbert space, as well as a generalized degree theory. 
4. Conducted research in probability theory, approximation theory, and group theory, as well as other fields of mathematics and mathematical physics.
5. Discovered Haar measure, a tool in measure theory used to analyzes the measure of subsets of locally compact groups. 
6. Published several important books on mathematics related topics, including Theory of Measures and Integration and Analytic Functions. 
7. Solved the Bieberbach conjecture, which was one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics at the time. 
8. Introduced the 'infinite' concept of measure and probability to the world of mathematics.

Born 11 October 1885, Budapest, Hungary. Died 16 March 1933, Szeged, Hungary.
