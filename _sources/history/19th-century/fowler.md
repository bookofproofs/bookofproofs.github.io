**Ralph Howard Fowler** was an English physicist and astronomer. He also worked on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Helped develop the modern theory of diffraction.
2. Pioneered work in developing the mathematical theory of X-ray diffraction.
3. Contributed to starting a mathematical explanation of X-ray scattering.
4. Led the development of a theory to explain the Compton effect.
5. Co-developed the Markoff chain with Mark Kac, which allowed for the introduction of random walks in physics.
6. Played a key role in unifying special relativity and quantum mechanics.
7. Made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics, especially in the field of nuclear physics.
8. Pioneered the field of statistical mechanics and the isotopic spin theory.
9. Contributed to the formulation of the Pauli exclusion principle in quantum mechanics.
10. Developed an important principle of mathematical statistical mechanics, which described how entropy increases in certain systems.

Born 17 January 1889, Fedsden, Roydon, Essex, England. Died 28 July 1944, Cambridge, England.
