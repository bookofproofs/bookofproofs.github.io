**James Jeans** worked on astronomy as well as thermodynamics, heat and other aspects of radiation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of orthogonality and applied it to linear algebra.
2. Formulated the Jeans equations which described the hydrodynamics of a gaseous mass contained in a gravitational field.
3. Constructed the mathematical theory of gravitational waves, based on Einsteinâ€™s general theory of relativity.
4. Developed an expansion method for solving the wave equation based on the separation of variables.
5. Proposed the Jeans instability, now referred to as the Jeans length, which was a key concept in the development of the modern understanding of star formation.
6. Devised a mathematical explanation of the Oort Cloud, a vast spherical shell of comets that surround our solar system.
7. Played a key role in the mathematical modeling and development of quantum mechanics.
8. Uncovered the mathematical basis of physical optics, the application of wave theory to the behavior of light.

Born 11 September 1877, Ormskirk, Lancashire, England. Died 16 September 1946, Dorking, Surrey, England.
