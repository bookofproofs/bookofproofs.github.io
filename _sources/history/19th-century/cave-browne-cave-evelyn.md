**Frances Evelyn Cave-Browne-Cave** was home educated, then studied the mathematical tripos at the University of Cambridge, being ranked next to G H Hardy. She was the first recipient of a research grant from Girton College, worked with Karl Pearson and published two papers. She spent the rest of her career teaching at Girton College.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Thomas Cave-Browne-Cave was a civil servant who became Deputy Accountant-General of the Army from 1897 to 1900 and a Commissioner of the Royal Hospital Chelsea from 1899 to 1923.
* Evelyn was brought up in quite privileged circumstances.
* At Cambridge, Evelyn was in the same year as G H Hardy and James Hopwood Jeans.
* Evelyn was ranked between the Fourth and Fifth Wranglers, so above her were Ronald William Henry Turnbull Hudson (1876-1904), the Senior Wrangler, John Forbes Cameron (1873-1952), James Hopwood Jeans and G H Hardy.
* After this outstanding performance, Evelyn was offered a three-year research studentship by Girton College.
* Evelyn undertook research at Girton College, advised by Karl Pearson.
* The author is given as F E Cave-Browne-Cave with some assistance from Karl Pearson.
* Only a few assistants, including Frances and Beatrice Cave-Browne-Cave, processed the data, creating tables, and computing correlations.
* In 1905 Evelyn published a follow-up paper to the one she had published in 1902.
* The paper was titled On the Influence of the Time Factor on the Correlation between the Barometric Heights at Stations more than 1000 Miles apart and had the single author F E Cave-Browne-Cave.
* This paper was the last of Evelyn's research publications and from that time on she concentrated on teaching and administration.
* Evelyn was a gifted teacher who was especially talented in helping less able students: a stammer that affected her normal speech completely disappeared when she was teaching.
* Thomas Reginald Cave-Browne-Cave attended Dulwich College and became an Engineering Officer in the Royal Navy.

Born 21 February 1876, Streatham Common, London, England. Died 30 March 1965, Shedfield, Hampshire, England.
