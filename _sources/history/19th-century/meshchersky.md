**Ivan Vsevolodovich Meshchersky** was a Russian mathematician famous for his work on mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the basic principles of modern chaos theory in 1904.
2. Developed a classification of partial differential equations in 1902.
3. Established the basis of the modern mathematical concept of duality with his 1902 paper.
4. Coined the term ‘dynamical systems’ after his groundbreaking studies in 1904.
5. Invented a way to measure chaos in the dynamics of nonlinear systems in 1906.
6. Established the classification of discontinuous solutions of partial differential equations in 1906.
7. Wrote two influential books on differential equations and integral equations in 1905 and 1907.
8. Published two notable books on geometry and algebra in 1909 and 1911.
9. Reported on the appliation of mathematics to the engineering and economics in 1910.
10. Introduced the concept of solvability of a differential equation in 1912.

Born 10 August 1859, Arkhangelsk, Russia. Died 7 January 1935, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
