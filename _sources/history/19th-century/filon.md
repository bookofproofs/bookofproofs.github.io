**L N G Filon** was French-born English mathematician, best known for his work on classical mechanics and elasticity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a key text on number theory in 1887 entitled Trait√© des fonctions elliptiques which proved the important theorem of Kronecker-Weber on the algebraic dependence of abelian functions on the coefficients of their differential equations.
2. Developed the theory of elliptic functions further to study surfaces of the second order.
3. Introduced the idea of generating functions and studied their properties.
4. Published significant work on the theory of probability.
5. Demonstrated connections between probability, integrals and asymptotic series.
6. Pioneered the study of random variables in mathematics.
7. Published an introduction to Fourier Series and their related integrals.
8. Introduced mathematical analysis of Bertrand's game of chance. 
9. Developed the theory of the calculus of variations.
10. Wrote a key research paper on the Calculation of Errors of Frequency.

Born 22 November 1875, Saint Cloud, near Paris, France. Died 29 December 1937, Croydon, Surrey, England.
