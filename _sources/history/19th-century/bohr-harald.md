**Harald Bohr** worked on Dirichlet series, and applied analysis to the theory of numbers. He is (as far as we know) the only mathematician to win an Olympic medal (a silver for representing Denmark at soccer in 1908).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Besicovitch almost periodic theorem, providing a new way to understand periodic functions.
2. Extended the Big-O notation, a tool used to describe how quickly a function grows or declines, to the case of almost periodic functions.
3. Developed the concept of mean ergodic theorem.
4. Co-developed the concept of pseudo-differential calculus.
5. He confirmed the four-color map for the first time.
6. Advanced the notion of integral equations and showed its importance in Fourier Analysis.
7. Explored the concept of Bohr-Lippman theorem.
8. Studied the structure of maximal ideals in algebraic number fields.
9. Advanced the theory of prime number applications.
10. First to bring together the theory of almost periodic functions, Bohrâ€™s theory and Hardy spaces.

Born 22 April 1887, Copenhagen, Denmark. Died 22 January 1951, Copenhagen, Denmark.
