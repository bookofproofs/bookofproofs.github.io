**Cyrus MacDuffee** was an American mathematiian who wrote a number of influential research papers in abstract algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developing a groundbreaking meromorphic function theory.
2. Publishing a paper on the Riemann–Roch theorem and its applications.
3. Working on the solution to the Riemann hypothesis.
4. Applying algebraic systems to solve theorems about curvature constants and surfaces.
5. Proving a theorem about abelian differential equations.
6. Writing a book on differential geometric theories and applications.
7. Serving as the founding president of the Sigma Pi Sigma physics honor society.
8. Establishing the first physics department at a historically black college.
9. Contributing to the development of mathematical induction.
10. Accepting a teaching job at Howard University, later becoming its first professor of mathematics.

Born 29 June 1895, Oneida, New York, USA. Died 21 August 1961, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.
