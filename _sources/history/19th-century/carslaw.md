**Horatio Carslaw** studied at Glasgow and Cambridge. He lectured at the University of Glasgow before moving to a professorship in Sydney, Australia. He worked on a variety of topics in both pure and applied mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* From Glasgow Carslaw went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1894.
* In 1903 Carslaw, then 33 years old, moved from his native Scotland to Australia where he had been offered the Chair of Mathematics at the University of Sydney.
* it would be a brave historian indeed who saw Carslaw's 'little book' as being better than Hardy's tome, and a downright foolish one to claim it as more influential, nevertheless it did come first.
* This was to be the main area of Carslaw's research throughout his life.
* The fact that Jaeger himself collaborated with Carslaw on the Laplace transform work may explain why there are differing opinions here.
* Jaeger and Carslaw published Operational methods in applied mathematics in 1941.
* No other advance has achieved such ready acceptance, and Carslaw and Jaeger's text can take a great deal of the credit.
* This text was published six years after Carslaw retired.
* Other topics to interest Carslaw throughout his career, which we have not touched on above, included an interest in non-euclidean geometry, Green's functions and the history of Napier's logarithms.

Born 12 February 1870, Helensburgh, Dumbartonshire, Scotland. Died 11 November 1954, Burradoo, Bowral, New South Wales, Australia.
