**Horatio Carslaw** studied at Glasgow and Cambridge. He lectured at the University of Glasgow before moving to a professorship in Sydney, Australia. He worked on a variety of topics in both pure and applied mathematics. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of determinants and matrices, now known as Carslaw’s Theory of Determinants.
2. Published the seminal work “Introduction to the Theory of Fourier’s Series and Integrals” in 1902.
3. Published the classic textbook “Elementary Mathematical Analysis” in 1904.
4. Authored over 30 papers on mathematical topics, including calculus, calculus of variations, and number theory.
5. Solved the 2-D Dirichlet problem using Green's functions.
6. Devised the Carslaw-Bird Integral Equation, used in electromagnetism theory.
7. Conducted research on the mathematical basis of radiative transfer.
8. Received the Sylvester Medal from the Royal Society in 1907 in recognition of his achievements in mathematics.

Born 12 February 1870, Helensburgh, Dumbartonshire, Scotland. Died 11 November 1954, Burradoo, Bowral, New South Wales, Australia.
