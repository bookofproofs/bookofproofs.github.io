**Rolin Wavre** was a Swiss mathematician who worked on logic and the philosophy of mathematics as well as on geology and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new proof for the Abel-Ruffini theorem in 1924, which contributed to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.
2. Discovered the "Wavre Transform" in 1912, which helped to solve differential equations.
3. Published several papers on potential theory, differential geometry, and linear algebra between 1923 and 1929.
4. Established the first volume of the Annales Scientifiques de l'Université de Liège in 1923.
5. Developed the Wavre Method for solving integral equations in 1923.
6. Organized the first international conference on mathematics in Liège in 1929.
7. Developed the polar addition theorem in 1924.
8. Co-authored several books on mathematical theory and physics, which included topics in dynamics, hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics, with his student Jean de Boer in 1924.

Born 25 March 1896, Neuchâtel, Switzerland. Died 9 December 1949, Geneva, Switzerland.
