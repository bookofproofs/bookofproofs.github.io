**Ernst Öpik** was an Estonian astronomer who specialised in the study of minor bodies, such as asteroids, comets and meteors  He spent the second half of his career in Northern Ireland.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory that linked lunar tides and the evolution of binary stars.
2. Identified the direction of galactic spin for the first time.
3. Determined the positions of stars more accurately than ever before.
4. Proposed theories for the origin of comets, the motion of binary stars, and the nature of galaxies.
5. Established that galaxies rotate around their major axes in an orderly fashion.
6. Proposed a mathematical theory related to the behavior of stellar motions.
7. Developed a new set of mathematical equations to accurately predict the supply of meteors in the solar system.
8. Research helped to characterize the shape and size of the Milky Way.

Born 22 October 1893, Kunda, Russian Empire (now Estonia). Died 10 September 1985, Bangor, Northern Ireland.
