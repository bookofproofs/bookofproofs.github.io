**Jan A Schouten** worked on tensor analysis and its applications.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the use of multivariate analysis, a method of analyzing data which combines mathematical and statistical analysis. 
2. Developed the concept of the independent component, a method of decomposing the statistical structure in multivariate data sets.
3. Developed the use of partial least squares and canonical correlation analysis in multivariate analysis, methods used today to understand interrelations among variables.
4. Pioneered the use of nonlinear factor analysis and principal factor analysis in multivariate data analysis.
5. Developed the use of harmonic analysis to solve partial differential equations.
6. Solved a long-standing problem in group theory called the Frobenius-Schur theorem. 
7. Developed the mathematical framework of Lie groups, an area of mathematics that is seen in both mathematics and physics. 
8. Devised the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket, a mathematical object used in differential geometry.

Born 28 August 1883, Nieuwer Amstel (now part of Amsterdam), Netherlands. Died 20 January 1971, Epe, The Netherlands.
