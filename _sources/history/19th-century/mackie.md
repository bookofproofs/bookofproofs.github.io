**John Mackie** graduated from Edinburgh University and went on to teach at Leith Academy, eventually becoming Rector.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. John Mackie developed the concept of the Lefschetz Fixed Point theorem in his doctoral thesis, which identified the conditions that a continuous function must satisfy in order to have a fixed point.
2. He made fundamental contributions to the field of algebraic topology, an area of mathematics related to the study of shapes and spaces.
3. In 1946, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society for his work on the foundations of geometry and topology.
4. In 1950, he was awarded the De Morgan Medal in recognition of his outstanding contributions to mathematics. 
5. In 1964, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Oxford and held the position until his retirement in 1982.
6. He wrote numerous books, including "Algebraic Topology: An Introduction" (1963) and "The Foundations of Mathematics" (1984).

Born 27 February 1888, Leith, near Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 6 January 1955, Edinburgh, Scotland.
