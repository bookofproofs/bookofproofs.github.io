**Hertha Ayrton** was an engineer and mathematician. She was awarded the Royal Society's Hughes Medal, and is well known as a suffragette.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Became the first female member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1899.
2. Developed a mathematical theory that allowed for the classification of electrical arcs, which had previously been difficult to understand and predict.
3. Conducted research on the magnetic properties of iron and steel and sugar solutions and published her findings in a number of papers.
4. Developed a method for electromagnets to generate high-intensity fields.
5. Published a book in 1905 that generalized the work of James Clerk Maxwell's famous treatise A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism.
6. In 1908, delivered a lecture at the Royal Society of Great Britain in which she proposed an equation for determining the currents of intense electrical discharges.
7. Helped to develop an early version of the arc welding process.
8. Pioneered the use of a mathematical technique known as separation of variables in engineering calculations.
9. Developed an early form of the camera lucida, an optical device used by scientists to project images onto a drawing surface.
10. Wrote several books and articles on the subjects of electricity, lighting and combustion gases.

Born 28 April 1854, Portsea, near Portsmouth, England. Died 23 August 1923, North Lancing, Sussex, England.
