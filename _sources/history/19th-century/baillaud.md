**Édouard Baillaud** was a French astronomer who specialised in celestial mechanics, in particular the motions of the satellites of Saturn.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Electro-Magnetism Laboratory at the Sorbonne in 1897.
2. Developed a theory of wave equations, which formed the basis for his PhD dissertation in 1867.
3. Published a highly acclaimed textbook titled Traite D'Analyse in 1885, which formed the basis for further developments in the field of mathematics.
4. Published numerous works in mathematical astronomy, studying topics such as the obliquity of the ecliptic and changes in the Earth's movements.
5. Proposed the law of free precession on the basis of his observations and mathematical arguments.
6. First person to propose the idea of absolute time, an early precursor to modern day time measurement. 
7. Demonstrated the existence of the planet Neptune through his precise mathematical computations.
8. Published a series of books related to the Moon's orbital motion, including paths and positions. 
9. Extended the field of potential theory and its application in physics, which laid the foundations for further investigation into the same.
10. Studied and published extensively on the theory of finite rotations in three dimensions and its applications to astronomy.

Born 14 February 1848, Chalon-sur-Saône, France. Died 8 July 1934, Toulouse, France.
