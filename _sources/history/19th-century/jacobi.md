**Carl Jacobi** made basic contributions to the theory of elliptic functions. He carried out important research in partial differential equations of the first order and applied them to the differential equations of dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Jacobi identity, a powerful tool used in abstract algebra.
2. Established Jacobi's inversion theorem as a general method of inverting determinants.
3. Proved that fundamental domains of planar domains can be expressed as the union of finitely many sets of circles.
4. Facilitated the development of the notion of automorphic functions.
5. Demonstrated the equations of the nth-order surface of any type can be expressed as a sum of at most n 2nd order surfaces.
6. Pioneered the study of elliptic functions.
7. Invented the Jacobi algorithm for solving linear equations.
8. Investigated the theory of orthogonal polynomials.
9. Developed the Jacobi symbols as a test for the solvability of Diophantine equations.
10. Established the Jacobi-Anger expansion for representing plane wave solutions to the wave equation.

Born 10 December 1804, Potsdam, Prussia (now Germany). Died 18 February 1851, Berlin, Germany.
