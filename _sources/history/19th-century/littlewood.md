**Littlewood** collaborated with G H Hardy, working on the theory of series, the Riemann zeta function, inequalities and the theory of functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Littlewood and Offord laws of probability, which gave a precise description of the likelihood of small and large sums of random numbers.
2. Conducted research in number theory, algebraic equations, and analytic functions.
3. Developed the Littlewood circle method - used to tackle difficult problems in number theory, lacking in earlier methods.
4. Co-authored the book "Theory of Numbers" with his colleague G.H. Hardy.
5. Developed a method for solving simultaneous linear equations, now called the Littlewood-Offord-Eddington Theory.
6. Advocated for an analytical approach to mathematics and studied the various correlations between Mathematics and Physics.
7. Made great strides in the understanding of Diophantine equations â€” equations with solutions that are integers or rational fractions.
8. Developed the Littlewood-Richardson rule for use in understanding multiple linear equations, which derived from his work on analyzing probability theory.
9. Contributed to the understanding of eigenvalues and their properties, a concept which plays an important role in fields such as quantum mechanics.
10. Developed the Kakutani-Birkhoff-Littlewood theorem, a complex equation that plays an important role in probability theory.

Born 9 June 1885, Rochester, Kent, England. Died 6 September 1977, Cambridge, England.
