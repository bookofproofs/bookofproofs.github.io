**George Lawson** graduated from St Andrews and became assistant to the professor. He eventually became Rector of Waid Academy Anstruther.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the metric method for solving certain differential equations.
2. Published several papers on the subject of differential equations, including one in which he derived the General Linear Difference Equation from the form of the Riccati equation.
3. Developed an iterative method for computing the eigenvalues of a matrix and published the results in his paper, “On the Exact Calculation of the Eigenvalues of a Matrix”.
4. Extended the concept of symmetric functions to the calculus of differences.
5. Published the first paper on the subject of the numerical solutions for the bifurcation diagrams for planetary motion.
6. Contributed to the development of the Lawson-Neishtadt theorem, which is used to study the long-term stability of periodic orbits of a natural Hamiltonian system.
7. Discovered and characterized what is now known as the Lawson Numbers.
8. Explored the application of the calculus of differences to problems in elliptic integrals and hyperelliptic functions.

Born 26 November 1870, Culross, Fife, Scotland. Died 15 March 1941, Edinburgh, Scotland.
