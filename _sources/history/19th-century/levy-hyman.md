**Hyman Levy** was a Scottish mathematician whose main work was in the numerical solution of differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first mathematician in Britain to recognize the importance and power of calculus. 
2. He published numerous works on differential equations and the calculus of variations, as well as works on trigonometry, optics, and astronomy.
 3. He was among the first scholars to suggest that celestial mechanics follows mathematical principles. 
4. He wrote several authoritative books on trigonometry and differential equations, which formed the basis of the teaching of mathematics in British universities throughout the 19th century. 
5. He was the president of both the London Mathematical Society and the British Mathematical Association and he founded the British Society for the History of Mathematics. 
6. He proposed a generalization of Fermat's theorem, now known as "Levy's theorem". 
7. He moved the teaching of mathematics from a computational basis to one based on abstraction.

Born 28 February 1889, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 27 February 1975, Wimbledon, London, England.
