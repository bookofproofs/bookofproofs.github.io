**Benjamin Osgood Peirce** was an American mathematician who became an important figure in applied mathematics in the United States.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He was the son of Benjamin Peirce and Rebecca Orme.
* Benjamin Osgood Peirce, the father of the subject of this biography, attended Colby University, graduating in 1835.
* He married Mehetable Osgood Seccomb, who was also teaching in Georgia, on 15 June 1841.
* She was the daughter of Ebenezer Peirce and Mary Marston.
* Mehetable and Benjamin had three children: Emily Rebecca Osgood Peirce, Mary Osgood Peirce, and Benjamin Osgood Peirce, the subject of this biography.
* Benjamin Osgood Peirce, the father, served as Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at New Hampton Institution from 1835 to 1837, then as Principal of Madison Female Academy, Georgia, from 1838 and 1839.
* In 1847, because his wife was suffering ill health, he moved north to Beverly, Massachusetts, north of Boston, where his son Benjamin Osgood Peirce, the subject of this biography, was born.
* His family moved from Beverly to Cambridge, Massachusetts, so that Peirce was able to live at home while his undertook his studies.
* has a vivid recollection of Peirce in his college days.
* At one time Peirce, Pine, Lefavour, and the two Lowells were all together in a course of elective mathematics given by Benjamin Peirce, then at the height of his fame.
* It is interesting to hear Mr Pine's observation that Peirce and Lefavour took criticism in docile fashion from their illustrious teacher, but that the Lowells always wanted to argue the point.
* Peirce began publishing papers, his first, written jointly with his friend Lefavour, was entitled On the effect of armatures on the magnetic state of electromagnets and appeared in 1875.
* Peirce was awarded a Parker Fellowship which allowed him to continue his studies in Europe.
* When this young man appeared he tried Peirce in Latin.
* Peirce's love of music meant that he had joined the choral society, the Riedelsche Verein, and attended many musical events where he had met Isamella.
* At this time Peirce was particularly interested in studying properties of magnetism.
* These years in Germany were particularly important for Peirce who learnt mathematical techniques used in theoretical physics, topics hardly studied at all in the United States at this time.
* Having now secured a permanent academic post, Peirce married Isamella Landreth in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 27 July 1882; they had two daughters.
* In 1884 Peirce was promoted to Assistant Professor of Mathematics and Physics, working under Joseph Lovering (1813-1892) who was Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Harvard, a post he had been appointed to in 1838.
* Peirce was assisted in developing the teaching of mathematical physics at Harvard by his colleague William Elwood Byerly (1849-1935).
* Together they taught calculus and its applications, constructing a two year course which Peirce and Byerly taught starting in alternate years.
* But the most notable course instituted by Peirce and shared by this pair of masterly teachers was that one in which Peirce treated the theory of the Newtonian potential function, and Byerly the theory of Fourier's series.
* Byerly's text Elements of the integral calculus was first published in 1881, while Peirce's text Elements of the theory of the Newtonian potential function was first published in 1886.
* As an indication of the cooperation of Peirce and Byerly on the two books, we note that Peirce published a table of integrals as a supplement to the edition which Byerly brought out in 1889.
* Peirce's A short table of integrals was a very popular work which soon became a book in its own right rather than a supplement.
* Joseph Lovering had retired in 1888 and Peirce was appointed to succeed him becoming Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy.
* The extreme activity that Peirce began after his illness in 1900-02 continued until the spring of 1913 when again his health became so bad that he was forced to stop teaching before the end of the academic year.
* Peirce had excellent relations with his wife's brothers and they shared many intellectual interests.
* During his visit to Britain Peirce's health gave cause for concern, he suffered a minor stroke and had heart problems.
* Professor Peirce devoted much time to the study of this subject, and his work is marked by the great care he took in his experiments and by his thoroughgoing analysis of the details of the problems involved; it is an admirable example of the best type of experimental work.

Born 11 February 1854, Beverly, Massachusetts, USA. Died 14 January 1914, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
