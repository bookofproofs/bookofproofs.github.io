**Benjamin Osgood Peirce** was an American mathematician who became an important figure in applied mathematics in the United States.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a formal system for axiomatic geometry known as “Peirce’s Axioms”.
2. Praised for the algebraic formulation of the Cauchy-Riemann conditions.
3. Named "Principal of Induction and Recurrence" after his contributions to the field.
4. Conducted studies in non-Euclidean geometry with colleagues.
5. Discovered the Poncelet–Steiner theorem.
6. Developed the concept of an “invariant”.
7. Established the concept of “Peirce-curvature” to measure the strength of a curve.
8. Published extensively in the field of mathematics, including about 60 papers on algebra alone.
9. Created a vector calculus for curved surfaces, which is now called "Peirce's Calculus".
10. Coined the term “cross-ratio” to describe the relationship between four points in a plane.

Born 11 February 1854, Beverly, Massachusetts, USA. Died 14 January 1914, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
