**Luther Eisenhart** was an American mathematician who worked in differential geometry and relativity theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for differential geometry known as "Eisenhart Lift" which allows one to turn any problem in ordinary differential equations into one in Hamiltonian mechanics. 
2. Established a collaboration between physics and mathematics by introducing the mathematics of Ernst Mach into the theory of relativity.
3. Developed the Atomic Model of Matter in the 1920s, which was one of the first attempts to explain the physical properties of matter using wave mechanics.
4. Developed the Gauss-Eisenhart Theorem, an important result in Riemannian geometry which laid the groundwork for Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity. 
5. Established a fundamental connection between Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics. 
6. Found a way to quantize the harmonic oscillator. 
7. Pioneered the use of tensor analysis to find connections between various branches of mathematics. 
8. Developed a proof for the Darboux Theorem, an important result in symplectic geometry. 
9. Solved the Painlevé equation in the 1930s, providing insight into the behavior of non-linear differential equations. 
10. Developed a high-accuracy averaging procedure for solving Hamilton's equation, a technique now known as the Eisenhart Method.

Born 13 January 1876, York, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 28 October 1965, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
