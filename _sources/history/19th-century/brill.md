**Alexander von Brill** was a German mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry. He also made mathematical models and was interested in the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1.Developed the Brill–Noether theorem, which provides a criterion for the existence of linear systems of divisors (an area of algebraic geometry)
2.Discovered a formula to calculate the number of linear systems of divisors on an algebraic curve
3.Proved that every algebraic function can be expressed as a composition of power, rational, and circular functions
4.Introduced the concept of Grosswald lattices, which attempts to solve certain problems about the representation of numbers
5.Provided a geometric proof for the Elkies–James–Thomas theorem, a theorem about linear recurrences 
6.Developed global differential geometry, among other contributions to the discipline

Born 20 September 1842, Darmstadt, Germany. Died 8 June 1935, Tübingen, Germany.
