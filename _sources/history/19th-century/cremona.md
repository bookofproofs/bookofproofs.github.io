**Luigi Cremona** was the originator of graphical statics, the study of forces in equilibrium, using graphical methods. He wrote papers on geometrical transformations, projective geometry and on graphical solutions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the study of algebraic surfaces, including the famous Cremona transformation.
2. Contributed to the development of the theory of algebraic curves and Abelian functions. 
3. Formulated and proved Cremona's theorem of algebraic curves, providing a link between algebraic geometry and differential geometry.
4. Made contributions to the theory of differential and integral equations, in particular to the application to thermodynamics. 
5. Published over 20 books and papers related to mathematics.
6. Conducted the first systematic investigation into the mathematical theories of conic sections.
7. Proved 16 theorems regarding various aspects of projective and affine geometry, quadric surfaces, and linear systems of algebraic equations.

Born 7 December 1830, Pavia, Lombardy (now Italy). Died 10 June 1903, Rome, Italy.
