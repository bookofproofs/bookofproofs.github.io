**Kuratowski** was a Polish mathematician who worked in the area of [topology][bookofproofs$57] and [set theory][bookofproofs$27].
He is best known for his theorem giving a necessary and sufficient condition for a [graph][bookofproofs$523] to be [planar][bookofproofs$1226].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Kuratowski's theorem in topology, which states that every finite graph is a planar graph or can be drawn in a plane without crossings of edges.
2. Constructed the first countable ordinal and first uncountable ordinal.
3. Formulated a general theorem allowing one to prove, without the tedious work of direct computation, the existence of various subsets in mathematics and their cardinal numbers.
4. Developed the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma, which is used in theorems of existence and regularity, such as the Hahn-Banach theorem.
5. Created the Kuratowski closure-complement problem in an attempt to formalize the intuitive notion of closure in topology.
6. Initiated the study of mathematical logic in Poland.
7. Co-formulated a theorem describing the properties of graphs and surfaces with curved edges.
8. Advanced the understanding of set theory with his theorem on the characterization of finite sets.
9. Contributed to the development of the theory of games by coining the term ‘game theory’.
10. Established the foundational groundwork of the theory of relational structures.

Born 2 February 1896, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 18 June 1980, Warsaw, Poland.
