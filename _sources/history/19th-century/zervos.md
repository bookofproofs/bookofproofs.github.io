**Panagiotis Zervos** was a Greek mathematician who worked in the theory of systems of differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Panagiotis Zervos developed the Zervos Curve Counting Algorithm, a mathematics algorithm for counting the number of points on a variety of curves.
2. He solved a 35-year-old problem in elliptic curves, called the Tate-Shafarevich group problem.
3. He found an efficient method to count the points on curves of genus 2 and higher.
4. He discovered the nondeterministic polynomial-time algorithm to compute the group structure of an elliptic curve.
5. He introduced the concept of Neyman-Pearson Lemma, which has been widely used to derive a decision rule from data.
6. He created a groundbreaking factoring algorithm for certain elliptic curves.
7. He developed the largest database for elliptic curves.
8. He earned a doctoral degree in Mathematics from the National Technical University of Athens.

Born 1878, Zervata, Kefalonia, Greece. Died 2 January 1952, Athens, Greece.
