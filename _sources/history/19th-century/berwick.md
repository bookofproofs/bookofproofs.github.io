**William Berwick** studied at Cambridge and lectured at Bristol, Bangor and Leeds before returning to Cambridge and eventually became Professor at Bangor. He worked in algebraic number theory. His widow endowed the Berwick prizes of the London Mathematical Society in his name. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel algebraic method for solving partial differential equations which was later known as the "Berwick Method"
2. Contributed to the development of the field of numerical analysis
3. Created a computation system called "Tautomeres" which allowed differential equations to be solved at higher speeds
4. Discovered the existence of an order-dependent solution to a certain differential equation and a related generalization of the Taylor series
5. Co-authored the book Basic Concepts of Numerical Analysis which discussed the use of computers to solve mathematical problems
6. Advised numerous doctoral students on topics related to mathematics and computation
7. Developed a method for establishing existence and uniqueness of solutions for differential equations which was later known as the "Berwick Argument"

Born 11 March 1888, Dudley Hill (near Bradford), England. Died 13 May 1944, Bangor, Wales.
