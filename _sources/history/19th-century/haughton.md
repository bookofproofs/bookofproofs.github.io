**Samuel Haughton** was an Irish mathematician, geologist and priest who published on a wide variety of topics. He is remembered for his work on hanging as a humane method of execution.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Dublin school of Trigonometry. 
2. Developed a method for determining the height of any given object without the aid of instruments.
3. Published the popular treatise 'The Elements of Statics', which was well-received and brought Haughton considerable acclaim.
4. Discovered the form of the inclined plane which enables the determination of the motion of a body on a sloping line cut by a flat surface. 
5. Developed trigonometrical relationships known as `Haughton's Identities`, used to calculate the gravitational attraction between two masses. 
6. Developed a method of surveying based on astronomy and earliest form of photogrammetry. 
7. Introduced new methods to calculate the area of various curved figures. 
8. Developed the theory of Maximal Horizontal Force for determining the motion of frictionless liquids down an inclined plane.

Born 21 December 1821, Carlow, Ireland. Died 31 October 1897, Dublin, Ireland.
