**Ettore Bortolotti** was an Italian mathematician who worked in various areas in analysis. He was interested in the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a proof system for non-binary arithmetic logic known as a two-valued Boolean algebra.
2. Established the concept of a single universal model of arithmetic.
3. Developed a pioneering axiomatic system for constructive analysis with Lukasiewicz.
4. First to propose a complete set of respective laws for algebraic structures. 
5. Pioneered the use of hyperreal numbers, allowing for a simplified analysis of the foundations of real analysis.
6. Founded the discipline known as fuzzy logic.
7. Encouraged the development of a group theory applicable to logic.
8. Pioneered the reverse use of Dedekind Cuts to understand functions with limits. 
9. Wrote a dissertation on the consistency of choice and paradoxes with number theory. 
10. Developed tools to demonstrate the consistency of the axiom of choice for infinite cardinalities.

Born 6 March 1866, Bologna, Kingdom of Sardinia (now Italy). Died 17 February 1947, Bologna, Italy.
