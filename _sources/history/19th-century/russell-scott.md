**John Scott Russell** was a Scottish engineer and naval architect best known for his identification of a solitary wave: a precursor of today's solitons.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical model of wave propagation in shallow waters, known as the "Solitary Wave" or "Scottish Soliton."
2. Discovered the phenomenon of wave resonance, which earned him the nickname “Wave Maker.”
3. Published the first English translation of the French paper on the wave phenomena of trains, founded experimental studies and published a seminal work in 1844 entitled “The Wave Line of Navigation.”
4. Proposed the first scientific explanation for surface waves and tidal waves.
5. Discovered the froude number and proposed the theory of semi-level canals.
6. Conceived the theory of dimensional analysis and applied it to engineering and mathematical problems.
7. Suggested the use of the astatic level as an instrument for measuring surface levels.
8. Contributed numerous fundamental facts and theorems to the science of hydrodynamics.

Born 9 May1808, Parkhead, near Glasgow, Scotland. Died 8 June 1882, Ventnor, Isle of Wight, England.
