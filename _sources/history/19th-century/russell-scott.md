**John Scott Russell** was a Scottish engineer and naval architect best known for his identification of a solitary wave: a precursor of today's solitons.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His mother was  Agnes Clarke Scott.
* Agnes, who married David Russell in Dublin, Ireland, died when John Scott Russell was very young.
* When John was three years old, his father became minister of Colinsburgh Relief Church, near Kirkcaldy, a congregation which had seceded from the Church of Scotland; but he soon moved on to a larger congregation in Hawick, and married Anne Titterton (1787-1861) on 28 April 1812 in Kilconquhar, Fife and had more children.
* John Scott Russell was primarily an engineer and naval architect, rather than a mathematician; but his name is well-known to applied mathematicians today through his experimental discovery of the 'solitary wave'.
* John spent just one year at St Andrews University, before transferring to Glasgow University; there, he first added his mother's name, Scott, to his own.
* During 1832-33, following the death of John Leslie, he substituted for the professor of natural philosophy at Edinburgh University; but he did not apply for the vacant post, which he was sure would go to David Brewster.
* In 1838, Russell was an unsuccessful applicant for the chair of Mathematics, which Philip Kelland secured.
* John Scott Russell married Henrietta Osbourne in 1836.
* In the 1830s Russell developed a prototype passenger-carrying steam carriage, but it met with opposition from the road trustees, and the venture failed.
* He spoke of his work at early meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, founded in 1831; and the Association appointed him and Sir John Robison of Edinburgh to a 'Committee on Waves' to conduct observations and experiments.
* A substantial report by Robison and Russell appeared in 1837 and Russell alone wrote his major Report on Waves (1844) following Robison's death in 1843.
* These reports, in fact all Russell's own work, contain a remarkable series of observations, at sea, in rivers and canals, and in Russell's own wave tank constructed for the purpose.
* There, Russell's "Great Wave of Translation" is described in detail.
* Russell's experimental work helped to stimulate a revival in theoretical hydrodynamics in Britain.
* Airy objected to the emphasis placed by Russell on his "Great Primary Wave", wrongly arguing that it was neither great nor primary, but just one consequence of the linear shallow water theory which he (Airy) had given.
* After working for a shipbuilder in Greenock, Russell moved to London in 1844, with his wife and two young children.
* In the 1860s, Russell's reputation suffered a number of setbacks from which it never recovered.

Born 9 May 1808, Parkhead, near Glasgow, Scotland. Died 8 June 1882, Ventnor, Isle of Wight, England.
