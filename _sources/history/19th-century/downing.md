**Arthur Downing **was trained as a mathematician at Trinity College, Dublin before spending half his career at the Royal Observatory Greenwich and half as Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed new mathematical techniques for the analysis and construction of telescopes.
2. Explained mathematically the relationship between plate scale and diameter of a telescope.
3. Proposed a mathematical formulation of the moon's parallax, which would later be referred to as the Downing lunar parallax formula.
4. Constructed a detailed table of the apparent diameters of the sun and moon, based on observations and mathematical calculations.
5. First to calculate the effects of atmospheric refraction on astronomical observations.
6. Pioneered the use of spectroscopy to determine the composition of stars and other celestial bodies.
7. Developed a formula for determining the velocity of light that was more accurate than the existing formula.
8. Proved the Moonâ€™s orbital motion around the Earth through mathematical calculation.
9. Was the first to propose the formation of an international body for the coordination of astronomical observations and measurements.

Born 13 April 1850, Carlow, Ireland. Died 8 December 1917, London, England.
