**Augustus Love** was an English mathematician known for his work on the theory of elasticity. He also worked on wave propagation and the structure of the Earth.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the research school for mathematical physics at the University of Toronto in 1924.
2. Authored the book "Modern Mathematical Physics" which was a widely used advanced mathematical physics textbook for decades.
3. Established mathematical foundations for the guiding equations of atmospheric physics.
4. Significantly improved the accuracy of predictions in hydrodynamical calculations.
5. Derived the Love–wave solution for surface gravity waves.
6. Discovered a set of particular solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations. 
7. Demonstrated the integral identity now known as Love's identity.
8. Contributed to the first use of the finite-difference method for the numerical solution of partial differential equations.

Born 17 April 1863, Weston-super-Mare, England. Died 5 June 1940, Oxford, England.
