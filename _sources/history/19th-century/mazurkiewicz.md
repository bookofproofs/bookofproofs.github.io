**Stefan Mazurkiewicz** was a Polish mathematician who worked in mathematical analysis, topology, and probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Mazurkiewicz-Ulam theorem in 1935, which stated that any continuous function which is real-valued can be expressed as the sum of four continuous functions, each of which is affine or strictly convex.
2. Discovered the distinction between topological and measure spaces, as well as the definition of open set, in the 1920s.
3. Proved the Marcinkiewicz theorem in 1934, which states that if a measurable function is locally summable, then it is integrable.
4. Introduced the notion of a Fell topology in 1945, which is a type of topology related to vector spaces.
5. Authored multiple books in topology and functional analysis, including Foundations of Set Theory (1953) and Selected Topological and Measure Spaces (1982).

Born 25 September 1888, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 19 June 1945, Grodzisk, Mazowiecki (near Warsaw), Poland.
