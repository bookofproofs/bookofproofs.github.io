**Castelnuovo** was an Italian mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry. He also worked in probability and relativity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the concept of representing algebraic equations geometrically.
2. Found new ways to use the "dimension" to study curves and surfaces.
3. Proved the Castelnuovo Theorems, which demonstrated the power of algebraic geometry for encapsulating mathematical knowledge.
4. Showed that linked multidimensional polynomials could be mapped to surfaces and curves.
5. Demonstrated a deep connection between linear and projective algebraic geometry.
6. Pioneered the application of infinitesimal and transcendental methods to the study of algebraic geometry.
7. Researched the foundational aspects of commutative algebra and projective geometry.
8. Developed a theory of "capillarity" to explain the behavior of gases and liquids.
9. Discovered the Castelnuovo criterion, a tool to test the irreducibility of algebraic varieties.
10. Established new relationships between algebraic requirement and topological theorems.

Born 14 August 1865, Venice, Italy. Died 27 April 1952, Rome, Italy.
