**Fritz Zwicky** was a Bulgarian-born  Swiss astronomer who worked most of his life in the USA. He made important contributions in theoretical and observational astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical basis for supernova research and dark matter theory.
2. Envisioned correctly the trajectories of orbiting galaxies and the discovery of galactic superclusters.
3. Initiated the development of the neutron star concept.
4. Developed the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity and the mathematical theory of wave equation.
5. Pioneered the use of the virial theorem to find the masses of galaxies.
6. Developed mathematical models for stellar masses, luminosity and evolution.
7. Guessed correctly the existence of neutron stars before they were discovered.
8. Coined the term “Dark Matter” and the related “Missing Mass” hypothesis.
9. Proposed the Core-halo structure of galaxies.
10. Developed the Zwicky-Kowal Principle for a better understanding of interstellar matter.

Born 14 February 1898, Varna, Bulgaria. Died 8 February 1974, Pasadena, California, USA.
