**George Airy** was Lucasian professor at Cambridge and Astronomer Royal. He made many major contributions to mathematics and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the first system of mathematical analysis, called the progressive differential method.
2. Discovered the phenomenon of 'gravitational attraction', which explained why the planets moved in elliptical orbits.
3. Formulated a method of planetary orbits that enabled accurate calculations of the movement of Mercury, which was then used to determine other heavens body's movements.
4. Applied mathematical techniques to understand what causes tides and account for them mathematically.
5. Developed a mathematical ‘brake’ to control the speed of a steam engine.
6. Levelled a strip of land in Ireland that was to become the railway connecting Dublin and Kingstown.
7. Developed a method for gauging the exact weight of a solid and its volume or containing capacity.
8. Formulated a mathematical proof for the wave theory of light.
9. Founded the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos and first examined students for the degree in 1833.
10. Created an effort to revamp British navigation, which involved the measurement of angles and distances on the Earth's surface.

Born 27 July 1801, Alnwick, Northumberland, England. Died 2 January 1892, Greenwich, England.
