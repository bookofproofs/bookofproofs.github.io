**Horace Lamb** wrote important texts and made important contributions to applied mathematics, in particular to acoustics and fluid dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His mother was Elizabeth Lamb (born Hayfield, Derbyshire about 1817).
* John Lamb died when Horace was young and after his mother remarried, Horace went to live with Mrs Holland who was his mother's sister.
* She was kindly lady but nevertheless brought Horace up in a severe Puritan manner.
* Horace was educated at the Grammar School in Stockport.
* In 1866, when Horace was only 17, he won a scholarship to read classics at Queen's College, Cambridge but declined the scholarship to spend a year studying at Owens College, Manchester.
* It was at Owens College that Lamb's interests turned firmly towards mathematics so that, when he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, the following year it was to study mathematics.
* Lamb was taught by Stokes and Maxwell at Cambridge and graduated as Second Wrangler in 1872 (meaning that he was second in the ranked list of those students awarded a First Class degree).
* Adelaide was extremely fortunate in their choice of Lamb as their first professor of mathematics and he rapidly built the reputation of the mathematics department there.
* Lamb left Australia in 1885, accepting a chair at Victoria University in England (now the University of Manchester).
* Lamb held the chair at Manchester until 1920 when, at the age of 70, he retired and moved to Cambridge.
* Lamb wrote important texts and made important contributions to applied mathematics, in particular to acoustics and fluid dynamics, for example Mathematical Theory of the Motion of Fluids (1878).
* Lamb's texts had a major role on teaching in British universities for many years.
* Lamb wrote books in addition to those mentioned above, including Infinitesimal Calculus (1897), Dynamical Theory of Sound (1910), and Higher Mechanics (1920).

Born 29 November 1849, Stockport, England. Died 4 December 1934, Cambridge, England.
