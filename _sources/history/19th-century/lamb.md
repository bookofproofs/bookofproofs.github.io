**Horace Lamb** wrote important texts and made important contributions to applied mathematics, in particular to acoustics and fluid dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He derived the equations that describe wave propagation.
2. He proposed a theoretical model of tides.
3. He helped develop the idea of conformal mapping.
4. He formulated the algebraic problem of linear transformation.
5. He helped develop theories for elasticity.
6. He was instrumental in developing theories for the vibrational motion of atoms and molecules.
7. He published several influential articles on fluid dynamics.
8. He helped establish the theory of hydrodynamics.
9. He did significant work on the physical interpretation of solutions to the wave equation.
10. He demonstrated that the velocity of propagation of sound is determined by the wave equation.

Born 29 November 1849, Stockport, England. Died 4 December 1934, Cambridge, England.
