**Annie Scott Dill Maunder** was a Northern Irish astronomer and mathematician who studied the mathematical tripos at Cambridge then worked at the Royal Observatory Greenwich. She was the first to find evidence of the movement of sunspot emergence from the poles toward the equator over the sun's 11-year cycle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Became the first woman to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1916.
2. Published over 90 papers and books related to mathematics during her career.
3. Co-discovered the differential rotation of sun spots.
4. Improved the accuracy of measuring the solar wind by developing the modern butterfly diagram.
5. Developed models to predict the length of a solar cycle.
6. Helped examine the correlation between the position of sun spots and the magnetic fields on Earth.
7. Designed a technique to accurately measure sunspot positions known as the Maunder Minimum.
8. Used photography as a means to study the solar system, resulting in the discovery of many sun spots.
9. Developed models to describe the solar cycle and its influences on Earth.
10. Demonstrated a correlation between sunspots and the next sunspot cycle.

Born 14 April 1868, Strabane, County Tyrone, Ireland. Died 15 September 1947, Wandsworth, London, England.
