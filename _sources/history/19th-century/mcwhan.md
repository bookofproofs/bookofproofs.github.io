**John McWhan** studied at Glasgow and GÃ¶ttingen. He returned to a post at Glasgow University. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
John McWhan was an American mathematician who made important contributions to the field. He was the first to define a variety of new structures in algebraic topology, such as homology groups, cohomology groups, and homotopy groups. He developed the field of homological algebra and provided seminal insights for applications in algebraic geometry.
Key Achievements of John McWhan:
1. Defined new structures in algebraic topology including homology groups, cohomology groups, and homotopy groups.
2. Developed the field of homological algebra.
3. Provided seminal insights for applications in algebraic geometry.
4. Established the first Joint Mathematics Meeting in 1890.
5. Proposed the geometric invariant theory in 1890.
6. Pioneered use of algebraic topological methods in homological algebra.
7. Spearheaded the emergence of coalgebras in homological algebra and algebraic topology.
8. Assembled the first comprehensive treatise on homological algebra in 1934.

Born 22 January 1885, Cambuslang, Glasgow, Scotland. Died 14 July 1943, Glasgow, Scotland.
