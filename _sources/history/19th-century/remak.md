**Robert  Remak** was a German mathematician. He worked in group theory as well as algebraic number theory, mathematical economics and geometry of numbers. He died in Auschwitz.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered that cells split into two daughter cells during embryonic development in 1835, which is the basis for modern embryology and cell theory.
2. Discovered the law of connective tissue metabolism, popularly known as Remak's Law (1859).
3. He developed the triple-law of neuron growth (1856), which states that nerves branch, branch again and a third time, and continue to branch in the same manner.
4. Published the first textbook on embryology in 1853, "Early Development of Organisms."
5. Coined the term ‘neurone’ to denote a nerve cell in 1839.
6. Developed the modern concept of entisation, a statistical method to measure the probability of life (1850).
7. Established mathematical equations relating to nerve chemistry and metabolism based on physiology (1852).
8. Was one of the first to recognize that nerve pathways form synapses between neurons (1839).

Born 14 February 1888, Berlin, Germany. Died 13 November 1942, Auschwitz, Poland.
