**Delfino Codazzi** was an Italian mathematician who worked in differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new method of mapping in three dimensions, requiring the measurement of angles and distances.
2. Developed a mathematical formula to calculate the curvature of the earth's surface.
3. Catalogued and charted the physical geography of a large part of Colombia and Venezuela.
4. Calculated the angle of refraction for the computation of distance.
5. Determined the exact height of each mountain peak in of the mountain ranges.
6. Was the first to introduce the 'triangulation system' in Colombia.
7. Created an original map as a result of over 1,500 measurements from the region.
8. Established the method of sectionalizing the surface of the earth, now known as 'sectionalization of areas'.
9. Published  an extensive catalog of the mountains and rivers of Colombia, the first of its kind.

Born 7 March 1824, Lodi (now Italy). Died 21 July 1873, Pavia, Italy.
