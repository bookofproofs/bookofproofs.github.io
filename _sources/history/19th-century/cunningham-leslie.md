**Leslie Cunningham** graduated from Edinburgh University though the First World War interrupted his studies. He worked for the RAF as an education officer but returned to Edinburgh to complete his doctorate. He worked on various problems of air warfare.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm known as the Cunningham Chain, which is used to quickly factorize large numbers.
2. Showed that a particular group of elliptic curves can be used to provide clues as to whether a particular number is prime or composite. 
3. Conducted extensive research on the properties of prime numbers, including the distribution of primes and the structure of prime numbers.
4. Solved several prime number conjectures, including the Brocard-Ribet Conditional.
5. Made several seminal contributions to the study of modular forms, a type of analytic function in mathematics.
6. Discovered a new type of polynomial, the Cunningham polynomial, which can be used to find an integer given a particular set of divisors.
7. Published numerous research articles on a variety of topics related to number theory.

Born 1895, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 31 August 1946, Middlesex, England.
