**Einstein** contributed more than any other scientist to the modern vision of physical reality. His special and general theories of relativity are still regarded as the most satisfactory model of the large-scale universe that we have.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Special Theory of Relativity which revolutionized our understanding of space, time and gravity.
2. Proposed the famous equation E = mc2 which established the formula for the transformation of mass into energy.
3. Successfully explained the photoelectric effect, which led to the development of quantum theory.
4. Formulated the concept of Brownian motion which explained the random movement of molecules.
5. Pioneered the study of Bose-Einstein Statistics, a type of quantum statistics which describes the behavior of a system of particles.
6. Helped to develop the mathematical framework of the theory of general relativity.
7. Provided the basis for the mathematical theory of chaotic dynamical systems.

Born 14 March 1879, Ulm, WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. Died 18 April 1955, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
