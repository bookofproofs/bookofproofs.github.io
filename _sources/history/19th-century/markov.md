**A A Markov** was a Russian mathematician who is is best known for his work in probability and for stochastic processes especially Markov chains.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the theory of stochastic processes, including the Markov chains and processes.
2. Developed the mathematical tools for analyzing statistical and probabilistic processes.
3. Developed algorithms for calculating the probability of a given series of events occurring in an uncertain environment.
4. Developed a Lattice Model of Probability Theory.
5. Created highly practical algorithms to solve counting problems using Markov Chains.
6. Was the first to formulate the theory of Markov processes.
7. Developed a systematic theory of abstract classes of stochastic processes.
8. Derived the central limit theorem and dispersion theorem of probability theory.
9. Investigated the conditions of positive definiteness of Markov's quadratic form.
10. Investigated properties of normal and simple Markov Chains.

Born 14 June 1856, Ryazan, Russia. Died 20 July 1922.
