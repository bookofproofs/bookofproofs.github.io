**Johannes Robert Rydberg** was a Swedish mathematician and physicist whose most important work was on spectroscopy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He formulated the Rydberg formula, which gives an approximate wavelength for the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom.
2. He formulated the Rydbergâ€“Ritz combination principle which provided a way to calculate the energy levels of the hydrogen atom.
3. He developed the atomic shell theory which describes the distribution of electrons in atoms.
4. He contributed to the foundations of quantum mechanics by introducing the concept of orbital momentum.
5. He accurately predicted the structure of helium based on theoretical considerations.
6. He provided an early derivation of the Planck Law which states that the energy of systems is quantized.
7. He worked extensively on the mathematical problem of self-adjoint functions.
8. He made important contributions to the mathematical theory of differential equations.

Born 8 November 1854, Halmstad, Sweden. Died 28 December 1919, Lund, Sweden.
