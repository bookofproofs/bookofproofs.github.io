**Marian Smoluchowski** was an Austrian physicist who was a pioneer of statistical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first meaningful mathematical model of a living cell, which accurately predicted its growth rate.
2. Created a mathematical model for random walks based on diffusion and other properties, which formed the basis for modern kinetic theory.
3. Developed the theory of a competition between mutually exclusive chemical processes, from which he deduced the law of mass action, now known as the Smoluchowski equation.
4. Established the foundation of Boltzmann's work on classical gas dynamics and developed the kinetic theory of colloids.
5. Devised the gravitational paradigm of coagulation, which eventually became a data model for several areas of science and technology.
6. Demonstrated the statistical nature of Brownian motion, thus providing a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics.
7. Incorporated thermodynamic elements into his theories, which gave rise to the first thermodynamically consistent theory of living things.
8. Pioneered the use of mathematics in biology, which revolutionized the field and opened the door for modern biological research.

Born 28 May 1872, Vorderbrühl, near Vienna, Austria. Died 5 September 1917, Kraków, Poland.
