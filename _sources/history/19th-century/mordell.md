**Mordell** is best known for his investigations of equations of the form of `$y^2=x^3+k$` which had been studied by Fermat.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He proved Mordell's theorem, an important generalization of the law of quadratic reciprocity proven by Gauss.
2. He solved several important diophantine equations, including establishing the restriction on the Fermat equation of the fourth degree.
3. He made advances in number theory, including studying the elliptic curves and their complex multiplication.
4. He established the basic number-theoretic properties of the classical root numbers. 
5. He developed new methods for understanding lattices, introducing the notion of a convex polytope.
6. He discovered and studied the Mordell-Weil theorem, a significant result in algebraic geometry. 
7. He developed new techniques in transcendental number theory, such as his approach to Thueâ€“Siegel's theorem. 
8. He laid the foundations for the area of analytic number theory, combining the use of geometry and analytic methods.
9. He introduced the concept of zeta functions and the associated zeta functions of algebras and varieties. 
10. He laid the groundwork for the further development of the theory of diophantine approximations.

Born 28 January 1888, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 12 March 1972, Cambridge, England.
