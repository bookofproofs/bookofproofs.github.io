**Thomas Kirkman** wrote on the theory of groups and his writings are the first systematic account of the elements of group theory in English. He also made many contributions to combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a paper entitled "On the Integration of Certain Differential Equations" at the age of 18.  
2. Developed the Kirkman–Cayley Theorem of algebra, one of the most important results in computational group theory.
3. Discovered the five regular polyhedra now known as the Platonic solids.
4. Developed a new way of solving linear equations that is considered one of the foundations of modern-day linear algebra.
5. Demonstrated the possibility of what are now known as Fourier series, showing that a periodic function can be expressed as an infinite series of sines and cosines.
6. Proposed a new method of determining the roots of certain equations, now referred to as the Kirkman Method. 
7. Showed how to solve equations with complex numbers using elliptic functions. 
8. Founded the mathematical field of graph theory and invented the concept of abstract graphs. 
9. Published the book “The Theory of Probability”, which is considered one of the most important works on the subject.

Born 31 March 1806, Bolton (near Manchester), England. Died 4 February 1895, Bowdon (near Manchester), England.
