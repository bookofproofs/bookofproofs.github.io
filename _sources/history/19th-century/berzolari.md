**Luigi Berzolari** was an Italian mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry, the theory of forms and differential projective geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the groundbreaking book 'Algebraic Structures in Geometry', wherein he synthesized an algebraic approach to geometric problems.
2. Developed the concept of numerical equivalence which is an important part of modern algebraic geometry.
3. Discovered an original method to solve third and higher order polynomials.
4. Developed the theory of geometric equations.
5. Established Berzolari's Theorem, which generalizes the concept of normal lines and planes to higher dimensions.
6. Produced several works on the general theory of algebraic equations, the geometry of complex numbers, and the theory of linear and multilinear transformations.
7. Pioneered the exploration of algebraic varieties and determined the conditions for their complete classification.
8. Pioneered the introduction of geometrical methods into the study of equations.
9. Demonstrated that the theory of equations could be used to study the properties of circles in the Euclidean plane.

Born 1 May1863, Naples, Italy. Died 10 December 1949, Pavia, Italy.
