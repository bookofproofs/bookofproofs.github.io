**Aleksei Krylov** was a Russian applied mathematician who worked in many areas including shipbuilding, magnetism, artillery, mathematics, astronomy, and geodesy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Krylov Subspace Method, a powerful numerical approach for solving linear equations in high-dimensional matrices.
2. Initiated the method of continued fractions, which enables the generation of accurate approximations of irrational numbers.
3. Established the Krylov-Bogolyubov theorem in linear dynamical systems.
4. Set up the theory of scalar and vector fields, an important development in electrostatics.
5. Introduced the concept of Gibbs Phenomenon, a phenomenon in which an oscillatory tail appears in the numerical solution of differential equations.
6. Established Krylov's theory of solvability, an important theorem in algebraic and Euclidean geometries.
7. Pioneered mathematical foundations of modern probability theory.
8. Developed the famous Krylov Acceleration procedure, an algorithm used in numerical analysis.
9. Contributed significantly to the fields of mechanics, elasticity, and hydrodynamics.
10. Studied the spectral theory of linear operators and spectral integral representations.

Born 15 August 1863, Visyaga, Simbirskoy (now Ulyanovskaya), Russia. Died 26 October 1945, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
