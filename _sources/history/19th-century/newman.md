**Max Newman** was an English mathematician who worked on combinatorial topology and theoretcal computer science. His codebreaking work in World War II has made him famous.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the foundational ideas of morphogenesis, a branch of mathematics that focused on biological shapes and processes.
2. Pioneered the use of electronic computers for pattern recognition and problem solving.
3. Designed a mathematical model that predicted the size and motion of electric circuits in nature.
4. Wrote seminal papers on computing and mathematical physics and contributed to the development of artificial intelligence.
5. Helped to found the academic discipline known as neural networks.
6. Co-authored an influential paper with Alan Turing on the use of computers to break codes. 
7. Spearheaded the creation of a Manchester University computer laboratory in 1951.
8. Obtained a degree in mathematics from Christ's College, Cambridge in 1932.

Born 7 February 1897, Chelsea, London, England. Died 22 February 1984, Comberton (near Cambridge), England.
