**Max Newman** was an English mathematician who worked on combinatorial topology and theoretcal computer science. His codebreaking work in World War II has made him famous.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Max attended the City of London School, entering in 1908.
* As we mentioned above, it was at this time that he changed his name by deed poll from Neumann to Newman.
* From 1916 until 1919 Newman undertook work related to the war, doing various jobs such as army paymaster and schoolmaster.
* Newman visited Princeton in 1928-9 during which time he was a Rockefeller Research Fellow working closely with Alexander.
* Newman married Lyn Irvine in 1934.
* While at Cambridge Newman taught a course on the foundations of mathematics.
* which was published with considerable help from Newman.
* Without Newman's encouragement, Turing might not have done this work and got drawn into codebreaking.
* Newman returned to Princeton for a second visit in 1937-8.
* He devised a way of carrying forward the work of Tiltman and Tutte by the use of specially designed machines and for this purpose was given charge of a section, commonly called "Newmanry".
* At the end of the War Newman was appointed to a chair to succeed Mordell as Fielden Professor of Mathematics at Manchester and, three years later, he appointed Turing to the post of Reader in Mathematics in his Department.
* Along with Hodge and Henry Whitehead, Newman set up the British Mathematical Colloquium.
* A series of papers by Newman on this topic between 1926 and 1932 revolutionised the field.
* Newman also wrote an important paper on theoretical computer science, produced a topological counter-example of major significance in collaboration with Henry Whitehead, and wrote an outstanding paper on periodic transformations in abelian topological groups.
* Newman saw, and presented, topology as part of the whole of mathematics, not as an isolated discipline: and many must wish he had written more.
* In 1962 Newman was presented with the De Morgan Medal from the London Mathematical Society.
* In 1964 Newman retired from his Manchester chair but he most certainly did not give up mathematics.
* Retirement was also an opportunity for Newman to relaunch his research career which he did with the vigour of a young academic.
* Lynn Newman died in 1973, and later in the same year he married Margaret Penrose, the daughter of a professor of physiology, who was the widow of the physician Professor Lionel Sharples Penrose.

Born 7 February 1897, Chelsea, London, England. Died 22 February 1984, Comberton (near Cambridge), England.
