**Bendixson** taught at Stockholm, then from 1913 to 1927 he was rector of Stockholm University. He worked on set theory and differential equations. He is best remembered for the Poincaré - Bendixson theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Bendixson–Dulac Theorem on critical point theory, a central tool of dynamical systems theory.
2. Conducted research on ordinary differential equations with applications to celestial mechanics.
3. Discovered a method to determine the integrability of differential equations.
4. Discovered the first known examples of chaotic behaviour in a simple dynamical system.
5. Constructed a numerical calculation of the potential created by a continuously distributed mass.
6. Developed the theory of elliptic functions and theta functions.
7. Developed a numerical integration method to approximate the solution of differential equations.
8. Developed a theory of integral equations.
9. Found a method to generate a continuous function from a discrete function.
10. Constructed a numerical method for tackling the three-body problem in celestial mechanics.

Born 1 August 1861, Bergshyddan, Djurgården, Sweden. Died 29 November 1935, Stockholm, Sweden.
