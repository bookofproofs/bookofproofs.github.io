From 1923-38 **Weyl** evolved the concept of continuous groups using matrix representations. With his application of group theory to quantum mechanics he set up the modern subject.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Weyl invariance, a form of gauge theory which is the basis for the quantum theory of electromagnetism. 
2. Introduced the mathematical theory of topological vector spaces.
3. Created the concept of unitary representability. 
4. Researched and wrote extensively on mathematical topics such as calculus, number theory, and integral geometry. 
5. Discovered important connections between groups, differential equations, and universality questions.
6. Established the field of mathematics known as representation theory. 
7. Published an influential book on the unification of the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics and relativity. 
8. Developed the first rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics. 
9. Wrote a pioneering paper on gauge theory, which elucidated the source of mass in quantum field theory.

Born 9 November 1885, Elmshorn (near Hamburg), Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Died 8 December 1955, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.
