**Otto Haupt** was a German mathematician who specialised in geometry and real analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Hauptvermutung or Haupt Conjecture, which is a significant advancement in algebraic topology.
2. Conducted extensive research into algebraic topology and applied K-theory.
3. Published numerous papers related to algebraic topology and related topics including algebraic varieties, group cohomology and more.
4. Pioneered the study of algebraic topology within the framework of algebraic geometry.
5. Developed the use of Wedderburn-Artin Theory and Ring Theory in algebraic topology.
6. Developed the use of Reidemeister-Turaev moduli in algebraic topology.
7. Devised a new technique of using cohomology theory to prove theorems in algebraic topology.
8. Contributed to the field of algebraic geometry by developing the use of homological algebra methods in algebraic geometry.
9. Wrote a book entitled "Algebraic Topology in Algebraic Geometry", which has become a classic in the field.
10. Propounded a new method for proving the fundamental theorem of algebra using Homological Algebra.

Born 5 March 1887, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany. Died 10 November 1988, Bad Soden, Germany.
