**Benjamin Kagan** was a Russian and Soviet mathematician who woked on non-Euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Kagan entered Novorossysky University in Odessa in 1887.
* In 1892 Kagan received a degree from Kiev University, then in 1895 he was awarded a Master's Degree by St Petersburg University.
* As if this was not enough, Kagan also edited the Journal of Experimental Physics and Elementary Mathematics from 1902 until 1917 and he was the director of a large publisher of scientific materials Mathesis.
* Kagan was the first Head of Department and he founded an important School of Differential Geometry.
* In 1927, Kagan organised a seminar on vector and tensor analysis.
* In 1934 Kagan and other members of his School organised an International conference on differential geometry which took place at Moscow University.
* Kagan worked on the foundations of geometry and his first work was on Lobachevsky's geometry.
* Kagan studied tensor differential geometry after going to Moscow because of an interest in relativity.
* Kagan wrote a history of non-euclidean geometry and also a detailed biography of Lobachevsky.
