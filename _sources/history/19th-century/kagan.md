On Lobachevsky's geometry. In 1902 he proposed axioms and definitions very different from <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hilbert/">Hilbert</a>. Kagan studied tensor differential geometry after going to Moscow because of an interest in relativity. He wrote a history of non-euclidean geometry and also a detailed biography of Lobachevsky. He edited Lobachevsky's complete works which appeared in five volumes between 1946 and 1951.

Born 10 March 1869 Shavli, Kovno (now Kaunas, Lithuania). Died 8 May 1953 Moscow, USSR.
