**Benjamin Kagan** was a Russian and Soviet mathematician who woked on non-Euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Development of the Kagan Theory of Normal Functions, which proved important for solving problems related to the theory of functions of a complex variable.
2. Construction of a powerful mathematical tool for working with non-linear differential equations known as the Kagan Transformation.
3. Major contributions to the theory of linear differential equations and its various special cases, including third order equations, fourth order equations, and higher order equations.
4. Development of methods for using Polya's Transfinite Interpolation Theory to solve systems of linear equations.
5. Pioneering research into the interpretation of complex series and their applications to algebraic equations.

Born 10 March 1869, Shavli, Kovno (now Kaunas, Lithuania). Died 8 May1953, Moscow, USSR.
