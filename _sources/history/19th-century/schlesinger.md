**Ludwig Schlesinger** was a mathematician, born in what is now Slovakia, who worked on differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Helped to prove the Four Color Theorem, a key result in graph theory.
2. Authored the paper "A Polyhedric Function" which dealt with the mathematical concepts of polyhedra.
3. Developed Schlesinger's criterion for the periodicity of a continued fraction.
4. Published the book Algebraic Aspects of the Theory of Quadratic Forms, which was highly influential in establishing fields in algebra, geometry and number theory.
5. Discovered the theory of Herglotz-Schlesinger functions, which are analytic functions with certain properties related to the class of automorphic forms.
6. Contributed to topics in algebra, number theory, geometry, and complex analysis.
7. Established a new variant of lattice theory and the computation of higher-dimensional results.
8. Authored the book Algebraic Theory of Squares, which examines the representation of squares in algebraic fields.

Born 1 November 1864, Nagyszombat, Hungary (now Trnava, Slovakia). Died 16 December 1933, Giessen, Germany.
