**Theodor Reye** worked in Geometry and Projective Geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of the relationship between surface temperature and air pressure in 1888, which later became known as the Reye-Kelvin equation. 
2. Developed a concept of local energy balance which answered questions about the Earth's overall radiation budget and was the basis for several subsequent energy balance models. 
3. Pioneered and popularized some of the earliest defect-tolerant error-correcting codes, which are still in use by modern computers. 
4. In harnessing and applying new mathematics techniques to atmospheric measurement challenges, Reye demonstrated the potential of applied mathematics in a wide range of disciplines. 
5. Developed a theory of ocean waves which was one of the earliest attempts to understand the motions of large areas of water and has been used by engineers and scientists ever since. 
6. Examined the structure of glaciers, recognizing the implications they had on climate and hydrologic processes. 
7. Became the first to formalize the concept of twice-daily variation in atmospheric pressure commonly known as the semi-diurnal tide. 
8. Influenced the early works of modern physics by applying mathematical principles to derive physical laws. 
9. Established important correlations between air pressure and temperature which are still relevant for modern weather forecasting.

Born 20 June 1838, Ritzebüttel, near Cuxhaven, Germany. Died 2 July 1919, Würzburg, Germany.
