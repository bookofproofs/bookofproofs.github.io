**Heinrich Friedrich Weber** was a German physicist who was important in the history of the Zürich Polytechnic. His most famous student was Einstein.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Weber–Hermite Constant D(h) in 1885, laying the foundation for the theory of the Weber–Hermite differential equation.
2. Developed the Weber–Strass Transform in 1891, consuming a lifetime of work in just a few months.
3. Established the Weber equations and Weber's principle in large numbers in 1892, furthering the development of number theory.
4. Published a monograph on elliptic functions in 1895 which Albert Einstein drew upon in his 1905 paper on the special Theory of Relativity.
5. Demonstrated a simple proof of the imaginary number i in a 1897 paper. 
6. Authored a book on the theory of algebraic functions in 1898.
7. Proposed Weber Groups in 1906, which today play an important role in algebraic geometry and number theory.
8. Proposed Weber’s Law (named after him) in 1908, which states that the explanation of certain phenomena is largely determined by the magnitude of associated stimuli.

Born 7 November 1843, Magdala, Thuringia, Germany. Died 24 May1912, Zürich, Switzerland.
