**Lord Raleigh** (John Strutt) was an English scientist who worked on the theory of waves. He became the Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge and was awarded the Nobel prize for the discovery of the gas Argon.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Refined thewave theory of light developed by Fresnel and Young, which explained the interference phenomenon of light and provided the basis of the modern understanding of optics. 
2. Improved the theories of elasticity and the elastic line proposed by Germain. 
3. Developed the Law of Diminishing Returns in 1834, a principle that is fundamental to the understanding of economic behaviour. 
4. Developed the Law of Diffusion which described the movement of heat in a medium through successive layers, later known as Fourier's Law. 
5. Discovered that the thermal conductivity of a gas (its ability to conduct heat) depends on the pressure. 
6. Discovered the phenomenon of thermal emission, now known as black-body radiation, which was later explained by Planck's law. 
7. Constructed accurate barometric pressure readings by developing the first digital barometer. 
8. Established the existence of an ionosphere in the upper atmosphere in the 1930s and described the properties of its various layers. 
9. Demonstrated experimentally that the electric force between two charged particles diminishes according to an inverse square law. 
10. Developed mathematical techniques to calculate the motion of a moving particle in a resistive medium, known as the Strutt-Stokes methods.

Born 12 November 1842, Langford Grove (near Maldon), Essex, England. Died 30 June 1919, Terling Place, Witham, Essex, England.
