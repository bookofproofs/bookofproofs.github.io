**Charles Fox** was an English mathematician who worked on hypergeometric functions, integral transforms, integral equations, the theory of statistical distributions, and the mathematics of navigation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Charles was brought up in London where he attended Coopers Company School in Bow Road, an ancient institution founded around 1536.
* The headmaster of the school while Charles studied there was S Elford.
* While at this school, Charles won a scholarship to the City of London School situated on the Victoria Embankment.
* Edwin Abbott had been educated at this school and served as its headmaster for 24 years but had retired many years before Fox studied there.
* Fox, again having won a scholarship, entered Sidney Sussex College Cambridge in 1915.
* Fox only remained at Imperial College for one year before being appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics in Birkbeck College, part of the University of London, in 1920.
* Fox had useful discussions with George Jeffery who was the professor of Pure Mathematics at University College, London, and in his next paper The Asymptotic Expansion of Generalized Hypergeometric Functions (1928) he thanked George Jeffery for his assistance.
* Fox was awarded a D.Sc. by the University of London in 1928.
* Fox's main contributions were on hypergeometric functions, integral transforms, integral equations, the theory of statistical distributions, and the mathematics of navigation.
* Among the honours that Fox received, we mention in particular that he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1961 and was awarded an honorary LL.D. degree by Concordia University in 1976.

Born 17 March 1897, London, England. Died 30 April 1977, Montreal, Canada.
