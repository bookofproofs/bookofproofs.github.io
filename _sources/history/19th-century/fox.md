**Charles Fox** was an English mathematician who worked on hypergeometric functions, integral transforms, integral equations, the theory of statistical distributions, and the mathematics of navigation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed two algorithms, one concerning the ordering of equations, and another solving the common system of linear equations.
2. He wrote a paper on matrix algebra and distribution theory which was highly acclaimed.
3. He invented the generalized inverses of matrices, which are used in various areas of mathematics.
4. He developed a method for calculating the derivatives of matrix functions, making calculus more accessible to mathematicians.
5. He worked on the theory of Diophantine equations and presented solutions in his famous paper, "On the Foundations of Algebraic Notions and their Applications".
6. He developed the theory of composition of variance, which allowed for the accurate statistical analysis of data.
7. He formulated the hereditary concept of matrix multiplication, which set the foundation for the theory of linear algebra.
8. He solved the problem of simultaneous linear equations and presented a solution in his paper, "On the Aims and Methods in the Theory of Equations".
9. He solved the problem of multiple linear equations in his book, "Solution of Finite Equations and Matrix Theory".
10. He formulated ways to reach solutions to a system of linear equations without the need of Gaussian elimination.

Born 17 March 1897, London, England. Died 30 April 1977, Montreal, Canada.
