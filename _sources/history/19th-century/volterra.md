**Vito Volterra** published papers on partial differential equations, particularly the equation of cylindrical waves. His most famous work was done on integral equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed the Volterra Integral Equation, a significant mathematical tool used in the analysis and modelling of dynamic systems.
2. He was a pioneer in the field of functional analysis and introduced fundamental ideas, techniques and results in the study of operator equations and integro-differential equations.
3. He was a prominent contributor to the theory of partial differential equations of mathematical physics.
4. He laid the foundations of mathematical ecology by applying mathematics to biological population models.
5. He was the first to propose a mathematical equation to describe the competition between two species called the Lotka-Volterra equation.
6. He formulated the critical points of the second variation of a functional, known as the Euler-Lagrange equations, which are important in mathematical physics. 
7. He produced a classification of irreversible processes that form the basis of thermodynamics.
8. He founded the research field of mathematical psychology, which uses quantitative models to both describe and explain behaviour. 
9. He was an influential teacher who produced over 100 doctoral students, many of whom went on to become famous mathematicians.

Born 3 May1860, Ancona, Papal States (now Italy). Died 11 October 1940, Rome, Italy.
