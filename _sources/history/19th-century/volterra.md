**Vito Volterra** published papers on partial differential equations, particularly the equation of cylindrical waves. His most famous work was done on integral equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The name Volterra comes from the Tuscan town of Volterra where one of Vito's ancestor moved in the 15th  century, having originally come from Bologna.
* One of the Volterras had opened a bank in Florence while other members of the family were writers, collectors of books and manuscripts, and travellers.
* They had lived in various different cities but from the 18th  century there were Volterras living in Ancona.
* Vito, his parents' only child, named after his maternal grandfather, was born at exactly the time (May 1860) when Giuseppe Garibaldi set out to conquer Sicily and Naples and so to create a unified Italy.
* Vito, aged about three months, was in his cradle when a missile fell close by destroying the cradle yet, by good fortune, baby Vito survived.
* His father Abramo  died when Vito was only two years old.
* The family was left without any means of financial support and only survived because Alfonso Almagià, a brother of Vito's mother, took care of them.
* They all moved from Ancona to Terni in the autumn of 1863 when Alfonso worked there for a railway company but in January 1865 he became an official with the Banco d'Italia in Turin and at this stage Vito and his mother returned to Ancona.
* After only a short stay in Turin, Alfonso moved to Florence where he continued to work for the bank, and Vito and his mother joined him there.
* It was in this city that Vito spent most of his childhood, although he returned to Ancona for some long family visits, and it was in Florence that he received his education.
* After elementary school, Vito studied at the lower secondary Dante Alighieri Technical School and later he spent three years at the Galileo Galilei Technical Institute in Florence.
* Since his family were extremely poor, there was pressure on Vito to leave the Galileo Galilei Technical Institute after one year of study and take a job.
* Alfonso put pressure on Vito to join Edoardo's firm but Edoardo kept delaying to allow Vito to continue his education.
* One of Vito's mathematics teachers at the Galileo Galilei Technical Institute was Cesare Arzelà and he quickly realised that Vito was an extremely talented mathematician.
* The physics teacher, Antonio Ròiti (1843-1921), became another important ally in Vito's bid to continue his education.
* Ròiti offered Vito a position teaching physics at the Istituto di Studi Superiori e di Perfezionamento in Florence in 1877, so managing to prevent him from being forced by Alfonso to take a job at the Banco d'Italia.
* Volterra was able to proceed to the University of Pisa in the autumn of 1878, enrolling in the faculty of Science.
* Volterra published three papers in 1881 before graduating, one on mathematical physics Sul potenziale di un' elissoide eterogenea sopra sè stessa Ⓣ(On the potential of a heterogeneous ellipsoid upon itself) and two on analysis, Alcune osservazioni sulle funzioni punteggiate discontinue Ⓣ(Some remarks on discontinued dotted functions), on pointwise discontinuous functions, and Sui principii del calcolo integrale Ⓣ(On principles of the integral calculus) which became important in the development of the history of integration.
* His thesis on hydrodynamics, Sopra alcuni problemi di idrodinami Ⓣ(On some problems in hydrodynamics), included some results of George Stokes, which Volterra had discovered later but independently.
* After graduating with his laurea, Volterra was appointed as Betti's assistant in December 1882.
* Volterra's mother Angelica had continued to live with her brother Alfonso while Volterra studied at Pisa and she continued to live in Florence until 1887 when she moved to Pisa and set up home with Volterra.
* During these years while holding a chair at Pisa, Volterra had made a number of trips abroad.
* This proved an important event since it saw Volterra become a significant member of the international mathematical community.
* Pisa tried to entice him to stay, while Turin tried hard to persuade him to accept their offer which Volterra eventually did.
* The dispute did nothing to harm Volterra's reputation, if anything he came out of it rather well, and he continued to receive honours for his contributions.
* The next International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Paris in August 1900 and Volterra was invited to give one of the four plenary lectures; he gave the lecture Betti, Brioschi, Casorati - Trois analystes italiens et trois manières d'envisager les questions d'analyse Ⓣ(Betti, Brioschi, Casorati - Three Italian analysts and three ways of looking at questions of analysis).
* By the time Volterra gave his lecture in Paris he was married.
* They spent their honeymoon in Switzerland visiting places that Volterra knew from his visit for the International Congress in 1897.
* Volterra took up the appointment in Rome in November 1900 and, in the following year, gave his inaugural lecture Sui tentativi di applicazione delle matematiche alle scienze biologiche e sociali Ⓣ(On  attempts to apply mathematics to the biological and social sciences) which discussed applications of mathematics to the biological and social sciences.
* Let us continue to give Vito and Virginia Volterra's other children: Edoardo (born 1904), Enrico (born 1905), Gustavo (born 1906 but died after a few months) and Gustavo (born 1909).
* Volterra was not in Rome when some of these children were born since to travelled much over these years.
* Volterra conceived the idea of a theory of functions which depend on a continuous set of values of another function in 1883.
* Hadamard was later to introduce the word 'functional' which replaced Volterra's original terminology.
* In 1890 Volterra showed by means of his functional calculus that the theory of Hamilton and Jacobi for the integration of the differential equations of dynamics could be extended to other problems of mathematical physics.
* During the years 1892 to 1894 Volterra published papers on partial differential equations, particularly the equation of cylindrical waves.
* He began this study in 1884 and in 1896 he published papers on what is now called 'an integral equation of Volterra type'.
* Actually the name "functional" was introduced later by Hadamard and has now replaced Volterra's original nomenclature.
* In developing this theory Volterra already followed a principle which guided him through many discoveries and which he called the passage from the discrete to the continuous.
* It was this principle which he applied to his celebrated researches on integral equations of Volterra's type.
* Volterra spoke out strongly against Italy honouring its treaty with the Central Powers.
* Volterra became a lieutenant in the corps of engineers and was sent to the Central Institute of Aeronautics.
* In other words he was interested in a mathematical theory of the "survival of the fittest." While there are today other methods of a stochastic nature, the work of Volterra still exerts a dominant influence on several modern and quite recent developments in mathematical biology.
* Volterra fought against the Fascists in the Italian Parliament but continued to be a leading figure being elected the first president of the Italian National Council for Research in 1923 and, in the same year, elected president of the Accademia dei Lincei.
* By 1926 the Fascists had abolished all opposition parties and Volterra felt he could not continue with these two roles, and resigned as president.
* By 1928 elections to Parliament had been abolished and the police began constructing a file on Volterra as being "politically suspect".
* When Volterra refused to take the oath of allegiance to the Fascist Government in 1931, which was required of all tenured and contracted professors, he was forced to leave the University of Rome.
* By this time, two of Volterra's sons held university positions and they were deprived of these by the racial laws.
* Volterra advised his sons to go abroad and try to start a new life there.
* Volterra was offered an honorary degree by the University of St Andrews in 1938 but, although he wished to come, his doctor did not allow him to travel to Scotland to receive it.

Born 3 May 1860, Ancona, Papal States (now Italy). Died 11 October 1940, Rome, Italy.
