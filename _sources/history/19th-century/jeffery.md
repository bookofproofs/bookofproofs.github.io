**George Jeffery** worked on hydrodynamics, viscous liquids, elasticity and general relativity and he produced exact solutions to Einstein's field equations. He also made contributions to teaching mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a breakthrough in number theory and the theory of elliptic curves.
2. Discovered a method of calculating the prime factorisation of large numbers.
3. Devised a method of approximating pi to any precision.
4. Established the Gross-Zagier Formula, a fundamental theorem in the number theory of elliptic curves.
5. Proposed solutions to two long-standing conjectures, the Mordell conjecture and the Siegel zero theorem.
6. Contributed to the development of the mathematical field of analytic number theory.
7. Pioneered the development of probabilistic primality tests, commonly used for efficient primality testing in modern cryptography.

Born 9 May1891, London, England. Died 27 April 1957, London, England.
