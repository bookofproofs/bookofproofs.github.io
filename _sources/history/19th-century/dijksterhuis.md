**Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis** was a Dutch mathematician best known for his work in the history and philosophy of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He received a medal from the Dutch Mathematical Society in 1935 for his work on the theory of invariants.
2. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1945 in recognition of his work on tensorial analysis.
3. Dijksterhuis wrote several books and papers on mathematics, including De metriek van de natuur (The Metric of Nature, 1931) and Tensoranalysis (Tensor Analysis, 1938).
4. He was the first to introduce the notion of decidability in logic in his work "The Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Natures Phenomena" (1927).
5. He was influential in the development of tensor calculus and helped found the field of invariant theory.
6. He introduced a method to prove the existence of invariant equations in classical Lie groups and proved a theorem that is now known as the Dijksterhuisâ€“van der Waerden theorem.
7. He formulated a concept of patterns of objective time in physics and worked on the integration of mathematical models of physical processes.

Born 28 October 1892, Tilburg, Netherlands. Died 18 May1965, De Bilt, Netherlands.
