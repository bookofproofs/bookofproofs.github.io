**Cesare Arzelà** was an Italian mathematician best known for his work in the theory of functions of a real variable.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He introduced the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem in 1902, which is an important theorem in real analysis. 
2. He was the first to use Lebesgue integrals, which greatly extended the area of integration. 
3. He helped develop the set-valued functions that also extend the realm of integration. 
4. He proved the fundamental theorem of calculus, which states that a continuous function can be integrated by the calculus of variations. 
5. He founded important concepts of modern analysis such as uniform convergence and relative compactness. 
6. He was among the first to develop the elements of descriptive set theory, the modern form of Cantor's Theorem. 
7. He identified the significant strings of the Borel–Lebesgue theorem, which are now used in modern statistics. 
8. He introduced the concept of a compact subset in topology as a tool for studying properties of continua. 
9. He is credited with the development of the study of topological spaces. 
10. He provided major contributions to the field of measure theory and areas of modern analysis.

Born 6 March 1847, Santo Stefano di Magra, La Spezia (now Italy). Died 15 March 1912, Santo Stefano di Magra, La Spezia, Italy.
