**John James Waterston**  was a Scottish physicist who worked in the kinetic theory of gases.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the framework for calculus, which formed the foundation of calculus for many later scientists.
2. Published an important paper on the role of mathematicians in society that helped shape philosophical debates about the value of mathematical thought.
3. Developed the first abstract model of physical space, laying the groundwork for later advancements in geometry and topology.
4. Developed methods for solving equations and polynomials which became the basis for modern mathematical analysis.
5. Pioneered the early use of Newton's calculus and the analytical geometry of Descartes.
6. First to show that complex numbers can be used to solve polynomial equations, a key result in algebraic analysis.
7. Proved that Euclid's postulates were complete and consistent, thus giving a foundation to the entire field of geometry and setting the stage for the development of non-Euclidean geometry.
8. Proposed a unified field theory that combined the principles of Newtonian and Leibnizian calculus and presented a consistent explanation of the laws of motion.

Born 1811, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 18 June 1883, Edinburgh, Scotland.
