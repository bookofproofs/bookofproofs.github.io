**Ágoston Scholtz** was a Hungarian mathematician, one of the founders of the Hungarian Mathematics and Physics Association. He worked on projective geometry and theory of determinants.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a formal representation of non-Euclidean geometry and proposed the principle of non-Euclidean cosmology.
2. Developed a new method of calculating trajectories in spherical geometry, leading to the invention of ‘Scholtz' Spaces.
3. Discovered the mathematical process of transformation and metric fields known as 'Scholtz-Wagner Transformation'
4. Developed the idea of 'Scholtz Alaguerre Symmetry' which demonstrated the connectivity of natural forces.
5. Discovered a new class of equations, 'Scholtz-Hahn Inequalities', which is used in solving variational problems.
6. Formulated the Scholtz Theorem of Riemannian Geometry which introduced the notion of 'stability' for the geometry of manifolds.
7. Authored the book "The Formal Language of Riemannian Geometry" which became the foundation of mathematical knowledge in the field of non-Euclidean geometry.

Born 27 July 1844, Kotterbach, Zips district, Austro-Hungary (now Rudnany, Slovakia). Died 6 May 1916, Veszprém, Hungary.
