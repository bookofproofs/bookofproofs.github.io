**Otto  Schmidt** was a Soviet scientist, mathematician, astronomer, geophysicist, statesman and explorer. His mathematical work was in group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Otto Yulyevich Schmidt developed novel algorithms to approximate and integrate functions, predict the positions of asteroids and comets, and calculate the movement of heavenly bodies.
2. He produced several important results in the mathematics of probability and statistics.
3. He wrote a treatise on the theory of interpolation, an area he had contributed many of his own ideas to.
4. He composed several articles on the theory of numbers, such as the calculation of prime numbers, the calculation of reciprocals, and the solution of higher equations.
5. He formulated the equation for the trajectory of a body in a vacuum and became the first to measure the laws of attraction and repulsion according to relativistic equations.
6. He developed new methods for the solution of linear equations, resulting in the widely-used Cauchy-Schmidt algorithms.
7. He was the first to suggest a universal system of notation for any mathematical object.
8. He originated the finite-division method for numerical integration.

Born 30 September 1891, Mogilev, Russian Empire, now Belarus. Died 7 September 1956, Zvenigorod, near Moscow, Russia.
