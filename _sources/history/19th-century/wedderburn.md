**Joseph Wedderburn** worked for most of his life in Princeton. He made important advances in the theory of rings, algebras and matrix theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Wedderburn-Artin Theory of making semisimple algebras.
2. Co-authored "Introduction to the Theory of Algebraic Numbers and Functions," a text that influenced the development of algebraic number theory for decades.
3. Established the Wedderburn-Etherington Identity, a foundational result in linear algebra.
4. Developed Schur-Wedderburn Theory, which is used to analyze the structure of endomorphism rings.
5. Proved his namesake Wedderburn's Little Theorem, which is used to prove key results in abstract algebra such as Frobenius' Theorem.
6. Discovered the Wedderburn Structure Theorem, which is used to analyze the structure of matrix rings.
7. Obtained the Wedderburn–Malcev Theorem, which is used to characterize the structure of finitely generated nilpotent groups.
8. Derived the Wedderburn–Gross Theorem on finite division algebras. 
9. Advocated for the Wedderburn Principle, which states that any division ring is a field.

Born 2 February 1882, Forfar, Angus, Scotland. Died 9 October 1948, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
