**Robert Richard Anstice**  was an English clergyman and mathematician who wrote two remarkable papers on combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for calculating and publishing exact values of the mathematical constant pi.
2. Broke new ground in applied mathematics with his work on the properties of conic sections.
3. Pioneered the use of analytical geometry to solve problems in physics.
4. Investigated parametric equations and their application to the calculus of variations. 
5. Established an early form of the calculus of finite differences.
6. Pioneered the use of symbolic algebra in mathematics.
7. Published major works on the lunar theory and the theory of gravity.
8. Explored the relationship between multiple variables and their transformations.
9. Formulated the mean speed theorem and employed it to analyze the motions of heavenly bodies.
10. Developed a method for solving polynomial equations of degree higher than four.

Born 9 April 1813, Madeley, Shropshire, England. Died 17 December 1853, Wigginton (near Tring), Hertfordshire, England.
