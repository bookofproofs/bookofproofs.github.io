**François Cosserat**  was a French engineer and mathematician known by his theories about deformable bodies written with his brother Eugène.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* François-Constant had three sons, François-Nicolas (the subject of this biography), Lucien-Constant, and Eugène Cosserat (who also has a biography in this archive).
* François-Nicolas, born in 1852, was the eldest of the sons, Lucien-Constant, born in 1856, was the middle son, while Eugène, born in 1866, was the youngest and twelve years younger than his eldest brother François.
* François Cosserat entered the École Polytechnique in 1870 when his youngest brother Eugène, with whom he would later collaborate, was only four years old.
* The examination for entry to the École Polytechnique was highly competitive and François was ranked twenty-sixth among the successful candidates in that year.
* Along with seventeen other graduates from the École Polytechnique, Cosserat opted to continue his training at the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées.
* In 1878, Cosserat married; the only child of the marriage was a daughter Amélie Adèle who married the marine engineer Édouard-Victor Davaux (1876-1950).
* Cosserat became a Railway Engineer Second Class (Northern Zone) in 1879.
* The details we have given show that Cosserat had a highly successful career as a civil engineer.
* Of course, his brother Eugène Cosserat was an academic in Toulouse and François Cosserat published many outstanding joint works with his brother.
* It is tempting to believe, therefore, that Eugène Cosserat would be the major player in their joint research but this would be far from the truth.
* In fact during the period of their close collaboration, Eugène Cosserat was burdened by heavy administrative tasks and was only a very minor contributor.
* the main creative mechanical ideas (the most striking behind the computations) have been furnished by François, while Eugène, overburdened by management tasks at the Observatory of Toulouse, was just rectifying the computations.
* For example, the report written on 27 June 1898 states, "M François Cosserat is a distinguished engineer who has high practical experience.
* In addition to his normal position, he devotes himself to theoretical studies and he recently presented to the Académie des Sciences remarkable works on mechanics." The report of 11 October 1910 states, "M François Cosserat is a valued collaborator, highly efficient, especially in public works.
* Cosserat began his mathematical studies considering a theory of elasticity but went on to consider broad questions concerning mechanics particularly relating to gravitational, electrical and thermal phenomena.
* This work was carried out in collaboration with his brother, Eugène Cosserat, who was, at the time the collaboration began, professor of differential and integral calculus at the University of Toulouse.
* This collaboration between the two Cosserat brothers began in 1896 with the publication Théorie de l'élasticité Ⓣ(Elasticity Theory).
* By the early 1900s both Cosserat brothers were devoting all their research efforts towards working on mechanics.
* The Cosserats themselves recognised the value of oriented two-dimensional continua (i.e., curves and surfaces endowed with additional structure in the form of directors) for representing the deformations of rods and shells respectively.
* Exceptions are also colleagues of Eugène Cosserat in Toulouse, like L Ray and A Buhl.
* Relativity Theory and Quantum Physics overtook this period in science and the work of E and F Cosserat was almost rediscovered after 1950 because of the use of liquid crystals.
* In addition to his mathematical research, François Cosserat made other contributions to mathematics through his expertise in languages.
* François Cosserat also began translating Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics (1902) by J Willard Gibbs from English to French but died before completing the task.
* The Cosserat brothers François and Eugène also collaborated in translating the article on mechanics from the German Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften Ⓣ(Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences) for a French version of this monumental classic work.
* After François Cosserat died, Ernest Vessiot succeeded him as President of the Société Mathématique de France.
* It is now clear that the qualities that Vessiot saw so clearly in their joint work were almost all due to François Cosserat.

Born 26 October 1852, Douai, France. Died 22 March 1914, France.
