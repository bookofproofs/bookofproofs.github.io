**François Cosserat**  was a French engineer and mathematician known by his theories about deformable bodies written with his brother Eugène.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a three-dimensional family of material elements to model solid bodies under external forces.
2. Developed a mathematical theory of structured bodies that unified the ideas of Solid Mechanics, Elasticity and the Mechanics of Continuous Media.
3. Pioneered the mathematical formulation of the strain active forces in elasticity with his rigidities theory.
4. Established the foundations of the kinematics of material points and of the kinetic theory of deformable bodies.
5. Developed analytical methods to solve the elasticity and mechanics problems in a structured body.
6. Proved that a finite number of unknown functions was needed to solve the equations of motion of a three-dimensional continuous medium.
7. Demonstrated that the Cosserat guess of a strain active “Couple Stress” constituent was realistic.
8. Demonstrated that the mechanics of structured solids follows the same rules of continuum medium and showed rigidity curves.

Born 26 October 1852, Douai, France. Died 22 March 1914, France.
