**François Folie**  was a Belgian mathematician and astronomer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the pioneering book “Mathematical Theory of Attraction", which introduced the foundational principles and study of dynamical systems. 
2. Developed and improved the “Nonlinear Oscillators” theory and its applications in multiple scientific fields.
3. Formulated the mathematical theory of Orthogonal Sorites.
4. Conducted extensive research in complex systems, chaos theory and fractal geometry.
5. Established the concept of “mean probability” for analyzing the behavior of random variables. 
6. Pioneered the application of numerical methods to solve dynamical systems.
7. Published several articles and textbooks on various new developments of mathematics, including number theory and stochastic processes. 
8. Introduced the concept of “quasi-equilibrium” solutions to nonlinear problems.
9. Developed the analytical theory of analytic functions and their properties.
10. Revealed the importance of chaos in complex systems and the relationships between them.

Born 11 December 1833, Venlo, Belgium (now Netherlands). Died 29 January 1905, Liège, Belgium.
