**Christian Wiener** was a German mathematician, physicist and philosopher. He was the first person to identify qualitatively the molecular cause of Brownian motion.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Wiener-Hopf Method of solving partial differential equations.
2. Developed the Wiener Tauberian Theorem of Fourier Series.
3. Conducted major research in Fourier analysis, integral equations, and probability theory.
4. Developed the Wiener-Kolmogorov theorem of linear systems theory.
5. Solved the Dirichlet problem and developed his famous Tauberian theory.
6. Proved the Wiener-Levy theorem, a cornerstone of probability theory.
7. Formulated the Wiener-Kintchine theorem, which played a key role in establishing the modern theory of filters.
8. Developed the Wiener-Khinchin theorem in spectral analysis.
9. Established the Wiener-LÃ©vy theorem for random processes.
10. Discovered the discrete version of the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, now known as the Wiener-Kintchine-Slutsky Theorem.

Born 7 December 1826, Darmstadt, Germany. Died 31 July 1896, Karlsruhe, Germany.
