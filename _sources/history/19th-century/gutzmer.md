**August Gutzmer** was a German mathematician who worked on differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Gutzmer had not studied foreign languages at school so he did not gain the required passes in his final examinations to obtain university entrance.
* Among those who lectured to Gutzmer in mathematics were L Kronecker, K Weierstrass and L Fuchs.
* Gutzmer, therefore studied with two of the three great Berlin mathematicians, Kronecker and Weierstrass, in the last years of their careers.
* However the manor was sold and the couple moved to Berlin where Gutzmer was an assistant at the Technischen Hochschule of Charlottenburg.
* From 1 October 1894 to 9 January 1895 Gutzmer was in the army but dismissed as being unfit for duty.
* On 3 August 1905 Gutzmer took up an appointment to an ordinary professorship at the University of Halle-Wittenberg.
* Highly gifted as a teacher, showing infectious enthusiasm for his topic, Gutzmer taught courses on a wide variety of topics including differential and integral calculus, and analytic geometry at lower level.
* Gutzmer received many honours.

Born 2 February 1860, Neu-Roddahn, near Neustadt an der Dosse, Prussia (now Germany). Died 10 May 1924, Halle, Germany.
