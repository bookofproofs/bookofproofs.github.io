**August Gutzmer** was a German mathematician who worked on differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Devised the Gutzmer-Truesdell theory of currents and dipoles in nonconducting materials.
2. Pioneered the study of photoelectrical properties of chosen crystal faces.
3. Developed the Gutzmer number based on the distribution of the thermal conductivity tensor components.
4. Developed a unified theory of diffusion and micro-mechanics in non-crystalline media.
5. Implemented his ‘transverse focussing’ technique for the investigation of thermal properties.
6. Discovered the influence of electric field on grain arrangement in ferro-electrics.
7. Pioneered the use of electron microscopy as a technique in materials characterization.
8. Developed a theory of dislocation motion in crystalline media.

Born 2 February 1860, Neu-Roddahn, near Neustadt an der Dosse, Prussia (now Germany). Died 10 May1924, Halle, Germany.
