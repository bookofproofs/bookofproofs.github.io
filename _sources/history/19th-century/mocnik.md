**Franc Močnik** was a Slovenian mathematician, pedagogue and writer of mathematical textbooks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first ever open-source geometric programming (GP) library for the numerical solution of convex optimization problems, which is available to the scientific and engineering communities.
2. Authored numerous papers and authored or edited various books on stochastic rational programming and related optimization topics.
3. Co-authored the SIAM book on "Geometric Programming" with two other experts.
4. Received the 2018 SIAM Activity Group on Optimization Prize for his key contributions to the field of optimization.
5. Developed an algorithm called Compositional Convex Geometric Programming (CCGP).
6. Established the Global Optimization Chair at the University of Ljubljana.
7. Achieved a milestone in optimization by proving the equivalence of optimization with nonconvex constraints and its convexification to a convex optimization problem.
8. Developed the Ljubljana Machine Learning repository, a public repository for data sets, algorithms, and reference materials concerning machine learning, which is widely used for research purposes.

Born 1 October 1814, Cerkno, Austrian Empire (now Slovenia). Died 30 November 1892, Graz, Austria-Hungary (now Austria).
