**Mario Pieri** was an Italian mathematician who worked in projective geometry and the foundations of geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Mario Pieri formulated the arithmetization of analysis, which opened up a new way of treating the foundations of mathematics.
2. He made significant contributions to the theory of invariants and the theory of linear algebraic groups.
3. He proposed the theory of hyperelliptic theta functions, which he used to study the number of solutions of algebraic equations and the structure of algebraic curves.
4. He proved that non-singular theorems in invariant theory could be reduced to the case of the binary forms, a theorem known as the fundamental theorem of algebraic covariants.
5. He wrote the landmark work Theoria Generale delle Equazioni Algebriche, which is still one of the authoritative introductions to the theory of equations and invariant theory.
6. He further developed the theory of algebraic curves, giving a classification of all algebraic curves of any degree, as well as laying the foundations for the development of algebraic geometry.

Born 22 June 1860, Lucca, Tuscany (now Italy). Died 1 March 1913, S Andrea di Compito (near Lucca), Tuscany, Italy.
