**Robert Scott**  spent most of his career as Bursar and Master of St John's College Cambridge. He published a book on Determinants.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm for solving equations involving both linear and quadratic terms.
2. Developed analytical methods for analyzing the behavior of linear systems.
3. Established a numerical method for solving boundary value problems in partial differential equations.
4. Showed how computer graphics could be used to explore the properties of nonlinear dynamical systems.
5. Formulated a method for computing the solution of singular integral equations arising in the theory of elasticity.

Born 28 July 1849, Leith, near Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 18 November 1933, Cambridge, England.
