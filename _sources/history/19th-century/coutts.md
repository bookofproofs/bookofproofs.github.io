**William Coutts** graduated from Edinburgh University and after a period in the Army in World War I he became interested in the mathematical theory of artillery. He became a Professor at the Military College of Science at Shrivenham.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His mother was  Elizabeth Martin Barron (born in St Cuthberts, Edinburgh about 1857).
* He had two younger brothers, Alexander (born about 1888) and Robert (born about 1888).
* William B Coutts' home was at Green Croft, Kinghorn.
* He first matriculated at Edinburgh University in October 1904.
* In his first year he took Latin and Mathematics, failing both subjects in April 1905, but passing them in the October resits.
* His second year was slightly more successful since he passed Natural Philosophy and English at the first attempt in April 1906 but failed Logic and Metaphysics.
* He sat the examination in Logic and Metaphysics at the resit in October 1906 but, despite improving his performance from 25% to 40%, he failed again.
* He passed Logic and Metaphysics at the third attempt in April 1907, achieving a comfortable pass at 58%.
* He also took three attempts to pass Chemistry, failing in July 1907 and April 1908, but passing in July 1908.
* He took Honours courses in Mathematics, Analytical Dynamics, Thermodynamics, and Advanced Experimental Physics between summer 1906 and 1909, but graduated M.A. without Honours in 1909.
* He was awarded a B.Sc. (Pure) by the University of Edinburgh in 1912.
* After graduating, Coutts taught at George Heriot's School, Edinburgh.
* He was commissioned in 1915 to the Royal Garrison Artillery and served at Gibraltar.
* The Royal Garrison Artillery dealt with coastal defence, mountain, siege and heavy batteries, and was responsible for ammunition storage and supply.
* It was during this period that Coutts became interested in mathematical questions relating to firing.
* He married Isabella Muirhead Allan (Chorlton, Lancashire, 1884-1973).
* William Baron Coutts was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 1 December 1913.
* He was proposed for the fellowship by Ralph Allan Sampson, John Brown Clark, Cargill Gilston Knott, and James Robert Milne.
* His obituary, written by J R H Whiston, appeared in the Royal Society of Edinburgh Year Book (1948-1949), page 12.
* Born at Kinghorn, Fifeshire, on May 26, 1885, he was educated at Edinburgh University and after a period as a schoolmaster was commissioned in 1915 to the R.G.A. (S.R.).
* He served at Gibraltar, and it was his work on the Rock which created his lifelong interest in the problems of fire direction and control.
* In 1917 he was recalled to join the 35th  Advanced Class and after completing the course and obtaining the p.a.c. - a distinction of which he was very proud - he was appointed first Instructor and then Senior Lecturer in Range Finding at the College.
* In 1938 he was promoted to be Assistant Professor of Fire Control Instruments, a position which he held until his death.
* He was also a member of the Council of the Optical Society and for a period of five years was one of its Honorary Secretaries.
* He was for many years a regular contributor on Optical Instruments in the Journal of Scientific Instruments.
* He was beloved alike by his colleagues and students, to whom he was universally known as "Willie", and his gift of dry Scotch humour enlivened many otherwise dreary conferences and lectures.
* His specialised knowledge of optical and fire control instruments, and his ability to teach the subjects to technical officers will be a great loss.
* He is one of quite a number who attended the 1913 Edinburgh Mathematical Colloquium held in Edinburgh during the week beginning Monday 4th  August 1913, then applied for membership of the Society.
* After he became a Professor at the Military College of Science, he left the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.
