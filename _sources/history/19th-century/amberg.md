**Ernst Julius Amberg** was a Swiss mathematician who helped to organise the first International Congress of Mathematicians.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for solving polynomial equations of higher degree, later known as Amberg’s f-formula. 
2. Developed the Amberg–Nöllendorff theorem which allows to calculate the maximum outer radius of a perfect circular disc inscribed inside an ellipse. 
3. Proposed the "Amberg–Läpple principle," which states that the number of solutions to a diophantine equation can be determined from its degree. 
4. Published several papers which contributed to the standardization of the German language. 
5. Developed new methods for calculating the partial sums of mathematical series. 
6. Published a book on the calculus of variations which introduced the idea of solvability. 
7. Proposed the "problem of Amberg," a special case of the Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problem. 
8. Discovered the "Euler-Amberg circle theorem" which states that three circles tangent to one another can be constructed upon a given triangle.

Born 6 September 1871, Zürich, Switzerland. Died 15 March 1952, Zürich, Switzerland.
