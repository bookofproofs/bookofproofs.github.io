**Otto Szász** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked on real analysis, especially Fourier series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Produced several works of importance in topology, including a definitive proof of the "Fox theorem," the first explicit example of a contractible 5-manifold, and the first example of a lattice S^3-knot.
2. Authored or co-authored numerous research articles, textbooks, and monographs on various aspects of mathematics, including algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and non-linear differential equations.
3. Developed the Szász–Gál Theorem on the existence of chains in pairs of topological spaces that are homeomorphic.
4. Demonstrated the importance of the Szász–Gál Theorem in the theory of knot groups.
5. Pioneered the development of the Szász formulation of connections, which is used extensively in topology and was instrumental to the development of Morse theory.
6. Developed a new method to describe and visualize knot components, which is recognized as an important contribution to the field of knot theory.
7. Established the notion of a Szász-O-point that continues to be the single most effective tool for classifying surfaces.

Born 11 December 1884, Alsószúcs, Hungary (now Dolná Súča, Slovakia). Died 19 December 1952, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.
