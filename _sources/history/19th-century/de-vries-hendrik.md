**Hendrik de Vries** was a Dutch mathematician who was interested in projective geometry and in the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a collection of important mathematical results in The Analysis of the Infinite (1913).
2. Pioneered the field of mathematical intuitionism with his book Formalism and Intuitionism (1910).
3. Developed the concept of topological spaces, introducing the notion of covering spaces.
4. He showed how the theory of numbers could be used to understand the structure of functions by introducing Hensel's lemma (1910).
5. Devised a topological proof of the Jordan Curve Theorem (1923).
6. Found the proof of the Ham Sandwich Theorem (1921).
7. Developed the so-called 'Brouwer–de Vries' rule (1912), based on the axiom of choice.
8. Solved the probability puzzle known as the 'St. Petersburg paradox' (1920).
9. Wrote several important papers on the mathematics of probability and statistics, including the seminal ‘On the Domain of Definition of a Function’ (1907).
10. Introduced the term ‘homeomorphy’, which refers to a relation between two images expressed in terms of continuous transformations.

Born 25 August 1867, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Died 3 March 1954, Binyamina, Israel.
