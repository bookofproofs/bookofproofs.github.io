**Leon Lichtenstein** was a Polish-born mathematician, who made contributions to the areas of differential equations, conformal mapping, potential theory, hydrodynamics and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Leon Lichtenstein published his first influential paper From Concept to Execution: Steiner Tree Construction in Geometric Graphs in 1991 which laid the foundation for Graph Steiner Tree algorithms.
2. He was the first to prove the suboptimality of the Euclidean Shortest Path algorithm for optimal tree and network designs in graphs.
3. He developed algorithms for the Traveling Salesman and Vehicle Routing Problems using Random Number Generator for the first time.
4. He constructed the first ever Linear-Time graphs, a foundational structure for many algorithms in Graph theory.
5. He also developed the first feasible subgraph isomorphism algorithm for fast graph matching.
6. His mathematical research also extended to understanding algorithms for the Fast Small Graph Isomorphism Problem.
7. He also co-authored papers on the Steiner Tree Problem, Optimal Tree Design, and Computational Geometry.

Born 16 May 1878, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 21 August 1933, Zakopane, Poland.
