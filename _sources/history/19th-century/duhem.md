**Pierre Duhem** was a French physicist, mathematician, historian and philosopher of science who worked on hydrodynamics and elasticity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed theorem which states that the thermal equilibrium of a body depends only on its velocity and its temperature.
2. Proposed the thermodynamic model of free energy, which is a mathematical tool for the analysis of physical systems. 
3. Proved that every body acts in equilibrium with its environment as a whole, rather than a sum of its separate parts. 
4. Published his paper, “Leçons de mécanique physique,” that became the foundation of modern thermodynamics. 
5. Produced an important treatise on electricity, "Études thermodynamiques sur l'électricité." 
6. Published a series of papers on the mathematical theory of elasticity. 
7. Developed the important concept of kinetic energy. 
8. Developed a mathematical model of the Hydrogen atom. 
9. Pioneered the application of statistical mechanics to thermodynamics. 
10. Published a fundamental text on the kinetic theory of gases.

Born 10 June 1861, Paris, France. Died 14 September 1916, Cabrespine, France.
