**Gheorghe Țițeica** was a Romanian mathematician who worked in geometry. He was a founder of the Romanian school of differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He successfully solved an important problem in celestial mechanics, involving the motion of three bodies subject to their mutual gravitational attraction, for which he was honored with a Volta Prize in 1938.
2. In 1936 he gave a proof of George D. Birkhoff's ergodic theorem. 
3. He successfully obtained a rigorous limit theorem for infinite sequences, known as the "Ţiţeica Limit Theorem".
4. He built upon work by Siméon Denis Poisson, establishing definitive solutions of the boundary value problems of mathematical physics.
5. He developed an integral theorem now known as the Chern-Gheorghiu-Ţiţeica Theorem. 
6. He made important contributions to the field of integral equations. 
7. He analysed the continued fractions of divergent and periodic sequences, obtained important convergence theorems and built a theoretical basis for the study of basic iterative methods. 
8. He also studied nonlinear integro-differential equations and developed various techniques for the investigation of nonlinear problems.

Born 4 October 1874, Turnu-Severin, Oltenia, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Romania). Died 5 February 1939, Bucharest, Romania.
