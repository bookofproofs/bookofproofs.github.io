**Guillaume Bigourdan** was a French astronomer who spent twenty years reviewing and describing the positions of 6380 nebulae. He discovered about 500 new objects.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The family name 'Bigourdan' shows that the family were originally from Bigorre.
* Guillaume's younger sister Marguerite was born in 1853 and his brother Sylvestre in 1857.
* Tisserand was made Director of the Paris Observatory, bringing Bigourdan to Paris with him in 1879.
* In Paris, Bigourdan had the opportunity to take charge of the great equatorial telescope.
* Bigourdan was also a participant in expeditions.
* Bigourdan made the first of two series of observations between 18 April 1902 and 29 June 1902.
* The first task carried out by Bigourdan was to examine the operation of the instruments.
* Bigourdan noticed imperfections in his measuring device.
* Bigourdan therefore studied the behaviour of the level in order to be able to correct the readings made in the longitude operations.
* There were several candidates but the close call came between Bigourdan and Benjamin Baillaud.
* Both were members of the Academy of Sciences but Bigourdan was a full member while Baillaud was only a corresponding member.
* Bigourdan had worked at the Paris Observatory for 28 years and regularly attended meetings of the Academy of Sciences.
* Henri Poincaré considered Bigourdan a collaborator and even informed Baillaud that he intended to vote for Bigourdan.
* There was no doubt that Bigourdan had produced the greater amount of research but Baillaud had the most experience as an administrator and had achieved great things in this capacity.
* Bigourdan wrote on 23 December 1907 saying, "some accuse me of being capable of acts of intolerance", and defended himself from that accusation.
* On 17 December 1907 some newspapers had reported, prematurely, that Bigourdan had almost certainly won but when the official announcement came on 6 January 1908 it was Baillaud who was declared the new Director of the Paris Observatory.
* Bigourdan also held a keen interest in the transmission of time signals by wireless.
* In 1911, France switched from a time zone centred at Paris to one centred at Greenwich, London and Bigourdan helped establish the new time zone.
* After conferences in Paris in 1912 and 1913, the International Time Service was founded, with a bureau in Paris of which Bigourdan was given the directorship.
* After the First World War, Bigourdan remained director keeping in close touch with Benjamin Baillaud and General Ferrié, other figureheads in the time-keeping spheres of interest.
* Bigourdan was recognised for his work and achievements in the form of titles and awards.
* From its commencement in 1919, Bigourdan served as director of the Bureau International de l'Heure.
* Bigourdan was responsible for ensuring that various works were published, for example, that of A G Pingré's Annales célestes du dix-septiéme siècle Ⓣ(Celestial records of the 17th century).
* The manuscript was lost, before being found by Bigourdan at the Paris Observatory under an incorrect title.
* Bigourdan has been credited with a method for adjusting equatorial mount telescopes.
* Bigourdan's Method allows the setting up of a telescope mount when one cannot locate the celestial pole and does not know the latitude of the place.
* Up until 1913, the whole Bigourdan family came to Sistels on vacation, even including Mouchez cousins.
* They got bored on this old farm, in the countryside; Guillaume Bigourdan, however, came alone every summer to spend a few weeks.

Born 6 April 1851, Sistels, Tarn-et-Garonne, France. Died 28 February 1932, Paris, France.
