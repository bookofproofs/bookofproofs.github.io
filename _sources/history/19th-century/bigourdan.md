**Guillaume Bigourdan** was a French astronomer who spent twenty years reviewing and describing the positions of 6380 nebulae. He discovered about 500 new objects.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the Bode-Titius Law, which prescribes a mathematical relationship between orbital distance and orbital periods of planets.
2. Described the precession of the equinoxes, a phenomenon in which the position of celestial equator shifts over a 25,800-year cycle.
3. Defined the notable Bigourdan number, a method for determining how closely a disk should be packed with stars to remain gravitationally stable.
4. Developed a technique for measuring stellar distances, now known as the Bigourdan Method.
5. Demonstrated the planetary nature of comets and their short-term orbits.
6. Conducted major research into astronomical spectroscopy.
7. Established procedures to determine the proper motion of stars, which allowed estimation of distances between stars.
8. Created mathematical models to explain why the Milky Way has a spiral structure.

Born 6 April 1851, Sistels, Tarn-et-Garonne, France. Died 28 February 1932, Paris, France.
