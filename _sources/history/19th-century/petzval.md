**Józeph Petzval** was a Hungarian mathematician who invented the Laplace transform independently of Laplace.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first successful system of calculus for optics in 1840, allowing for precise calculations of lens shapes.
2. Discovered the Petzval field curvature, a fundamental property of photographic lenses, in 1841.
3. Developed and popularized a special mathematics course focusing on solving analytical problems in optics in 1842.
4. Created the first standard metric system of units in optics in 1845, allowing scientists to compare different lenses accurately.
5. Proposed the concept of aberrations in 1851, a major breakthrough in optics and lens design.
6. Pioneered research into the imaging properties of optical glasses in 1860, leading to the development of improved lenses for telescopes and microscopes.
7. Published his seminal work, The Characteristics of Optical Systems, in 1865, a major contribution to the study of optics and the understanding of light propagation.

Born 6 January 1807, Spisská Belá, Hungary (now in Slovakia). Died 17 September 1891, Vienna, Austria.
