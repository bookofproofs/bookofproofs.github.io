**Paul Montel** was a French mathematician who worked on complex analytic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Montel theorem on the approximation of functions continuous in a closed interval by a trigonometric polynomials.
2. Became the first mathematician to sympathetically explore the notion of prime numbers having an infinity of prime combinations.
3. Published 'Leçons sur la Théorie des Fonctions' in 1921 which proposed a generalization of Cauchy's theorem on singularities of analytic functions.
4. Proved various theorems on uniform convergence.
5. Developed the concept of absolutely convergent series.
6. Advanced the development of linear partial differential equations.
7. Was awarded the prestigious Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques of the French Academy of Sciences in 1921.

Born 29 April 1876, Nice, France. Died 22 January 1975, Paris, France.
