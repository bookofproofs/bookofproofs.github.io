**Annibale Comessatti** was an Italian mathematician who worked in in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the existence of a limit in the solution to a differential equation.
2. Developed a theory of electrical networks and fields, leading to the introduction of the concept of resistors.
3. Devised a new method for solving linear differential equations.
4. Discovered certain properties of the trigonometric series.
5. Co-developed a new theory for infinite products with non-commutative operators.
6. Evaluated the integral of certain transcendental functions that were previously unsolved.
7. Derived a solution for the two-point boundary value problem.
8. Proved the Hilb's theorem on the number of points of a plane curve.
9. Proved a theorem on the absolute continuity of linear combinations of responses.
10. Introduced new techniques to the study of the asymptotic behavior of some classes of functions.

Born 30 January 1886, Udine, Austrian Empire (now Italy). Died 13 September 1945, Padua, Italy.
