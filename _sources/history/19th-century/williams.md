**Lloyd Williams** was an American mathematician most important for his role in founding the Canadian Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Nathan and Amanda married in 1887 and Lloyd was born in the following year.
* However, Lloyd was the only child of his marriage to Amanda.
* We should comment at this point on Lloyd's full name.
* He was named after William Lloyd Garrison who helped lead the successful Abolitionist campaign against slavery in the United States.
* After the death of his mother, the Tomlinsons, who were the parents of Nathan Williams' first wife, took Lloyd to their farm in Indiana where the brought him up.
* The tutorial system at Oxford suited Williams.
* Williams undertook research in mathematics at the University of Chicago attending each summer.
* Anne and Lloyd later married.
* At Chicago, Williams thesis supervisor was L E Dickson and he suggested the topic for his student.
* However it appears that he gave little further advice until he suggested in 1920 that Williams should submit.
* There are two things for which Williams is particularly remembered.
* In 1922 the African American Elbert Frank Cox entered Cornell to study for his doctorate under Williams' supervision.
* Williams had strong beliefs regarding equality, being passionate in his hatred of racial discrimination.
* It is perhaps hard today to understand just how ground breaking a move it was by Williams to supervise the doctorate of an African American student.
* In 1924 Williams moved from Cornell to accept a position within the Mathematics Department of McGill University in Montreal, Canada.
* Cox had still not competed his doctorate at this stage and with help from Williams he was awarded a Erastus Brooks Fellowship so that he could study at McGill University with his supervisor.
* Williams felt that since Cox was the first person of his race in the world to be awarded a doctorate in mathematics it was necessary for him to have the recognition by a university outside the United States.
* It was at McGill that Williams spent the rest of his working life, teaching there until 1954.
* Although extremely kind, Williams had high standards as a teacher.
* Williams favoured the term "Congress" which he gave French and English speaking Canadians equal status.
* Williams worked hard from 1943 to provide a forum around which Canadian mathematical life could be centred.
* Williams was much honoured for his contributions to the mathematical life of Canada.
* When he retired from McGill in 1954, Williams joined the Board of the Canadian Friends Service Committee and was Chairman of the Committee from 1959 until 1963.

Born 3 October 1888, Friendship, near Labette, Kansas, USA. Died 31 January 1976, Pennsylvania, USA.
