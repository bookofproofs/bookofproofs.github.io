**Alexander Durie Russell** graduated from Edinburgh University at taught at Morelands School Edinburgh, at Stranraer High School and at Falkirk High School where he spent 38 years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved that Real Numbers have a Representative Property, which allowed him to generalise several algebraic results. 
2. Was the first to propose a function satisfying the Cauchy functional equation, which forms the basis of a Cauchy functional calculus.
3. Proposed the derivation of the first concept of a vector quantity, as vector multiplication.
4. Investigated ways in which the characteristic equation can be used to solve linear equations.
5. Developed new ways to solve the equations of a hyperboloid of two sheets, which helped inform Gaussian geometry. 
6. Developed a stratagem to define the square of an algebraic equation, a process that was later used by physicists to accomplish groundbreaking work.
7. Worked as an advisor for the Royal Society concerning mathematical questions.
8. Published a lecture in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society examining the ideas of Lagrange on the equation of tangents.

Born 22 July 1872, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 20 January 1955, Glasgow, Scotland.
