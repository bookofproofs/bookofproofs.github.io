**Alexander Durie Russell** graduated from Edinburgh University at taught at Morelands School Edinburgh, at Stranraer High School and at Falkirk High School where he spent 38 years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He married Janet Durie in Edinburgh on 23 August 1869.
* Janet was born in Midcalder in 1837 to parents Alexander Durie, a dairyman, and his wife Janet.
* Thomas and Janet Russell settled in Edinburgh after their wedding and in 1871 were living at 5 Salisbury Street, Edinburgh.
* Their first child James Russell was born in Newington, Edinburgh on 24 June 1870.
* Alexander Durie Russell, the subject of this biography, was born in Newington, Edinburgh in July 1872.
* At the time of the 1881 census, the Russell family are living at 56 Clerk Street, Edinburgh.
* Alexander is a school pupil, his father Thomas is a grocer, but the family also have two lodgers, James Miller, a law apprentice, and David Murray Maxwell, a Law Clerk.
* Alexander is a university student, his father is a retired grocer, and now they have two boarders, William Asmit, a retired confectioner, and Peter White, a school pupil, as well as the lodger David Murray Maxwell, now a cashier in a Law Office, and Jeanie R Gordon, a visitor.
* Let us go back a little and to look at Alexander Durie Russell's secondary schooling.
* Russell then studied Chemistry with Alexander Crum Brown, Mathematics with George Chrystal, Natural Philosophy with Peter Guthrie Tait, Botany with Isaac Bayley Balfour, and Natural History with James Cossar Ewart.
* Russell was educated at Edinburgh University, where he had a distinguished academic career.
* It is worth noting that the physicist and meteorologist, Charles Thomson Rees Wilson, worked at the Observatory around the time that Russell worked there.
* After working for a year as a Demonstrator in Physics at the University of Edinburgh, Russell was appointed to Morelands School, Edinburgh, where he taught mathematics for one year.
* This was quite a new school when Russell was appointed there, for it had been founded in 1886.
* Russell taught both school children and iron workers.
* Although Russell was teaching in Falkirk from 1899, at the 1901 census he was living with his parents at 3 Bernard Terrace in Edinburgh.
* David Murray Maxwell was still a lodger and Russell's father, Thomas, is now listed as a fish merchant.
* On 12 April 1930, Russell married  Margaret Wilson Swan Fisher in Blythswood, Glasgow.
* In fact Russell was almost exactly the same age as Margaret's father James Fisher.
* Alexander and Margaret Russell were living at 14 Heugh Street, Falkirk in 1938, the house where Russell was living before his marriage since he gives this address in the list of Edinburgh Mathematical Society members of 1927.
* Russell was proposed for election as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 12 December 1905 by William Peddie, John Brown Clark, Robert Traill Omond, and Cargill Gilston Knott.
* We now list some of Russell's papers, with some extracts from Abstracts where appropriate.
* Alexander Durie Russell, A special case of the dissection of any two triangles into mutually similar pairs of triangles, Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society 18 (1900), 28-29.
* Alexander Durie Russell, Trigonometrical Ratios of (A±B)(A±B)(A±B), Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society 40 (1921), 60-61.
* Alexander Durie Russell, Theorem regarding a regular polygon and a circle cutting its sides, with corollary and application to trigonometry, Edinburgh Mathematical Notes 22 (1924), 7-10.
* Alexander Durie Russell, A note on equilateral polygons, Edinburgh Mathematical Notes 37 (1949), 23-24.
* St Modan's Church, Falkirk has an interesting history through the time that Russell taught in Falkirk.
* Russell retired in 1937 from his position of Head of Mathematics at Falkirk High School but continued his interest in mathematics publishing the occasional paper.
* Mr Russell is survived by his widow, to whom much sympathy is expressed in her bereavement.

Born 22 July 1872, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 20 January 1955, Glasgow, Scotland.
