**Gustav Herglotz** was a Czech-born German mathematician  best known for his works on the theory of relativity and seismology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a solution for the minimum time problem in solid mechanics, now known as Herglotz's Principle. 
2. Developed the Herglotz–Vitali theorem concerning Fourier series.
3. Contributed to the research of partial differential equations and to the theory of potential functions.
4. Developed the basic theory of affine transformations of fields.
5. Established novel formulations of surface wave equations.
6. Published influential work on a mathematical model of emulsions and contact problems.
7. Wrote two influential books on the mathematics of magnetism.
8. Made significant advances in the theory of plane elasticity.

Born 2 February 1881, Wallern, Bohemia (now Volary, Czech Republic). Died 22 March 1953, Göttingen, Germany.
