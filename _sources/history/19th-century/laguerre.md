**Edmond Laguerre** studied approximation methods and is best remembered for the special functions: the Laguerre polynomials.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Laguerre polynomials, a set of orthogonal polynomials which can be used to solve certain types of differential equations and to model certain physical phenomena.
2. Researched the method of least squares, and published findings that are still used today for linear and non-linear regression. 
3. Derived and developed an accurate method to calculate the roots of higher-order polynomial equations.
4. Developed the Laguerre Differential Equation and the associated Laguerre transform, a powerful tool in signal processing.
5. Published many influential works on differential equations, including on Dirichlet's problem and Abel's theorem.
6. Developed the Laguerre–Gauss quadrature formula for calculating integrals. 
7. Made numerous contributions to the theory of equations, including the method of Laguerre's elimination to solve polynomial equations.

Born 9 April 1834, Bar-le-Duc, France. Died 14 August 1886, Bar-le-Duc, France.
