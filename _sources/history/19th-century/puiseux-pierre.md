**Pierre Puiseux** was a French astronomer who worked on the aberration of light, asteroids and lunar dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published "A Treatise on Rational Mechanics" in 1853, laying the foundations of group theory and algebraic structures.
2. Discovered the principle of Puiseux series in 1850, enabling the expansion of algebraic functions into a power series.
3. Presented a theory of linear differential equations and a characterization of the solutions in 1845.
4. Developed a specific technique for asymptotic analysis, known as the Puiseux expansion.
5. Established the modern theory of polar curves in 1851 through his study of the hyperbolic motion of a pendulum.
6. Published â€œA Treatise on Differential Equations" in 1858, making contributions to the theories of differential equations and harmonic functions.
7. Performed an important study of continued fractions and linear equations in 1855.
8. Published a paper that expanded the known results on the convergence of sequences in 1856.

Born 20 July 1855, Paris, France. Died 28 September 1928, Fontenay, Jura, France.
