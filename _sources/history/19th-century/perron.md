**Oskar Perron** was a German mathematician best known for the Perron paradox:\n\n

Suppose the largest natural number is `$N$`. Then if `$N>1$` we have `$N^2>N$` contradicting the definition. Hence (!), `$N=1$`.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the major open problem of how to express an arbitrary irrational number such as Ï€ as a continued fraction.
2. He formulated and proved the spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space.
3. Developed a novel algebraic method to expand Fourier series.
4. Helped put an end to a controversy over which system is the most practical for measuring angles: the sexagesimal system or the system of right triangles.
5. Assisted in the compilation of an early version of a table of the sines and cosines of the integers. 
6. Found a proof of the Minkowski-Wirtinger inequality.
7. Revised and extended a number of theorems concerning quadratic forms in real numbers.
8. Applied linear algebra to the theory of quadratic forms and to the invariant theory of binary forms.

Born 7 May 1880, Frankenthal, Pfalz, Germany. Died 22 February 1975, Munich, Germany.
