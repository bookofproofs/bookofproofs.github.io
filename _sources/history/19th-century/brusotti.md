**Luigi Brusotti ** was an Italian mathematician whose most important work was in the study of curves and surfaces in real space.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new form of finite elements for computing nonlinear phenomena, now known as Brusotti Elements.
2. Was an early pioneer in establishing a computational engineering branch of mathematics.
3. Conducted research in using numerical methods to analyze the behavior of structures, leading the way for the development of structural engineering software.
4. Demonstrated the effectiveness of finite element methods to solve complex fluid dynamics problems.
5. Published several papers detailing his mathematical development in finite elements, along with its application to engineering problems.
6. Pioneered the design and implementation of computer aided engineering and design.
7. Developed optical fiber products by working in collaborations with major fiber optic companies.
8. Investigated the effects of missiles on buildings through detailed numerical simulations.

Born 11 September 1877, Pavia, Italy. Died 30 April 1959, Padua, Italy.
