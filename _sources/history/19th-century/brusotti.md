**Luigi Brusotti ** was an Italian mathematician whose most important work was in the study of curves and surfaces in real space.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Felice Casorati was professor of mathematics at Pavia when Luigi Brusotti was born and continued until his death in 1890.
* At the 'Ugo Foscolo' high school in Pavia Brusotti was taught mathematics by Pilo Predella and Luigi Berzolari.
* It specialised in a classical education and indeed Brusotti proved an exceptional student of classical studies.
* After graduating from the 'Ugo Foscolo' high school, Brusotti enrolled at the University of Pavia.
* Brusotti's dissertation, supervised by Aschieri, was of high quality but it did not result in publications since the results had been independently discovered and published by others.
* In addition to attending courses delivered by Ferdinando Aschieri, Brusotti had attended courses by Luigi Berzolari and Ernesto Pascal.
* Brusotti graduated from the University of Pavia on 10 July 1899 with honours in pure mathematics.
* He spent the following academic year, 1999-1900 in Pisa where he attended courses, both at the University and at the Scuola Normale Superiore, delivered by Ulisse Dini, Eugenio Bertini and Luigi Bianchi.
* After his year at Pisa, Brusotti returned to Pavia where he was an assistant to Luigi Berzolari, Carlo Formenti (1841-1918) and Ferdinando Aschieri.
* During the years 1900-01 and 1901-02 Brusotti was a voluntary assistant involved in exercise classes in algebraic analysis and analytical geometry.
* It was during these years when he was working as an assistant that Brusotti began publishing the results of his research.
* In 1906 Brusotti left university teaching and, for a twenty years, he taught mathematics in secondary schools.
* On 6 May 1910 Brusotti returned to the University of Pavia when he was appointed as a Lecturer teaching analytical geometry.
* After two years at Cagliari, he succeeded Luigi Bianchi, who died in June 1928, when he was appointed to the chair of analytic geometry at the University of Pisa.
* In this area of work Brusotti has, in almost fifty years of activity, brought an impressive contribution of new results, consisting of a true body of theory, hinged on the so-called "method of small variation," which has brought him fame in Italy and abroad.
* The complete donation includes the entire private holdings of Brusotti: 4 bookcases containing about 600 books, of which about 130 are antique works, and some furnishings that allow the original arrangement of the private library to be maintained.

Born 11 September 1877, Pavia, Italy. Died 30 April 1959, Padua, Italy.
