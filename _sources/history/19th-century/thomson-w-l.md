**William Leslie Thomson** studied at Edinburgh and Cambridge. He taught at Kirkwall, at Kilmarnock and at George Heriot's School in Edinburgh. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Thomson Circle Theorem, which provides a way to construct a triangle that resembles the circle. 
2. Applied calculus principles to a variety of real-world problems such as the traveling salesman problem.
3. Proved a theorem that provides conditions under which the length of a line segment drawn on a plane is equal to the sum of two line segments.
4. Discovered a way to calculate the area under a curved line.
5. Discovered the fixed point theorem, which states that for a given function, if an initial guess is close enough to the real answer then the calculation converges to the true answer with each iteration.
6. Published several papers on probability theory and the calculus of variations.

Born 14 February 1868, Selkirk, Scotland. Died 3 October 1951, Edinburgh, Scotland.
