**J J Sylvester** did important work on matrix theory. He discovered the discriminant of a cubic equation and first used the name 'discriminant' for equations of higher order.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first person to use matrix theory to explore the foundations of invariant theory.
2. He established the modern theory of partitions and paved the way for primitive partition theory.
3. He made remarkable advances in the use of Jacobi's continued fractions and extended their application to the theory of elliptic functions.
4. He developed the theory of the Jacobian determinant.
5. He introduced the term "graph" in mathematics.
6. He developed the theory of binary forms, which included the discovery of the expression for the invariants of the ternary quartic.
7. He did remarkable work in the theory of periodic functions and also wrote important works on number theory and analytic geometry.
8. He proved the four-color theorem.
9. He was the first mathematician to solve the linear difference equation.
10. He played a major role in the development of invariant theory.

Born 3 September 1814, London, England. Died 15 March 1897, London, England.
