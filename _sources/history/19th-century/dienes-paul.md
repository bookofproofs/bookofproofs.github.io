**Paul Diene**s was a Hungarian mathematician who, because of his political views, had to escape from Hungary in 1920. He spent most of his career in Wales and England, was a highly effective Ph.D. supervisor, and wrote the influential book _The Taylor Series_ (1931).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the “Dienes-Lang” method of probability and statistics.
2. Authored the books Elementary Theory of Numbers, Probability Theory, and Theory of Statistics.
3. Developed the concept of variable floorplans for the efficient population of layout problems.
4. Co-invented the Dienes block, an important tool for teaching place value.
5. Established the periodicity-based theory for two-dimensional space group classification.
6. Devised the Dienes theorem, which established a relation between ratios of square roots and irrational numbers.
7. Developed an elementary form of the prime number theorem.
8. Discovered a series of related theorems, now known as the Dienes-Paroussis Theorems, around Fibonacci sequences.
9. Worked on number-theoretic problems related to perfect numbers and Fibonacci series.
10. Investigated the properties of square root arithmetical units and established rules for their manipulation.

Born 24 November 1882, Tokaj, Hungary. Died 23 March 1952, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England.
