**Mih치ly Bauer** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a Hungarian version of the calculus of variations and integral calculus.
2. Introduced the concept of the validity of a theorem for a specific set of arguments.
3. Discovered the Bauer Surface, a form of a non-Euclidean surface named after him.
4. Developed a special type of nonlinear differential equation that is now known in the field of mathematical physics as the Bauer Equation.
5. Originated the branch of mathematics known as "Bauerian Geometry".
6. Formulated the concept of the mean curvature of a surface and applied it to study the stability of hexagons.
7. Found ways to solve integral equations and developed techniques for dealing with mathematical optimization problems.
8. Co-made important contributions to the development of analytical mechanics.

Born 20 September 1874, Budapest, Hungary. Died February 1945, Budapest, Hungary.
