**Mihály Bauer** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Bauer published two important papers in 1903.
* What Bauer proved was that if two finite Galois extensions of the rationals have the property that, with at most a finite number of exceptions, the same primes split completely in both extensions, then the two extensions are equal.
* In 1909 Bauer was appointed as a privatdozent at the Technical University of Budapest having submitted a habilitation thesis on analytic number theory and function theory.
* Kürschák was himself a mathematician but it was as rector of the university that welcomed Bauer.
* It was fitting that Bauer, who was a student of König, should be the first recipient of the prize in 1922.
* The insults he had to suffer caused much long-lasting pain to Bauer.
* Bauer had other problems to contend with in addition to the disgraceful anti-Semitic behaviour of his students.
* Bauer celebrated his 70th  birthday on 20 September 1944 forced to wear a yellow star and forced to share his home.
* Immediately he moved his forces against the Hungarian Jews and Bauer was sent to Tattersaal camp.

Born 20 September 1874, Budapest, Hungary. Died February 1945, Budapest, Hungary.
