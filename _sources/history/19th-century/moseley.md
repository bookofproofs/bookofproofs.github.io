**Henry Moseley** was an English churchman, mathematician, and scientist. He served as Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy and Astronomy at King's College, London. He then became of of the first H.M. inspectors of schools.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for calculating the effective nuclear charge of atoms. 
2. Showed that the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is related to its position in the Periodic Table of Elements. 
3. Demonstrated that the atomic number of an element is a better means of predicting the properties of its atoms than the original atomic weight. 
4. Developed an equation to describe the energy levels of electrons in atoms. 
5. Demonstrated the existence of isotopes, or atoms with the same atomic number but different atomic weights. 
6. Showed that X-ray spectra could be used to determine the relative abundance of elements. 
7. Invented a special type of X-ray diffraction tube to study X-rays. 
8. Established a method of correlating the wavelengths of spectral lines with the atomic numbers of the elements producing them.

Born 9 July 1801, Long Buckby, Northamptonshire, England. Died 20 January 1872, Olveston, Gloucestershire, England.
