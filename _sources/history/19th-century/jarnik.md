**Vojtěch Jarník** was a Czech mathematician who worked in number theory, mathematical analysis, and graph algorithms.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Jarník developed the concepts of strictly convex plane curves, admissible numbers and monotonic functions.
2. He refined and made significant contributions to the theory of continued fractions and deviation theory.
3. He was one of the first mathematicians to prove the Generalized Fermat Theorem.
4. He contributed to the development of the theory of diophantine approximation.
5. He also wrote on number theory, approximation theory and the theory of space curves.
6. He published several papers on the approximation of irrational numbers by rational fractions.
7. He also published a work on Dirichlet series and results in best approximation theory.
8. He was the first to prove a number of geometric theorems, including one stating that every sequence of convex plane curves has an upper bound.

Born 22 December 1897, Prague, Bohemia (now Czech Republic). Died 22 September 1970, Prague, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic).
