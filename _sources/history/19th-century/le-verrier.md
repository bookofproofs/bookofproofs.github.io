**Urbain Le Verrier** is best known for the calculations which led to the discovery of Neptune.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established mathematical rules for accurately predicting the motion of planets. 
2. Developed the mathematical theory of tidal friction to explain the distribution of the solar system's masses. 
3. Predicted the existence of the planet Neptune before its actual discovery. 
4. Predicted the exact location of the planet Neptune before its actual discovery. 
5. Derived mathematical formulas to predict the exact orbit of planets and other celestial objects. 
6. Constructed a precise mathematical model of the solar system. 
7. Established a precise system of celestial coordinates known as the ecliptic coordinate system. 
8. Discovered the anomalies of the orbit of Mercury and proposed a solution to this problem.
9. Introduced the idea of a planet's resonance of orbital periods with its moons.

Born 11 March 1811, Saint-LÃ´, France. Died 23 September 1877, Paris, France.
