**Nicolai Vasilievich Bugaev** was a Russian mathematician, born in Georgia, who worked mainly on analysis and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Completed the first reliable proof of the Weierstrass \lambda-lemma in 1890. 
2. Established a classification system for all Abelian integrals. 
3. Developed the now well-known Bugaev invariant, which is named after him. 
4. Discovered a fundamental property of second order linear equations. 
5. Established a theory of multiple integrals with an application to mathematical physics. 
6. Developed a method of approximating functions that minimizes the maximal error. 
7. Published influential work on the asymptotic behavior of multiple integrals. 
8. Was the first to study the equations of motion of a discrete dynamical system. 
9. Contributed to the theory of linear elliptic partial differential equations. 
10. Developed a method for solving certain Diophantine equations.

Born 14 September 1837, Dusheti (near Tiflis, now Tbilisi), Georgia. Died 11 June 1903, Moscow, Russia.
