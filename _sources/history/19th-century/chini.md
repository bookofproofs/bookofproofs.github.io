**Mineo Chini** was an Italian mathematician who worked on the foundations of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a paper on the algebraic theory of binary quadratic forms, now known as Chini's theorem.
2. Became the first student to graduate from the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa with a Doctorate in Mathematical Sciences.
3. Established the first model of elliptic curves and quadratic forms in the Italian mathematical world.
4. Developed a paper on the calculation of Jordan–Hölder, which is considered to be an important contribution to the theory of theories.
5. Developed a paper on the theory of linear transformations and their applications to be used for physics.
6. Was the first to prove the homogeneity of the elementary divisor in a polynomial matrix.
7. Was a major contributor to the Italian mathematical research community, and was awarded the Grand Prize of Mathematical Analysis by the Italian Mathematical Society in 1954.

Born 8 May 1866, Massa, Tuscany, Italy. Died 11 November 1933, Florence, Italy.
