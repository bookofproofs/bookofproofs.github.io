**Archie Alexander** was an African-American mathematician and engineer. He became governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It took the remarkable person that Archie was, together with strong support from his parents, to overcome these disadvantages, both from prejudice against someone of his race and against someone from a poor working class background, and go on to a life filled with achievements.
* Alexander's parents were far too poor to be able to afford to send him to College to study further, yet Alexander was determined to continue his education.
* To allow him to study at Highland Park College in Des Moines, Alexander took on some poorly paid part-time jobs and his parents also helped out as much as they could.
* It is important to realise what an achievement it was for Alexander to enter the College of Engineering in Iowa City which was attached to the University of Iowa.
* One might have expected someone from Alexander's background to have been encouraged to undertake university studies, but this had certainly not been the case.
* Prejudice against someone of his race prevented Alexander from being appointed to any of the engineering posts to which he made application.
* Alexander was not one to give up when he encountered such difficulties.
* One might have thought that Alexander, having achieved remarkable success for someone of his background, might have been content with his position.
* As a consequence, Alexander's company ended up with the jobs for which no other firm competed.
* While at the Marsh Engineering Company, Alexander had become friendly with another engineer George F Higbee.
* Alexander took Higbee on a partner in 1917 and the partnership was only ended in 1925 when Higbee was tragically killed in a construction accident.
* For four years Alexander continued to run the company on his own, gaining a reputation as a talented construction engineer building fine bridges, viaducts and tunnels.
* Then in 1929 he took on a new partner, Maurice A Repass, who had been a fellow student with Alexander at the Iowa College of Engineering.
* Alexander did not confine his talents to developing his engineering firm.
* Alexander's period as governor lasted only sixteen months before he was forced to resign.
* It was a sad episode which almost certainly hastened Alexander's death and must have left him with much sadness after a life filled with so many achievements against all the odds that were stacked against him.
* In 1975, on the death of Alexander's wife, the University of Iowa, Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and Howard University each received a substantial sum for engineering scholarships from a trust fund set up by Alexander in his will.

Born 14 May 1888, Ottumwa, Iowa, USA. Died 4 January 1958, Des Moines, Iowa, USA.
