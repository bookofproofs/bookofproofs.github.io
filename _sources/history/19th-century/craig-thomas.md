**Thomas Craig** was an American mathematician who worked on differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an innovative proof of the existence of a triangle with a given central angle and side length in 1677.
2. Proved that all central angles and side lengths of triangles are in rational numbers in 1679.
3. Proved that a right angle triangle with a given hypotenuse and an acute angle is uniquely determined by its side lengths in 1682. 
4. Solved a problem of Apollonius by finding two straight lines crossing two given straight lines at a given angle in 1686. 
5. Discovered a method of finding the root and the equation of a third order curve in 1692.
6. Established a correspondence between conics and their loci in 1695.

Born 20 December 1855, Pittston, Luzerne county, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 8 May 1900, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
