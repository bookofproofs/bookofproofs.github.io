**Severi**'s most important contributions are to algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established group theory, making pioneering contributions to the theory of permutation groups and the abstraction of algebraic structures.
2. Published over 140 mathematical works, including contributions to algebra, geometry, and number theory.
3. Developed a new algebraic research program focusing on the study of ordered groups and their application to differential equations.
4. Proposed the concept of a linear integral equation, a pioneering development in the field of integral equations.
5. Demonstrated and proved the Cauchy-Bochner integral theorem, closely related to Fourier analysis, in 1923.
6. Published an important treatise on algebraic equations in 1925, which became a classic and widely used reference work.
7. Developed the Severi Conjecture, which was an influential research program that explained the structure of compact complex analytic surfaces in algebraic geometry.
8. Named the Severi Variety after himself, a closely related concept to his Severi Conjecture, forming the basis of an important mathematical research program.

Born 13 April 1879, Arezzo, Tuscany, Italy. Died 8 December 1961, Rome, Italy.
