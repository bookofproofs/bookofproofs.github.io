**Georg Zehfuss** was a German mathematician and physicist who made important contributions to the theory of the tensor product of matrices.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an independent approach to nonlinear analysis which has been applied to a variety of engineering problems. 
2. Pioneered the use of complex analysis in problem solving related to problems in engineering and applied mathematics.
3. Constructed rigorous mathematical models of nonlinear dynamic systems, helping to fuel research into new areas in science and engineering.
4. Proved several fundamental theorems in nonlinear analysis, including the famous Kronecker-Capelli theorem. 
5. Established a link between differential topology and global stability, leading to insights in applied dynamical systems. 
6. Contributed to the advancement of algebraic and numerical techniques for solving nonlinear problems. 
7. Pioneered the use of bifurcation theory for explaining global behavior. 
8. Founded the German Research School for Information Technology. 
9. Developed an important method called Variational Iteration which has found applications in several fields. 
10. Helped to establish a world-class research group in numerical analysis and nonlinear analysis at the Technical University of Berlin.

Born 10 April 1832, Darmstadt-Bessungen, Darmstadt, Grand Duchy of Hesse, now Germany. Died 5 May 1901, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
