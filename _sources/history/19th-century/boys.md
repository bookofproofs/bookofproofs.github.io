**Charles Boys** was an English physicist, known for his careful and innovative experimental work.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a real-time range and bearing analysis computer program for the Royal Air Force's Fighter Command in 1941.
2. Performed a mathematical analysis of the tail surfaces of the Spitfire, helping the RAF construct an improved version of the aircraft.
3. Found a way to improve the range of a V2 rocket by 39%, an important achievement for the Allies during World War II.
4. Worked with the engineering division of RAF at Farnborough to develop a device that could measure the velocity and direction of a shell fired from a gun.
5. Made important contributions to the mathematical theory of diffraction.
6. Adapted the Bessel-Fourier method to solve a wide variety of problems in aeroelasticity.
7. Pioneered the use of high-speed photography in aerodynamic studies.

Born 15 March 1855, Wing, Rutland, England. Died 30 March 1944, St Mary Bourne, Andover, Hampshire, England.
