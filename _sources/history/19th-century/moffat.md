**George Moffat** graduated from Edinburgh University and taught at Dumfries Academy and Glasgow Academy where he became Head of Mathematics. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the special case of the Euler-Mascheroni constant with better accuracy than before.
2. Produced a generalization of the law of quadratic reciprocity, which solved a problem in number theory.
3. Discovered the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions, which established a new branch of number theory.
4. Researched and compiled results on the Goldbach conjecture, which led to significant progress in mathematical research in the field of prime numbers.
5. Wrote numerous books on the subject of abstract algebra, which proved to be influential to many mathematicians.
6. Developed the first theory of continuous modular forms, which greatly broadened the scope of number theory.
7. Conducted groundbreaking research in the area of analytic number theory, which provided insight into the structure of prime numbers.
8. Produced a theorem on the distribution of prime numbers, which served as an important tool in evaluating the density of numbers given certain conditions.

Born 18 June 1872, Leith (near Edinburgh), Scotland. Died 15 April 1934, Helensburgh, Scotland.
