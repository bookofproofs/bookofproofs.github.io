**Nikolai Krylov** was a Russian mathematician who published over 200 papers on analysis and mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a parametric method for solving two-point boundary value problems.
2. Mathematically demonstrated the stability of uniform rotations of a curved surface and a proof of the invariance of the general equation of the geodesic curve.
3. Established a general theorem and formulas for the soluble cases of Abel's equations.
4. Discovered the Krylov Subspace which is used in scientific and engineering calculations. 
5. Constructed an algorithm for inverting a matrix.
6. Devised a method for constructing uncountable sets of solutions to boundary value problems of mathematical physics.
7. Developed methods for the numerical solution of ordinary time-dependent partial differential equations.
8. Discovered the application of the variational principle in harmonic analysis.
9. Found a way to numerical solution of two-point boundary value problems.
10. Found a method of compressible flow calculations which would later be known as the Krylov-Bogolyubov method.

Born 29 November 1879, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 11 May 1955, Moscow, USSR.
