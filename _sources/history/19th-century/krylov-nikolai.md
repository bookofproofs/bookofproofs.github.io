**Nikolai Krylov** was a Russian mathematician who published over 200 papers on analysis and mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He held this post until 1922 when he moved to Kiev on being appointed chairman of the mathematical physics department of the Ukrainian  Academy of Sciences (in fact renamed the All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in the year before Krylov was appointed).
* Krylov published over 200 papers on analysis and mathematical physics.
* The most famous publication of Krylov and Bogolyubov is their book Introduction to nonlinear mechanics, published in Kiev in 1937.
* Before publishing this book with Bogolyubov, in 1931 Krylov had published the important monograph Les méthodes de solution approchée des problèmes de la physique mathématique.
* All of Krylov's works emphasise computational aspects, motivations, and applications.
* In 1939 Krylov and Bogolyubov published Sur les équations de Focker-Planck déduites dans la théorie des perturbations à l'aide d'une méthode basée sur les propriétés spectrales de l'hamiltonien perturbateur (Application à la mécanique classique et à la mécanique quantique).
* Finally let us mention three papers published by Krylov in 1947.
* In 1928 Krylov was elected to the USSR Academy of Sciences and in 1939 he became an honoured scientist of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.
