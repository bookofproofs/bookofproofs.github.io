**Joseph Plateau** was a Belgian mathematician best known for _Plateau's problem_ on surfaces of minimal area.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of optical perception, known as the phi phenomenon, in which the illusion of movement is created by presenting a series of still drawings in rapid succession.
2. Demonstrated and explained the phenomenon of persistence of vision.
3. Explored the mathematics of fluid motion using the wave theory of light and sound.
4. Discovered the mathematical principle now known as the Plateau-Rayleigh instability or the Plateau-Rayleigh instability criterion.
5. Developed a mathematical explanation of the phenomenon of capillary action.
6. Formulated a mathematical theory of topographic surfaces based on the principle of the conservation of surface area.
7. Researched the mathematics of soap films, and elucidated the equations that describe their equilibrium shapes. 
8. Proved the mathematical equivalence of the sine and cosine functions using rotating discs. 
9. Discovered that soap films can assume minimal surface shapes, which describes the behavior of a class of materials known as minimal surfaces. 
10. Demonstrated the use of liquid soap films to produce an almost perfect sphere, known as the Plateau-Douglas illusion.

Born 14 October 1801, Brussels, French Empire (now Belgium). Died 15 September 1883, Ghent, Belgium.
