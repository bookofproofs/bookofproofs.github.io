**Ludwig Boltzmann** was an Austrian mathematician who made important advances in electromagnetism and thermodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Boltzmann's equation, a mathematical equation related to the motion of molecules in an ideal gas.
2. Devised a method of representing fluctuations in the physical parameters of a system of particles, known as the Boltzmann distribution.
3. Formulated a statistical understanding of entropy, known as the “Boltzmann entropy”.
4. Helped prove the second law of thermodynamics.
5. Published groundbreaking works on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, supporting the kinetic theory of gases.
6. Demonstrated the Equipartition Theorem, which states that the average kinetic energy of particles in a system is proportional to the temperature.
7. Established a relationship between entropy and probability.
8. Developed the concept of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

Born 20 February 1844, Vienna, Austria. Died 5 September 1906, Duino (near Trieste), Austria (now Italy).
