* "If only she could go to Cambridge and study mathematics she would carry everything before her," he said, "but what could a girl do learning mathematics." Mary was shocked to learn that she could not go to university, she could not study mathematics and she would never meet the famous Charles Babbage.
* Mary Boole could not go to university but she could learn mathematics by teaching herself from books.
* George Everest spent many hours with Mary, encouraging her and telling her about his experiences.
* Indeed, their relationship evolved partly as a consequence of time they spent together devoted to Mary's private tuition, George proving particularly helpful to overcoming her various difficulties with differential calculus.

* Mary was described as "living on her own means".
