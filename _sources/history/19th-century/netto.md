**Eugen Netto** was a German mathematician who made major steps towards abstract group theory when he combined permutation group results and groups in number theory. He also worked on space-filling curves.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Netto Envelope Theorem in the field of projective differential geometry. 
2. Introduced a way of representing and solving linear programming problems which led the way to the later inventions of the cutting plane method and the simplex algorithm. 
3. Published fundamental work on graph theory and lattice theory, particularly on the theory of transference and exchange. 
4. Developed the quasi-arithmetic mean, an extension of the arithmetic mean, as part of his work on the geometry of curves. 
5. Devised a generalized theory of determinants which unified much of the existing theory and was later employed in his work on elliptic difference equations. 
6. Proved the Double Genocchi-Polya Theorem, a result in classical analysis. 
7. Developed a systematic theory of graphical solutions of differential equations which advanced the general theory of linear forms in topological space.
8. Advocated for "Elements of Linear Algebra", an introductory textbook for students of mathematics.

Born 30 June 1846, Halle, Germany. Died 13 May 1919, Giessen, Germany.
