**FrancescoBrioschi** was an Italian mathematician who contributed to the study of mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He proposed the basic theorem of calculus, which states that the integral of a function's derivative is the original function.
2. He discovered that the integral of a polynomial of degree n can be expressed in terms of the integral of polynomials of lesser degree.
3. He devised techniques to evaluate integrals involving trigonometric functions.
4. He made advances in the theory of differential equations, including methods of solving equations with multiple unknowns.
5. He improved the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula and developed an algorithm to approximate integrals of certain types of functions.
6. He published 'Analysis of Curves', which was a foundational work in the field of differential geometry.
7. He proposed the modern version of the mean value theorem for derivatives.
8. He was the first to construct a function that satisfies the boundary-value problem of a differential equation.

Born 22 December 1824, Milan, Lombardo-Veneto (now Italy). Died 14 December 1897, Milan, Italy.
