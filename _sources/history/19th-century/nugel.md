**Frieda Nugel ** was a German mathematician who was one of the first women to receive a doctorate in Germany.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The family were members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, and Frieda received her early education at home given by her father.
* Nugel then began her studies at Berlin University, attending lectures in mathematics, physics and German.
* It is worth looking for a moment at the mathematics department where Nugel was receiving her education.
* Nugel attended lectures by Frobenius and Schur, who at the time was a dynamic young lecturer.
* After three terms of study in Berlin, Nugel moved to the University of Munich where she spent one term attending lectures by Ferdinand Lindemann and Aurel Voss.
* In receiving a doctorate in mathematics, Nugel became one of the first German women to receive such a degree.
* Later in July Nugel passed the state examinations qualifying her to teach mathematics, physics and German in a Gymnasium.
* Immediately after passing these examinations, Nugel was appointed as a teacher in the Augusta school on Cottbus.
* By this time she was engaged to be married to Louis Hahn who had been a research student studying for his doctorate in history at Halle at the same time as Nugel.
* They were married on 4 April 1914 and Nugel left her teaching post at Cottbus at this time and the newly married couple moved to Altena, Westphalia, where Louis Hahn had a job as an editor.
* It fell to Frieda Hahn to support the family and she returned to teaching.
* Frieda Hahn had to leave her husband in Emden, which must have been a terrible experience for her knowing that the town was continually under attack.
* Frieda had retired from teaching in 1945 and cared for her husband through his illness.
* Frieda Hahn continued to live in Emden, but after the death of her husband she lived with her daughter Ingeborg.
* There is one aspect of Frieda Hahn's life which we have not mentioned above.

Born 18 June 1884, Cottbus, Brandenburg, Germany. Died 6 November 1966, Bad Godesberg, Bonn, Germany.
