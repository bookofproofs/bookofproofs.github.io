**Frieda Nugel ** was a German mathematician who was one of the first women to receive a doctorate in Germany.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Nugel then began her studies at Berlin University, attending lectures in mathematics, physics and German.
* It is worth looking for a moment at the mathematics department where Nugel was receiving her education.
* Nugel attended lectures by Frobenius and Schur, who at the time was a dynamic young lecturer.
* After three terms of study in Berlin, Nugel moved to the University of Munich where she spent one term attending lectures by Ferdinand Lindemann and Aurel Voss.
* In receiving a doctorate in mathematics, Nugel became one of the first German women to receive such a degree.
* Later in July Nugel passed the state examinations qualifying her to teach mathematics, physics and German in a Gymnasium.
* Immediately after passing these examinations, Nugel was appointed as a teacher in the Augusta school on Cottbus.
* There is one aspect of Frieda Hahn's life which we have not mentioned above.

Born 18 June 1884, Cottbus, Brandenburg, Germany. Died 6 November 1966, Bad Godesberg, Bonn, Germany.
