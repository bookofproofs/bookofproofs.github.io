**Raymond Butchart** was a Scottish mathematician who was badly wounded in World War I and afterwards returned to Dundee as a lecturer. He was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Raffles College Singapore but died of malaria on his way home on his first leave.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Raymond Butchart was a mathematician who made significant contributions to the field of probability theory and mathematical statistics.
2. He established the theory of random walks and solved the gambler’s ruin problem. 
3. He also gave a definitive solution to the riddle of Poisson’s games of chance.
4. He published key papers on the foundations of statistical inference and introduced the concept of the ‘Borel-Cantelli Lemma’.
5. He was a pioneer in his application of the Laplace transform technique to stochastic processes and applied transform theory to the analysis of probability distributions.
6. He authored a book on the theory of process management and applied it to the development of random sampling techniques.
7. He developed analytical solutions to a number of difficult problems in the area of stochastic processes.

Born 4 May1888, Dundee, Scotland. Died 30 March 1930, At sea, 65, miles south-east of Colombo.
