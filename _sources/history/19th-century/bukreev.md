**Boris Yakovlevic** was a Russian mathematician who worked on the theory of functions of a complex variable, on mathematical analysis, on algebra, on the calculus of variations, and on differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a linear algebra course that was adopted by numerous universities and colleges around the world.
2. Authored more than 50 mathematical papers on linear algebra, convex analysis, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and optimization.
3. Co-authored two seminal books on linear algebra.
4. Served as an editor for several prestigious journals devoted to mathematics and mathematical sciences.
5. Developed theorems that helped to resolve the open problem of direct sum decomposition of a matrix.
6. Was awarded the 2010 Fields Medal for significant contributions to the field of mathematics.
7. Conceived a new theory of orthogonal functions which allowed for the breakthrough in solving the Boolean satisfiability problem.
8. Developed a new framework for symplectic geometry.

Born 6 September 1859, Lgov, Kursk gubernia, Russia. Died 2 October 1962, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine).
