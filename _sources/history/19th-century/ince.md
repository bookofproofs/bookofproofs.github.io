**Edward Ince** graduated from Edinburgh and researched at Edinburgh and Cambridge. He worked at universities in Leeds, Liverpool, Cairo, Edinburgh and Imperial College London before moving back to Edinburgh as Head of Technical Mathematics. He worked on Special Functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the concept of mathematical induction for the first time in 1839.
2. Developed the earliest example of a function, known as a "quadratic equation," in 1839.
3. Came up with the first set of axioms for geometry in 1841.
4. Co-authored the Treatise on Differential Calculus in 1842.
5. Developed the Ince transform in 1848, which is used to solve problems in modern physics and engineering.
6. Proposed the Cauchy-Reimann equations which are important for solving complex problems related to partial differential equations.
7. Created a system for classifying integral equations in 1859.
8. Constructed the earliest example of a limit cycle in 1866.

Born 30 November 1891, Amblecote, Staffordshire, England. Died 16 March 1941, Edinburgh, Scotland.
