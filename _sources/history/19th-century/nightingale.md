**Florence Nightingale** is best known for her work as a nurse, but she was also a pioneering statistician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Named after the city of her birth, Nightingale was born at the Villa Colombia in Florence, Italy, on 12 May 1820.
* Her parents, William Edward Nightingale and his wife Frances Smith, were touring Europe for the first two years of their marriage.
* Nightingale's elder sister had been born in Naples the year before.
* The Nightingales gave their first born the Greek name for the city, which was Parthenope.
* William Nightingale had been born with the surname Shore but he had changed it to Nightingale after inheriting from a rich relative, Peter Nightingale of Lea, near Matlock, Derbyshire.
* When Nightingale was about five years old her father bought a house called Embley near Romsey in Hampshire.
* The early education of Parthenope and Florence was placed in the hands of governesses, later their Cambridge educated father took over the responsibility himself.
* Nightingale loved her lessons and had a natural ability for studying.
* Under her father's influence Nightingale became acquainted with the classics, Euclid, Aristotle, the Bible, and political matters.
* Although William Nightingale loved mathematics and had bequeathed this love to his daughter, he urged her to study subjects more appropriate for a woman.
* After many long emotional battles, Nightingale's parents finally gave their permission and allowed her to be tutored in mathematics.
* Nightingale was said to be Sylvester's most distinguished pupil.
* Lessons included learning arithmetic, geometry and algebra and prior to Nightingale entered nursing, she spent time tutoring children in these subjects.
* Nightingale's interest in mathematics extended beyond the subject matter.
* One of the people who also influenced Nightingale was the Belgian scientist Quetelet.
* Religion played an important part in Nightingale's life.
* Her unbiased view on religion, unusual at the time, was owed to the liberal outlook Nightingale found in her home.
* Although her parents were from a Unitarian background, Frances Nightingale found a more conventional denomination preferable and the girls were brought up as members of the Church of England.
* On 7 February 1837 Nightingale believed she heard her calling from God, whilst walking in the garden at Embley, although at this time though she did not know what this calling was.
* Nightingale developed an interest in the social issues of the time, but in 1845 her family was firmly against the suggestion of Nightingale gaining any hospital experience.
* While Nightingale was on a tour of Europe and Egypt starting in 1849, with family friends Charles and Selina Bracebridge, she had the chance to study the different hospital systems.
* In early 1850 Nightingale began her training as a nurse at the Institute of St Vincent de Paul in Alexandria, Egypt, which was a hospital run by the Roman Catholic Church.
* Nightingale visited Pastor Theodor Fliedner's hospital at Kaiserswerth, near Düsseldorf, in July 1850.
* Nightingale returned to Kaiserswerth, in 1851, to undertake 3 months of nursing training at the Institute for Protestant Deaconesses and from Germany she moved to a hospital in St Germain, near Paris, run by the Sisters of Mercy.
* On returning to London in 1853 Nightingale took up the unpaid position as the Superintendent at the Establishment for Gentlewomen during Illness at No 1 Harley Street.
* In response to this Nightingale was asked in a letter from her friend Sidney Herbert, the British Secretary for War, to become a nursing administrator to oversee the introduction of nurses to military hospitals.
* Although being female meant Nightingale had to fight against the military authorities at every step, she went about reforming the hospital system.
* With conditions which resulted in soldiers lying on bare floors surrounded by vermin and unhygienic operations taking place it is not surprising that, when Nightingale first arrived in Scutari, diseases such as cholera and typhus were rife in the hospitals.
* Whilst in Turkey, Nightingale collected data and organised a record keeping system, this information was then used as a tool to improve city and military hospitals.
* Nightingale's knowledge of mathematics became evident when she used her collected data to calculate the mortality rate in the hospital.
* Nightingale used this statistical data to create her Polar Area Diagram, or "coxcombs" as she called them.
* Using this information, Nightingale computed a mortality rate of 1,174 per 10,000 with 1,023 per 10,000 being from zymotic diseases.
* On her return to London in August 1856, four months after the signing of the peace treaty, Nightingale discovered that soldiers during peacetime, aged between 20 and 35 had twice the mortality rate of civilians.
* While pressing her case, Nightingale gained the attention of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert as well as that of the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston.
* Nightingale hid herself from public attention, and became concerned for the army stationed in India.
* In 1858, for her contributions to army and hospital statistics Nightingale became the first woman to be elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society.
* In 1860, the Nightingale Training School and Home for Nurses based at St Thomas's Hospital in London, opened with 10 students.
* It was financed by the Nightingale Fund, a fund of public contributions set up during Nightingale's time in the Crimea and had raised a total of £50,000.
* Due to the foundation of this school Nightingale had achieved the transformation of nursing from its disreputable past into a responsible and respectable career for women.
* Nightingale responded to the British war office's request for advice on army medical care in Canada and was also a consultant to the United States government on army health during the American Civil War.
* For most of the remainder of her life Nightingale was bedridden due to an illness contracted in the Crimea, which prevented her from continuing her own work as a nurse.
* Nightingale's other published works included Notes on Hospitals (1859) and Notes on Nursing for the Labouring Classes (1861).
* Florence Nightingale deeply believed that her work had been her calling from God.
* In 1874 she became an honorary member of the American Statistical Association and in 1883 Queen Victoria awarded Nightingale the Royal Red Cross for her work.
* Nightingale died on 13 August 1910 aged 90.
* Nightingale never married, although this was not from lack of opportunity.
* The Crimean Monument, erected in 1915 in Waterloo Place, London, was done so in honour of the contribution Florence Nightingale had made to this war and the health of the army.

Born 12 May 1820, Florence (now Italy). Died 13 August 1910, East Wellow, England.
