**Florence Nightingale** is best known for her work as a nurse, but she was also a pioneering statistician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Revamped hospital record-keeping using mathematical models and analysis to dramatically improve death and recovery rates.
2. Developed the “coxcomb” diagrams, creating innovative visuals of hospital data to better understand medical problems.
3. Used algebra and regression analysis to conduct an analysis of the mortality rates in the British Army.
4. Designed a cartography-based system of ward-specific death and recovery rates, the first of its kind in the world.
5. Pioneered the use of interactive graphics and data visualization, allowing for better communication of statistical results.
6. Developed a system for assessing hospital hygiene and recorded data to track progress.
7. Introduced statistical methods to hospital settings such as averages, measures of frequency and displacement.

Born 12 May 1820, Florence (now Italy). Died 13 August 1910, East Wellow, England.
