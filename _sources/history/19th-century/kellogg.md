**Oliver Kellogg** was an American mathematician best known for his work on potential theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However Oliver's father was also an academic and he later left the priesthood to take up a professorship of English literature at the University of Kansas.
* Day Otis Kellogg was also important as the American editor of Encyclopaedia Britannica.
* Oliver studied as an undergraduate at Princeton University, entering in 1895.
* After receiving his A.B. in 1899, Kellogg continued his studies for a Master's Degree at Princeton.
* Kellogg spent the year 1900-01 at the University of Berlin, then moved to GÃ¶ttingen where he spent 1901-02 working for his doctorate.
* Fredholm had just published a major work on the Dirichlet problem but Fredholm's methods did not apply to the regions which Hilbert suggested Kellogg investigate.
* In 1902 Kellogg published his first paper giving a direct proof of Fredholm's inversion formula.
* However Kellogg soon became less than happy with these papers.
* Secondly some of Kellogg's results were incomplete and others were incorrect.
* Kellogg was appointed to the University of Missouri in 1905 where, despite a heavy teaching and administrative load he was able to publish impressive papers on potential theory.
* This paper includes what today is called 'Kellogg's theorem' on harmonic and Green's functions.
* Although he would return to potential theory, Kellogg next published a number of papers on sets of real orthogonal functions.
* Kellogg published the paper Invariant points in function space  jointly with G D Birkhoff in 1922.
* This contains the Birkhoff-Kellogg Theorem which generalises the Brouwer fixed point theorem.
* Kellogg published the classic text Foundations of potential theory  in 1929 (it was reprinted in 1967).
* While not specifically mentioned, many of the proofs in the volume - even of well-known results - are original and due to Kellogg himself.
* This volume also includes the first statement of the celebrated Kellogg-Evans Lemma (proven in generality by Griffith C Evans in 1933).
* Kellogg also wrote a number of papers on the existence of certain sets of functions in analysis as well as generalisations of polynomials due to Sergei Bernstein.
* Kellogg continued to work at Harvard until his death which resulted from a heart attack which he suffered while climbing near Greenville, Maine.

Born 10 July 1878, Linwood, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 26 July 1932, Greenville, Maine, USA.
