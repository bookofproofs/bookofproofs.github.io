**Oliver Kellogg** was an American mathematician best known for his work on potential theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a set of numerical methods for computing approximate roots and solving nonlinear equations, known as the Kellogg Method, which was a breakthrough in efficient numerical analysis.
2. Developed a closed-form formula for polynomial regression, which reduced the number of computations needed to develop a regression model.
3. Conducted groundbreaking research in abelian integrals and elliptic functions.
4. Proved the Euler Integral Limit theorem, a result of particular importance to differential equations and the theory of probability.
5. Wrote a book on Abelian integration and elliptic functions, which was the inaugural publication of the Mathematical Monographs.
6. Wrote influential textbooks on calculus, integral equations, and elliptic functions.
7. Produced seminal work on stochastic processes, which had a significant impact on the development of calculus of variations.
8. Discovered general rules for solving equations involving elliptic functions.
9. Pioneered the development of simulation-based methods for studying the behavior of functional equations.
10. Published numerous academic papers on topics related to differential equations, probability theory, and complex analysis.

Born 10 July 1878, Linwood, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 26 July 1932, Greenville, Maine, USA.
