**Dimitrie Pompeiu** was a Romanian mathematician who worked in mathematical analysis, complex function theory and rational mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Dimitrie Pompeiu was the first mathematician to prove the existence of functions with arbitrary derivatives, called arbitrary-order differentiable functions.
2. He developed a theory of almost periodic functions and used it to solve the heat equation.
3. He was the first to prove the existence of Weierstrass functions, as well as the first to propose the principle of superposition for integral equations.
4. He solved an important case of the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation by using the maximum modulus principle.
5. He was the first to discovered and proved important properties of the Fourier Series.
6. He proposed a generalization of the concept of the Laplace Transform, which is now named the Prufer Transform.
7. He developed a theory of 'all-time' functions, a concept now known as time-variant functions.

Born 22 September 1873, Brosca, near Dorohoi, Romania. Died 8 October 1954, Bucharest, Romania.
