**Alfred Whitehead** was a mathematician and philosopher who collaborated with Bertrand Russell on _Principia Mathematica _ (1910-13).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published, with Bertrand Russell, the influential work Principia Mathematica (1910-1913), which sought to reduce mathematics to logic. 
2. Developed a theory of natural deduction which challenged traditional syllogistic logic. 
3. Advanced the study of the foundations of mathematics through his works On Mathematical Concepts of the Material World (1914) and An Introduction to Mathematics (1911).
4. Developed the theory of symbolic logic and combinatory logic in his works Symbolic Logic (1902-03) and Universal Algebra (1903).
5. Co-developed a theory of quantum mechanics, based on the principle of relativity, in his book The Principle of Relativity (1920).
6. Developed a theory of partial differential equations in his writings The Principle of Relativity and in the first part of his book The Concept of Nature (1920). 
7. Published "The Algebra of Logic" (1898), in which he introduced a three-valued logic known as tertium non datur.

Born 15 February 1861, Ramsgate, Isle of Thanet, Kent, England. Died 30 December 1947, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
