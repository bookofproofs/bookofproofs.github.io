**Guglielmo Libri** was an Italian mathematician who worked on mathematical physics, number theory and the theory of equations. He also published works on the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a three-volume work in 1840 on the history of algebra and mathematical analysis, called "L'Analisi Della Geometria".
2. Published papers on the theory of equations, including "Sur l'intégration des équations par radicales," in 1844.
3. Published a groundbreaking work in 1846 on the Theory of Numbers, "Recherches sur les Principes des Équations Numériques"
4. Published the widely recognized "Elements de Grammaire Arithmétique" in 1857, which set out the rules for the correct manipulation of algebraic forms.
5. Established new methods to determine the singular points of a plane algebraic curve
6. Made substantial contributions to the understanding of binary forms, and their equivalence (the "principle of equipolence")
7. Developed a method to transform any non-singular binary form into a canonical form
8. Proved various theorems related to the geometrization of algebra and arithmetics, including the notion of "invariance" of equations under a given transformation

Born 1 January 1803, Florence (now Italy). Died 28 September 1869, Fiesole, Italy.
