**Gury Vasilievich Kolosov** was a Russian mathematician who worked on the theory of elasticity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new method of solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), which is now known as the Kolosov Method.
2. Discovered a new type of PDE, which is now referred to as the Kolosov-Krylov equation.
3. Discovered a fundamental new property of the solutions to linear homogeneous PDEs, known as the Kolosov Lemma.
4. Proved the existence of quadratic linear and nonlinear integrals of motion for Hamiltonian systems of arbitrary dimensions.
5. Developed a new technique for constructing exact solutions of Hamiltonian systems with polynomial integrals of motion.
6. Established a general criterion for the integrability of Hamiltonian systems with polynomial integral. 
7. Made significant contributions to the mathematical theory of non-integrable Hamiltonian systems.
8. Developed an algorithm for solving nonlinear integrable equations in celestial mechanics.
9. Demonstrated their practical applications by producing solutions of boundary value problems for two-dimensional celestial mechanics.
10. Successfully reconstructed and analyzed the dynamic behavior of parametrized Hamiltonian systems and their perturbations.

Born 25 August 1867, Ust, Novgorod guberniya, Russia. Died 7 November 1936, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
