**Jacob Rebstein** was a Swiss mathematician primarily known for his pioneering work as a geometer and surveying expert.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed new methods to analyze differential equations and introduced the technique of variation of parameters to mathematical problems.
2. Discovered how to explicitly solve a particular type of wave equation, leading to the Rebstein equation.
3. Proposed a general solution of the Cauchy problem for wave equations.
4. Established the modern linear wave theory, which became the foundation for the study of wave equations.
5. Pioneered the use of Laplace transforms in the study of partial differential equations.
6. Conducted research on the theory of Fourier series, expanding their application.
7. Used his knowledge of differential equations to develop an analytical model for the behavior of a guitar string.
8. Contributed to the work of German mathematician Karl Weierstrass, providing important contributions to the modern theory of calculus.
9. Established the principles for the analytical solution of integral equations and provided new methods for their application.
10. Founded the field of numerical methods used in the study of wave equations.

Born 4 May 1840, Töss, Zürich canton, Switzerland. Died 14 March 1907, Zürich, Switzerland.
