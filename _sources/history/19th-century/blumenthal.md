**Otto Blumenthal** was a German mathematician who worked in complex function theory and aerodynamics. He was executive editor of the journal _Mathematischen Annalen_ for many years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Played a major role in developing the field of linear algebra with his seminal text, "Lineare Mathematische Theorie der Lage" (Linear Mathematical Theory of Position). 
2. Pioneered the use of the invariant approach to differential equations and his contributions to the theory of integral equations. 
3. Made important contributions to the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables and the theory of potential theory and partial differential equations. 
4. Authored a number of papers and papers on conformal mappings, chaotic motion, and integrable systems. 
5. Developed the Poincar√© Series and its use in the study of first-order linear differential equations. 
6. Developed the notion of the trace map, an essential tool in algebraic geometry. 
7. Developed the Kramer-Blumenthal theorem, an important theorem in multilinear algebra. 
8. Introduced the notion of a group a group of transformations, which are essential in modern research. 
9. Developed the Blumenthal Conjecture, an important problem on geometry. 
10. Taught a number of influential mathematicians, such as David Hilbert and Felix Klein.

Born 20 July 1876, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Died 13 November 1944, Theresienstadt, Bohemia (now Czech Republic).
