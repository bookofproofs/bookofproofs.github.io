**Karl Rohn**  was a German mathematician, who studied geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1884 Rohn was promoted to extraordinary professor at Leipzig, then in 1887 he became a full professor at Technische Hochschule in Dresden where he held the chair of descriptive geometry.
* He said that Rohn's work on this topic was the most significant.
* One of Rohn's models for the Kummer surface uses the generating lines on a hyperboloid of one sheet.
* Gifted with a strong spatial intuition, Rohn possessed outstanding ability to select geometric facts from algebraic relations.
* Rohn constructed models of surfaces and space curves that he was studying, particularly in the early part of his career.
* In 1884 the Jablonowski Society proposed as prize problem asking for essays on the general surface of order 4, extending the work of Schläfli, Klein and Zeuthen on cubic surfaces; they awarded the prize to Rohn for his essay in 1886.
* Rohn was made rector of the Technical University of Dresden during 1900-01.
* In Dresden, Rohn gave the course 'Darstellende Geometrie' in the summer of 1904.
* From 1 April 1905 until his death, Rohn held the chair of mathematics at the University of Leipzig.
* Let us look briefly at some of the mathematical highlights of Rohn's career, some of which have already been mentioned.
* Rohn published three papers contributing to this problem.
* After Rohn's death, the book Stereometrie: Ein Handbuch für Studierende und Lehrer Ⓣ(Stereometry: A Handbook for Students and Teachers) (1922) was published.
* Dr Rohn was himself a pupil of Professor Klein, and the latter, in his appreciative introduction, speaks highly of his skill in the field of geometry.

Born 28 January 1855, Schwanheim (near Bensheim), Hesse, Germany. Died 4 August 1920, Leipzig, Germany.
