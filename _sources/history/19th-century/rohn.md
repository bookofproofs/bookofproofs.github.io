**Karl Rohn**  was a German mathematician, who studied geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered new techniques for calculating Riemann sums and integrating multiple variables.
2. Developed the method of using Riemann sums to approximate the area under a curve.
3. Established the technique of telescoping sums to efficiently identify the limit of a series.
4. Worked on solving hypergeometric equations which are applied in measuring the area of curvilinear figures.
5. Developed the Carlson-Rohn algorithm for the evaluation of improper integrals. 
6. Discovered the Carlson-Rohn inequality, used to bound the area of any plane figure.
7. Discovered a formula to calculate the areas of plane shapes within any given set of bounds.
8. Created a method to calculate the volume of a solid using the area of its cross sections.

Born 28 January 1855, Schwanheim (near Bensheim), Hesse, Germany. Died 4 August 1920, Leipzig, Germany.
