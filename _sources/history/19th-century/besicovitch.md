**Abram Besicovitch** was a Russian mathematician who worked mainly in England on functions of a real variable, analytic functions and almost periodic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first mathematician to define the concept of a measure, which led to the development of a rigorous theory of integration.
2. He introduced the concept of the Besicovitch number for the study of non constancy of the harmonic measure. 
3. He formulated the syndetic covering theorem, a generalization of the Vitali covering theorem from integrals to sets.
4. He was the first person to note the connection between point-set topology and measure theory.
5. He proved the Besicovitch Almost Periodic Functions theorem, a form of generalized Fourier series.
6. He described the concept of 'vector measure,' which has applications in partial differential equations.
7. He proved the Besicovitch Summability Theorem, which states that a series of real numbers can be summable to any given degree.
8. He was the first to systematically study irrational numbers using metric geometry. 
9. He made major contributions to symmetry sets, including the 'pumping theorem' which he described in depth in his paper 'Symmetry Sets'.
10. He made significant advances in the area of Banach Spaces and introduced the Besicovitch Covering Property to show that any discrete set in a Banach space is a coverable set.

Born 24 January 1891, Berdyansk, Russia. Died 2 November 1970, Cambridge, England.
