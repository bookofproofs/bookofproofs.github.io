**Abram Besicovitch** was a Russian mathematician who worked mainly in England on functions of a real variable, analytic functions and almost periodic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Samuel Besicovitch had been a jeweller but his jeweller's shop had hit hard times through theft and he gave up the business and became a cashier.
* This in itself presented problems since, as Valentina Vietalievna was of the Orthodox faith and Besicovitch was a Karaim, they were not allowed to marry.
* Besicovitch was accepted into the Russian Orthodox Church so that the marriage could take place.
* In 1917 the University of Perm became an independent institution and in that year Besicovitch was appointed professor of mathematics there.
* As the Red Army had approached, all the staff except Besicovitch had left the University.
* Perm suffered badly in the troubles of 1919 despite the best efforts of Besicovitch to protect the books and other university property.
* Besicovitch had to teach people without any educational background and he was very unhappy.
* Besicovitch left Petrograd for Copenhagen in 1924 and there worked with Harald Bohr.
* After he visited Oxford in 1925 Hardy, who quickly saw the mathematical genius in Besicovitch, found a post for him in Liverpool.
* At Cambridge Besicovitch lectured on analysis in most years but he also gave an advanced course on a topic which was directly connected with his research interests such as almost periodic functions, Hausdorff measure, or the geometry of plane sets.
* Besicovitch never seems to have been troubled in this way.
* Besicovitch, around 1930, extended his density properties of sets to those of finite Hausdorff measure.
* The figures that resulted from Besicovitch's construction were highly complicated, unbounded figures.
* Other areas on which Besicovitch worked included geometric measure theory, Hausdorff measure, real function theory, and complex function theory.
* In addition to this work on deep mathematical theories, Besicovitch loved problems, particularly those which could be stated in elementary terms but which proved resistant to attack.
* Besicovitch showed that this was false and that the man had a path which meant that the lion would never catch him, although he would come arbitrarily close.
* Besicovitch received many honours for his work.

Born 24 January 1891, Berdyansk, Russia. Died 2 November 1970, Cambridge, England.
