**Faa di Bruno** is best known for his formula for the _n_th derivative of a composition of functions. He was beatified in 1988

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the formula for higher derivatives known as Faà di Bruno’s formula, in 1855.
2. Developed the notion of multiple integral from the concept of multiple derivative. 
3. Identified the exponential integral function, which bears his name. 
4. Coined the term binomial coefficient in a memoir published in the Annali di Scienze Matematiche e Fisiche in 1877. 
5. Developed methods for solving higher-order and nonlinear differential equations in 1877.
6. Found the solution of a recurrence equation known as Faà di Bruno's equation in 1857. 
7. Contributed to the development of differential equations by solving the differential equation of the second order.
8. Published work in Algebra, Number Theory, and Calculus in numerous publications.

Born 29 March 1825, Alessandria, Piemonte (now Italy). Died 27 March 1888, Turin, Italy.
