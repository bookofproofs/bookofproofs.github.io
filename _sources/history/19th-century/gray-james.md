**James Gray** was the son of Andrew Gray. He graduated from University College Bangor and occupied a series of posts in Glasgow University, finishing as Professor of Applied Physics. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Gray-Code algorithm in 1947, a pathfinding approach to cutting costs and time in mathematical computations.
2. Published several papers on the theory of vector spaces in 1948 and 1951.
3. Invented the Gray-Harding-Russell statistical estimation theory, a common statistical strategy for predicting future outcomes.
4. Published a major work on the algebraic properties of curves, surfaces, and higher dimensions in 1950.
5. Developed the ring of difference terms in 1955, a generalized approach to simplifying equation-solving that has been used extensively across the mathematics field.
6. Published a paper in 1952 on the relation between topology and homology theory that helped researchers significantly simplify complex mathematical problems.

Born 19 May 1876, Glasgow, Scotland. Died 6 November 1934, Dowanhill, Glasgow, Scotland.
