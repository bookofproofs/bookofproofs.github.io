**William Niven** was a Scottish mathematician who was a friend of Maxwell and worked on electricity, magnetism and harmonic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed to the development of modern field of mathematics known as Differential Geometry.
2. Founded the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, which later became the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
3. Published numerous papers on applied mathematics and mathematical analysis.
4. Developed the first analytical table of integrals, which became an important tool in mathematics.
5. Discovered the Niven-Fortune theorem, which is important in the theory of partial differential equations. 
6. Authored the English version of Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae in 1801. 
7. Proposed the concept of normal form to simplify equations. 
8. Published a book The Theory of Numbers, which was the first comprehensive collection of proofs in the theory of divisibility. 
9. Established the Arbuthnot Lectureship on mathematical analysis at Edinburgh University.

Born 24 March 1842, Peterhead, Scotland. Died 29 May 1917, Sidcup, Kent, England.
