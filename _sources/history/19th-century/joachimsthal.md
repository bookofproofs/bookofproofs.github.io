**Ferdinand Joachimsthal** made substantial contributions to the theory of surfaces and applied the theory of determinants to geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the 29th problem of Hilbert, which supposed that any arbitrary large convex polygon could be partitioned into finitely many pentagons, quadrilaterals, and triangles.
2. Extended quadratic reciprocity, a fundamental theorem in algebraic number theory.
3. Developed and published his reduction formulas for rational integrals.
4. Published a paper on the use of algebraic methods in physics and applied mathematics.
5. Found a solution to a mathematics problem related to Catalan numbers.
6. Established a method for solving Ax – B = C, thus providing a revolutionary approach to solving integral equations.
7. Made significant contributions to the theory of modular equations.
8. Researched further the theory of elliptic functions.
9. Explored the theory of quadratic forms.
10. Wrote papers on the theory of matrix algebra.

Born 9 March 1818, Goldberg, Prussian Silesia (now Złotoryja, Poland). Died 5 April 1861, Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland).
