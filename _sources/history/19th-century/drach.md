**Jules Drach** was a French mathematician who worked on number theory, partial differential equations, and differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He researched and made important contributions to number theory, specifically in the fields of diophantine approximation, diophantine equations, and Diophantine geometry. 
2. He demonstrated that certain integral solutions of equations can be closely approximated by simple fractional solutions of the same equation. 
3. He also studied several problems in algebraic geometry, such as the Archimedean Curve, as well as probabilistic and dynamical problems in algebraic number theory. 
4. He wrote several important papers and gave more than 40 lectures in international mathematics seminars. 
5. He was the first to give an example of a diophantine equation of the fifth degree with a single integral solution, which was groundbreaking for the field.
6. He helped extend the algebraic geometry developed by Hilbert and published several books on the subject. 
7. He also wrote several papers that proposed new theories in number theory, such as proving a conjecture related to integers that are divisible by 3.

Born 13 March 1871, Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines (near Colmar), France. Died 8 March 1949, Cavalaire, Var, France.
