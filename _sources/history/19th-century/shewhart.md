**Walter Andrew Shewhart** was an American physicist, engineer and statistician who worked on statistical quality control.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published The Economics of Quality in 1931, which outlined the concept of statistical process control. 
2. Developed the Shewhart Cycle, which illustrated the relationship between variation and improvement. 
3. Pioneered the concept of standard deviation relative to process efficiency and quality. 
4. Established the basis for the field of statistical quality control. 
5. Produced planning, inspection and control charts, which made it easier to understand statistical variability. 
6. Created control limits and demonstrated the importance of separating "common" variation from "special" variation. 
7. Developed the concept of inferring the presence of assignable causes by analyzing data. 
8. Proposed the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle.

Born 18 March 1891, New Canton Illinois, USA. Died 11 March 1967, Troy Hills, New Jersey, USA.
