**Pierre Humbert** graduated from the École Polytechnique in Paris and then moved to Edinburgh to do research under Whittaker. He spent most of his career in the University of Montpellier. He worked on Special Functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Pierre's mother died when he was very young and he therefore never knew her.
* However, his father remarried when Pierre was about nine years old so he at least had a step-mother from this time.
* All of Pierre Humbert's school education took place in Paris, and following this he went on to attend the École Polytechnique there entering the famous French university in 1910.
* At the University of Edinburgh Humbert undertook research under Whittaker whose philosophy of mathematics, and of science more generally, fitted in precisely with those of Humbert.
* After receiving a wound Humbert was no longer fit enough to continue to take part in the military action and so he was able to continue his research.
* Humbert's father Georges Humbert had gifts which extended beyond mathematics.
* Pierre, like his father, was a Roman Catholic and he mixed his religious beliefs with one of his other great loves, namely teaching, in his work for the Joseph Lotte Association which was an organisation for Catholic public school teachers.
* Humbert married the daughter of the astronomer Henri Andoyer and this, certainly in part, increased his interest in the history of astronomy.
* Humbert had a fine reputation as a lecturer and also was a talented organiser.

Born 13 June 1891, Paris, France. Died 17 November 1953, Paris, France.
