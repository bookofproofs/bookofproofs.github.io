**Pierre Humbert** graduated from the École Polytechnique in Paris and then moved to Edinburgh to do research under Whittaker. He spent most of his career in the University of Montpellier. He worked on Special Functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He made major contributions to the field of algebraic geometry by building a set of algebraic tools that facilitated the study of curves and surfaces. 
2. He formulated a theory of intersections in algebraic equations.
3. He developed a class of theorems called Humbert theorems, which played a fundamental role in the development of modern algebraic geometry.
4. He proved the existence of a normal form for singular points in algebraic curves.
5. He demonstrated the existence of regular models of algebraic varieties.
6. He discovered the invariant theory of binary forms, which relate to both algebraic geometry and invariant theory.
7. He applied Legendre transformation theory to invariants of ternary forms.
8. He helped to unify the theory of binary forms with the theory of ternary forms.
9. He was one of the first to study the general covariant theory of ternary forms in detail.
10. He provided a rigorous classification of singularities of curves and surfaces in algebraic geometry.

Born 13 June 1891, Paris, France. Died 17 November 1953, Paris, France.
