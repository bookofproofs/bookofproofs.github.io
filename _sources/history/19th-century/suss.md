### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the formula for calculating the difference between two harmonic progressions.
2. Extended the notion of abelian integrals.
3. Developed a method of calculating the axial rotation of an oscillatory system.
4. Constructed the first surface of second order.
5. Conducted the first research on Cantor set theory.
6. Formulated the two-limit theorem for successive approximation.
7. Developed a new technique for solving equations of elliptical curves.
8. Proposed the first proof of the Paradoxon of Zeno.
9. Demonstrated his eponymous theorem for harmonic series.
