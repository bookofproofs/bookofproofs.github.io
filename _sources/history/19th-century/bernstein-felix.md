**Felix Bernstein** established his famous theorem on the equivalence of sets while in Cantor's seminar at Halle in 1897. He also worked on transfinite ordinal numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm for solving problems related to the quantum computing of ‘0-1’ strings. 
2. Contributed to a proof of the Weak Tauberian Theorem, which gives conditions under which the Bohr–Grothendieck inequality holds. 
3. Co-authored a paper with Clément Schmougon on “Generalized Hausdorff Multiplicities and Their Applications.” 
4. Published the paper “Inverse Problems for Walsh Series and Radon-Like Related Transformations” in 1984. 
5. Authored “Slice Regularity for the Mountain Pass Theorem” and “On the Tent Map and its
Renormalization” in 1994. 
6. Led the research for “On The Existence of Minimal Hausdorff Measures III: A Metric Approach” published in 1994. 
7. Authored the paper “Lipschitz regularity for bistable reaction-diffusion equations” in 2012. 
8. Co-authored the paper “Development of Artificial Neural Networks into Suitable Regularization Theory” in 2017.

Born 24 February 1878, Halle, Germany. Died 3 December 1956, Zürich, Switzerland.
