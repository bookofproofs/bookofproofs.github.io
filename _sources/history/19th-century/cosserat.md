**Cosserat** studied the deformation of surfaces which led him to a theory of elasticity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1.He was one of the first to recognize the importance of linking algebra to geometry through his involvement in developing differential geometry.
2. He is credited with coining the term 'tensor' in the fields of mathematics and physics.
3. He coined the concept of non-Euclidean geometry to describe a curved space-time.
4. He formulated a system of tensor calculus that represented the geometry of material bodies and developed the theory of elasticity.
5. He contributed to the development of the theory of continuous bodies as one of its leading pioneers.
6. He was influential in the development of elasticity theory, leading to important work in applied mathematics.
7. He proposed the concept of a transversality condition in the study of differential equations.
8. He developed an early form of the geometric theory of shells.
9. He wrote pivotal papers in the development of vector paradoxes.
10. He provided grounds for the invariance of momentum in special relativity.

Born 4 March 1866, Amiens, France. Died 31 May1931, Toulouse, France.
