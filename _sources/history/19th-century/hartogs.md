**Friedrich  Hartogs** was a Belgian mathematician, known for his work on set theory and foundational results on several complex variables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Hartogs established the Hartogs–Friedrichs theorem, which is used in partial differential equations to show that solutions to a hyperbolic equation depend continuously on the initial data.
2. He contributed to the development of abstract measure theory, including the proof of Lusin's theorem, which has been referred to as the Hartogs–Lusin theorem.
3. He also developed modern point-set topology and axiomatic set theory.
4. He proved the Urysohn metrization theorem, a fundamental result in the study of topological spaces, in 1923. 
5. Hartogs also made contributions to the fields of set theory, tensor calculus and calculus of variations.

Born 20 May1874, Brussels, Belgium. Died 18 August 1943, Munich, Germany.
