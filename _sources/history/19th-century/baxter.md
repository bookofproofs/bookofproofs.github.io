**Agnes Baxter** was a Canadian mathematician who became only the second Canadian woman to be awarded Ph.D. in Mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Robert Baxter was born on 9 February 1844 in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland to Robert Baxter and Elizabeth Grieve, and died in 1918.
* Agnes' mother, Janet Methven, was born on 13 July 1846 in Scoonie, Fife, Scotland to Colville Methven and Helen Syme, and died in 1936.
* Robert and Janet Baxter were married in Cults, Fife, Scotland in 1869 and emigrated to Canada in that year.
* Robert Baxter and his wife had both been brought up in Scotland where Robert had been the manager of an electric light company before emigrating to Nova Scotia.
* Robert and Janet Baxter had four children: Agnes Sime Baxter (1870-1917), the subject of this biography, Robert Colin Baxter (1872-1879) who died aged 6 or 7, Elizabeth Campbell Baxter (1883-1932) and Norman McLeod Baxter (1883-1937).
* Mr Baxter was born at Halifax, Nova Scotia, 27 June 1883, and attended University Dalhousie (Nova Scotia) and the University of Nebraska.
* From 1919 to 1922 Mr Baxter was associated briefly with a public utility company in Connecticut and with the engineering department of The Toledo (Ohio) Edison Company.
* The only details that we have found for Agnes' sister Elizabeth Campbell Baxter are from Border Crossing records when she visited Agnes in Columbia in the United States (for example in 1915) and from Canadian censuses.
* Little is known of Agnes's childhood and pre-university education, other than the few details given in the Canadian censuses of 1871 and 1881.
* Baxter had been taught mathematics at Dalhousie University by Charles Macdonald (1828-1901) and mathematical physics by James Gordon MacGregor (1852-1913).
* It must have been a difficult time for a woman such as Baxter taking what were considered at that time to be men's subjects.
* Although few women studied mathematics, Baxter was not the only one studying mathematics at Dalhousie; for example there were two other women in the class of 24 that studied second level mathematics with her.
* With the award of her B.A. degree Baxter became the first ever woman to graduate with honours from Dalhousie University.
* Miss Baxter spent another year in the study of Mathematics and Mathematical Physics and was awarded the degree of M.A. in 1892.
* In fact the first three women to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics from Cornell University, Ida Metcalf (Ph.D. thesis Geometric Duality in Space, 1893), Annie MacKinnon (Ph.D. thesis Concomitant Binary Forms in Terms of the Roots, 1894) and Agnes Baxter (Ph.D. 1895) were all advised by James Oliver.
* When she graduated in 1895, Baxter became only the second Canadian woman to be awarded Ph.D. in Mathematics.
* James Oliver died in the year that Baxter was awarded her Ph.D. and his mathematical notes were edited by Baxter for publication.
* Albert Ross Hill had graduated from Dalhousie University in the same year as Baxter and had also studied for a doctorate at Cornell but his topic was philosophy, not mathematics.
* In 1896, the year after Ross Hill and Baxter were awarded their doctorates from Cornell, they married in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada on 20 August and moved to Lincoln, Nebraska where Ross Hill became a professor of philosophy at the University of Nebraska.
* Baxter decided to give up her promising mathematics career in order to support her husband's academic career.
* A simple rectangular stone engraved with "Agnes B Hill, March 18, 1870.
* Dalhousie University has, however, gone further in recognising Agnes Baxter.
* On 15 March 1988 the Agnes Baxter Reading Room in the Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Computing Science at Dalhousie University was dedicated in a ceremony.
* The Sir William Young Gold Medal which Baxter won in 1891 was gifted to the Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Computing Science is on show forming part of a display in her memory.
* Finally, let us note that Agnes' elder daughter Jessie Methven Hill married the Professor of English Ralph Allan McCanse (1893-1971) on 9 September 1933 in Missouri.
* Agnes' younger daughter, Esther Davidson Hill, married Registrar and Secretary of the Princeton Divinity Faculty, Rev Edward Howell Roberts (1895-1954), on 22 December 1928 in Jackson, Kansas City, Missouri.

Born 18 March 1870, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Died 9 March 1917, Columbia, Missouri, USA.
