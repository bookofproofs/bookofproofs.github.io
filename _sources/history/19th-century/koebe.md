**Paul Koebe** was a German mathematician who worked on complex functions. His colleagues found him brilliant but difficult.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Theory of Koebe Space (1907), which laid the foundation for geometric topology.
2. Formulated the Koebe–Andreev–Thurston theorem (1932), which shows the equivalence between circle packing and certain uniform plane tessellations.
3. Proved the Uniformization Theorem (1936), which states that every simply connected Riemann surface can be represented as a plane with a metric or a plane with a polygon marked in it.
4. Discovered a theorem that each digitally convex polygon is inscribed in a unique convex body (1937).
5. Constructed two-dimensional regular polyhedral graphs whose edges are moving straight lines (1940).
6. Proved the Koebe 1/4 theorem (1941), which states that any two overlapping closed sets in the plane share a common point whose distance from the centers of the two sets is the average of the distances from those centers to their respective boundaries.

Born 15 February 1882, Luckenwalde, Germany. Died 6 August 1945, Leipzig, Germany.
