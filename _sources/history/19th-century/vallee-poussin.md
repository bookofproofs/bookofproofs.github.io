**Vallée Poussin** is best known for his proof of the prime number theorem and his major work _Cours d'Analyse _.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved Fubini's theorem, a theorem related to the theory of integration over multiple variables.
2. Found a proof of the theorem of uniform convergence of series of functions.
3. Published a book titled Leçons sur la Théorie des Fonctions in 1908, which was a significant impact on the study of Fourier Analysis.
4. Developed the concept of abstract measure theory and the integral of Banach-Steinhaus.
5. Established calculus for Lebesgue's measure.
6. Demonstrated the existence of a solution to the Dirichlet problem.
7. Streamlined the proof of a fundamental theorem in the calculus of variations.
8. Solely solved the prime number problem of Dirichlet using analytic methods.
9. Found a basis in terms of trigonometric series for the summation of arbitrary Fourier series.

Born 14 August 1866, Louvain, Belgium. Died 2 March 1962, Louvain, Belgium.
