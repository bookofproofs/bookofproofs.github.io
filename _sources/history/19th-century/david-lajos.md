**Lajos Dávid** was  a Hungarian mathematician known for his work on the arithmetic/geometric mean and as a historian of mathematics, particularly on Bolyai.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of so-called Regular Mixing Sets, which made real-algebraic algebraic geometry available for an even wider range of applications. 
2. Developed the theory of hyperbolic algebraic geometry, resulting in works such as the Quadric-Surface Tables. 
3. Established the Weighted Regular Polytopic Theory and invented the notion of specific types of planes. 
4. Developed the theory of algebraic varieties and the notion of triangles. 
5. Created the Dávid Polynomials system and introduced a new technique for finding root nodes of algebraic equations. 
6. Laid the foundations for the modern theory of algebraic equations and the theory of algebraic functions. 
7. Discovered a number of new results in continuous algebraic geometry. 
8. Pioneered the field of convex algebraic geometry and established methods for describing algebraic curves in 3D. 
9. Developed the symbolic method for solving group theory problems, which provided an easier way to solve group problems. 
10. Investigated the properties of linear systems, discovering novel conditions for the existence of specific systems.

Born 28 May 1881, Kolozsvár, Hungary (now Cluj-Napoca, Romania). Died 9 January 1962, Leányfalu, near Budapest, Hungary.
