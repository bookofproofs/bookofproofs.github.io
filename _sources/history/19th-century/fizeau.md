**Hippolyte Fizeau**  was a French physicist, best known for measuring the speed of light.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to accurately measure the speed of light by attempting to evaluate the length of a moving gear wheel.
2. He constructed a device that measured the speed of light by shooting a narrow beam of light between two points, then measuring the time it took for the light to travel the distance.
3. He determined the law of double refraction, or the dispersion of a light beam into two discs when it passes through a prism.
4. He developed a method for analyzing the diffraction of light by an aperture that focused his research on frequency of light.
5. He established the concept of length contraction (also known as Fizeau's paradox), which states that moving objects contract in the direction of motion relative to an observer.
6. He made advances in the field of optical metrology, developing tools for accurate measurements of distances, angles, and light signals.
7. He proposed a mathematical model for describing the annular eclipse, which later helped Einstein in making his Theory of Relativity.

Born 23 September 1819, Paris, France. Died 18 September 1896, Nanteuil-le-Haudouin, Seine-et-Marne, France.
