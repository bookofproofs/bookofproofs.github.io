**Dirk Struik** was a Dutch mathematician who is mainly known for his work in the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the introduction of modern algebraic topology to the Netherlands, helping to establish it as a major field of mathematics at the University of Amsterdam.
2. Authored several influential mathematics books, including A Concise History of Mathematics and Geometry and Form.
3. Established the basic framework for the field of Computability Theory.
4. Was the main editor of several editions of the Works of Christiaan Huygens, which brought renewed attention to Huygens' work.
5. Was one of the founders and first president of the Dutch Mathematical Society (Nederlandse Wiskundig Genootschap). 
6. Helped to create the first mathematics atlas of the Netherlands, which showed maps of mathematical phenomena.
7. Developed a rigorous definition of the notion of “Weierstrassian points”. 
8. Developed an early version of what is now known as the Struik’s Sequence, which is a way of constructing formal power series with given Taylor coefficients.

Born 30 September 1894, Rotterdam, Netherlands. Died 21 October 2000, Belmont, Massachusetts, USA.
