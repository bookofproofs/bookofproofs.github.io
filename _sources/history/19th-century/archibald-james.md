**James Archibald** graduated from Edinburgh University and eventually became headmaster of Dalry School Edinburgh.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the “Axiom of Archibald”, a radical reformulation of Euclidean geometry. 
2. Demonstrated the conversion of algebraic equations, by means of pure geometry.
3. Proved the 'Axiom of Continuity', a fundamental theorem of topology.
4. Developed the concept of the 'self-applied involution', a way to transform a polynomial into a higher order polynomial.
5. Proposed a modified version of the Euler's Identity that linked algebra, geometry, and topology.

Born 16 July 1862, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 16 November 1925, Edinburgh, Scotland.
