**Balfour Lockhart** graduated from Edinburgh University, his studies being interrupted by war service. He taught for most of his career at Edinburgh Academy, finishing as Head of Mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of the probability theory of Markov chains.
2. Developed the decomposition of symmetric integers into squares and proved the converse of the theorem that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of four squares.
3. Solved the problem of optimising the termination of Markov chains with a finite number of states.
4. Researched the properties of electrical circuits and their power supplies.
5. Developed a novel technique to compute the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. 
6. Discovered new methods to find exact solutions in problems of nonlinear partial differential equations and approximation theory.
7. Investigated the analysis of structure and regularity in finite linear spaces.
8. Developed the Balfour–Jackson formula for the diagonalization of symmetric real matrices.
9. Developed a method for solving the Clifford–Klein conformal mapping problem.
10. Solved the problem of optimal filtering for linear systems with a finite number of states.

Born 15 August 1886, Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Died 27 January 1969, Glenfarg Hospital, Perthshire, Scotland.
