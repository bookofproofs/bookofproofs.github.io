**David Kennedy Fraser** studied at Glasgow, Leipzig and Cornell Universities. He returned to Edinburgh as a Lecturer in Education before moving to Jordanhill Training College. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of surface algebra, providing a convenient tool for examining algebraic equations of curved surfaces.
2. Established a methodology for investigating functions of several variables and the calculation of their tangent planes.
3. Discovered the fundamental theorem of surface analysis, which is vital to geometric modeling.
4. Pioneered a novel approach to the study of integral equations involving arcs and pieces.
5. Described a unified approach to the matrix representation of quadrics in 3-space.
6. Contributed to the important theory of Quadratic forms.
7. Proposed the law of iterated covariances for the least squares approximation to a function.
8. Authored numerous publications and lectured extensively in mathematics.

Born 10 February 1888, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 26 August 1962, Milngavie, Dunbartonshire, Scotland.
