**Léon Foucault** was a French mathematician and astronomer who is best known for his invention of a pendulum which demonstrates the rotation of the earth.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Foucault's pendulum in 1851 to measure the rotation of the Earth.
2. Established the first international Bureau of Longitudes in 1854.
3. Discovered the equivalence between thermodynamics and mechanics, giving birth to thermodynamics in the 1860s.
4. He developed a new method for calculating elliptic functions in the 1890s, leading to the discovery of the oblate spheroidal harmonics in 1895.
5. He proposed and explored a practical pendulum for clockmaking in 1867.
6. He proposed the concept of a 'singular point' in mathematics by applying zero-division theory to Abelian integrals in 1867.
7. Developed a new method for differentiating and integrating Fourier series in the 1870s.
8. Applied harmonic analysis to the study of the Moon's rotation in 1881.
9. Developed the volume-preserving transformation of a differential equation in 1883.
10. Demonstrated the circulation of Earth's atmosphere in 1888.

Born 18 September 1819, Paris, France. Died 11 February 1868, Paris, France.
