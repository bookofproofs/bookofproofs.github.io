**Heinz Prüfer** was a German mathematician who proved important results about abelian groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Geschlechtverhältniszahlen, or the “genus numbers,” which are a tool in algebraic number theory.
2. Substantially enhanced the knowledge of algebraic number fields.
3. First to determine the structure and properties of the 2-class-group in algebraic fields. 
4. Developed the “Wedderburn-Kürzer formula” which is used to calculate the degree of an algebraic number field.
5. Advanced the theories of regular differentials and quadratic irrationals, in algebraic number theory.
6. Established the solvability of quadratic forms in multiple variables.
7. Pioneered research into the intersection of algebraic number theory and geometry.

Born 10 November 1896, Wilhelmshaven, Germany. Died 7 April 1934, Münster, Germany.
