**Johann Listing** wrote one of the earliest texts on Topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the concept of a Venn diagram for depicting sets and their relationships.
2. Developed a famous counterexample, now known as 'Listing's law', to refute the belief that for every three consecutive real numbers, at least one of them is a multiple of the sum of the other two.
3. Invented a notation system for expressing mathematical symbolically expressions.
4. Published the first book on knot theory.
5. Developed a novel geometrical method to solve polynomial equations.
6. Founded several important properties of continuous functions, including what is known as 'Listing's theorem'.
7. Established the basis of the categorical approach to algebraic geometry and Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.
8. Discovered the concept of 'regular polytope', a shape with equal sides and angles.
9. Formulated the first axioms of projective geometry.
10. Introduced the concept of 'distance invariance' related to calculus of variations.

Born 25 July 1808, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Died 24 December 1882, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany.
