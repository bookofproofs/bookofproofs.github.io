**Johann Listing** wrote one of the earliest texts on Topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1825 Listing entered a Gymnasium where he studied for five years.
* Being an art foundation they could not support Listing to undertake a degree in mathematics, which would have been his preferred option, but instead awarded him the scholarship for the study of mathematics and architecture.
* Although there was a time when architecture was considered as a branch of mathematics, it certainly was not considered such in Listing's day so the combination was a rather peculiar one dictated by a compromise between Listing's wishes and the remit of the Städel foundation.
* Listing entered Göttingen University in 1830 and attended a remarkably broad range of courses, much broader than the mathematics and architecture specified by his scholarship.
* Soon Listing was attending mathematics courses given by Gauss and he was quickly spotted by Gauss as being both a very able and a very hard working student.
* Listing was not the only student invited into close friendship with Gauss.
* Another student was Sartorius von Walterhausen who was one year younger than Listing.
* Walterhausen, who was interested in geology, became a lifelong friend of Listing.
* The influence of Gauss on Listing was, however, very marked.
* It was from Gauss that Listing began to learn topological concepts.
* Gauss became the supervisor of Listing's dissertation De superficiebus secundi ordinis Ⓣ(Surfaces of the second order) which was on surfaces of the second degree and ternary forms.
* Listing was an obvious choice for an assistant to accompany him and the pair set off less than a month after Listing had obtained his doctorate.
* It was a journey on which Listing maintained his interests in many different topics and as well as the geology and physics which were the purpose of the trip.
* While on his travels Listing was approached by the Höhere Gewerbeschule Hannover asking if he would be interested in a post as a teacher of applied mathematics.
* Because of a cholera epidemic Sartorius and Listing delayed their return to Göttingen.
* Listing went to Hannover to be interviewed for the post in the Gewerbeschule and was appointed, starting his teaching career in November 1837.
* He produced a list of three names with Listing in third place.
* When the first two turned down the offer, Listing was appointed in 1839 despite never having published a paper.
* As professor of physics Listing could choose his area for research.
* As well as containing data from careful experimental work, the book was beautifully illustrated by Listing using all his skills in drawing and calligraphy.
* Listing continued to think about topological ideas, however, and he wrote the book Vorstudien zur Topologie in 1847.
* It was the first published use of the word topology although, as we mentioned above, it was first used in Listing's letter of 1836.
* Of course Listing had been appointed to fill Weber's chair so a compromise had to be reached.
* This was that Listing was promoted to ordinary professor of mathematical physics while Weber became professor of experimental physics.
* Although little changed in the research that Listing undertook, since he had always gone in the direction which interested him, he did have to give up a large part of his laboratory to Weber.
* The near bankruptcy came around the time that Listing was publishing another remarkable contribution to topology.
* It was Sartorius who had arranged for the rescue act by the ministry and here he was repaying a debt to Listing who had saved his life by nursing him through a serious illness during their journey of nearly thirty years earlier.
* The range of contributions made by Listing is quite remarkable.
* Among the honours which Listing did receive were election to the Göttingen Academy and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
