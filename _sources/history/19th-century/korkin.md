**Aleksandr Korkin** was a Russian mathematician whose major contribution was to the development of partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored seminal works on the algebraic idea of a genus, which contributed to the development of algebraic geometry.
2. Contributed to the development of linear algebra, by introducing new proofs and definitions of operations on matrices. 
3. Developed the theory of polyhedra, a field of algebraic topology. 
4. Developed a novel approach to Finite Differential Calculations, a branch of mathematical analysis.
5. Published influential works on differential equations and Boolean logic.
6. Developed a theorem that any polynomial of degree three with integer coefficients has at least one rational root.
7. Authored the founding work on topological stability theory, which remains an active area of research in dynamical systems theory.
8. Established the notion of a group of finite order in abstract algebra.
9. Developed an approach to the Riemann Hypothesis, a major open problem in mathematics.

Born 19 February 1837, Zhidovinovo, Tot'ma, Vologda, Russia. Died 1 September 1908, St Petersburg, Russia.
