**Edwin Abbott** was an English schoolmaster who wrote the popular book _Flatland_ as an introduction to higher dimensions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the influential book Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions, which greatly enhanced the study of multidimensional geometry and drew attention to the mathematical basis for physical theoretical models.
2. Developed an innovative system of logical symbolism which helped to elevate mathematical reasoning and description.
3. Helped to establish the theological and philosophical implications of non-Euclidean geometry.
4. Developed a new system of teaching mathematics that made the subject more accessible and attractive to a wider range of students.
5. Contributed to the development of 'higher arithmetic', a system of algebraic thought which helped to revolutionize the wider scientific community.
6. Co-founded the journal Mind and wrote over 200 essays on education, logical grammar, and philosophy.
7. Advocated for the use of symbolic algebra in mathematics education. 
8. Established a mathematical school in Stepney, where he used his new methods to teach students. 
9. Content of his book on mathematics, The Elements of Algebra, allowed it to become an essential reference for school teachers and students for generations. 
10. Published several works on differential equations, mathematical analysis, and other branches of mathematics.

Born 20 December 1838, Marylebone, Middlesex, England. Died 12 October 1926, Hampstead, London, England.
