**Enoch Beery Seitz**  was an American mathematician who contributed over 500 published problems and solutions to various publications.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Following the death of his first wife, he married Catherine Beery (born in 1808 in Fairfield County, Ohio), a second cousin, on 15 April 1832.
* Enoch Beery Seitz was one of Daniel and Catherine's eight children, being the third of their four sons.
* It was told to the author, by his nephew Mr Huddle, that when Seitz was in the field with a team, he would solve problems while the horses rested.
* His father Daniel died in October 1864 and, in about 1866, his mother Catherine, together with Enoch and another couple of her children, moved to Greenville, Ohio.
* Seitz attended a normal school at Greenville and then enrolled at the Wesleyan College in Delaware, Ohio.
* On 24 June 1875, Seitz married Anna Elizabeth Kerlin.
* Anna became a school teacher in 1872 and taught until her marriage to Seitz.
* Enoch and Anna Seitz had four sons: Ray E Seitz studied law at the University of Cincinnati; Willie Kerlin Seitz became a science teacher in Lancaster, Missouri; Clarence D Seitz died in 1886 at the age of four; and Enoch Beery Seitz excelled in science and mathematics.
* The family moved to Kirksville, but Seitz died of typhoid fever four years later.
* We have said nothing yet of Seitz's mathematical contributions.
* A Memorial Plaque, dedicated to Seitz's memory in 1929, is in the old Bremen High School.
* Seitz, although he died at the age of 37, contributed over 500 published problems and solutions in the Analyst, the Mathematical Visitor, the Mathematical Magazine, the School Visitor, and the Educational Times of London.
* Seitz was particularly fond of problems involving averages and probabilities.
* Although Seitz died in Kirksville, his body was taken to Greenville, Ohio where he was buried.
* J P Blanton was head of the North Missouri Normal School in Kirksville where Seitz taught for the final four years of his life.
* Enoch Beery Seitz was an extraordinary man.
* Professor Seitz' external life was that of a modest, deep hearted, perfect gentleman.
