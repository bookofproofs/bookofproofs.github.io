**Béla Kerékjártó** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Provided a unified description of differential equations.
2. Developed the Hilbert-Kernel theorem.
3. Developed the first set theoretic proof of the finiteness theorem.
4. Developed a semigroup theoretic proof of the maximal theorem.
5. Discovered the fundamental structure of differential equations in prime fields.
6. Coined the phrase “potential theory” in reference to geometric probability.
7. Studied classical covariant equations and performed several new developments in algebraic topology.
8. Founded the scientific journal Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum in Hungary.

Born 1 October 1898, Budapest, Hungary. Died 26 June 1946, Gyöngyos, Hungary.
