**Georg Feigl **was a German mathematician who worked in the foundations of geometry and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed analytic methods for the solution of certain elliptic and parabolic equations.
2. Made valuable contribution to the theory of linear equations in Hilbert space.
3. Proposed a new chain-rule for differentiation of scalar and vector functions.
4. Introduced a mathematical way of investigating the structure of theories of physics.
5. Developed a scheme for calculating energy states of multi-particle systems.
6. Pioneered the study of the properties of physical systems under certain restrictions.
7. Conducted research on the properties of functions of operators in Hilbert space.
8. Developed a theory of nonlinear equations in Hilbert space.
9. Established a new form of the Helmholtz equation and its derivatives.
10. Discovered the existence of resonances in the general form of the Schr√∂dinger equation.

Born 13 October 1890, Hamburg, Germany. Died 25 April 1945, Wechselburg, Sachsen, Germany.
