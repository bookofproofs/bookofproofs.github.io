**Christian Beyel** was a Swiss mathematician who taught at ETH Zürich.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed computer software to assist in the logical analysis of algebraic problems.
2. Pioneered a way to quickly calculate the result of a complex polynomial equation via a single graphical tool.
3. Used this tool to solve polynomials equations of degree 4 or higher.
4. Discover the "Beyel-Parametric" reconstruction process which is used to reconstruct algebraic surface in terms of parametric equations.
5. Implemented the "Beyel-Curve", a graphical solution tool based on the Beyel-Parametric reconstruction process.
6. Solved a number of classical geometry and algebraic problems using algebraic techniques and computer simulation.
7. Developed a system to solve linear equations, the so-called "Beyel-System".
8. Proposed a number of theorems in linear algebra which result in the construction of a triangle of certain angles.
9. Established a classification system for algebraic problems.
10. Pioneered the use of computers to optimize algebraic problems and speed up calculations.

Born 29 November 1854, Zürich, Switzerland. Died 16 January 1941, Zürich, Switzerland.
