**Sergei  Chaplygin** was a Russian physicist and mathematician who did important work in hydrodynamics and aerodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Chaplygin developed the theory of partial differential equations, the most powerful tool for studying various problems in mathematics and physics.
2. He is credited with establishing the mathematical foundations of the theory of aero- and hydrodynamics.
3. In addition, Chaplygin worked on the theory of gyroscopes and created a new approach to the study of thermodynamics.
4. He laid the foundations of the modern theory of topology.
5. Chaplygin also made significant advances in the theory of nonlinear systems.
6. He developed a general theory of integral invariants and the first general theory of surface tension.
7. Additionally, Chaplygin worked on the problem of the motion of a rigid body in a potential field and established the theory of motion groups.
8. He discovered the well-known Chapygin equations, a generalization of the Navier-Stokes equation.
9. Chaplygin developed the eponymously-named Chaplygin equations, a highly influential set of equations in aerodynamics.
10. He also developed an analytical solution to the three-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

Born 5 April 1869, Ranenburg (now Chaplygin), Russia. Died 8 October 1942, Novosibirsk, USSR.
