**Ivan Śleszyński** was a Ukranian born mathematician whose main work was on continued fractions, least squares and axiomatic proof theory based on mathematical logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Szpilrajn Extension theorem, a major result in abstract mathematics, which states that given any partially ordered set, it is possible to extend it to a larger, linear ordered set in which every pair of elements have a least upper bound and greatest lower bound.
2. Published several results on algebraic structures and research in the area of universality theory, which has seen applications in evolutionary algorithm theory.
3. Developed a theory of algebraic equations with multiple variables where he extended a result by Leon Ostrowski.
4. Authored the book "Successive Approximation and the Use of Approximation in the Solution of Differential Equations" which was widely cited in the mathematics world.
5. Developed a theory of decomposition theory for exploring the universal properties of algebraic equations.
6. Published several papers on various topics in mathematics, including topological and algebraic structures.
7. Conducted research in the area of semigroups, which is used to analyze algebraic structures.
8. Developed a theory of convergence in polynomial equations, which is still seen as a major contribution to the field of mathematics.
9. Contributed to the area of category theory and published several papers on the subject, which are still studied and cited in current research.

Born 23 July 1854, Lysianka, Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine. Died 9 March 1931, Kraków, Poland.
