**Ivan Śleszyński** was a Ukranian born mathematician whose main work was on continued fractions, least squares and axiomatic proof theory based on mathematical logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* This work by Śleszyński was more than a translation since it contained Śleszyński's own very useful commentary.
* Śleszyński left Odessa and went to Poland in 1911 where he was appointed as an extraordinary professor at the Jagellonian University of Kraków.
* We should note that in fact Kraków was at this time in the Austro-Hungarian Empire but, remembering Śleszyński's Polish background, it is fair to say that he was moving to Poland.
* Śleszyński's main work was on continued fractions, least squares and axiomatic proof theory based on mathematical logic.
* Thron demonstrates that Pringsheim was aware of Śleszyński's work, though Pringsheim himself claims that he only became aware of Śleszyński after his article was completed.
* Śleszyński then represents the five different situations by using Venn diagrams.
* Śleszyński then argues as follows.
* Next Śleszyński looks at the situation where common elements exist.
* Śleszyński also goes on to consider what happens when empty classes are allowed and shows that three further relations occur.
* We should mention another interesting work by Śleszyński, namely On the significance of logic for mathematics (Polish) published in 1923.
* However, despite the interesting publications we have mentioned, Śleszyński did not publish much of his work.
* One of Śleszyński's most famous students at the Jagellonian University of Kraków was Stanisław Zaremba.
* In 1925 Zaremba, acting as editor, published the first of two volumes of The theory of proof based on Śleszyński's lectures at Kraków.

Born 23 July 1854, Lysianka, Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine. Died 9 March 1931, Kraków, Poland.
