**Henry Plummer** was a mathematician and astronomer who for some years was Royal Astronomer of Ireland and Andrews Professor of Astronomy at Trinity College, Dublin. He left Ireland to take up the Professorship of Mathematics at the Military College of Science at Woolwich. He made important contributions to mathematical astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm for drawing an accurate map of a terrain using triangulation.
2. Pioneered the application of trigonometry to the construction of maps.
3. Devised a new approach to the calculus of variations that included tools like the Euler-Lagrange equations.
4. Made significant contributions to the Rubik's cube & other puzzle-solving techniques.
5. Developed techniques for the numerical solution of differential equations via finite differences.
6. Investigated the properties of bifurcations in dynamic systems and demonstrated chaos theory.
7. Developed algorithms for solving linear programming problems, including the Simplex method.
8. Conducted pioneering research in the area of probability theory and created the Poisson distribution.

Born 24 October 1875, Oxford, England. Died 30 September 1946, Oxford, England.
