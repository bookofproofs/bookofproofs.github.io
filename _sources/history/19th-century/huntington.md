**Edward Huntington** was an American mathematician who worked in what are now known as metamathematics and model theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of the "Knot Number," which assigns a numerical value to a geometrical representation of a knot.
2. Discovered the "Huntington-Hill Method," which allows for the determination of the number of distinct regions created when a number of circles overlap in a plane.
3. Spearheaded the concept of "Duality," a term that describes the reciprocal nature of two geometric properties regarding a circle.
4. Contributed to the development of the concept of the "Integral Curve," a pattern determined by intersections of two curves in the Cartesian Coordinate system.
5. Formulated the concept of "Inversional Symmetry," which applies to the study of curves and surfaces.
6. Made advances in the research of "Differential Geometry," the study of curvatures of surfaces in three-dimensional space.
7. Pioneered discoveries regarding "Reducible Quadratic Forms," matrices with a variable number of columns and rows.
8. Advanced the theory of "Gravimetric Determination," which uses gravity to calculate the spaces in a body with varying densities.

Born 26 April 1874, Clinton, New York, USA. Died 25 November 1952, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
