**Willem de Sitter** was a Dutch mathematician, physicist, and astronomer who made major contributions in physical cosmology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of a non-Euclidean universe, which eventually led to the establishment of the theory of relativity.
2. Established a formal mathematical basis for cosmological theories, including Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.
3. Developed a model of a three-dimensional universe in which constant, non-zero curvature exists.
4. Discovered the concept of non-Euclidean geometry as an abstract mathematical theory.
5. Worked on the mathematical foundations of quantum theory and the description of atomic structures.
6. Explored the mathematics of black holes and their effects on space-time.
7. Pioneered the use of analytic geometry in theoretical physics.
8. Co-developed the Lambda-CDM model, which remains the standard model of cosmology.

Born 6 May 1872, Sneek, Netherlands. Died 20 November 1934, Leiden, Netherlands.
