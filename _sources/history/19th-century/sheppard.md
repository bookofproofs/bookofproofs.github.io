**William Sheppard** read Mathematics at Cambridge and then went on to study Law. He was appointed to the Department of Education. His mathematical interests were mainly in Statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* William was educated at Brisbane Grammar School, Australia, before coming to England and completing his school education at Charterhouse School.
* Sheppard was elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1887 and, like many mathematicians from this period, he decided on a career in law and was called to the bar.
* Quickly Sheppard realised that his interests were in education rather than law and, in 1896, he was appointed to the Education Department.
* Sheppard spent some time in Edinburgh following his retirement and during this time he collaborated with Aitken.
* He was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 7 March 1932, his proposers being Sir Edmund T Whittaker, George James Lidstone, Alexander C Aitken, William Ogilvy Kermack.

Born 21 November 1863, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Died 12 October 1936, Cardrona, Berkhampsted, Herts, England.
