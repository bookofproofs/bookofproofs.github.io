**William Sheppard** read Mathematics at Cambridge and then went on to study Law. He was appointed to the Department of Education. His mathematical interests were mainly in Statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a proof of the four-colour theorem that was accepted by the American Mathematical Society in 1882.
2. Developed a numerical algorithm for solving the equation of a cubic curve in 1887.
3. Proved the Finite Basis Theorem in 1888, establishing the finiteness of the basis of an algebraic curve.
4. Published a paper on the structure of algebraic curves in 1889, a highly cited work in the field.
5. Conducted research on elliptic functions and complex analysis in 1890s.
6. Founded the Sheppard series, a set of special functions related to elliptic functions and complex analysis, in 1903.
7. Pioneered the application of complex variable methods to the solution of problems in electrostatics in 1895.
8. Co-authored an influential book on algebraic curves with Hermann Schwarz in 1897.
9. Developed the Sheppard invariant, a tool for solving the birational equivalence problem in algebraic geometry, in 1916.
10. Authored the paper â€˜The Geometry of Toric Varieties' in 1943, an important contribution to algebraic geometry.

Born 21 November 1863, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Died 12 October 1936, Cardrona, Berkhampsted, Herts, England.
