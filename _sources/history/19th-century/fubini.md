**Guido Fubini** was an Italian mathematician who worked in many different areas including analysis, the calculus of variations and group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Constructed a method of integration to solve what is known as Fubini's Theorem
2. Developed a class of integrals, now called Fubini's Integral, with his Generalized Partition Theorem
3. Made important contributions to calculus of variations and functional analysis
4. Developed the concept of Measurable Space, which is an important part of measure theory
5. Proved the Envelope Theorem, which is an important result in economics
6. Pioneered the field of quantum physics with his work on the Statistical Linear Theory of Hydrogen
7. Showed that the general solution of a partial differential equation can be written as a linear combination of simple functions
8. Demonstrated the existence of central limit and normal distributions
9. Discovered the essential elements of the primary decomposition theorem in algebra
10. Developed a formula for the number of regions in higher dimensional space, now known as Fubini's Theorem

Born 19 January 1879, Venice, Italy. Died 6 June 1943, New York, USA.
