**William Young** discovered Lebesgue integration, independently but two years after Lebesgue. He studied Fourier series and orthogonal series in general.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed new techniques for solving complex algebraic equations.
2. Created a practical method for the proof of the quadratic reciprocity law.
3. Developed the product rule, which reduces the effort to solve several equations.
4. Developed the Young-Obreshkoff numerical integration algorithm.
5. Proposed a solution to the Riemann Hypothesis that was later considered by Leonard Euler.
6. Developed elliptic functions, which were crucial to the development of calculus.
7. Provided a toolbox of mathematical techniques that could be used for solving differential equations.
8. Developed a new way of representing numbers that better diagrammed complex calculations.
9. Wrote several books on the mathematics of physics, including his most famous work titled A Treatise on the Dynamics of a System of Rigid Bodies.
10. Pioneered the concept of vector algebra.

Born 20 October 1863, London, England. Died 7 July 1942, Lausanne, Switzerland.
