**William Young** discovered Lebesgue integration, independently but two years after Lebesgue. He studied Fourier series and orthogonal series in general.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* William was his parents' eldest son and he was brought up by his parents as a Baptist.
* He immediately saw the potential that Young had for mathematics and he encouraged him in that direction.
* In 1881 Young entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, to begin his undergraduate studies of mathematics.
* At Cambridge Young was an outstanding student showing far more mathematical ability than any of the other students in his year.
* Young was one such student for he made a very conscious decision that becoming First Wrangler was less important to him than having varied interests, both academic and sporting, at university.
* However Young did not even submit an essay for this prize but submitted an essay for a theology prize instead.
* One of the students Young tutored was Grace Emily Chisholm, who studied mathematics at Girton College.
* It is extremely unlikely that Young would have ever become interested in research had it not been that he married Grace Chisholm (who, of course, then became Grace Chisholm Young) in 1896, and that Klein visited Cambridge to receive an honorary degree in 1897.
* Discussions with Klein seems to inspire Young.
* Together the Youngs, who formed a mathematical married partnership of real significance, left Cambridge and went to GÃ¶ttingen.
* However Young returned to Cambridge during term time where he both taught and examined.
* In 1915, while holding his two part-time chairs, the Youngs moved their permanent home from Geneva to Lausanne.
* This remained the family's permanent home even after 1919 when Young was appointed to the chair of Pure Mathematics at the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth in Wales.
* Young discovered a form of Lebesgue integration, independently but two years after Lebesgue.
* This 1910 book was one of three which Young wrote.
* The other two were written jointly with his wife: The first book of geometry (1905) was an elementary work clearly written by the Youngs having the teaching of mathematics to their own children in their minds, and The theory of sets of points (1906).
* Young was widely travelled, visiting universities in Europe, America, Asia, and Africa.

Born 20 October 1863, London, England. Died 7 July 1942, Lausanne, Switzerland.
