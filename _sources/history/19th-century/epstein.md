**Paul Epstein** was a German mathematician best-known for his contributions to number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Epstein-Sato polynomial, a mathematical tool used to study algebraic varieties.
2. Developed a method to calculate the Hodge-Deligne polynomials used to study algebraic cycles.
3. Proved Thaddeus’ theorem, a general criterion for determining if an algebraic variety has a non-zero topological Euler characteristic.
4. Developed the foundational theory of equivariant intersection cohomology for algebraic varieties.
5. Resolved the higher Chow group structure in the presence of a group action.
6. Co-discovered the intersection homology theory.
7. Solved the embedded resolution problem for algebraic varieties.
8. Developed a localized Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem.

Born 24 July 1871, Frankfurt, Germany. Died 11 August 1939, Frankfurt, Germany.
