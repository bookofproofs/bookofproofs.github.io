**Filadelfo Insolera** was an Italian mathematician best known for his work on statistics and financial mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The name Filadelfo is, in fact, quite typical of the region where he was born.
* He attended elementary school in Lentini and showed such promise, particularly in mathematics, that his parents moved to Catania, Sicily, so that Filadelfo could spend time attending a school specialising in science and technology.
* Insolera was awarded his first degree by the University of Rome in 1902.
* Throughout his life, Insolera was full of admiration for his two teachers.
* The first appointment of his scientific career was at the University of Rome as an assistant to Tullio Bagni, an expert in actuarial science, and through him Insolera became interested in the subject which from that time on became the main focus of his academic interests.
* Insolera, guided by Bagni, quickly distinguished himself in actuarial science and he was appointed Head of the Actuarial Department in the National Institute of Social Security.
* One of the students that Insolera taught at the Institute in Turin was Maria Luisa Mazzetta.
* Insolera published most of his work in the Giornale di Matematica Finanziaria from that time onwards.
* Insolera published an impressive 105 works, nearly all in the Giornale di Matematica Finanziaria.
* Although this was published in 1947, Insolera completed the work several years earlier while suffering extraordinary difficulties due to World War II.
* It is interesting to compare the rather different reception that Insolera's work received in different countries.
* The book by Filadelfo Insolera is an integral part of his Treatise on actuarial science, excellently written and very useful for financial experts, demographers and academics.
* On a high mathematical level - which is the evident sign of all actuarial analysis - Insolera's theory takes us away from some dry constructions; it is enriched and embellished with a permanent sociological contribution.
* Insolera died while making a visit to Milan where he was presiding over a committee for the qualifying examination of the Technical Institute S.

Born 29 February 1880, Lentini, near Syracuse, Sicily. Died 1 October 1955, Milan, Italy.
