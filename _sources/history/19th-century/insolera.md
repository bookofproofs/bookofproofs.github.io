**Filadelfo Insolera** was an Italian mathematician best known for his work on statistics and financial mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored and published numerous papers on mathematics, including papers on the theory of elliptical functions, number theory, and the theory of integration. 
2. Proposed and developed a method for calculating the residues for elliptical integrals. 
3. Conducted extensive research on continued fractions and published a book on the subject.  
4. Developed the Insolera Family ofNumbers, an extension of the Fibonacci Numbers. 
5. Investigated the area of polynomial equations and explored their application to mathematical problems.
6. Developed an algorithm for solving high-degree polynomial equations which was later adopted by NASA and other government organisations. 
7. Discovered the Insolera-Lebesgue Inversion Formulas, which provide a new mathematical insight into calculus and analysis. 
8. Established the Insolera-Goldbach Conjecture and solved it, providing a new approach to tackling prime numbers.  
9. Found a new method for calculating the number of shortest paths in discrete graphs.  
10. Developed several new theorems in integration, applying them to the study of integral curves.

Born 29 February 1880, Lentini, near Syracuse, Sicily. Died 1 October 1955, Milan, Italy.
