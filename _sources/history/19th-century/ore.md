**Øystein Ore** was a Norwegian mathematician who worked in ring theory, Galois theory and graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the Ore theorem in 1938, which is a fundamental theorem in graph theory.
2. Developed linear programming techniques in 1947 when he was a professor at the Norwegian Institute of Technology. 
3. Authored a monograph on linear programming that was published in 1966.
4. Implemented the shortest path algorithm in order to solve the linear programming problem. 
5. Established the Norwegian Mathematical Society in 1956 and served as its president for two years. 
6. Founded MATHNEWS in 1965, a Norwegian journal for mathematical research. 
7. Introduced a number of graph theory results related to coloring, connectivity, and digraphs in the 1950s and 1960s.

Born 7 October 1899, Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. Died 13 August 1968, Oslo, Norway.
