**Tibor Radó** was a Hungarian mathematician best known for his solution to the Plateau Problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Radó-Kneser-Choquet Theorem, which states the minimum number of solutions required to solve a system of linear equations.
2. Formulated the hypothesis of the existence of three-dimensionally continuous minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds.
3. Found that the classical quadrature of the plane is cyclic.
4. Discovered a method for constructing solutions to Plateau's problem, one of the most famous problems in mathematics.
5. Developed a method for approximating the solutions of certain classes of partial differential equations.
6. Pioneered the study of minimal surfaces in manifolds of any dimension.
7. Created a proof of the Euler-Lagrange equation in the Calculus of Variations.
8. Solved the Dirichlet problem for the external field.
9. Developed the Radó-Kneser representation formula to describe how minimal submanifolds intersect in a Minkowski space.
10. Established the Radó-Kneser-Tihanyi theorem, which provides theoretical proof of the solution of this equation and its application.

Born 2 June 1895, Budapest, Hungary. Died 12 December 1965, New Smyrna Beach, Florida, USA.
