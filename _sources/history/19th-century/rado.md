**Tibor Radó** was a Hungarian mathematician best known for his solution to the Plateau Problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* At this stage Radó enlisted as a lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian army and was sent to the Russian front.
* Around 600000 men in the Austro-Hungarian army were killed or captured in the 1916 Russian offensive and Radó was one of those taken prisoner by the Russians.
* In the camp near Tobolsk Radó had met a fellow prisoner Eduard Helly.
* After being shot, Helly had been captured by the Russians towards the end of 1915 and after a spell in hospital was by then in the same prison camp Radó.
* However unlike Radó, who had only just begun his university studies, Helly was already a research mathematician who had made remarkable progress in his work on functional analysis, proving the Hahn-Banach theorem in 1912.
* In the prison camp Helly acted as mathematics teacher to Radó who was also able to read books on mathematics.
* None of this had a significant effect on the Russian Revolution but it did mean that Radó remained a prisoner in the midst of bitter conflict.
* Eventually in the confusion that was taking place in Siberia Radó was able to escape from the prison camp but returning to his much reduced country forced him to make a most remarkable journey.
* Escaping from the prison camp near Tobolsk, Radó made his way north to the Arctic regions of Russia.
* After a trek of many thousands of miles Radó reached Hungary in 1920.
* Let us mention in particular the paper from this period, namely Über den Begriff der Riemannschen Fläche Ⓣ(On the concept of Riemann surface) which Radó published in 1925.
* Also during this period Radó married Ida Barabás de Albis on 30 September 1924.
* They had two children, Judith Viola Radó and Theodore Alexander Radó.
* The Rockefeller Foundation awarded Radó a fellowship to enable him to spend 1928 working in Germany; part of the year being spent with Carathéodory in Munich and part with Koebe and Lichtenstein in Leipzig.
* The following year saw Radó visit the United States where he was a visiting lecturer at Harvard University and Rice University.
* In 1930 Radó published the work for which he is most famous, namely his solution to the Plateau Problem.
* Garnier made a major breakthrough in 1928 followed soon after by independent solutions to the general problem by Douglas and by Radó.
* Their approaches were very different, Radó's being via conformal mappings.
* Let us remark that the solution to the Plateau problem by both Douglas and by Radó did not exclude the possibility that the minimal surface contained a singularity.
* Radó spent 1942 as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago.
* It was in 1945, the year that the war ended, that Radó was invited to be the American Mathematical Society Colloquium Lecturer.
* gives a systematic and detailed exposition of most of the contributions to the theory of the Lebesgue area which have been made by C B Morrey, T Radó and Radó's students.
* The end of the war also marked a time when Radó took on the role as chairman of the Department of Mathematics of Ohio State University, a position he held from 1946 to 1948.
* The Mathematical Association of America invited Radó to give the first Earle Raymond Hedrick Lectures at its meeting in the summer of 1952.
* In the last decade of his life, Radó's interests turned to a new area when he found a fascination in the mathematics behind the newly developing ideas in computer science.

Born 2 June 1895, Budapest, Hungary. Died 12 December 1965, New Smyrna Beach, Florida, USA.
