**Ernest de Jonquières** was a French naval officer who discovered many results in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the theory of difference equations in the 1820s, linking them to probability theory and numerical analysis.
2. Developed a special mechanical calculation device designed to help students with integrals and equations of up to four unknowns.
3. Created a new form of analytical geometry that made calculations much easier by introducing the concept of polar coordinates.
4. Developed a new algebraic approach to the calculus of probability and devised a method for calculating expectation values.
5. Published papers on the theory of probability in relation to combinatorics and statistical mechanics.
6. Developed a general theory of linear equations and successfully applied it to solving a number of difficult problems.
7. Published articles on calculus and its application to probability, providing the initial groundwork for its modern form.
8. Demonstrated the close correlation between probability measures and certain clauses of the calculus of variations.
9. Discovered a new type of series integral solution, now named the de Jonquières series, which is used in a number of fields.
10. Published an important work on the theory of numbers that was later used by Carl Friedrich Gauss to make important discoveries in number theory.

Born 3 July 1820, Carpentras, France. Died 12 August 1901, Mousans-Sartoux (near Grasse), France.
