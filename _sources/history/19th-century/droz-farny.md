### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* On marriage they both changed their name to Droz-Farny.
* In 1880 Droz-Farny was appointed as a professor of physics and mathematics at the cantonal School in Porrentruy near Basel in Switzerland.
* Droz-Farny is best known for results published in the publications of 1899 and 1901 mentioned in this quote.
* This is known as the Droz-Farny line theorem, but it is not known whether Droz-Farny had a proof of the theorem.
* Looking at other work by Droz-Farny, one is led to conjecture that indeed he would have constructed a proof of the theorem.
