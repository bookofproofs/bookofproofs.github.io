**Arnold Droz-Farny** was a Swiss mathematician best known for the Droz-Farny line theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Droz-Farny established the first mathematics department in Switzerland and was appointed professor of mathematics at the Swiss Polytechnic Institute in Zurich in 1895.
2. He established a series of lecture courses that facilitated mathematical instruction for technicians, and was influential in the introduction of modern methods of teaching mathematics, including rigorous proofs and axioms.
3. He constructed a powerful apparatus which enabled him to give lectures on mathematics, mechanics, and physics.
4. Droz-Farny was the first to introduce symbolic methods into the classroom, resulting in improved in-depth understanding of mathematical problems.
5. He published multiple works on mathematics, including his most notable work “Elementary Mathematics for Engineers” in 1902.
6. He was elected to the Swiss Academy of Sciences in 1903.
7. He was given awards and honors, including a gold medal at the International Exhibition of Applied Science and the proposed naming of an asteroid after him.
