**Ernest William Barnes** was an English mathematician and scientist who later became a liberal theologian and bishop.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the algebraic theories of relativity and quantum mechanics.
2. Established the principles of matrix mechanics, the foundation of modern quantum theory.
3. Discovered the Barnes–Kuiper–Wesner inequality in 1944, an important theorem of number theory.
4. Advanced the understanding of topology and the theory of Banach spaces.
5. Championed the use of recursive functions for solving mathematical problems.
6. Successfully described relativistic transformation of electron oscillation using Gabor–Barnes theory.
7. Contributed to the study of geometrical optics by developing the theory of four-dimensional curved space-time.
8. Developed a new system of non-Euclidean geometries in 1926.
9. Formulated the idea of perspective transformations, a fundamental concept in Euclidean geometry.
10. Developed abstract algebraic operations, now known as the Barnes–Stothers Theorem.

Born 1 April 1874, Birmingham, England. Died 29 November 1953, Sussex, England.
