**Christian Heinrich von Nagel** was a German geometer. The "Nagel point" of a triangle is named after him.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Dirichlet principle, which provides the basis for solving certain problems in the calculus of variations.
2. Pioneered the study of higher dimensional calculus and applied it to the study of multiple integrals.
3. Pioneered the study of the theory of surfaces in higher dimensions, leading to the development of coordinate geometry.
4. Formulated the first application of solving ordinary differential equations for multiple variables.
5. Constructed the theory of determinants and solved the Stieltjes problem.
6. Discovered the generalization of the Laplacian operator, which allows for the formulation of differential equations in more than three dimensions.
7. Established the systems of linear coordinates and showed how these systems could be used to solve problems in any number of dimensions.
8. Developed the principles of duality for solving problems for two-variable functions.
9. Applied calculus to the motion of solids and the oscillations of rigid bodies.
10. Developed the theory of orthogonal trajectories.

Born 28 February 1803, Stuttgart, Germany. Died 27 October 1882, Ulm, Germany.
