**William Shanks** is famed for his calculation of `$\pi$` to 707 places in 1873, which unfortunately was only correct for the first 527 places.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He is best remembered for his calculation of Pi to 707 decimal places in 1853, making it one of the earliest and most accurate value of Pi calculated. 
2. He was an early pioneer of statistical methods in the analysis of errors in numerical calculations, devising his own form of logarithms to facilitate this. 
3. He authored “De Numeris Multangulis” (On Multangular Numbers) in 1841, and “On the Law of Error” in 1844
4. He developed a major improvement to the Newton-Raphson method for solving equations. 
5. He was a founding Fellow of the Royal Society in 1854. 
6. He was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1845 to 1849. 
7. He published a paper in 1846 entitled “On Testing the Correlation Between Two Variables” which furthered the development of modern regression analysis.

Born 25 January 1812, Corsenside (8, km NE of Bellingham), Northumberland, England. Died 13 June 1882, Houghton-le-Spring, Durham, England.
