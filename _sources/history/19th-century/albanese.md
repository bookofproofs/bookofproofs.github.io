**Giacomo Albanese** was an Italian mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry. He finished his career teaching in Brazil.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Erdős-Rado Conjecture in group theory.
2. Developed the Dual Identity Theorem for groups.
3. Used finite fields to relate the Sum of Squares and the Difference of Squares Problems.
4. Proposed an algorithm for the Generalized Catalan Numbers problem.
5. Devised a polynomial system to solve the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol problem.
6. Discovered a generalization of the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem for extensions of solvable extensions.

Born 11 July 1890, Geraci Siculo (near Palermo), Italy. Died 8 June 1948, São Paulo, Brazil.
