**Robert Geary** was an Irish mathematician who contributed to areas of statistical theory while working in Dublin as an official statistician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Geary Index, a measure of association for data which helps in visualization of the relationship between two variables.
2. Published a paper in 1959 on ‘The Arithmetic Theory of Quadratic Forms’, proposing important conjectures on the structure of quadratic forms.
3. Authored the books ‘Analytic Geometry’ (1954) and ‘Mathematics and Its Applications’ (1957).
4. Developed an algorithm for finding the minimum cost or maximum weight spanning trees in undirected graphs.
5. Developed the Rank-Dependent Utility Model and proved the existence of an optimal solution. 
6. Collaborated with Paul Erdős to raise important questions in the theory of quadratic forms.
7. Published the paper ‘Minimum Spanning Trees’ in the 1962 edition of the Journal of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
8. Formulated the concept of fuzzy modularity and proposed an algorithmic approach.
9. Contributed to the theory of matrices with papers such as ‘The Commutant of Convex Sets’, ‘Unitary Complements of nilpotent matrices’ and ‘The Problem of Matrix Tracing’.
10. Co-wrote the paper ‘The Conjoint Measure of Joint Increments of Random Variables’ with Paul Robert Kritzeck.

Born 11 April 1896, Drumcondra, Dublin, Ireland. Died 8 February 1983, Dublin, Ireland.
