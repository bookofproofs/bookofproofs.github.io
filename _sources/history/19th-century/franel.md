**Jérôme Franel**  was a Swiss mathematician who specialised in analytic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Franel co-supervised (at least) four PhD students, three jointly with Hurwitz and one with Hermann Weyl.
* Franel served as the Polytechnic's Director from 1905-1909.
* On several occasions Franel acted as intermediary between the Polytechnic and secondary schools or the Gesellschaft ehemaliger Polytechniker.
* As Director, Franel was heavily involved in organising the celebrations.
* Franel was first and foremost a teacher and not a researcher.
* Franel wrote a couple of papers on problems in geometry, but then turned to analysis and number theory.
* Franel also regularly contributed to the French journal L'Intermédiaire des mathématiciens.
* The German mathematician Edmund Landau, who held a professorship at the University of Göttingen at the time, then wrote a few papers on the same topic based on and expanding Franel's ideas.
* Franel joined the organising committee of the first International Congress of Mathematicians in July 1896, where he was responsible for the French translations.
* Franel did not give a talk himself, but he read out Poincaré's talk in the first general meeting, which he is remembered for.
* Despite having been general secretary, Franel never had the chance to edit the congress proceedings in French.
* Franel was a member of the organising committee of the 1932 ICM in Zürich again, but did not give a talk at the congress.
* Franel was married and he had two daughters, Jeanne (born 1889) and Marie-Louise (born 1893).

Born 29 November 1859, Travers, Neuchâtel canton, Switzerland. Died 21 November 1939, Zürich, Switzerland.
