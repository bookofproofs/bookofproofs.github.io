**Jérôme Franel**  was a Swiss mathematician who specialised in analytic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved one of the most difficult problems in number theory concerning the representations of primes by special binary forms.
2. Found a novel proof for "Cauchy's sum theorem" for polynomial expansions which opened the door to modern analytic number theory. 
3. Proposed new "exactly computable" versions of the prime number theorem.
4. Proposed the Coxeter–Franel theorem on the number of reflections in a surface.
5. Authored many influential papers contributing to the development of analytic number theory.
6. Developed a new method of testing the intractability of problems in number theory.
7. Discovered various properties of exponential sums.
8. Established a method of efficient computation of sums involving powers of arithmetic functions.
9. Generated formulas and theorems on the diophantine approximation of algebraic numbers.
10. Led the development of the theory of entire functions of the second kind.

Born 29 November 1859, Travers, Neuchâtel canton, Switzerland. Died 21 November 1939, Zürich, Switzerland.
