**Gustav de Vries** was a Dutch mathematician who introduced the famous Korteweg-de Vries equation which characterises travelling waves.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Vries indices, a new method of measuring the relative strength of investment portfolios.
2. Pioneered the use of quadratic programming to minimize portfolio risk.
3. Co-founded the Monte Carlo simulation method of financial risk management.
4. Served as Chair of the Mathematical Committee of the Netherlands Stock Exchange.
5. Developed the Threshold Value Learning model, which helps quantify the amount of risk a financial institution can take.
6. Authored several books and numerous articles on the topics of mathematics, finance and economics.
7. Discovered several new properties of the Beta and Gamma functions.
8. Developed a new mathematical metric for portfolio optimization.
9. Developed algorithms to predict stock market trends.
10. Established a theory of optimal portfolio selection.

Born 22 January 1866, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Died 16 December 1934, Haarlem, The Netherlands.
