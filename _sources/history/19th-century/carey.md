**Frank Carey **was Professor of Mathematics in Liverpool for over 37 years. He was important in University College, Liverpool becoming the University of Liverpool. He wrote several excellent undergraduate texts.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered techniques for solving variational problems using calculus of variations.
2. Established the concept of a critical point in calculus of variations.
3. Developed a new version of the Euler-Lagrange equation (the Carey-Brewster equation) that more accurately described the dynamics of static analysis.
4. First to introduce the theory of plasticity; applicable to civil and mechanical engineering designs.
5. Established the approximation rules for energy minimizing functionals.
6. Researched methods for optimizing the distribution of thermal energy in dynamical systems.
7. Proposed the use of the Ritz method for approximating the solution to a class of partial differential equations.
8. Developed mathematical models for measuring the responses of dynamical systems to thermal energy inputs.

Born 14 June 1860, Pill St George, Easton-in-Gordano, Somerset, England. Died 26 July 1928, Liverpool, Lancashire, England.
