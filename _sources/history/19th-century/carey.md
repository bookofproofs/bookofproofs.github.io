**Frank Carey **was Professor of Mathematics in Liverpool for over 37 years. He was important in University College, Liverpool becoming the University of Liverpool. He wrote several excellent undergraduate texts.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We have given Frank Stanton Carey's name as 'Frank Carey' but we note that his name appears on the cover of one of his books as 'F Stanton Carey'.
* Carey studied at Bristol Grammar School, an independent school with a long tradition having been founded in 1532.
* The headmaster of Bristol Grammar School when Carey studied there was John William Caldicott (1829-1895).
* Carey performed well at this school and was admitted as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge on 4 October 1879.
* Carey was elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1884.
* During the years that Carey was Professor of Mathematics in Liverpool, the institution where he held his chair went through several stages to become the University of Liverpool.
* Windham Francis Carey, born 1 November 1895, was educated at Greenbank School, Liverpool, Liverpool College and the University of Liverpool.
* Richard Mein Carey studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge and was awarded a B.A. in 1922.
* It gives plenty of practical applications on which the student can exercise himself, and it does not "hedge" the fundamental principles of Number, Continuity, etc., on which the modern conception of the Calculus is based; but wherever these abstract motions are introduced, Prof Carey attempts by concrete illustration to vivify and vitalise as far as possible those nebulous entities which in many modern treatises and lectures leave the ordinary student vague and miserable.
* By F S Carey, M.A., Professor of Mathematics in the University of Liverpool, formerly Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.
* Perhaps Carey's greatest achievement was the long and valuable service he gave to the University of Liverpool for over 37 years.
* A number of letters from Frank Stanton Carey to James George Frazer are in the Trinity College Archive.
* The letters are dated from 1905 to 1918 and they give some insight into Carey's life and his friends.
* Probate Liverpool 30 October to Jessie Carey widow and Richard Mein Carey schoolmaster.

Born 14 June 1860, Pill St George, Easton-in-Gordano, Somerset, England. Died 26 July 1928, Liverpool, Lancashire, England.
