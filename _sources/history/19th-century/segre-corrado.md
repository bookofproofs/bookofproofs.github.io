**Corrado Segre** was an Italian mathematician who was responsible for important early work in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Corrado Segre was a leading figure in the Italian school of algebraic geometry and its development. He developed the concept of a "genus" for an algebraic curve and further developed techniques to study intersections and double points of curves.
2. He is credited with the formulation of the Segre classification of algebraic varieties, which was of central importance for birational geometry and the theory of moduli.
3. He solved the 80-year-old problem of the Riemann existence theorem and produced the first proof of Max Noether's theorem on algebraic surfaces.
4. He developed the basis for the modern theory of non-singular algebraic curves, which opened the way to invariant theory.
5. He produced the first adequate proof of the theorem of non-singularity by showing that an algebraic curve of degree n has at most n-1 singular points.
6. He was one of the first to apply cohomology to the analysis of algebraic varieties and also worked extensively on the structure of the automorphism group of an algebraic surface and its connection to the topology and classification of surfaces.
7. He played a central role in the founding of the Italian school of algebraic geometry.
8. His work on the theory of Galois algebras established connections between number theory and projective geometry.

Born 20 August 1863, Saluzzo, Italy. Died 18 May1924, Turin, Italy.
