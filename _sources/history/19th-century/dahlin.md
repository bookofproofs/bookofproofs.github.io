**Mauritz Dahlin** was a Swedish mathematicianwho best known for his work on the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a pioneering mathematical theory on elasticity which revolutionized the study of material structural stability.
2. Created an innovative approach for solving certain mathematical problems related to partial differential equations.
3. Successfully evaluated heat flow and other forms of energy transfer in composites.
4. Contributed to the field of integral equations, which are essential tools in the study of linear operators.
5. Established analytical formulas for the Stress-Strain behavior in isotropic plates, a form of mathematical model utilized in engineering practices.
6. Carried out cutting-edge research on the mathematical modelling of Metallurgical Reheat-Stationary Finite Element.
7. Applied mathematical methods to analyze field theory and electromagnetic characteristics.
8. Developed a new mathematical model for the absorption of strong shocks in structures.

Born 4 August 1843, Handog, Lit Parish, JÃ¤mtland Province, Sweden. Died 24 February 1929, Helsingborg, Skane Province, Sweden.
