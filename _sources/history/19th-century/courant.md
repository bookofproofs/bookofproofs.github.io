**Richard Courant** was a Polish-born applied mathematician best known for founding the Institute named after him in New York.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the "Courant Method" of numerical analysis, pioneering numerical methods for differential equations, which had a major effect on the development of modern computer simulation.
2. Proved a number of theorems concerning partial differential equations, now known as Courantâ€™s Theorem.
3. Co-authored two widely-referenced mathematics textbooks: Differential and Integral Calculus and Methods of Mathematical Physics.
4. Introduced and popularized the term "variational calculus" to describe a certain approach to mathematics.
5. Founded the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University and served as its Director.
6. Awarded the 1988 Wolf Prize in Mathematics for his contributions to mathematics.

Born 8 January 1888, Lublinitz, Germany (now Lubliniec, Poland). Died 27 January 1972, New Rochelle, New York, USA.
