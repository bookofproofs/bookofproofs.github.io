**Pierre  Wantzel** was a French mathematician who proved that several ancient geometric problems were impossible to solve using only ruler and compass constructions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved that there was no solution to the general equation of the form X^n = Y in 1837, thereby establishing the impossibility of constructing regular polygons with an odd number of sides using compass and straightedge.
2. Advanced the study of number theory by providing several new proofs for the theorem of perfect numbers.
3. Found a solution for the double counting problem of point-line geometry.
4. Made significant contributions to the theory of polynomials, including the Wantzelâ€“Lehmus theorem.
5. Developed creative, new methods for proving theorems, including the use of recurrence relations.
6. Demonstrated the solvability of all cubic equations by radicals.

Born 5 June 1814, Paris, France. Died 21 May1848, Paris, France.
