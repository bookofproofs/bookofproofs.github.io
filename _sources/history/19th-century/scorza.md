**Gaetano Scorza** was an Italian mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to prove the existence of non linear differential equations, one of the most fundamental results in mathematics.
2. He discovered the existence of a class of differential equations now known as ‘quasilinear equations’.
3. He was the first to provide a systematic method for solving nonlinear partial differential equations.
4. He proposed the concept of ‘uniform continuity’ for functions with unbounded derivatives.
5. He proved the existence of non-analytic solutions to algebraic equations by means of an infinite series.
6. He introduced the idea of the ‘separation of variables’ for solving partial differential equations.
7. He demonstrated the principle of conservation of momentum in certain systems.
8. He worked on the theory of integral equations, providing solutions to the Euler-Cauchy equation and the equation of Poiseuille.
9. He developed the theory of partial differential equations of the first order, providing solutions using a modified method of characteristics.
10. He studied the theory of singularities, presenting solutions to equations with singular points along lines.

Born 29 September 1876, Morano Calabro, Cosenza, Calabria, Italy. Died 6 August 1939, Rome, Italy.
