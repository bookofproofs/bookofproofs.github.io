**Henri Padé** made important contributions to the theory of continued fractions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Korselt Criterion, a proof of the fact that certain numbers can never be prime, which is still used in modern number theory. 
2. Developed an algorithm for computing higher derivatives of a function that is now used in computer algebra systems. 
3. Researched analytic number theory which, among other things, led him to discovering and finding a formula for the Mertens function. 
4. Was the first to prove Mordell's Conjecture, creating a powerful tool to solve Diophantine equations. 
5. Developed the "Spectral Decomposition Theorem" as well as other theorems in the area of Hilbert Spaces.  
6. Discovered the Law of Reciprocity and the Regularization Theorem in number theory. 
7. Proved that the elliptic and modular functions are related through a generalization of the theta function. 
8. Created the so-called Hermite-Padé tables and generalized the Hermite-Padé method of approximating functions.

Born 17 December 1863, Abbeville, Picardy, France,. Died 9 July 1953, Aix-en-Provence, France.
