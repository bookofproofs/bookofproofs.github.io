4. Developed mathematical models for differential equations.
5. Extended the concept of surjective functions to a greater class of mappings.
6. Established the criteria for frame transformation systems.
7. Established the concept of differential-algebraic systems of equations.
8. Published numerous mathematical journals and books on the subjects of geometry, algebra and mechanics.

Born 26 February 1843, Langenthal, Bern, Switzerland. Died 7 May 1934, Küsnacht, Zürich, Switzerland.
