**Pólya** worked in probability, analysis, number theory, geometry, combinatorics and mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the book "How to Solve It," which provided guidance for problem-solving in mathematics.
2. Pioneered the use of heuristics in mathematics, inspiring what is today known as heuristic reasoning.
3. Put forth the fundamental principle of counting, also known as Pólya Counting.
4. Developed the Pólya Enumeration Theorem, which studies the number of possible configurations of a mathematical form.
5. Credited with popularizing the idea of mathematical induction.
6. Invented the Pólya Square, a unique form of visual representation of algebraic equations.

Born 13 December 1887, Budapest, Hungary. Died 7 September 1985, Palo Alto, California, USA.
