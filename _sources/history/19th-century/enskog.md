**David Enskog**  was a Swedish mathematical physicist who helped develop the kinetic theory of gases.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a kinetic theory for gases, now known as Enskog theory.
2. Was the first mathematician to use the phrase ‘kinetic theory’ in a paper.
3. Established the foundation for many of the kinetic theories that followed.
4. Used the technique of mathematical reductionism to solve problems.
5. Discovered an equation that modelled the interaction of small particles in a gas.
6. Developed a kinetic theory of crystal growth.
7. Developed a seminal theory of particle diffusion, known as Enskog diffusion theory.
8. Studied the motion of small rigid particles in a liquid.
9. Established the fundamental equations of mechanochemistry, now known as Enskog equations.
10. Proposed the kinetic theory of gases with a two-particle collision frequency.

Born 22 April 1884, Västra Ämtervik, Värmland, Sweden. Died 1 June 1947, Stockholm, Sweden.
