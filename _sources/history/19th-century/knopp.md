**Konrad Knopp** was a German mathematician who worked on generalised limits and complex functions. He was the co-founder of _Mathematische Zeitschrift_ in 1918.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Paul Knopp (1845-1904) was a businessman and manufacturer from Neustettin (the town is now in northwest Poland and is named Szczecinek).
* Konrad's school education was in Berlin, then he spent one semester at the University of Lausanne in 1901.
* Knopp left Germany in the spring of 1908 and travelled to Japan where he taught in Nagasaki in western Kyushu, at the Handelshochschule during 1908-09.
* Konrad and Gertrud Knopp then moved to Tsingtao, eastern Shantung province, China where he taught at the German-Chinese academy during 1910-11.
* In 1911 Knopp and his wife returned from Tsingtao to Germany and he taught at the Military Technical Academy and the Military Academy while working on his habilitation thesis which he submitted to Berlin University.
* Knopp worked on generalised limits and wrote excellent books on complex functions.
* Details of three further textbooks by Knopp are given in the article: Texts by Knopp.
* The book continued to appear as a jointly authored text by von Mangoldt and Knopp, and the three volumes which were reprinted in 1990 were the seventeenth, sixteenth and fifteenth editions of these volumes respectively.
* After he retired Knopp continued to publish interesting papers such as Zwei Abelsche SÃ¤tze (1952) in which he proved abelian theorems for Laplace and Abel transforms which are closely related to the well-known Tauberian theorems of Karamata.

Born 22 July 1882, Berlin, Germany. Died 20 April 1957, Annecy, France.
