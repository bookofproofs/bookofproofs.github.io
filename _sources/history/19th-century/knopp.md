**Konrad Knopp** was a German mathematician who worked on generalised limits and complex functions. He was the co-founder of _Mathematische Zeitschrift_ in 1918.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developing the Knopp-Lebesgue Theorem which provided insight on basic properties of harmonic functions.
2. Pioneering work in functional analysis which led to his discovery of aggregation of discontinuous points in analytic functions.
3. Establishing the concept of an ordered integral which was a basis for both measure theory and functional analysis.
4. Discovered and developed the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem which stated that any continuous function can be approximated in any manner of desired accuracy by a polynomial. 
5. Constructed the Knopp functions, which uniquely characterize the properties of holomorphic functions.

Born 22 July 1882, Berlin, Germany. Died 20 April 1957, Annecy, France.
