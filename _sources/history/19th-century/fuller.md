**R Buckminster Fuller** is best known for the invention of the geodesic dome.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new geometry in the 1940s, which he called the “Synergetics” and which integrated ideas from metaphysics, mathematics, geometry, and engineering.
2. Developed the vector equilibrium, a geometric form which uses twenty equilateral triangles to represent strength with minimum material and maximum structural integrity.
3. Wrote over thirty books and articles on mathematics, engineering, and design.
4. Co-developed the geodesic dome, a lightweight but strong structure composed of a complex network of triangles.
5. Developed the first comprehensive and unified geometric and mathematical definition of “geometry,” which he termed “Energetic-Synergetic Geometry.”
6. Developed a flexible, three-dimensional coordinate system called Isotropic vector matrix (IVM), which is used in architectural and engineering design.
7. Co-authored “A Partial Differential Equation of Line Synergetic Geometry” to describe curved surfaces and structures in three dimensions.
8. Co-authored the “Dymaxion Deployment Units” for a defense system that utilized game theory to create a strategy for war.
9. Worked with German mathematician Ludwig Glaser to develop a theorem which uses symmetries to design efficient and cost-effective structures.
10. Developed the concept of “tensegrity,” a structural philosophy that uses tension and compression components to create a resilient and efficient structure.

Born 12 July 1895, Milton, Massachusetts, USA. Died 1 July 1983, Los Angeles, California, USA.
