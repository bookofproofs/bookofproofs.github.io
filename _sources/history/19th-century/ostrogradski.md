**Mikhail Ostrogradski** worked on hydrodynamics, elasticity, heat and electricity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the fundamental theorem of variational calculus, which was further expanded upon by Gustav Dirichlet and Felix Klein.
2. Proposed a method of solving partial differential equations by the method of separation of variables.
3. First to formulate the correct version of Gauss's Theorem in vectors, which was later used in the calculus of variations.
4. Proved the Euler–Ostrogradsky theorem, a generalization of the energy conservation theorem.
5. Developed the concept of analytical functions, which became the basis for modern mathematical analysis.
6. Established a theory of order-of-magnitude estimates, which served as an important tool for analysis.
7. He explored the motion of small bodies subjected to perturbations of external forces, which became the basis of the theory of celestial mechanics.
8. Pioneered the formation of statistical mechanics, the science of dealing with large-scale behavior of matter.
9. Established a unified theory of partial differential equations called the "Ostrogradsky-Gauss theorem".

Born 24 September 1801, Pashennaya (now Poltava oblast), Ukraine. Died 1 January 1862, Poltava (now Ukraine).
