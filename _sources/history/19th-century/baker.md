**Henry Baker** spent his whole life in Cambridge and worked on Geometry and Analysis and inspired a younger generation of geometers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Baker would remain at Cambridge for the whole of his career, strongly influencing the teaching of pure mathematics in that university and in the rest of Great Britain.
* Baker, while on a visit to GÃ¶ttingen, was inspired by Klein to study algebraic function theory.
* In 1943 Baker published An Introduction to Plane Geometry which was reprinted in 1971.
* Baker also undertook the extremely large task of editing Sylvester's papers.
* The four volumes of the Collected Mathematical Papers of James Joseph Sylvester were edited and published by Baker between 1904 and 1912, and with these volumes he produced a fitting tribute to the great mathematician.
* Elected to a Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1898, it was indeed highly appropriate that Baker won the Society's Sylvester Medal in 1910.
* His address to the Association provided an opportunity for Baker to explain his feelings about the relation of pure mathematics to other sciences.
* Baker inspired a younger generation of geometers.

Born 3 July 1866, Cambridge, England. Died 17 March 1956, Cambridge, England.
