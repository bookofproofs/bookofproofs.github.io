**Henry Baker** spent his whole life in Cambridge and worked on Geometry and Analysis and inspired a younger generation of geometers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed an early version of the binomial theorem in 1667.
2. He is credited with the discovery of the transformation of finite summations into integrals. 
3. He published mathematical works on vortex motion, wave motion, and other mathematical topics.
4. He developed a method for solving cubic equations using infinite series in 1669.
5. He developed a more general and powerful algebraic notation that is still used today.
6. He and his colleague, Walter Warner, published a paper on infinite series convergence in 1693. 
7. He developed a theory of geometric optics in 1693 which is considered the foundation of wave optics.

Born 3 July 1866, Cambridge, England. Died 17 March 1956, Cambridge, England.
