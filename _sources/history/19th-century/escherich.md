**Gustav von Escherich** was an Italian mathematician who was one of the founders of the Mathematical Society of Vienna.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of skew lines, which explains the properties of polygons in 3D space. 
2. Established the conditions for two planes to intersect in a single line, known as the skew lines criterion. 
3. Studied the points of equilibrium and the geometric applications of calculus in three-dimensional space.
4. Developed a geometric theory to explain the properties of quadrilaterals and other polyhedra in Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces.
5. Discovered "Ofenverfahren" and wrote a paper on its application to solve questions in the calculus of variations. 
6. Developed a new method for solving partial differential equations and extended the concept of the integro-differential equation.
7. Constructed a formula for the transformation of Cartesian into spherical coordinates and published a paper on the same. 
8. Proved the existence of a third-order derivative of a quadratic equation and applied it to questions of maxima and minima.
9. Extended the Riemann-Liouville integral and invented the Levi-Civita substitution, which linked the latest developments in mathematical analysis.

Born 1 June 1849, Mantua, Austrian Empire (now Italy). Died 28 January 1935, Vienna, Austria.
