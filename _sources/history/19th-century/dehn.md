**Dehn** wrote one of the first systematic expositions of topology (1907) and later formulated important problems on group presentations, namely the word problem and the isomorphism problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Dehn proved the Dehn's Lemma, which states that every polyhedron can be cut into finitely many pieces with curved faces and then reassembled into a sphere.
2. He developed the concept of combinatorial group theory and initiated a study of group-theoretic algorithms.
3. In 1907, Dehn produced a proof of Hilbert's third problem, establishing that any monomorphism between two finitely presented groups is expressible as a combination of inner automorphisms and conjugations.
4. In 1912, Dehn outlined the concept of a topological invariant of a 3-manifold, known as the Dehn invariant, which has since been used in the study of knots.
5. Dehn formulated the first version of what is now known as the word problem for groups, and devised an algorithm for its solution, the Dehn algorithm.
6. Dehn proved the first cut theorem for knots, as well as the first invariant for solving the knot problem.
7. He introduced planar surface reconstructions in group theory, introducing the Dehn-Nielsen theorem.
8. Dehn also discovered the first finitely presented group with unsolvable word problem.

Born 13 November 1878, Hamburg, Germany. Died 27 June 1952, Black Mountain, North Carolina, USA.
