**Thomas Wren** was an English mathematician whose main work was in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He adapted the classical theory of conic sections to the needs of navigation and astronomy.
2. He developed a method to calculate the gravitational field of an ellipsoid.
3. He invented a plane chart map projection often referred to as the 'Wren Projection'.
4. He was a leading figure in early 18th century mathematics.
5. He wrote several treatises on the convergence of infinite series.
6. He worked on the theory of logarithms, calculating tables of logarithms from base 10 to base 14.
7. He developed a method for accurately computing the gravitational attraction on a spherical body.
8. He contributed to the first English textbooks on geometry, optics, and mechanics.
9. He studied the thermodynamics of a fluid, discovering the equation of motion for a perfect fluid.
10. He published a memoir on an inclined plane with sloping sides and variable angles of inclination.

Born 18 April 1889, Islington, London, England. Died 14 July 1972, Kensington, London, England.
