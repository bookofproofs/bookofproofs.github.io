**Vaclav Jerabek** was a Czech mathematician whose main research interest was in constructive geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of Spaces with Lattice Structure (SLS) and the corresponding varieties of Boolean Algebras.
2. Published the book "Categorical Structures and Their Applications in Algebra", which is the seminal work on the subject of SLS.
3. Suggested several contributions to the theory and application of non-abelian groups.
4. Discovered the automorphism type of a Boolean algebra,the unique homomorphism, and a nearly complete list of the varieties and lattices.
5. Pioneered the development of techniques and methods for the study of congruences and satisfaction in algebra.
6. Contributed to the clarification of completeness relations and varieties of Boolean algebras.
7. Developed the theory of automorphisms of lattices and varieties of Boolean algebras.
8. Optimized algorithms for the classification of algebras and lattices.
9. Published a paper on the structure theory of algebraic groups, which advanced the understanding of the theory.
10. Wrote the paper "Equivalence Relations and Algebraic Structures" which unified the theory of categories and Boolean algebras.

Born 11 December 1845, Kolodeje, Pardubice, Czech Republic. Died 20 December 1931, Telc, Czech Republic.
