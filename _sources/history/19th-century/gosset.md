**Gosset** invented the _t_-test to handle small samples for quality control in brewing. He wrote under the name "Student".

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the probability distribution known as Student's t-distribution in 1908, which is used to compare the means of small and large samples. 
2. Pioneered the method of analysis of variance (ANOVA) in 1918, showing the importance of variance in different statistical approaches.
3. Developed and published the t-test, a statistical hypothesis level test in 1908.
4. Published a series of papers on quality control, showing the power of statistic methods in assessing reliability of products and processes.
5. Established the importance of the mean as a significant statistic in evaluating and understanding the behavior of a population, published in 1911.
6. Developed groundbreaking work in the field of experimental design, setting the principles for an efficient replication of experiments.

Born 13 June 1876, Canterbury, England. Died 16 October 1937, Beaconsfield, England.
