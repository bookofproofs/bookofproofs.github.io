**Gosset** invented the _t_-test to handle small samples for quality control in brewing. He wrote under the name "Student".

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* William was educated at Winchester, where his favourite hobby was shooting, then entered New College Oxford where he studied chemistry and mathematics.
* Gosset obtained a post as a chemist with Arthur Guinness Son and Company in 1899.
* Many people are familiar with the name "Student" but not with the name Gosset.
* In fact Gosset wrote under the name "Student" which explains why his name may be less well known than his important results in statistics.
* Gosset discovered the form of the ttt distribution by a combination of mathematical and empirical work with random numbers, an early application of the Monte-Carlo method.
* Gosset certainly did not work in isolation.
* At the end of 1935 Gosset left Ireland to take charge of the new Guinness brewery in London.

Born 13 June 1876, Canterbury, England. Died 16 October 1937, Beaconsfield, England.
