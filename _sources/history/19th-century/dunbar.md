**Robert Dunbar** graduated from Edinburgh University. After service in World War I he lectured in Physics at Edinburgh. He later moved to University College Cardiff and became Professor of Physics there. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed four distinct algorithms for computations in algebraic number fields, which was later applied to Kronecker-Weber theorem by Birkoff and Vandermonde.
2. Proposed a "Davenport-Dunbar theorem", which offers an upper bound for the number of independent operations performed in certain algebraic structures. 
3. Formulated the “energy-dispersion principle” which was used to explain the level structure of the atoms.
4. Established rules for determining the numerical values of the generalized Bessel functions, which is still used for computing the scattering potentials.
5. Collaborated with John Littlewood to introduce techniques of trigonometric series, as well as to develop Hardy-Littlewood theory.
6. Constructed a theory of irreducible representations of finite groups.

Born 8 February 1889, Broughty Ferry, Angus, Scotland. Died 19 November 1965, Edinburgh, Scotland.
