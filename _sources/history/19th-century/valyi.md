**Gyula Vályi** was a Hungarian mathematician and theoretical physicist known for his work on mathematical analysis, geometry and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Gyula's mother was a descendent of the nobleman György Dózsa (1470-1514), who led an army in a crusade against the Turks which later became a peasant revolt against the Hungarian nobility.
* Gyula had an older brother Gábor Vályi who went on to become a professor of statistics.
* Vályi was born in Marosvásárhely, which was a famous town for any Hungarian mathematician to be born in given the connection with Farkas Bolyai and János Bolyai.
* The University of Kolozsvár was a newly established university when Vályi entered it, being founded in 1872.
* After qualifying as a teacher of mathematics and physics from the University of Kolozsvár, Vályi was awarded a scholarship to allow him to undertake further study abroad.
* Vályi was appointed professor of theoretical physics at Kolozsvár in 1884, and in the following year he also became professor of mathematics lecturing on analysis, geometry and number theory.
* Vályi asked which triangles are similar to their nnnth  pedal triangle (that is, they have the same angles).
* Vályi also made extensive studies of projective geometry, in particular studying polar reciprocity, and used elliptic functions to study third order curves.
* Vályi showed that there are precisely five triangles with this property.
* Vályi's eyesight deteriorated rapidly and he had to lecture without notes for he could not read them.
* Vályi's lectures did not always follow the same pattern.
* There were two courses of Vályi which hardly changed over time.
* One of them presented the basic theory of functions; in it Vályi followed his old master Weierstrass and included the theory of elliptic functions.
* The other concerned with János Bolyai's "Appendix"; in that course Vályi, especially in the first years stuck to the order and contents of the sections of Bolyai's masterpiece.
* Vályi remained in Kolozsvár all his life despite being offered a professorship in Budapest.
* After Vályi retired he went to live with his brother Gábor who had also retired by this time.

Born 25 January 1855, Marosvásárhely, Transylvania, Hungary (now Târgu-Mureș, Romania). Died 13 October 1913, Kolozsvár, Hungary (now Cluj, Romania).
