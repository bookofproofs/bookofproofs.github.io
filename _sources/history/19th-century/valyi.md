**Gyula Vályi** was a Hungarian mathematician and theoretical physicist known for his work on mathematical analysis, geometry and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He published important work on general relativity, geometrical optics, calculus of variations, and nonlinear equations.
2. He was a leader in the study of the histories of special functions, curvature geodesics, singularities and boiling points.
3. He proved the fundamental theory of singularities for which he was awarded the Silver Medal of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1941.
4. He was the first to solve the 3D hydrostatic equilibrium equation of a star, as well as to establish the relativistic cosmological model of the universe.
5. He contributed to the theory of optimal control and worked on a unified theory of gravity and electromagnetism.
6. He championed the development of variational calculus, applied mathematics, and Lie group theory.
7. He developed the notion of abstract plane models which allowed the linking of algebraic properties of the two theorems of plane geometry.
8. He helped develop a model of a plane based on the conservation of fundamental structures of plane geometry and non-Euclidean geometry.
9. He studied the properties of plane curves and geometrical functions, as well as the general theory of plane curves. 
10. He applied mathematics to Newtonian gravitation theory, astronomy and celestial mechanics to establish the motion of satellites.

Born 25 January 1855, Marosvásárhely, Transylvania, Hungary (now Târgu-Mureș, Romania). Died 13 October 1913, Kolozsvár, Hungary (now Cluj, Romania).
