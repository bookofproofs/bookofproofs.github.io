**Josip Plemelj ** was a Slovenian mathematician who worked in the theory of analytic functions and the application of integral equations to potential theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an assumption for the convergence of alternating series which is now known as Plemelj's theorem. 
2. Established a theory of an operator calculus in singular integral equations.
3. Authored the seminal textbooks: Mathematical Problems in Elasticity and Problemi matematici vol. 1 & 2.
4. Wrote several papers on the functions of mathematical physics and related fields.
5. Discovered a new over-convergent fixed point theorem for linear integral equations.
6. Proposed a property of ultraconservativeness for certain T-systems of first order partial differential equations.
7. Proved formulation of a version of the Hadamard-Riemann condition.
8. Transformed the Dirichlet's harmonic functions into a more general variational form.
9. Proved an important theorem on the existence of the boundary solution in singular boundary problems.
10. Obtained several important results in the theory of integral equations of the second kind.

Born 11 December 1873, Grad on Bled, Austrian Empire (now Slovenia). Died 22 May1967, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia (now Slovenia).
