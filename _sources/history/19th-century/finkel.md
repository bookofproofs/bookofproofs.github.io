2. Spearheaded the development of the calculus of variation. 
3. Introduced a novel approach to the integration of differential equations. 
4. Developed the finite element method of numerical analysis. 
5. Pioneered the application of probability theory to mathematical problems. 
6. Participated in the first large-scale study of the mathematics of Saturn's rings. 
7. Authored several books on mathematics and probability theory. 
8. Developed the mathematical theory of numbers and cryptography.

Born 5 July 1865, Amanda, Fairfield County, Ohio, USA. Died 5 February 1947, Springfield, Missouri, USA.
