3. Published the first works on the theory of algebras.
4. Contributed to the generalization of the physicist Boltzmann's entropy law through its thermodynamic formalism.
5. Researched the existence of non-abelian groups with finite order.
6. Developed a general framework for understanding the transformations of matrices.
