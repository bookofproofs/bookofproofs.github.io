**Schönflies** worked first on geometry and kinematics but became best known for his work on set theory and crystallography. He classified the 230 space groups in 1891.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Schönflies independently discovered the general structure of all congruence group systems.
2. He provided a complete classification of the crystallographic point groups in two and three dimensions.
3. He proposed the use of linear algebra to solve geometrical problems.
4. Schönflies formulated the fundamental theorem of point-set topology.
5. He was first to initiate a systematic geometrical theory of numbers, now known as algebraic topology.
6. He defined and elucidated the concept of continuous deformation.
7. Schönflies pioneered the use of metrics and projections. 
8. He developed a theory which unified crystallographic geometry, space groups and mathematical group theory. 
9. He helped stimulate the growth of linear algebra.

Born 17 April 1853, Landsberg an der Warthe, Prussia (now Gorzów-Wielkopolski, Poland). Died 27 May 1928, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
