**Emilie Martin** was an American mathematician and professor of mathematics at Mount Holyoke College. Her research focused on primitive substitution groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Robert Wilkie Martin was born in Port Richmond, Philadelphia on 14 June 1841.
* His parents, Thomas Martin and Agnes Thornley, were both born in Bolton, England, and emigrated to the United States.
* Robert married Mary Holmes Ford in 1868 and they had three children: Emilie Norton Martin, the subject of this biography; Imbrie Martin (who became Miller after her marriage); and Collier Ford Martin (1873-1941).
* Robert Martin became a prominent homeopathic surgeon in Philadelphia.
* Collier Ford Martin became a physician and professor of medicine in Philadelphia.
* Emilie Martin's preparation to study at college was two-fold, partly by attending Mrs E L Head's School in Germantown, Philadelphia, and partly by studying on her own.
* Mrs E L Head's School provided a way for women students to prepare for entry into Bryn Mawr College and Martin was one of a number of students taking that route.
* Bryn Mawr College was quite a young institution when Martin began her studies there for it had been founded only five years earlier in 1885.
* The head of mathematics at Bryn Mawr College when Martin studied there was Charlotte Angas Scott who had been a student of Arthur Cayley in Girton College, University of Cambridge.
* In 1893, while she was a student at Bryn Mawr College, Martin started to act as a private tutor in mathematics and Latin.
* Bryn Mawr College was the first institution in the United States to offer higher degrees to women and, after graduating in 1894, Martin spent a semester as a graduate student.
* After one semester of graduate study, Martin spent the second semester of 1894-95 as a teacher of Latin in the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore.
* This was the school where Martin taught Latin.
* The fellowship was established in 1894 and Martin received $500 which funded her stay during 1897-98 at the Göttingen University in Germany.
* After her year at Göttingen, Martin returned to Bryn Mawr College where she was appointed as a fellow by courtesy in mathematics for 1898-99.
* Martin taught there until the end of the first semester of 1904-05.
* Martin spent 1906-07 undertaking postdoctoral study at Bryn Mawr before returning to her position as an instructor in mathematics at Mount Holyoke College.
* Martin published Some varieties of space in The Mathematics Teacher 16 (8) (1923), 470-480.
* Martin was promoted to full professor in 1925 and took on the role of Chairman of the Mathematics Department in 1927.
* As an influential member of the faculty, Miss Martin was vigorous and wise in her judgment, never passive, and never satisfied with the second-rate.
* The college has reason to give thanks for Miss Martin's long and valuable service as teacher, as head of an important department, as member of many student and faculty groups.

Born 30 December 1869, Elizabeth, New Jersey, USA. Died 8 February 1936, South Hadley, Massachusetts, USA.
