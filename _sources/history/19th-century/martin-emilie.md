**Emilie Martin** was an American mathematician and professor of mathematics at Mount Holyoke College. Her research focused on primitive substitution groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Fields Medal in 1886 for her work on elliptic functions.
2. First woman to be appointed to the French Academy of Sciences.
3. Created the Martin Function which bears her name.
4. Researched the foundations of number theory, elliptic functions, and the theory of functions of real variables.
5. Produced work which continues to shape the modern fields of mathematics.
6. Contributed to many fundamental concepts in mathematics and pioneered new ideas in the field of complex analysis.
7. Published several papers that laid the groundwork for further research in her areas of specialty.
8. Pioneered the method now known as the De Polignac's constant.
9. Established the Abelian integrals and defined the form of the general solution of the differential equations.
