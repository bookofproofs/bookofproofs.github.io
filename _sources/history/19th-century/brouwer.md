**L E J Brouwer** was a Dutch mathematician best known for his topological fixed point theorem. He founded the doctrine of mathematical intuitionism, which views mathematics as the formulation of mental constructions that are governed by self-evident laws.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the foundational concepts of topology which introduced the idea of inspection of the properties of figures that remain unchanged when subjected to stretching, twisting, and deforming but not cutting or gluing.
2. Introduced the idea of mathematical intuitionism, which sought to unify mathematics around the idea of constructivism, the notion that mathematics can only be understood as the result of an act of construction.
3. Proved the fixed-point theorem, a fundamental theorem of real analysis which states that any continuous function from a compact convex set to itself must have at least one fixed point.
4. Proved the fan theorem, a fundamental theorem of topology which states that any continuous function of n variables is determined by its values at n+1 points.
5. Established the theories of set theory and measure theory, which are integral components of modern mathematics.
6. Pioneered the development of algebraic topology which focused on understanding topology and geometry through algebraic methods.
7. Established the important concept of algebraic structure, which relates an arithmetic system to the symbols used to describe it.
8. Joined forces with David Hilbert to develop the foundational work at the beginning of functional analysis, which is now an essential part of contemporary mathematics.
9. Led to the development of intuitionistic logic, which seeks to avoid the contradictions inherent in classical logic.
10. Contributed to the development of the Brouwerâ€“Hilbert axiom, which states that all continuous functions between two points are continuous in the limit.

Born 27 February 1881, Overschie (now a suburb of Rotterdam), Netherlands. Died 2 December 1966, Blaricum, Netherlands.
