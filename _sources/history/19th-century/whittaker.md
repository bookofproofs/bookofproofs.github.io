**Edmund Whittaker**'s best known work is in analysis, in particular numerical analysis, but he also worked on celestial mechanics and the history of applied mathematics and physics. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Whittaker is known for introducing the modern concept of Fourier analysis.
2. He established Hilbert spaces and functions as analytic objects in his discussion of mathematical physics.
3. He published 'A Course of Modern Analysis', in two volumes containing major works on special function theory and its applications.
4. He is known for his discovery of the 'Whittakerâ€“Shannon interpolation formula'.
5. He made important contributions to the theory of partial differential equations and classical mechanics.
6. He published 'Analytical Dynamics' in two volumes, which summarized recent advancements in the area.
7. He developed a method for the numerical solution of boundary value problems for ordinary differential equations, which is still used today.
8. His published 'The Calculus of Observations' which is still an important textbook in the field of statistics and the linear regression model.
9. He was awarded the Sylvester Medal by the Royal Society of London in 1936 for his work on the theory of functions and the theory of differential equations.

Born 24 October 1873, Southport, Lancashire, England. Died 24 March 1956, Edinburgh, Scotland.
