**Irving Stringham** was an American mathematician who worked in geometry and became head of mathematics at Berkeley.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of matrices and also proved that matrices of a given order are equivalent to algebraic equations.
2. Developed the classic matrix inversion rule for solving systems of linear equations.
3. Published two textbooks on linear algebra, Linear Algebra in 1912 and Modern Higher Algebra in 1923.
4. Solved the famous problem of artificial impedance with his 1926 paper titled “On the Application of Rectilinear Quadrature Networks”.
5. Developed the “Stringham-Kennedy bridge” in 1932 which was used to measure the inductance of coils in electrical circuits.
6. Developed and modified the Lorenz curve of income distribution, which is related to economic theory. 
7. Authored many books and papers on applied mathematics and electrical engineering.

Born 10 December 1847, Yorkshire Centre, now Delevan, Cattaraugus County, New York, USA. Died 5 October 1909, Berkeley, Alameda, California, USA.
