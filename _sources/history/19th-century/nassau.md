**Jason J Nassau** was an American mathematician who published papers in both mathematics and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Among Nassau's achievements are his discovery of a cluster of 9,000 stars, his co-discovery of two novae in 1961, and his development of a technique for studying the distribution of red stars.
* Further details are given in J J Nassau's obituary, written by Victor M Blanco, which appeared in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, volume 7 (1966).
* Among the honours given to Nassau, we mention that the Nassau Astronomical Station at the Warner and Swasey Observatory is named after him.
* Also the Jason J Nassau Prize was established by the Cleveland Astronomical Society in 1965.
* His name is given to two astronomical objects: Nassau crater on the Moon is named after him, as is asteroid 9240 Nassau, discovered on 31 May 1997.
* Nassau joined the American Mathematical Society in February 1921 (he was one of 114 people who joined at that time).
* He had already joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in June 1919.
* Finally we list a few of Nassau's papers: Questions and Discussions: Discussions: Evaluation of the Determinant  ∣1/(r+s−1)!∣|1/(r + s - 1)! |∣1/(r+s−1)!∣ (1924); Some extensions of the generalized Kronecker symbol (1926); Questions and Discussions: Discussions: Concerning a Theorem in Determinants (1927); and (with O E Brown) A Navigation Computer (1947).

Born 29 March 1893, Smyrna, (now Izmir) Turkey. Died 11 May 1965, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.
