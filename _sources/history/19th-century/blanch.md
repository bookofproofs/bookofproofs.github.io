### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Appointed as a professor of mathematics at Smith College in 1907, becoming only the second female professor in the United States.
2. Published an important paper on the theory of quadratic equations in 1900.
3. Earned her Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1909, one of the first women to do so.
4. Developed a formula for the volume of a parallelepiped in three-dimensional space in 1912.
5. Later published a groundbreaking paper on the Legendre transformation, a method of solving certain complicated equations.
6. Was honored with a special award from the American Mathematical Society in 1925 for her contributions to the field.
7. Gave lectures and wrote books on the teaching and history of mathematics.
