**Agnes Mary Clerke** was an Irish astronomer and writer on both astronomy and biography.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the book "A Popular History of Astronomy During the Nineteenth Century" which outlined her mathematical and astronomical knowledge.
2. Pioneered the use of statistics to study the structure and evolution of star clusters, pioneering the technique of using statistical measures such as luminosity and color.
3. Coined the phrase â€œastronomical spectroscopy" which describes the process of using a spectroscope to identify the chemical composition of astronomical objects.
4. Established several terms in astronomy, including "the Cepheid variables", which are used to measure the distance between stars.
5. Demonstrated that red stars, which appeared dimmer than blue stars, were actually more luminous, due to a wrong assignment of distances.
6. Devised an indexing system to simplify the usage of star catalogues and maps, simplifying astronomical work of the time.

Born 10 February 1842, Skibbereen, Co. Cork, Ireland. Died 20 January 1907, London, England.
