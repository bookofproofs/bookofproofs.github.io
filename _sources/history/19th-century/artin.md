**Artin** made a major contribution to the theory of noncommutative rings and later worked on rings with the minimum condition on right ideals, now called Artinian rings.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Artin was awarded the prestigious Fields Medal in 1936 for his work on Algebraic Number Theory.
2. He provided an important contribution to Class Field Theory and is also credited with founding Representation Theory.
3. He developed the foundations for abstract algebra as well as the modern technique of Galois Theory.
4. He formulated the famous Artin reciprocity law, which serves as a fundamental tool in the field of algebraic number theory.
5. He introduced the fields of twisted topological groups and the Artin formalism.
6. He proved ground breaking theorems on primitive roots, quadratic forms, diophantine approximation and class fields.
7. He made contributions to the Artinâ€“Schreier theorem in the field of algebraic function theory.
8. He proved the primary decomposition theorem for ideals.

Born 3 March 1898, Vienna, Austria. Died 20 December 1962, Hamburg, Germany.
