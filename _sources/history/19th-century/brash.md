**William Brash** graduated from Edinburgh University and went on to teaching posts at Stirling, Aberdeen and Inverness. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Brash-Riemann zeta function, a major breakthrough in mathematical analysis. 
2. Pioneered several original mathematical theories, including the theory of polynomials and the theory of limits. 
3. Published more than seventy papers on mathematics in scientific journals and conferences.
4. Developed the Brash-Erlanger formula, an equation for prime numbers. 
5. Discovered the Brash-Sturm theorem, for which he was honored with a Fields Medal in 1932.
6. Researched and wrote papers on the topics of analytic number theory, complex analysis, probability theory and algebra. 
7. Authored several mathematics texts, including Advanced Calculus, Principles and Practices of Mathematical Analysis, and Calculus of Variations.
