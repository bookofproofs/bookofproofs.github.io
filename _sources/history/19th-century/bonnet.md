**Pierre Bonnet** was a French mathematician who worked in the differential geometry of surfaces. He proved the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an innovative approach to teaching calculus to students.
2. Demonstrated the validity of using more sophisticated mathematical concepts in problem-solving.
3. Wrote two important texts on the theoretical foundations of elementary algebra.
4. Discovered a new class of quadratic inequalities and provided proofs for their existence.
5. Developed a technique for solving systems of diophantine equations.
6. Demonstrated new methods for approximating integrals.
7. Used innovative techniques to solve complex variational problems.
