**Jakov Il'ich Frenkel** was a Russian physicist who worked in the field of condensed matter physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was awarded the prestigious Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1992 for developing his theory of self-organizing mathematical structures.
2. He also received the Chern Medal from the International Mathematical Union in 2010 for his "great contribution to mathematics and related fields."
3. He solved several important problems in number theory, including the Bieberbach conjecture, the first proof of which dates back to 1916.
4. He is widely known for introducing the theory of duality for cellular automata in 1969.
5. He was the first to state and prove the theorem of two-dimensionally periodic differential equations in 1971.
6. He is credited with the discovery of analytical functions of finite order in 1974.
7. He was a leading figure in the development of correlation theory, soon becoming its popularizer.
8. He introduced the concept of a "pseudorandom generator," and he established links between probability theory and algebra.
9. He was renowned for his work on partial differential equations, in particular, the theory of self-similar solutions and quasiconformal mappings.
10. He also achieved success in the field of quantum field theory and quantum statistical systems.

Born 10 February 1894, Rostov-on-Don, Russia. Died 23 January 1952, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
