**Jakov Il'ich Frenkel** was a Russian physicist who worked in the field of condensed matter physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After one year in a Gymnasium, Jacov Il'ich was sent to Switzerland in 1905 because of the situation in Russia.
* There Frenkel entered the K May Gymnasium.
* By 1910 Frenkel was discovering mathematics for himself and working extremely hard.
* His work was shown to J V Uspenskii, a student of A A Markov, who saw that Frenkel had discovered many results on finite differences for himself.
* Frenkel graduated from the K May Gymnasium in 1913 with distinction and was awarded the Gold Medal.
* In November 1925 Frenkel set out on a European tour, spending a year visiting Germany, France, and England.
* If you think this means that a whole year went by without Frenkel publishing a book then you would be wrong for between the two volumes of Wave mechanics he published Statistical physics in 1933.

Born 10 February 1894, Rostov-on-Don, Russia. Died 23 January 1952, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
