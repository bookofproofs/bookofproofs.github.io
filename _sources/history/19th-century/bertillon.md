**Jacques Bertillon** was a French statistician who applied statistics to social sciences.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Jacques's maternal grandfather, Achille Guillard (1799-1876), is famed as the person who coined the term 'demography' in 1855.
* Jacques had a younger brother, Alphonse Bertillon, who was born on 24 April 1853.
* Both Jacques and Alphonse achieved fame and collaborated on a number of projects.
* Bertillon was educated as a physician before he turned his attention to statistics, but he invariably applied his statistics techniques to problems of a social nature.
* His work grew out of a tradition pioneered by Adolphe Quetelet and developed by Bertillon's grandfather, Achille Guillard, and father, Louis-Adolphe Bertillon.
* Some of Bertillon's early statistical work involved comparative studies of divorce rates and suicide rates between different countries which he published in Annales de d√©mographie internationale; he became the editor of the journal in 1882.
* In 1883 Bertillon's father, Louis-Adolphe, died and Jacques Bertillon succeeded him as director of the Bureau de Statistique Municipale in Paris; he held this post for thirty years until 1913.
* A study of the causes of death led him to introduce the 'Bertillon classification'.
* Of course, Bertillon was well known to members of the government being on various bodies such as the Higher Council of Statistics, which advised the government on statistical matters, and the Committee on Public Hygiene.
* Certainly not all of Bertillon's arguments have been accepted.
* Bertillon also ventured a guess about why sickness rates were higher in English societies: those societies were richer and thus better able to pay benefits.
* But Bertillon is guilty of being systematically inattentive to the significant details of the thing he purported to study.
* We should also mention another important contribution made by Bertillon in collaboration with his brother Alphonse Bertillon who was in the Police Force.
* Later Bertillon invented the fingerprint system but it was his brother Alphonse who saw the practical implementation and use by the police.

Born 11 November 1851, Paris, France. Died 7 July 1922, Valmondois, near Paris, France.
