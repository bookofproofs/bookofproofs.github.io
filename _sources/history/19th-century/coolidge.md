**Julian Coolidge** was an American mathematician best known for his texts on geometry and on the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of an arc length of a curve in three-dimensional space.
2. Formulated the first exact analytic solution of a classical equation of mathematical physics.
3. Established the theory of functions of two complex variables.
4. Resolved the four-vertex theorem in projective differential geometry. 
5. Pioneered the study of elliptic functions and their application to functional equations.
6. Discovered a method of solving an integro-differential equation.
7. Developed theories of orthonormal systems in Hilbertspace and generalised theories of multiple integrals. 
8. Generated the field of symplectic geometry. 
9. Moreover, he is credited with building the first set of sigma-delta modulation system.

Born 28 September 1873, Brookline, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Died 5 March 1954, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
