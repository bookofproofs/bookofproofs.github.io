**Johann Balmer** is best remembered for his work on spectral series and his formula for the wavelengths of the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Balmer series of spectral lines for the hydrogen atom, which provided the first systematic method for predicting the spectral lines of any element.
2. Introduced the familiar mathematical form of the Balmer series, called the Balmer equation.
3. Demonstrated the use of the Balmer series to determine the wavelengths of spectral lines.
4. Pioneered the use of spectroscopy in astronomy to measure the composition of astronomical objects.
5. Created a method for determining the relative intensities of spectral lines.
6. Developed a mathematical formula for the intensities of spectral lines.
7. Discovered the Balmer Law of wavelengths for the hydrogen atom.
8. Discovered the physical basis for the Balmer series.

Born 1 May1825, Lausen, Basel-Land, Switzerland. Died 12 March 1898, Basel, Switzerland.
