**Glenny Smeal** studied at Melbourne University and Imperial College London. After some time in Edinburgh he moved to a post in Statistical Methods and Computation at Leeds.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Smeal's studies at Imperial College were financed by a 1851 Exhibition Scholarship from 1912 to 1914.
* In 1914 Smeal was appointed as Assistant Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.
* Smeal's letter of resignation was put to the Court of Edinburgh University on 25 April 1921.
* Edinburgh University appointed George Robinson as Smeal's successor at Edinburgh.
* From 1925 to 1946 Smeal was a Lecturer in Statistical Method and Computation at the University of Leeds.
* Smeal joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in December 1914 soon after his appointment as an Assistant at Edinburgh.
* We note that Smeal corresponded with R A Fisher after moving to Leeds.
* Fisher's papers contain 24 letters and notes, with tables and copies of printed examination papers in statistics, sent by Smeal to Fisher between December 1925 and March 1928.
* Among Smeals' publications are (with Ernest Frederick John Love) The psychrometric formula (1911), (with S Brodetsky) On Graeffe's method for complex roots of algebraic equations (1924) and  The equations of the gravitational field in orthogonal coordinates (1926).
