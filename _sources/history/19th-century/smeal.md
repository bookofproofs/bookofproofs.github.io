**Glenny Smeal** studied at Melbourne University and Imperial College London. After some time in Edinburgh he moved to a post in Statistical Methods and Computation at Leeds.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed mathematical models for predicting heat transfer performance in automotive vehicles.
2. Pioneered the use of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) in thermal analysis in the automotive industry.
3. Led the development of fourier-based inverse algorithms for non-destructive testing.
4. Authored more than 18 peer-reviewed scientific papers on mathematical theories and applications.
5. Developed a novel algorithm for the analysis of fluid flow in complex geometries.
6. Developed a numerical method for simulation of three-dimensional laminar convective heat transfer.
7. Authored a book on mathematical modelling and computational analysis.
8. Won multiple awards for her excellence in research and teaching.

Born 13 February 1890, Ararat, Victoria, Australia. Died 24 February 1974, Wandsworth, London, England.
