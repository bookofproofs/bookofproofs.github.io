**Duilio Gigli** was an Italian mathematician who produced works on algebra, geometry and mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Torquato Gigli (1845-1936), born in Sansepolcro, studied chemical science at Pisa and lectured at the University as well as becoming head of the municipal chemical laboratory for many years.
* After his studies at a classical school in Pavia, Duilio Gigli studied mathematics at the Scuola normale superiore in Pisa, where he was taught by Luigi Bianchi.
* Following his doctorate Gigli spent another year undertaking further studies at Pisa; then he was appointed as an assistant at the University of Pisa.
* From 1910 Gigli taught at the Foscolo High School in Pavia, then at Portoferraio, Forl√¨, Sondrio and finally at Sassari in Sardinia before returning again to the Foscolo di Pavia (where he was also vice-president).
* Regarding the concept of number, Gigli referred, among the many references, directly to the arithmetic of Giuseppe Peano, and tried to use his investigations into the fundamentals in his teaching.
* in 1930, under the editorship of Luigi Berzolari (1863-1949), Giulio Vivanti (1859-1949), and Duilio Gigli (1878- 1933), appeared the first part of the first volume of 'Enciclopedia dette matematiche elementari'; the second part was published in 1932, both parts (each with its own author index) making a volume of nearly 1100 pages.
* While paying homage to Professor Gigli's thought effort, we will admit that conciseness is not always the prime quality of his explanations and demonstrations; this may be due to the point of view he wanted to take.

Born 8 January 1878, Sansepolcro, Alta Valle del Tevere, Italy. Died 10 May 1933, Pavia, Italy.
