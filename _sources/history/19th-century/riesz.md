**Riesz** was a founder of functional analysis and his work has many important applications in physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of non-Euclidean geometry and topology. 
2. Developed his famous theorem of Orthogonal Series. 
3. Accomplished a proof of the existence of a Fourier series. 
4. Discovered the notion of distribution in mathematics. 
5. Developed the concept of Riesz potentials and related functions. 
6. Established the theory of measure and integration. 
7. Pioneered the development of linear functional analysis. 
8. Introduced the notion of inner product spaces and developed the concept of duality. 
9. Researched the type theory of analytic functions. 
10. Introduced the Riesz Representation theorem for linear functional analysis.

Born 22 January 1880, Györ, Austria-Hungary (now Hungary). Died 28 February 1956, Budapest, Hungary.
