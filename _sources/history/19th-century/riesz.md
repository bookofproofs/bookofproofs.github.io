**Riesz** was a founder of functional analysis and his work has many important applications in physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Frigyes (or Frederic in German) Riesz studied at Budapest.
* Riesz was a founder of functional analysis and his work has many important applications in physics.
* In 1907 and 1909 Riesz produced representation theorems for functional on quadratic Lebesgue integrable functions and, in the second paper, in terms of a Stieltjes integral.
* A satisfactory theory of series of orthonormal functions only became possible after the invention of the Lebesgue integral and this theory was largely the work of Riesz.
* Riesz's work of 1910 marks the start of operator theory.
* Riesz was appointed to a chair in Kolozsvár in Hungary in 1911.
* In Szeged in 1922 Riesz set up the János Bolyai Mathematical Institute in a joint venture with Haar.
* Riesz became editor of the newly founded journal of the Institute Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum which quickly became a major source of mathematics.
* Riesz was to publish many papers in this journal, the first in 1922 being on Egorov's theorem on linear functionals.
* In 1945 Riesz was appointed to the chair of mathematics in the University of Budapest.
* Many of Riesz's fundamental findings in functional analysis were incorporated with those of Banach.
* His theorem, now called the Riesz-Fischer theorem, which he proved in 1907, is fundamental in the Fourier analysis of Hilbert space.
* Riesz made many contributions to other areas including ergodic theory where he gave an elementary proof of the mean ergodic theorem in 1938.
* The more leisurely mastership of F Riesz's style, whether he writes in his native Hungarian, or in French or German, conveys such pleasure and is to the older mathematician a nostalgic remainder of what we are in danger to lose.
* With it, and with all his other work, will live the memory of Frederic Riesz as a great and fertile mathematician for long in the history of our art.
* Riesz received many honours for his work.

Born 22 January 1880, Györ, Austria-Hungary (now Hungary). Died 28 February 1956, Budapest, Hungary.
