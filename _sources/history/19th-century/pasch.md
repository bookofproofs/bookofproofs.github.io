**Moritz Pasch** was a German mathematician who worked on the foundations of geometry. He found a number of assumptions in Euclid that nobody had noticed before.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pasch proved the first version of what is now known as the Pasch Axiom, which states that between any two points that lie on the same side of a line, there is at least one other point lying on the opposite side of the line.
2. He also published his book Vorlesungen über neuere Geometrie (‘Lectures on Modern Geometry’) in 1882 which established the basis of modern synthetic geometry.
3. Pasch was the first mathematician to use the concept of a Jordan curve, which is the path a continuously moving point takes throughout a 2D space, to prove theorems.
4. Pasch developed his own definition of a ‘limit’, later known as the Pasch Limit Theorem; this was a precursor to the modern definition of a limit.
5. He was a pioneer of non-Euclidean geometry in the 1880s; he developed the first ‘non-Euclidean’ definition of a ‘straight line’ which, he argued, was mutually exclusive from Euclidean definitions.
6. He proved that the concept of the ‘curvature of a line’, which was a crucial component of the mathematical fields of topology and differential geometry, could be calculated from the size of a triangle.
7. Pasch formulated the first definition of a 'geometric group'; a group of permutations operating on a space which does not shift the shape of the space.

Born 8 November 1843, Breslau, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 20 September 1930, Bad Homburg, Germany.
