**Edwin Hubble** was an American astronomer who first detected that the universe is expanding.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the relationship between redshift and distance in the universe, leading to the modern understanding of cosmology and an expanding universe. 
2. Discovered numerous galaxies outside of the Milky Way, including the Andromeda Galaxy, and discovered that these galaxies had an extraordinary range of distances and velocities. 
3. Discovered Cepheid variables, which allowed him to quantify the distance to nearby galaxies and redefine the astronomical sphere of influence of the Milky Way. 
4. Established the first classifications for galaxies and further developed a scheme for categorizing galaxies by their visual attributes.  
5. Developed the mathematical measurements for calculating the rate of expansion of the universe. 
6. Constructed the Hubble Law, a linear relationship between distance and redshift in the universe, proposed the Hubble constant to calculate distances to galaxies, and formulated the Hubble–Lemaȋtre Law.

Born 20 November 1889, Marshfield, Missouri, USA. Died 28 September 1953, San Marino, California, USA.
