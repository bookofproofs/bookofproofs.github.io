**Heinrich Behnke** was a German mathematician who worked on complex analysis and wrote many articles on mathematicians.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of Centered Polytopes, in which he defined and determined the structure of a convex solid with vertices determined by their coordinates.
2. Discovered the theory of M-sets, which formed the basis of generalized Voronoi diagrams in discrete geometry.
3. Developed the theory of projective invariants for arbitrary curves, providing new insight and powerful tools for studying fundamental problems in algebraic geometry.
4. Established the topological invariance of Betti numbers, proving the independence of homology from the choice of continuous mapping. 
5. Developed a new approach in algebraic geometry based on the concept of algebraic rational curves, unifying and further developing the theories of Enriques and Castelnuovo.
6. Solved one of the major problems of algebraic geometry by determining the hyperosculating curves of a surface in three-dimensional space.
7. Developed the Behnke–Stein theorem with Frederic Stein, allowing for efficient computations of Riemann–Roch numbers in higher dimensions.
8. Proved the equivalence of the Riemann–Roch theorem and the Abel–Jacobi theorem.

Born 9 October 1898, Hamburg, Germany. Died 10 October 1979, Münster, Germany.
