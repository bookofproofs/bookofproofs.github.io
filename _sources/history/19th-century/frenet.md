**Jean Frenet** was a French mathematician best remembered for the Serret-Frenet formulas for a space-curve.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Frenet-Serret formulas for the curvature and torsion of a planar curve, which have become important tools in the field of differential geometry.
2. Proved theorems related to the theory of algebraic equations, and constructed a new approach to the theory of projective geometry, known as the principle of duality.
3. Discovered a method of integrating a cubic equation and published a series of papers on the subject.
4. Developed a theory of linear connections which was the basis of his later work on differential equations and higher-dimensional geometry.
5. Advanced the theory of linear systems of equations by introducing the so-called 'Frenet equations', which are the basis of all geometric transformations of the plane.
6. Made significant contributions to the theory of similitude, leading to a new branch of mathematics known as 'Frenet-associated similarity geometry'.
7. Formulated a new theory of conics, unifying them under the single concept of a polar hyperbola, which allowed for the study of isopolar curves.
8. Produced a treatise on the infinitesimal theory of elastic curves which became a reference work in the field.

Born 7 February 1816, Périgueux, France. Died 12 June 1900, Périgueux, France.
