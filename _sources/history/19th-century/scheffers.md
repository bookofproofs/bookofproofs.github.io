**Georg Scheffers** was a German mathematician specializing in differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Demonstrated the usefulness of elliptic functions in mechanics, geometry, and algebra.
2. Published a German translation of an Italian textbook on mathematics, which became a widely used resource.
3. Developed a simplified method of calculating the roots of a cubic equation.
4. Developed a method for approximating the roots of a cubic equation.
5. Worked on a new, alternative approach to the calculus of variations.
6. Collaborated on producing an abridged version of the Fields of Mathematics and wrote numerous volume, related to elementary mathematics and calculus of finite differences.
7. Solved a problem concerning the motion of the Earth around the Sun.
8. Established an equation involving the angles of a triangle.
9. Improved the existing theory of ellipses by producing positive results concerning the movements of planets.
10. Published a book generalizing existing results of mathematical physics.

Born 21 November 1866, Altendorf (near Holzminden), Germany. Died 12 August 1945, Berlin, Germany.
