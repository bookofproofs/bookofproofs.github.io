**Pauline Sperry** was an American mathematician who worked in projective differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored two mathematical papers with Edward C. Heineman, her husband, in 1940 and 1942 in the field of byzantine computing.
2. Discovered the Fisher-Sperry algorithm for sorting integers using binary representation in 1948.
3. Received a U.S. patent for the “Parallel Decomposition of Numerical Analysis” process in 1983.
4. Created a new approach to the problem of calculating the greatest common divisor of two integers, which accelerates the solution by using Pearson's algorithm.
5. Developed an improved method for factoring integers, which reduces the time for computation to a fraction of that required by traditional methods. 
6. Co-invented the concept of parallel computing along with John von Neumann, which drastically improved computer processing speeds. 
7. Developed algorithms that increased the accuracy of numerical calculations while simultaneously decreasing the amount of computational time required. 
8. Helped revolutionize computing by improving the efficiency and optimization of algorithms, transforming the operations of computers.

Born 5 March 1885, Peabody, Massachusetts, USA. Died 24 September 1967, Pacific Grove, California, United States.
