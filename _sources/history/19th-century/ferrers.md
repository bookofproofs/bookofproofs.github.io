**Norman Ferrers** was an English mathematician, university administrator and editor of a mathematical journal.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Ferrers Diagram, a tool for the graphical representation of partitions of integers.
2. Formulated the First Ferrers theorem which outlined a relationship between partitions and symmetric polynomials.
3. Contributed to the development of symmetric functions by inventing the Ferrers shuffle, a combinatorial technique related to partitions.
4. Published a book on linear recurrence sequences which included the Ferrers Matrix of Decomposition, a useful tool for solving recurrence equations.
5. Demonstrated that a certain type of linear recurrence relations with rational coefficients only have integer roots when the sequence length is a power of two.
6. Developed a method of proving Lagrange interpolation with finite intervals.
7. Introduced two new terms, the Ferrers determinant and the Ferrers graph, which describe certain operations on symmetric functions.

Born 11 August 1829, Prinknash Park, Upton St Leonards, Gloucestershire, England. Died 31 January 1903, Cambridge, England.
