**Christian Doppler** was an Austrian mathematician who is best known for the _Doppler effect_ in wave theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Doppler equation which relates the frequency of wave radiation to the relative motion of the source and receiver.
2. Published initial studies on acoustics in the early 1840s, examining the wave activity of stretched strings and vibrating rods.
3. Discovered the principle of resonance, which later became the basis of wave theory.
4. Developed formulas for calculating the angular velocity, wave amplitude, and wave velocity.
5. Developed a wave theory of light which built off Newtonian optics and set the groundwork for the general wave approach to discussing light.
6. Made numerous contributions to the field of hydrodynamics, including further work done with the wave equation and wave motion.
7. Proposed the principle of "constant aberration" which suggested that the speed of any wave travelling through a given medium was unaffected by the movement of that medium.

Born 29 November 1803, Salzburg, Austria. Died 17 March 1853, Venice (now Italy).
