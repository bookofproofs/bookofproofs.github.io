**Thomas MacFarland Cherry** was an Australian mathematician who was Professor of Mathematics  at the University of Melbourne for many years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Thomas was brought up in Glen Iris on the outskirts of Melbourne which at that time was almost in the country.
* An indication of the rural nature of Glen Iris is that Thomas had to walk over 6 km each day to attend primary school.
* In 1924 Cherry won the Smith prize for applied mathematics and was elected a fellow of Trinity College.
* Cherry also spent one term teaching at the University of Edinburgh in 1927 substituting for Charles Galton Darwin (son of George Howard Darwin).
* During his time as a fellow of Trinity College, Cherry spent time with his two main hobbies, mountaineering and scouting.
* Cherry had returned to Australia in March 1929 to take up a professorship at the University of Melbourne.
* Let us look more closely at a few of Cherry's papers to give at least an indication of the topics on which he undertook research.
* In the second part of the paper, published two years later, Cherry extended his results to cover the case where circulation is not zero.
* In On expansions in eigenfunctions, particularly in Bessel functions (1949) Cherry gives a form of the integral theorems of Fourier, Hankel and Heinrich Weber which is applicable to functions which are exponentially large at infinity.
* In early 1965 Cherry suffered a heart attack after a particularly difficult incident during his climbing.
* Cherry received many distinctions for his contributions to mathematics.

Born 21 May 1898, Glen Iris, Melbourne, Australia. Died 21 November 1966, Melbourne, Australia.
