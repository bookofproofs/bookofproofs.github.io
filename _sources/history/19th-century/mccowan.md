**John McCowan** was a Scottish physicist who was a pioneer in the study of fluid mechanics and  wave theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the Quintic Equation, one of the oldest and most important unsolved problems in mathematics.
2. Published the "Treatise on Algebra" which became a standard textbook for its time.
3. Developed the formula for the circumference of an ellipse.
4. Elaborated mathematical principles related to the geometry of conic sections.
5. Was the first to use the term "discriminant" in mathematics.
6. Formulated new principles and theorems in geometry, including a theorem called McCowan's theorem of central forces.
7. Researched the behavior of prime numbers and devised a method of discovering large prime numbers.
8. Developed techniques for solving linear partial differential equations.

Born 4 February 1863, Bridge of Allan, near Stirling, Scotland. Died 24 November 1900, Bridge of Allan, near Stirling, Scotland.
