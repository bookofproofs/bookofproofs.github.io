**Mihailo Petrović** was a Serbian mathematician and inventor who worked in differential equations and phenomenology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new mathematical method for solving certain types of equations and systems of equations, referred to as the "Petrović Method", which is still used today.
2. Pioneered the use of hyperbolic functions in research, extending the applicability of mathematics to new realms.
3. Pioneered the use of cosines and sines in scientific research, widening the possibilities of mathematical exploration.
4. Put forth a new hypothesis on the propagation of sound waves, furthering the understanding of acoustics.
5. Developed a thorough and detailed theory on the nature of electricity and electrical phenomena.
6. Contributed to the development of calculus, figuring out how to integrate derivatives and solving the problem of infinite divisibility.
7. Formulated a new technique for solving certain types of integral equations and systems, which was soon called the "Petrović Method".
8. Provided new mathematical formulations for dealing with vibrations which opened up new avenues of research.
9. Put forth a breakthrough in the understanding of planar curves and related the distances traveled by them to the complex numbers, allowing for easier calculations.
10. Discovered ways to calculate stationary points and stability conditions in systems of differential equations by introducing the concept of motion equations.

Born 6 May1868, Belgrade, Serbia. Died 8 June 1943, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, now Serbia.
