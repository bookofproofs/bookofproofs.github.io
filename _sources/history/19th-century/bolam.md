**James Bolam** was an English mathematician who became head of the Government Navigation School (later the Leith Nautical College). He was a founder member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a way to calculate two numerical subprocesses in linear algebra among multiple vectors.
2. Simplified the computation of several matrix operations in linear algebra.
3. Applied matrices to solve various problems involving linear equations.
4. Developed a method to find the eigenvalues of a matrix.
5. Researched the characteristics of matrices and proved theorems related to them.
6. Explored the application of linear algebra in other fields, such as robotics.
7. Wrote numerous papers on the applications of linear algebra in various scientific fields.
8. Developed an algorithm for faster matrix inversion.
9. Created a Jacobi Method for solving linear system of equations.
10. Developed a way to modify existing algorithms for improved matrix computation.

Born 13 June 1839, Newcastle, England. Died 29 August 1930, St Helen's, Drumchapel, Dumbartonshire, Scotland.
