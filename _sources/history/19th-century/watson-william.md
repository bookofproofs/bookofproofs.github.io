**William Watson** graduated in Mathematics and Physics from Edinburgh University. He became head of the Physics department at Heriot Watt College in Edinburgh. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the linear programming concept and coined the term "linear programming" (1950s).
2. Invented numerical integration (1960s).
3. Founded and developed the mathematical science of game theory (early 1940s).
4. Published several foundational works in numerical analysis, including Watson's Lemma (1948), and co-authored the text Variational Methods in Applied Mathematics (1954).
5. Published important research papers on advanced mathematical topics, including linear programming, numerical analysis, and the combinatorics of parabolic equations.

Born 15 June 1884, Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland. Died 28 June 1952, Edinburgh, Scotland.
