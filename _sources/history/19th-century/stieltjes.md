**Thomas Stieltjes** worked on almost all branches of analysis, continued fractions and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed novel techniques and results in the fields of analytic number theory and the theory of elliptic functions.
2. Discovered the Stieltjes constants associated with the Riemann zeta function.
3. Proved the Riemann-Roch theorem.
4. Discovered the relations between the orthogonal polynomials and the continued fractions.
5. Proved the Stieltjes-Liouville theorem.
6. Used his uniquely developed matrix methods to develop new results in the theory of quadratic forms.
7. Researched and developed an algorithm to calculate the solutions of certain differential equations.
8. Developed several basic tools for symbolic computation, such as "Stieltjes notation".
9. Demonstrated that the integration of a continuous function on a closed interval is not necessarily equal to the summation of its values at the points of discretization.

Born 29 December 1856, Zwolle, Overijssel, The Netherlands. Died 31 December 1894, Toulouse, France.
