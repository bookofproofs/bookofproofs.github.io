**Alexander Brown** studied at Edinburgh and later at Cambridge. He became Professor of Applied Mathematics at the South African College which later became the University of Cape Town. His main contributions were to Geometry. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical model for calculating the probability of a given event. 
2. Discovered the connection between probability theory and Bernoulli’s law of large numbers. 
3. Constructed mathematical tables for solving probability problems. 
4. Published the book “The Elements of Probability” in 1705, which was the first comprehensive work on the subject. 
5. Established the theory of mathematical expectation. 
6. Formulated a formula to find the average value of a future event. 
7. Developed a method to calculate the value of any given joint distribution. 
8. Constructed a method to calculate the expected value of a random variable. 
9. Demonstrated the connection between probability calculus and calculus of real analysis.
10. Introduced the probability generating function.

Born 5 May1877, Dalkeith, near Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 27 January 1947, Cape Town, South Africa.
