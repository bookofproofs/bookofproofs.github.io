**Karl Sundman** was a Finnish mathematician who used analytic methods to find a solution to the three-body problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the application of multiple-precision arithmetic to numerical integration, providing a crucial tool for discovering new planets.
2. Developed a method for calculating the motion of three massive bodies such as the Earth, Moon, and Sun.
3. Credited with the discovery of the Moon's secular perturbations, a phenomenon related to the secular variation of the mean longitude of the Moon.
4. Successfully calculated the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, allowing him to explain the Bode-Titius Law.
5. Developed a method for the numerical integration of perturbations of Kepler's orbits.
6. Devised a method for transforming between orbital elements, and computing the period of a periodic orbit from its elements.
7. Founded the field of Celestial Mechanics, paving the way for future astronomical discoveries.

Born 28 October 1873, Kasko, Vaasa, Finland. Died 28 September 1949, Helsinki, Finland.
