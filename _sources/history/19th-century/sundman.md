**Karl Sundman** was a Finnish mathematician who used analytic methods to find a solution to the three-body problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father John Frithiof Sundman was a customs officer.
* Karl's health was poor as he was growing up and he certainly did not have a very easy time studying on his own without a teacher so that he could take the baccalaureate examinations, which he did on 18 May 1893.
* After qualifying to enter university, Sundman went to Helsinki (Helsingfors) where he began his studies in the autumn of 1883.
* The University was an ancient one, founded in 1640, and there Sundman excelled academically although he had to battle against financial difficulties.
* After graduating Sundman went to Pulkovo Observatory to continue his research on astronomy.
* Sundman, however, was interested in the theoretical aspects of astronomy.
* In this work Sundman examined the perturbations of minor planets whose period of revolution round the sun is in the ratio of 1:2 of that of Jupiter.
* In 1902 Sundman was appointed as a lecturer at the University of Helsinki, being promoted to extraordinary professor of astronomy there in 1907.
* The most famous contribution of Sundman was his solution of the three-body problem which he accomplished using analytic methods to prove the existence of an infinite series solution.
* In 1913 the Academy of Sciences in Paris awarded Sundman their Pontécoulant prize for his outstanding work on this problem.
* One of the reasons why the Academy was so impressed by Sundman's solution was that it was a problem to which Henri Poincaré had devoted much effort.
* To regularize the singularity of the differential equations of motion, in the 1912 paper mentioned above, Sundman introduced a new independent variable which regularizes the motion within a band of finite breadth.
* it is possible to show the existence of two different research programs, one related to Levi-Civita's works, the other to Sundman's investigations, which include for the first time a complete regularization of the three-body problem.
* Sundman will always be known for his remarkable solution to the extremely difficult three-body problem, but he did other important work.
* Such a machine will necessarily be very complicated and Sundman describes the project in detail using well-known techniques and construction capabilities in a field unrelated to astronomy.
* In the 1940 paper Sundman gave a new and elegant demonstration of the theorem of Poisson on the invariability of the major axes of the planetary orbits which had been demonstrated in several ways.
* This last statement suggests that Sundman may not have been pleased had he realised that 60 years after his death a biography describing his remarkable achievements would be placed on the web!

Born 28 October 1873, Kasko, Vaasa, Finland. Died 28 September 1949, Helsinki, Finland.
