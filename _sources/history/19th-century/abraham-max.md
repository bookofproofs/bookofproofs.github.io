**Max Abraham** was a German physicist who worked on electromagnetism and relativity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. In 1906, Max Abraham presented a paper entitled “On the Moment of Inertia Theory” which provided a new approach to the dynamics of moving rigid bodies. 
2. In 1909, Abraham developed a method of calculating the orbits of stars and planets which was a sophisticated approach to celestial mechanics. 
3. In 1913, he published “The Foundations of Dynamics”, a textbook that drew connections between the principles of Newtonian mechanics, special relativity, and Hamiltonian mechanics.
4. In 1911, Abraham was able to explain the non-Newtonian results of the Michelson-Morley experiment which helped to lay the foundations of modern physics.
5. Abraham published a proof of the mean value theorem in 1903, extending the field of calculus to functions with more than one variable. 
6. Abraham introduced the concept of scattering from Maxwell's equations in 1905, anticipating the work of Albert Einstein.
7. Max Abraham published the equations of motion for dielectric-medium radiation in 1909, furthering the understanding of electromagnetic waves.

Born 26 March 1875, Danzig, Germany (now Gdańsk, Poland). Died 16 November 1922, Munich, Germany.
