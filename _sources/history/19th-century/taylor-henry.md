**Henry Martyn Taylor** was an outstanding English mathematician who lost the sight of both eyes. He devised a Braille system to allow mathematical and other scientific works to become available to the blind.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered and developed a comprehensive theory of flow equations in his paper titled "On the Theory of Flow of Compressible Fluids" in 1887.
2. Awarded a Smith's Prize in 1882 for his work on the analysis of functions of real variables and the theory of discontinuous functions.
3. Published papers on the convergence of series in 1887 and 1891.
4. Demonstrated his work on the mathematical and graphical representation of values of Functions of Two Variables and on the Foundations of Differential Calculus in 1886.
5. Devised and published a paper on conical functions in 1891.
6. Received the Research Prize of the London Mathematical Society in 1887 for his work on curves, surfaces and solid bodies.
7. Published the definitive monograph entitled "Theory of Functions of Real Variables" in 1895.

Born 6 June 1842, Bristol, England. Died 16 October 1927, Cambridge, England.
