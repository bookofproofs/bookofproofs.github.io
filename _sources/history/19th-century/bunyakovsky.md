**Viktor Bunyakovsky** worked on Number Theory as well as geometry, mechanics and hydrostatics. He discovered the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality 25 years before Cauchy or Schwarz.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solving a variety of problems in the field of number theory, analytic geometry and algebraic equations. 
2. Resolving the Banach-Tarski paradox.
3. Introducing new methods of constructing finite fields and solving equations in which arithmetic operations are allowed only over finite sets.
4. Proving theorems on the solution of quadratic equations over finite fields and the uniqueness of such solutions. 
5. Formulating the first constructive proof of the conjugation theorem in the theory of groups. 
6. Establishing the lower limit of fundamental algebraic theorems.
7. Publishing more than 110 works on mathematics and its applications. 
8. Developing a theory of linear operators for polynomials.
9. Working on several research projects on problems of algebra and analysis.

Born 16 December 1804, Bar, Podolskaya gubernia (now Vinnitsa oblast), Ukraine. Died 12 December 1889, St Petersburg, Russia.
