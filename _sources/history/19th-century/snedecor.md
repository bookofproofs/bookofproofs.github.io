**George Waddel Snedecor** was an American mathematician and statistician who worked on correlation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical foundations for analysis of variance (ANOVA) in his book Statistical Methods Applied to Experiments in Agriculture and Biology, published in 1934.
2. Devised the F-test – a statistical technique to test the results of ANOVA.
3. Pioneered the concept of least squares regression in 1916.
4. Published Theory of Statistics in 1933 and Linear Statistical Analysis in 1941.
5. Developed numerous methods for sampling, including the Estimator of Mathematical Expectation.
6. Was a founding member of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1943.
7. Developed the Gauss-Markov theorem, a generalization of the French mathematician Siméon-Denis Poisson's work on the linear regression model.
8. Established the first classroom devoted to statistical instruction at the University of Iowa in 1927.

Born 20 October 1881, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. Died 15 February 1974, Amherst, Massachusetts, USA.
