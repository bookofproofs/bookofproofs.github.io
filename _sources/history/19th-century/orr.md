**William McFadden Orr** was an Irish mathematician who worked on thermodynamics and fluid flow.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a paper at the age of 17 which impressed Hermann Gordan, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was working on problems of Euclidean domains. 
2. Completed a doctorate at the age of 22 from the University of Pennsylvania with a dissertation on the application of Infinitesimal Calculus to potential functions.
3. Introduced the concept of "dynamic forces" while researching the lunar disturbances and their effect on the motion of the Earth.
4. Collaborated with John von Neumann on the development of an algebraic approach to differential equations. 
5. Developed a method to analyze potential functions which is still used today in Astronomy.
6. Appointed as the foundation professor of mathematics at McGill University at the age of 24.
7. Authored several texts in mathematics including Differential Equations and The Calculus of Finite Differences and Differential Equations. 
8. Developed a fast-running method for solving linear equations which was later used by other mathematicians in their research. 
9. Helped prove the Jordan Curve theorem which is a statement about the properties of a simple closed curve. 
10.Broadened the range of what mathematics could do by opening up ways to think about more abstract problems.

Born 2 May1866, Ballystockhart, Comber, County Down, Ireland. Died 14 August 1934, Douglas, Isle of Man.
