**Ernst Schröder** was a German mathematician who did important work is in the area of algebra, set theory and logic. His work on ordered sets and ordinal numbers is fundamental to the subject.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He introduced the delta operator, which enabled him to formally quantify the concept of differentiation of a function.
2. He was one of the first mathematicians to use matrices for describing linear operations.
3. He developed an algebraic system for treating derivatives of arbitrary orders.
4. He developed formal definitions of limit and continuity by incorporating the notion of neighborhoods into analysis.
5. He established the modern theory of linear partial differences in which derivatives of higher orders can be expressed as linear combinations of lower-order derivatives.
6. He developed the concept of integration by parts. 
7. He developed the Schröder-Bernstein Theorem, which states that any two countable sets of real numbers are equal. 
8. He developed the notion of a Dedekind cut, which unified the concepts of irrational and rational numbers and enabled the definition of real numbers.
9. He was one of the first mathematicians to recognize the importance of alternative forms of mathematical notation. 
10. He was one of the first to identify that certain kinds of problems are best solved using the principle of mathematical induction.

Born 25 November 1841, Mannheim, Germany. Died 16 June 1902, Karlsruhe, Germany.
