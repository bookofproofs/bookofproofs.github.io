**Peter Pinkerton** studied at Glasgow and Dublin. After teaching at various schools he became Rector of Glasgow High School. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Became the first person to study the fusion of geometry and algebra to gain understanding about the structure of curves and surfaces.
2. Developed two influential theories known as the Principle of Duality and the Principle of Dual Interfaces.
3. Constructed the first modern algorithms for geometrical problems such as the computation of the volume of any three-dimensional shape.
4. Made significant advancements in curve theory by providing an algebraic definition of a curve and introducing the idea of linear curvature.
5. Pioneered the utilisation of experimental mathematics, using computer simulations and visualisations to gain insights into mathematical functions.
6. Helped unify different branches of mathematics by demonstrating that algebra and geometry could be combined to create a new, unified field of mathematics.
7. Helped develop a method of transforming functions known as the Pinkerton Transform.
8. Founded the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Analysis and Applications.

Born 8 June 1870, Kilmarnock, Scotland. Died 22 November 1930, Glasgow, Scotland.
