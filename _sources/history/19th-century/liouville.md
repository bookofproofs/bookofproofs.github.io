**Joseph Liouville** is best known for his work on transcendental numbers. He constructed an infinite class of such numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Verified the existence of transcendental numbers through the proof of a particular case of the theorem.
2. Demonstrated rigorously that the logarithm of prime numbers are irrational.
3. Developed the concept of what is now known as Liouville Numbersâ€”a subclass of transcendentals.
4. Developed the idea of "potential theory," which was later expanded to become partial differential equations.
5. Discovered the limit of the prime number theorem and showed that e is transcendental.
6. Developed a method of solving the same types of integrals that had been solved by the method of separation of variables.
7. Developed a rigorous notion of the convergence of a continued fraction. 
8. Extended the concept of power series expansion to arbitrary functions.

Born 24 March 1809, Saint-Omer, France. Died 8 September 1882, Paris, France.
