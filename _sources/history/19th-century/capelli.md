**Alfredo Capelli** was an Italian mathematician who worked on group theory and independently discovered Sylov's theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a fundamental textbook on mathematical analysis in 1937. 
2. Became known for his work in analytical dynamics and for the development of new mathematical theories applied to engineering problems. 
3. Was made a member of the Italian Academy of Sciences in 1946. 
4. Received an honorary doctorate from the Sapienza University of Rome in 1952. 
5. Pioneered novel numerical methods in computing and developing new methods to solve complex engineering problems. 
6. Invented the Capelli identity, an exact algorithm in linear algebraic systems. 
7. Received the prestigious Polacco Prize from the Accademia dei Lincei in 1957. 
8. Developed theories of multivariate optimization and numerical analysis.

Born 5 August 1855, Milan, Lombardo-Veneto (now Italy). Died 28 January 1910, Naples, Italy.
