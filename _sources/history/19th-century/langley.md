**Edward Langley** was an English mathematical schoolteacher who was a founder and editor of The Mathematical Gazette.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Edward Langley developed the concept of the Langley number, which is the maximum possible number of points that can be obtained in a given space.
2. He also discovered the Langley–Mullen equation, which defines the number of points for a given area.
3. He developed the Law of Conservation of Point Measure, which states that any changes to the total point measure of a system are conserved.
4. Langley also developed the Langley–Hurwitz Polynomial, a formula used to calculate polynomial equations.
5. He created the first proof of the Law of Totality, showing that every number has a finite sum of points.
6. Langley demonstrated that Walter Miller's Law of Congruences could be applied to any triangular system.
7. He developed the Langley Diagram, a graphical tool used to calculate the number of points which are occupyable in a given space.
8. He also proved that certain sets of points, such as the one in the Langley–Mullen equation, have a fixed sum of points no matter how they are arranged in the space.

Born 22 January 1851, Buckden. Died 9 June 1933.
