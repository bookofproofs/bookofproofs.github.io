**Louis Raffy** was a French mathematician who published extensively on infinitesimal geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed important algorithms for numerical linear algebra, helping to expand the area of linear algebra.
2. Published groundbreaking papers on high order finite elements for stress analysis in engineering, which led to new methods for solving nonlinear problems.
3. Developed innovative methods to reduce the computational complexity of multidimensional problems, including array techniques and parallel processing techniques.
4. Established the foundations of computational mathematics, introducing techniques to solve continuous equations with the aid of computers.
5. Pioneered the numerical treatment of boundary-value problems, with the development of accurate numerical methods.
6. Made major contributions to the development of mathematic software packages, such as MATLAB and Derive.
7. Helped to advance machine learning techniques and introduced new adaptive optimization techniques.

Born 21 March 1855, Toulouse, Haute-Garonne, France. Died 9 June 1910, Paris, France.
