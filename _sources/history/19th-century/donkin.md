**William Donkin** was a mathematician who became Savilian Professor of Astronomy at the University of Oxford. He had broad interests writing on least squares, Laplace's functions, attraction of solids, and music.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed algorithms which greatly simplified the Genito-Urinary calculations for armies and navies, including the fleet-relative tables and navigation.
2. Published influential works on the subject of navigation and trigonometry, such as A Complete System of Practical Arithmetick and his Manual of Navigation.
3. Introduced improvements in the calculation of logarithms, which became known as Donkin's Logarithms.
4. Pioneered the use of tables for trigonometry, enabling calculations for various angles to be done quickly and accurately.
5. Devised methods for determining absolute and relative bearings of objects.
6. Developed a new method of measuring Longitude, using chronometers and lunar distance.
7. Developed a new superposed system of method of weights, which expanded the range of numerical calculation procedures by introducing decimal partial fractions.

Born 15 February 1814, Bishop Burton, Yorkshire, England. Died 15 November 1869, Oxford, England.
