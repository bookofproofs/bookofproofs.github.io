**William Donkin** was a mathematician who became Savilian Professor of Astronomy at the University of Oxford. He had broad interests writing on least squares, Laplace's functions, attraction of solids, and music.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Thomas Donkin, baptised 8 July 1776 at St John Lee, Sandhoe, Northumberland, was a land agent who married Alice Bateman on 6 June 1809 in Whitby, Yorkshire.
* Thomas and Alice Donkin had eleven children: William Bateman Donkin (born 1810), Sarah Donkin (born 1811), Alice Donkin (born 1812), William Fishburn Donkin (born 1814), Mary Donkin (born 1815), Thomas Bateman Donkin (born 1818), Henry Donkin (born 1820), James Rumsey Donkin (born 1822), Henry Donkin (born 1823), Edward Donkin (born 1825), and Frederick Donkin (born 1828).
* William Fishburn Donkin was, therefore, the second son, but William Bateman Donkin did not survive and so William became the eldest surviving son.
* William Donkin had two uncles who were men of considerable importance.
* Bryan Donkin (1768-1855), a brother of William's father, was both a fellow of the Royal Society and a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.
* Thomas Bateman (1778-1821), a brother of William's mother, studied medicine in Edinburgh and became a leading expert on dermatological diseases.
* Donkin's family wanted him to have a top quality education but they did not want to see him lose the influence that his family were able to provide.
* To achieve this the family moved to York in 1829 so that William Donkin could be educated at the famous St Peter's School, York.
* At St Peter's School, Donkin was taught classics by Stephen Creyke (1796-1883).
* Donkin spent three years at St Peter's School and always emphasised what a huge debt he owed to Creyke who he considered to be a truly outstanding teacher.
* Donkin left St Peter's School in 1832 and matriculated at St Edmund's Hall, University of Oxford, on 10 October 1832.
* He was elected a fellow of University College in 1836, defeating the well-known hymn writer and theologian Frederick William Faber.
* Donkin continued to hold the fellowship until 1843.
* From 1836 to 1842, Donkin was a mathematics lecturer at St Edmund's Hall; he became bursar in 1840.
* One of Donkin's early publications was not on mathematics but on ancient music.
* This article appeared in William Smith's "A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities" published in 1842.
* Donkin (1851) offers some critical remarks on the theory of least squares, and especially on the remarks of Ellis.
* Donkin says that Herschel's proof "should be treated with respect" and that the method of least squares may be used, if for no other reason, because "it is a very good method", as shown by Gauss (1823).
* On 25 June 1844, Donkin married Harriet Hawtrey (1816-1876) in St Peter's Church, Oxford.
* William and Harriet Donkin had six children, one of whom died as a child: William Frederick Donkin (1845-1888); Arthur Edward Donkin (1848-1937); Alice Emily Donkin (1850-1929); Alfred Henry Donkin (1850-1855); Edward Hawtrey Donkin (1853-1927); and Reginald Donkin (1855-1937).
* Indefatigable and successful as lecturer on chemistry at St George's Hospital, and in pursuing the practical developments of electric lighting, Mr Donkin had made his leisure a source of pleasure and instruction to a large public.
* Edward Hawtrey Donkin studied at Lincoln College, Oxford and became Professor of Classics at Royal Holloway College in 1890.
* Let us return to our description of Donkin's life.
* At the time of the 1851 Census the family, consisting of Donkin, his wife and five children, were living in New College Lane, Oxford.
* Donkin's interest in acoustics might explain why he was thought a suitable respondent; his 'Acoustics, Theoretical: Part 1' was published after his death.
* He noted that the current professor neither resided in Oxford nor gave lectures, although William Crotch, professor from 1799 to 1847, had given lectures at the start of the nineteenth century.
* Bartholomew Price wrote a Preface explaining that the book was only the first part of what Donkin had intended.

Born 15 February 1814, Bishop Burton, Yorkshire, England. Died 15 November 1869, Oxford, England.
