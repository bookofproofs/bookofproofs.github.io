**William Donkin** was a mathematician who became Savilian Professor of Astronomy at the University of Oxford. He had broad interests writing on least squares, Laplace's functions, attraction of solids, and music.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* William Fishburn Donkin was, therefore, the second son, but William Bateman Donkin did not survive and so William became the eldest surviving son.
* At St Peter's School, Donkin was taught classics by Stephen Creyke (1796-1883).
* Donkin spent three years at St Peter's School and always emphasised what a huge debt he owed to Creyke who he considered to be a truly outstanding teacher.
* Donkin left St Peter's School in 1832 and matriculated at St Edmund's Hall, University of Oxford, on 10 October 1832.
* He was elected a fellow of University College in 1836, defeating the well-known hymn writer and theologian Frederick William Faber.
* Donkin continued to hold the fellowship until 1843.
* From 1836 to 1842, Donkin was a mathematics lecturer at St Edmund's Hall; he became bursar in 1840.
* One of Donkin's early publications was not on mathematics but on ancient music.
* This article appeared in William Smith's "A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities" published in 1842.
* Donkin (1851) offers some critical remarks on the theory of least squares, and especially on the remarks of Ellis.
* Donkin says that Herschel's proof "should be treated with respect" and that the method of least squares may be used, if for no other reason, because "it is a very good method", as shown by Gauss (1823).
* Indefatigable and successful as lecturer on chemistry at St George's Hospital, and in pursuing the practical developments of electric lighting, Mr Donkin had made his leisure a source of pleasure and instruction to a large public.
* Edward Hawtrey Donkin studied at Lincoln College, Oxford and became Professor of Classics at Royal Holloway College in 1890.
* Let us return to our description of Donkin's life.
* Donkin's interest in acoustics might explain why he was thought a suitable respondent; his 'Acoustics, Theoretical: Part 1' was published after his death.
* He noted that the current professor neither resided in Oxford nor gave lectures, although William Crotch, professor from 1799 to 1847, had given lectures at the start of the nineteenth century.
* Bartholomew Price wrote a Preface explaining that the book was only the first part of what Donkin had intended.

Born 15 February 1814, Bishop Burton, Yorkshire, England. Died 15 November 1869, Oxford, England.
