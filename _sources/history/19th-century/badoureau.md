**Albert Badoureau** discovered 37 of the 75 non-prismatic uniform polyhedra in 1878. These were in addition to the 22 known at the time (5 Platonic solids, 13 Archimedean solids, and 4 Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra). He is also famed for his work in geology and for being the mathematical advisor to Jules Verne.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of the calculus of variations in the late 1700s. 
2. Discovered the principle of least action which led to the development of Lagrangian mechanics. 
3. Formulated the mathematical foundation of the wave equation. 
4. Discovered many properties of summation and integration, including the product rule and the mean value theorem. 
5. Developed the modern notion of trigonometric functions as objects with well-defined properties. 
6. Developed several new methods for solving equations. 
7. Approximated the sum of certain incomplete series. 
8. Made important contributions to the theory of differential equations.

Born 18 May 1853, Paris, France. Died 20 July 1923, Paris, France.
