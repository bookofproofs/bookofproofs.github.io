**Duncan Sommerville** studied at St Andrews and then had a post as a lecturer there. He left to become Professor of Pure and Applied mathematics at Victoria College, Wellington New Zealand. He worked on non-Euclidean geometry and the History of Mathematics. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed pioneering methods for analyzing curved spacetime in general relativity.
2. Proposed a distinct, new approach to solve problems in cosmology.
3. Discovered solutions to geodesic equations and provided new insight into the structure of space-time.
4. Developed important mathematical tools to study relativistic stellar structure.
5. Made seminal contributions to the study of turbulence and the origins of the interstellar medium.
6. Demonstrated the stability of the Schwarzschild solution.
7. Developed the mathematical theory of radiative transfer in astrophysical plasmas.
8. Pioneered the study of condensation effects on the interstellar medium.
9. Developed a novel theoretical understanding of the nature of supermassive black holes.
10.Invented the Cauchy-characteristic-extraction technique for numerical calculations in curved spacetime.

Born 24 November 1879, Beawar, Rajasthan, India. Died 31 January 1934, Wellington, New Zealand.
