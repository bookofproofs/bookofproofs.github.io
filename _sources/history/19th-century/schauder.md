**Julius Schauder** was a Polish mathematician known for his work in functional analysis, partial differential equations and mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father, Samuel Schauder, was a lawyer and Julius attended secondary school in Lemberg (now Lviv, Ukraine).
* After the collapse of Austria, Schauder joined a new Polish army which was being organised in France.
* He returned to Poland with this army in 1919, by this time the country of Poland had been reestablished and it was to a Polish Lwów that Schauder went.
* Schauder married Emilia Löwenthal in 1929.
* They would have one daughter Eva Schauder.
* Schauder published fixed point theorems for Banach spaces in 1930.
* While Schauder was in Paris he collaborated with J Leray and their joint work led to a paper Topologie et équations fonctionelles Ⓣ(Topology and functional equations) published in the Annales scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure.
* In fact by the time Schauder received this prize his final publication (1937) had appeared in print.
* Schauder was treated well by the new Soviet administration.
* Schauder sent pleas for help to Hopf and Heisenberg saying he had many important results but no paper to write them on.
* Schauder's wife Emilia was hidden in Lwów by the Polish resistance for some time after her husbands death.
* Eva, Schauder's daughter, survived until the end of the war when she went to Italy to live with Schauder's brother who lived there.
* We should comment on the picture of Schauder.
* Schauder was there, as were Aleksandrov, Lefschetz, Borsuk, and some dozen other topologists.

Born 21 September 1899, Lemberg, Austrian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died September 1943, Lwow, Poland (now Ukraine).
