**Julius Schauder** was a Polish mathematician known for his work in functional analysis, partial differential equations and mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a modification of the fixed-point theorem, now known as Schauder's Fixed Point Theorem.
2. Wrote the 1961 monograph Topologische Linienrandintegrale and contributed to the foundational work on potential theory and variational problems.
3. Solved several problems in the area of partial differential equations, including the Navier-Stokes equation and the Burgers equation.
4. Founded the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, which included the field of theory of distributions.
5. Discovered a fixed-point theorem for topological vector spaces which was later called Schauder's Theorem.
6. Provided the definitive proof of Birkhoff's geminal theorem.
7. Was instrumental in the development of classical linear functional analysis.
8. Discovered Schauder estimates, which extend Lax-Milgram Lemma, and form the basis for many of the fundamental deductions in elliptic regularity theory.

Born 21 September 1899, Lemberg, Austrian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died September 1943, Lwow, Poland (now Ukraine).
