**Corrado Gini** was an Italian statistician, demographer and sociologist.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm for determining the Gini coefficient, a statistical measure of a country’s wealth distribution.
2. Conducted pioneering studies on the mathematical properties of the Gini coefficient, including mathematical proofs of the Gini coefficient's basic properties.
3. Introduced new algorithms that weighted standard deviation to calculate the Gini coefficient. 
4. Created a mathematical ordering of data points — the Gini ordering. 
5. Developed the Lorenz curve, a graphical representation of the extent of inequality in a population. 
6. Introduced a method for the analysis of samples of qualitative variables, now known as the Gini index method. 
7. Published a book titled Variability and Mutability (1912), which presented the theory of variability, a coefficient that measures fluctuations in average incomes.

Born 23 May1884, Motta di Livenza, near Treviso, Italy. Died 13 March 1965, Rome, Italy.
