**Julio Garavito** was a Colombian mathematician and astronomer who also contributed to political economy.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a mathematical system based on the Fibonacci sequence which allowed for the calculation of many different problems in algebra, geometry and trigonometry. 
2. He made notable contributions to the use of projective geometry. 
3. He was the first to propose a systematic method to teach mathematical evaluation. 
4. He suggested the use of prime numbers to form networks of linear equations in two and three dimensions. 
5. He demonstrated how to use group theory techniques to understand the field of linear algebra. 
6. He provided an important foundation for insights into what had previously been a vague and intangible area of mathematics. 
7. He wrote several texts relating to mathematics that are still studied today, including "The Theory of Equations and Its Applications" and "Essentials of Geometry".

Born 5 January 1865, Bogotá, Colombia. Died 11 March 1920, Bogotá, Colombia.
