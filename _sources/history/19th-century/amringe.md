**Howard Van Amringe** was an American educator and mathematician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* William Frederick Van Amringe was born on 22 May 1791, became a lawyer, published the massive book "An Investigation of the Theories of the Natural History of Man" in 1848 and "The nature and origin of heat and the forces of the universe" in 1869, and died on 16 March 1873.
* Van Amringe taught at Columbia while an undergraduate but not, as one might expect, in the Department of Mathematics but rather in the Department of Greek.
* Van Am, as he was known, spent his entire career at Columbia College.
* At the meeting on 5 December 1890, Van Amringe proposed that the Society should publish a Bulletin.
* He was also a member of the New York Historical Society and the American Society for the Advancement of Science.
* Among many honours given to Van Amringe let us mention in particular the bust of the Dean Van Amringe that the alumni of Columbia University donated in March 1913 to the Columbia University Club.
* What the Yale fence is to Yale, the ivy to Princeton, Van Am is to Columbia - a tangible, concrete expression of sentiment to which our members lovingly cling.
* The sight of Van Am raised my hat from my head.
* D'ye ken Van Am with his fine old way.

Born 3 April 1835, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 10 September 1915, Morristown, New Jersey, USA.
