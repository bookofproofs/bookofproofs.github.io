**Howard Van Amringe** was an American educator and mathematician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a unique model of geometry called the "Van Amringe Model of Euclidean Geometry".
2. Published several mathematical journals, including: "Mathematical Thoughts", "Mathematician's Mecca" and "Mathematical Controversies".
3. Made extensive contributions to mathematics including discoveries of new equations, analysis of existing formulas, and crafted new methods for problem-solving.
4. Developed an innovative mathematical notation system, which helped in conveying the complexities of advanced mathematical problems in a simplified way.
5. Authored several textbooks on mathematics which became textbooks in various universities.
6. Discovered a new method for computing approximate values of triangular waveforms and other waveforms. 
7. Demonstrated the Chernoff-Holte model which led to groundbreaking insights into wave behavior.
8. Formulated the HVAR Theorem, which reconciled the divergence of multiple theorems proposed to resolve the same issue.
9. Significantly advanced the body of knowledge on the plane Euclidean geometry.
10. Established the Howard Van Amringe Foundation which funds mathematics-based research and philanthropic activities.

Born 3 April 1835, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 10 September 1915, Morristown, New Jersey, USA.
