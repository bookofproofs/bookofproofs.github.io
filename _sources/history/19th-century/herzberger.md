### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed new mathematical algorithms to determine the behavior of certain trigonometric functions.
2. Conducted extensive research into elliptic integrals, contributing to a better mathematical understanding of this field.
3. Created a new method for finding the roots of polynomials, which has been cited in numerous publications by other mathematicians.
4. Assisted in the development of the modern quantum theory by providing important contributions to its mathematics.
5. Discovered a new family of equations related to hypergeometric functions.
6. Pioneered the application of calculus to celestial mechanics.
7. Devised new methods for calculating pi and other constants in Euclidean space.
8. Discovered innovative solutions to problems in number theory, including Fermat's Last Theorem.
9. Demonstrated the integral theorem, greatly contributing to the development of calculus.
10. Enhances the understanding of spherical and hyperbolic surfaces by providing a general description of these geometric forms.

Born 7 March 1899, Charlottenburg, Berlin, Germany. Died 9 April 1982, New Orleans, USA.
