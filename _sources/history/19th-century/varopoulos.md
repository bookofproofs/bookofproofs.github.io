**Theodoros Varopoulos** was a Greek mathematician known for his research in multivariable complex equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Varopoulos was born three days before the death of his father.
* There was no secondary school in Zervada, so his uncle transferred to a school in Lefkada in order that Varopoulos and his brother could continue their education.
* Varopoulos loved his uncle dearly, and adored him the same way he adored his mother.
* A letter, dated 2 August 1936, written by Varopoulos to Panagiotis Zervos, a professor at the University of Athens, gives us some further insight into his childhood.
* After finishing secondary school in Lefkada, Varopoulos, despite his financial difficulties, took the decision to continue his studies at Graduate School.
* The well-qualified and outstanding mathematician, Kyparissos Stephanos, inspired Varopoulos' love of mathematical "forms".
* Although as a researcher Varopoulos always worked analytically, the nature of his lecturing and his writing always distinguished itself with the same conscious love of intellectual quality.
* As a researcher, Varopoulos was greatly influenced by Remoundos.
* As a student of the University of Athens, Varopoulos, even though he also had to work to earn money during this time, managed to stand out among his fellow students.
* While he was a student of École Normale Supérieure and at the Sorbonne, Varopoulos was influenced by the ideas of Remoundos, his teacher in Athens, and began publishing papers in Comptes Rendus of the French Academy of Sciences of Paris.
* Varopoulos's paper Sur quelque théoréms de M Remoundos Ⓣ(On some theorems of M Remoundos) (1920) refines theorems, postulated by Remoundos in a series of lectures at the University of Athens in 1918-1919, about the theory of functions.
* This was one of four papers Varopoulos published in the Comptes Rendus of the French Academy of Sciences in 1920, the others being Sur les fonctions algébroïdes et les fonctions croissantes Ⓣ(On algebraic functions and increasing functions), Sur une classe de fonctions á un nombre infini de branches Ⓣ(On a class of functions with an infinite number of branches), and Sur les zéros et les intégrales d'une class d'équations différentielles Ⓣ(On zeros and integrals of a class of differential equations).
* Varopoulos continued to publish in various journals such as: (1) Comptes Rendus of the Académie des Sciences of Paris, (2) Bulletin de la Societé Mathématique de France, (3) Bulletin des Sciences Mathématiques, (4) Acta Mathematica, (5) Proceedings of the Athens Academy, (6) Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Strasbourg, 1920, and (7) Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Toronto, 1924.
* Varopoulos married Aliki Stini on 21 September1939.
* Aliki was a graduate of Natural Sciences, and they had one child, a son Nicholas Theodore Varopoulos.
* He is Varopoulos's only child.
* We give more details near the end of this article about Nicholas Varopoulos.
* Theodoros Varopoulos had a passion for mathematics which he cultivated, and in which he saw harmony and beauty.
* Varopoulos even taught students who so excelled in mathematics that they have brought honour to Greece in the global mathematical community.
* Nicolas Baganas, professor at the University of Bordeaux and Nikos Artemiadis, Professor at the American University, were students of Varopoulos, whom he led in the direction of the research work undertaken by himself and by Remoundos.
* These two Greek mathematical researchers, and many others that Varopoulos directed towards mathematics, the science of harmony and symmetry, proves that, irrespective of any whims, Varopoulos inspired and aided worthy young mathematicians to go down the path of true research.
* The corresponding work for the complex roots of equations with complex coefficients appears in work by G Remoundos and was continued by his student Spyridon Sarantopoulos, but wis mainly developed by Varopoulos and Paul Montel.
* Topics that required little knowledge, but a lot of intuition and imagination were best suited to Varopoulos.
* Often, Varopoulos would recommended his PhD students to complete their work with Panagiotis Zervos, a professor at the University of Athens, with whom he worked closely.
* Varopoulos published several articles in the mathematical journals of France and Sweden.
* Theodoros Varopoulos was a member of the Editorial Committee of the journal "Bulletin de Sciences Mathématiques" from September 1927 to October 1928.
* Varopoulos was also a close associate of the journal Euclid of the Hellenic Mathematical Society, when the editorial responsibility was held by the president of the Society, Aristides Pallas, with whom he was a close friend.
* Varopoulos died from stomach cancer at the age of 63.

Born 30 January 1894, Astakos, Aetolia-Acarnania, Greece. Died 14 June 1957, Thessaloniki, Greece.
