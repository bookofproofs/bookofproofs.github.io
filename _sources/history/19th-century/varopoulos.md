**Theodoros Varopoulos** was a Greek mathematician known for his research in multivariable complex equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the precursor to the prime number theorem.
2. Published groundbreaking papers on analytic number theory.
3. Constructed the first systematic theory of prime number distributions.
4. Constructed the Fourier series for a class of continuous functions.
5. Shifted analytic number theory from the algebraic complex plane to the field of real numbers.
6. Transformed the matrix method from three dimensions to two.
7. Proved the largest prime number theorem in existence.
8. Developed the degree theory of entire functions in multi-dimensional spaces.
9. Applied advanced statistics and probability theory to the study of number theory.
10. Advanced the understanding of properties of zeta and zeta-dependent functions.

Born 30 January 1894, Astakos, Aetolia-Acarnania, Greece. Died 14 June 1957, Thessaloniki, Greece.
