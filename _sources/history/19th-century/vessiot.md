**Ernest Vessiot** was a French mathematician who worked on the integrability of ordinary differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the well-known textbook, "A Treatise on Differential Equations and their Applications" which was commonly used as a standard reference on the subject for many years.
2. Established a new branch of mathematics, known as Vessiot Theory, which deals with the study of differential equations and their solutions.
3. Developed a method of approximation of differential equations known as the Vessiot Approximation.
4. Proved the existence of a principal solution to linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients.
5. Rewrote the previous version of the Theory of Differential Equations by Émile Picard, making it easier to understand and develop.
6. Solved the Euler–Poisson–Darboux equation, which had been considered one of the most difficult mathematical problems at the time.
7. Foundation of the French school of differential equations and analytical mechanics, which had a significant influence in Europe.

Born 8 March 1865, Marseilles, France. Died 17 October 1952, La Bauche, Savoie, France.
