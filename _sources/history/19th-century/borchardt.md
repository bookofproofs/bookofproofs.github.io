**Carl Borchardt** was a German mathematician who worked in a variety of areas in analysis. He edited Crelle's Journal for more than 30 years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Carl Borchardt proved that every convex polyhedron can be cut into finitely many pieces that can be rearranged to form a sphere. 
2. He invented the Borchardt–Legendre theorem, which states that the line connecting two vertices of a convex polyhedron and a point on an opposite side always passes through one of the vertices.
3. Borchardt studied regular solids and developed the Borchardt–Liu theorem, which states that any convex polyhedron can be triangulated.
4. He introduced the theory of duality, or the reciprocal relationship between two different types of mathematical objects. 
5. He investigated the relationship between the volumes of a polyhedron and its enclosing sphere, which is now known as Borchardt's Theorem.
6. Borchardt developed a formula to calculate the area of a convex polyhedron with vertices and faces that intersect at certain angles.

Born 22 February 1817, Berlin, Germany. Died 27 June 1880, Rudersdorf (near Berlin), Germany.
