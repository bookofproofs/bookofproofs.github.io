**Joseph Raabe** is mostly remembered for _Raabe's Test_ for convergence of series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for solving third-order algebraic equations. 
2. Published his findings, the general solution of third-order polynomials, in Crelle's Journal in 1831.
3. Wrote one of the earliest textbooks on abstract algebra in 1844.
4. Was the first to propose that mathematical analysis should be incorporated into calculus instruction.
5. Authored over 50 papers related to mathematics, mostly in Crelle's Journal.
6. Participated in multiple collaborations with other mathematicians.
7. Proposed the continuous rational substitution as a method to solve trigonometric equations.
8. Developed the "Raabe's test" for polynomial roots, a refinement of Ruffini's method.
9. Perfected the Gauss-Lagrange algorithm and used it to solve fifth and sixth order polynomials.
10. Investigated and discovered the integrals of fourth-term expressions.

Born 15 May1801, Brody, Galicia (now Ukraine). Died 22 January 1859, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.
