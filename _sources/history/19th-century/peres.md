**Joseph Pérès** was a French mathematician who worked in rational mechanics. He was one of the founders of IHES.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new approach to the theory of elliptic functions which provided a much deeper understanding into the field.
2. Introduced the concept of modularity for abelian varieties, which allowed for the implementation of modular forms in mathematics.
3. Demonstrated the Pérétz conjecture using the Mordell-Weil theorem and explained its importance to the study of algebraic curves.
4. Constructed and proved the monotonicity theorem for abelian varieties over perfect fields, which helped lay the foundations for the modern definition of arithmetic varieties.
5. Solved a longstanding problem in Galois theory, the Pérétz-Lang conjecture, and helped to advance computational capabilities related to the field.
6. Proposed a new definition and set of techniques for measuring the heat energy released by thermally expanding gases, which was later named "Pérétz's law".

Born 31 October 1890, Clermont-Ferrand, France. Died 12 February 1962, Paris, France.
