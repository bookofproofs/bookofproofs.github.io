**Ivan Privalov**  was a Russian mathematician who worked on analytic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered a method for solving polynomial equations referred to as "Privalov's Formula"
2. Pioneered research in the areas of analysis, mathematical physics, and differential equations
3. Published an important early textbook on analysis and differential equations
4. Developed original techniques for solving partial differential equations
5. Contributed a concept of isostatic partial differential equations, now known as Privalov's theorem
6. Discovered a general solution to the classical (Cauchy) problem of equations of the form x^2 + y^2 = 0
7. Developed an original approach to the theory of integrals and functions of several variables
8. Published a series of fundamental works on the subject of analytic geometry
9. Established a new method of computing the probability of a set of events

Born 13 February 1891, Nizhny Lomov, Penza guberniya (now oblast), Russia. Died 13 July 1941, Moscow, USSR.
