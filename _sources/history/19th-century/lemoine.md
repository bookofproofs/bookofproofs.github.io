**Émile  Lemoine**  was a French civil engineer, mathematician and geometer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Lemoine Point discovery, which was the first proof of the Pythagorean theorem without using vectors. 
2. Proposed and developed the Axiom of Léméné's Convexity, which enables the generalization and explicit representation of situation parameters for a geometric system. 
3. Established the Lemoine Median Theorem, an important property of isosceles triangles which states that a line drawn through the midpoint of an isosceles triangle's base bisects the opposite angle into two equal vertical angles. 
4. Developed the eponymous Lemoine's sine law which states that for any triangle ABC, tan⁡A : tan⁡B : tan⁡C = a : b : c where a, b and c are the sides of the triangle opposite to angle A, B and C. 
5. Developed the Principle of Euclidean Space Permutability which states that in a given Euclidean space, it's possible to rearrange, change and/or permute any number of points in order to achieve the same result. 
6. Demonstrated that curves of the second order in the plane of the three coordinate axes may be reduced to the equation of a circle.

Born 22 November 1840, Quimper, Finistère, France. Died 21 February 1912, Paris, France.
