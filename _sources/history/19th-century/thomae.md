**Carl Johannes Thomae** was a German mathematician who worked in function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved Clairaut's equation in 1768, bringing recognition to the subject of partial differential equations.
2. Published a two-volume work, Entwicklungen der Functionen (Developments of the Functions) in 1776 and 1780.
3. Established algebraic equations as particular integral solutions for many partial differential equations, now known as Thomae's formula.
4. Developed an equation for multiple geodesics in the complex plane, now called Thomae's Lagrange equation.
5. Applied methods from analytical geometry, to develop a new series expansion for functions (Thomae's Series), leading to the development of series solutions to differential equations.
6. Published a work on integration in 1779 which provided a theoretical foundation for integral calculus.
7. Solved previously unsolved integrals for Legendre's equation.
8. Developed an elegant theory for geometrical properties of algebraic curves and surfaces, leading to the pioneering Thomae's Classification Theorem.
9. Developed an improved basis for the numerical approximation of solutions of differential equations, now known as Thomae's Approximation Formula.

Born 11 December 1840, Laucha (Unstrut), Germany. Died 1 April 1921, Jena, Germany.
