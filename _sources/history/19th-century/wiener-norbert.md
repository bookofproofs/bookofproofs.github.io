**Norbert Wiener** was an American mathematician who did important work on probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical theory of cybernetics, which studies the structure, behavior and communication of complex systems such as biological and mechanical systems.
2. Provided the foundation for the modern science of robotics.
3. Helped contribute to the development of game theory.
4. Showed how different branches of mathematics such as geometry, algebra, and analysis, could be used to describe physical systems.
5. Made major contributions to the study of communications, control, and automation.
6. Demonstrated how to measure and describe the dynamic behavior of machines and servomechanisms.
7. Appointed the first professor of Cybernetics at MIT. 
8. Co-created the Wiener-Khinchin Theorem, which provides the mathematical foundation for the analysis of stationary random processes.
9. Founded the journal Kybernetes, which publishes analytical studies related to the systems of control and communications.

Born 26 November 1894, Columbia, Missouri, USA. Died 18 March 1964, Stockholm, Sweden.
