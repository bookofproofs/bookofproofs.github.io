** Erwin Schrödinger** made important contributions to the development of Quantum Mechanics and received a Nobel prize in 1933.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-developed the Schrödinger equation, which lays the foundation for wave mechanics, providing a mathematical framework for understanding atoms and molecules.
2. Formulated the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, allowing solutions to the Schrödinger equation to be obtained in more general settings.
3. Coined the term Entanglement to explain the non-local phenomenon of pairs of particles exhibiting correlated behaviors.
4. Developed the variational method, a mathematical model for solving certain classes of problems in quantum mechanics.
5. Was the first to formulate the theoretical framework for Maxwell's equation in a relativistic form.
6. Authored the book Statistical Thermodynamics, which laid the mathematical foundation for understanding chemical thermodynamics and the behavior of gases.
7. Received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 for his wave equation and its application to quantum mechanics.

Born 12 August 1887, Erdberg, Vienna, Austria. Died 4 January 1961, Vienna, Austria.
