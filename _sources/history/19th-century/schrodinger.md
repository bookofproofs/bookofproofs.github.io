** Erwin Schrödinger** made important contributions to the development of Quantum Mechanics and received a Nobel prize in 1933.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Schrödinger learnt English and German almost at the same time due to the fact that both were spoken in the household.
* Schrödinger graduated from the Akademisches Gymnasium in 1906 and, in that year, entered the University of Vienna.
* It was Fritz Hasenöhrl's lectures on theoretical physics which had the greatest influence on Schrödinger.
* On 20 May 1910, Schrödinger was awarded his doctorate for the dissertation On the conduction of electricity on the surface of insulators in moist air.
* In 1914 Schrödinger's first important paper was published developing ideas of Boltzmann.
* After being sent back to the Italian front, Schrödinger received a citation for outstanding service commanding a battery during a battle.
* In the spring of 1917 Schrödinger was sent back to Vienna and assigned to teach a course in meteorology.
* Schrödinger had worked at Vienna on radioactivity, proving the statistical nature of radioactive decay.
* They had become engaged in 1919 and Anny had come to work as a secretary in Vienna on a monthly salary which was more than Schrödinger's annual income.
* Schrödinger accepted instead an assistantship in Jena and this allowed him to marry Anny on 24 March 1920.
* During these years of changing from one place to another, Schrödinger studied physiological optics, in particular he continued his work on the theory of colour vision.
* Weyl was Schrödinger's closest colleague in his first years in Zürich and he was to provide the deep mathematical knowledge which would prove so helpful to Schrödinger in his work.
* The intellectual atmosphere in Zürich suited Schrödinger and Zürich was to be the place where he made his most important contributions.
* One week later Schrödinger gave a seminar on de Broglie's work and a member of the audience, a student of Sommerfeld's, suggested that there should be a wave equation.
* Within a few weeks Schrödinger had found his wave equation.
* Schrödinger published his revolutionary work relating to wave mechanics and the general theory of relativity in a series of six papers in 1926.
* Wave mechanics, as proposed by Schrödinger in these papers, was the second formulation of quantum theory, the first being matrix mechanics due to Heisenberg.
* as Schrödinger's monument and a worthy one.
* Schrödinger accepted an invitation to lecture at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, leaving in December 1926 to give his lectures in January and February 1927.
* Sommerfeld was ranked in first place, followed by Schrödinger, with Born as the third choice.
* When Sommerfeld decided not to leave Munich, the offer was made to Schrödinger.
* Although he was a Catholic, Schrödinger decided in 1933 that he could not live in a country in which persecution of Jews had become a national policy.
* He spoke to Schrödinger about posts for one of his assistants and was surprised to discover that Schrödinger himself was interested in leaving Germany.
* Schrödinger asked for a colleague, Arthur March, to be offered a post as his assistant.
* To understand Schrödinger's request for March we must digress a little and comment on Schrödinger's liking for women.
* Anny had her own lover for many years, Schrödinger's friend Weyl.
* Schrödinger had been elected a fellow of Magdalen College.
* Soon after they arrived in Oxford, Schrödinger heard that, for his work on wave mechanics, he had been awarded the Nobel prize.
* In the spring of 1934 Schrödinger was invited to lecture at Princeton and while there he was made an offer of a permanent position.
* In 1935 Schrödinger published a three-part essay on The present situation in quantum mechanics in which his famous Schrödinger's cat paradox appears.
* In 1936 Schrödinger was offered the chair of physics at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.
* However the advancing Nazi threat caught up with Schrödinger again in Austria.
* From Rome, Schrödinger went back to Oxford, and there he received an offer of a one year visiting professorship at the University of Gent.
* After his time in Gent, Schrödinger went to Dublin in the autumn of 1939.
* During his last few years Schrödinger remained interested in mathematical physics and continued to work on general relativity, unified field theory and meson physics.

* Schrödinger's request for March to be his assistant was because, at that time, he was in love with Arthur March's wife Hilde.
* Here Hilde became pregnant with Schrödinger's child.
