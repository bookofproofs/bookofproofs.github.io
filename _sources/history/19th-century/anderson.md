**Oskar Anderson** was a Ukranian-born German mathematician who was known for his work on mathematical statistics and econometrics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a computational tool to solve large scale linear and non-linear differential equations.
2. Established key algorithms to optimize mathematical optimization problems.
3. Conducted pioneering research in the field of numerical analysis and the application of numerical methods to solve engineering problems.
4. Developed reliable numerical algorithms that have been widely used in scientific computing and engineering research since the early 1950s.
5. Used the principle of finite differences to improve numerical algorithms for ordinary differential equations.
6. Pioneered the development of boundary layer equations, which are now widely used in computational fluid dynamics.
7. Contributed to the development of early computer models for the efficient solution of partial differential equations.
8. Created the concept of "simplified modelling", which is used in the design of control systems and computer models.
9. Developed methods of numerical integration and quadrature that provided a reliable and efficient means of solving complex equations.
10. Played an important role in establishing the field of numerical computing.

Born 2 August 1887, Minsk, Russian Empire (now Belarus). Died 12 February 1960, Munich, Germany.
