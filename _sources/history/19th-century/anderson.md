**Oskar Anderson** was a Ukranian-born German mathematician who was known for his work on mathematical statistics and econometrics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His name appears both as Oskar Nikolaevich Anderson and Oskar Johann Viktor Anderson.
* His father Nikolas Anderson was professor of Finno-Ugric languages at the University of Kazan.
* Oskar attended Kazan Gymnasium (the same school Lobachevsky attended a century before) and graduated with the gold medal in 1906.
* Anderson spent one year studying mathematics at the University of Kazan before going to St Petersburg where he studied economics at the Polytechnic Institute.
* As well as teaching at this school, Anderson graduated with a law degree.
* In 1917 Anderson left St Petersburg and moved to Kiev.
* Slutsky was teaching in the Kiev Institute of Commerce when Anderson arrived and they would remain colleagues for three years.
* Events in 1920 were to have a profound influence on Anderson's life.
* Lenin approached Anderson and offered him a high position in the economic running of Russia.
* Anderson, like many Russians at this time, had political views which were leftist.
* Indeed this turbulence was to have a dramatic effect on Anderson's life.
* But we have got ahead of the events that we were describing, so returning to the period after Anderson left Russia, he went to Budapest and in 1921 he became a school teacher there.
* In 1933 Anderson was awarded a Rockefeller Scholarship which enabled him to travel to England and Germany.
* In this book Anderson tried to present the latest statistical methods assuming only that his readers had covered school level mathematics.
* Returning to Bulgaria in 1935 Anderson was appointed professor at the University of Sofia.
* Anderson belongs to the so-called 'continental' school of statistics, and worked in the tradition of Lexis and Bortkiewicz.
* Sensibly estimating the difficulties inherent in economics as a science, Anderson was opposed to the use of "refined" statistical methods and to accepting preconditions regarding laws of distribution.

Born 2 August 1887, Minsk, Russian Empire (now Belarus). Died 12 February 1960, Munich, Germany.
