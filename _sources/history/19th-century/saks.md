**Stanisław Saks** was a Polish mathematician who worked in topology, set theory and functional analysis. He was one of the frequenters of the _Scottish Café_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the co-founder of the modern theory of Banach Spaces, introducing the concepts of basis, norm, and completeness which are key components in Functional Analysis.
2. He developed the Saks-Szlenk theorem, offering an alternate approach to the Kuratowski-Ryll Nardzewski theorem.
3. He contributed to the study of sets of real numbers, the Saks spaces, which are named after him.
4. He developed the Hahn-Banach theorem which gives necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of extensions of linear functionals.
5. He wrote seminal books on probability and statistical physics.

Born 30 December 1897, Kalisz, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 23 November 1942, Warsaw, Poland.
