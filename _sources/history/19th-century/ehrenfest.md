**Paul Ehrenfest** was an Austrian mathematician who made important contributions to statistical mechanics and  quantum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He wrote the first paper of the modern theory of phase transitions, the so-called Ehrenfest classification.
2. He developed the theory of irreversibility in gases by introducing the concept of entropy.
3. He developed the statistical mechanical approach to thermodynamic phenomena.
4. He proposed a correlation between the kinetic energy of a particle and the entropic behavior of that particle.
5. He proposed a mathematical explanation to the third law of thermodynamics.
6. He developed the stationary phase method of stability analysis, which was later rediscovered in the context of quantum mechanics.
7. He developed the notion of adiabatic invariants in thermodynamics.
8. He made early contributions to linear response theory, which was later developed by other physicists.
9. He also made contributions to the theory of quasiparticles and developed the Ehrenfest Correction, a mathematical principle which serves to improve classical mechanics.

Born 18 January 1880, Vienna, Austria. Died 25 September 1933, Leiden, Netherlands.
