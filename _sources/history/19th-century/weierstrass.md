**Karl Weierstrass** is best known for his construction of the theory of complex functions by means of power series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the modern definition and foundations of the calculus of variations. 
2. Established the theory of Fourier series and modern analysis on an axiomatic basis. 
3. Defined the notion of limit of a sequence in mathematical analysis. 
4. Developed the modern definition of a function of a real variable. 
5. Introduced the ϵ-δ definition of continuity into analysis. 
6. Developed important concepts in the field of analytic number theory. 
7. Developed three new arithmetic means and studied their traceability. 
8. Introduced the first rigorous treatment of elliptic functions.

Born 31 October 1815, Ostenfelde, Westphalia (now Germany). Died 19 February 1897, Berlin, Germany.
