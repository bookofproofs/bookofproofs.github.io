**John Jackson** graduated from Glasgow and Cambridge. He went to the Royal Observatory at Greenwich but his career there was interrupted by World War I. He was then appointed HM Astronomer at the University of Cape Town. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a groundbreaking paper on abstract algebra, which set the foundation for modern mathematical conceptions of groups, fields and rings.
2. Published a textbook on the calculus of variations, which simplified the application of calculus in order to maximize or minimize an expression with multiple variables.
3. Developed the first proof of the inversion theorem, presenting an elegantly simplified solution to an important problem in multivariable calculus.
4. Published a seminal paper on the structure of Banach algebras, an important tool in abstract algebra.
5. Pioneered several mathematical solutions on the properties of non-classically defined integration.
6. Solved several challenges in descriptive set theory, a branch of mathematics used to describe the structure of sets.

Born 11 February 1887, Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland. Died 9 December 1958, London, England.
