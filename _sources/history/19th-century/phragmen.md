**Edvard Phragmén** was a Swedish mathematician who worked on the theory of functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a number of important contributions to mathematics, including the “Phragmén-Lindelöf Principle” for the Dirichlet problem.
2. Established Phragmén-Meijer Theorem which expanded upon least squares minimization theory.
3. Authored several seminal works in number theory, including “On a theorem in elementary number theory,” “On the pure theory of Dirichlet’s series,” and “On the solution of certain finite equations with real coefficients.”
4. Contributed to the development of the modern constructions of prime numbers and the theory of Bernoulli numbers. 
5. Pioneered the concept of using "race games" in the study of social choice theory.
6. Developed the “Phragmén-Brouwer Theorem” that has had applications in many fields including economics, psychology and computer science.

Born 2 September 1863, Örebro, Sweden. Died 14 March 1937, Stockholm, Sweden.
