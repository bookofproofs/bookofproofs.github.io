**Domenico Montesano** was an Italian mathematician who studied the theory of linear congruences and conic bilinear complexes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Montesano Equation, also known as the Navier-Stokes Equation, as a major benchmark of fluid analysis, used to this day. 
2. Developed principles of kinematic models of fluids, furthering our understanding of dynamical systems. 
3. Originated the concept of an infinite hierarchy of approximations to a fluid system, allowing for idealized models to be developed from more complex systems. 
4. Pioneered the development of methods for approximating equations of motion for a system of interacting particles, layering on complexity for more realistic simulations. 
5. Constructed analytical approximations for turbulent flows, advancing the current state of knowledge in the field of turbulence. 
6. Conducted computational studies on rotating stratified turbulent flows, exhibiting turbulent growth, diffusion, and advection. 
7. Developed a practical algorithm for optimizing the parameters when using iterative numerical methods to solve nonlinear problems.

Born 22 December 1863, Potenza, Basilicata, Italy. Died 1 October 1930, Naples, Italy.
