**Karl Peterson** was a Latvian mathematician worked in differential geometry and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed two equations for determining the speed of a wave–‘Love's Equations’–with the help of which seismic waves can be studied.
2. Developed the concept of virtual displacement using the ‘Peterson's Approach’ to link wave equations and the principle of least action.
3.Developed the concept of transmission eigenvalue analysis which is a faster and more reliable solution for accurately predicting the behavior of waveforms within a porous or fractured medium.
4. Published several scientific papers pertaining to the application of mathematics to seismic wave analysis.
5. Developed robust numerical models of wave propagation which enabled the mapping of geological deformations and the computation of seismic hazard maps. 
6. Made a key contribution to the creation of the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act which established ground rules for the safe construction of buildings in seismic areas. 
7. Demonstrated the application of mathematics to problems in oceanography, engineering and seismology.

Born 25 May 1828, Riga, Russia (now Latvia). Died 19 April 1881, Moscow, Russia.
