**Grace Chisholm Young** was an English mathematician who together with her husband William Young  wrote many mathematical articles and several books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Grace Chisholm developed a new proof of the algebraic Riccati equation (1903).
2. She wrote a paper on using complex numbers in linear equations (1904).
3. She was the first woman to become a Fellow of the Royal Society (1905).
4. She developed a method for solving third-order equations algebraically (1908).
5. She published a paper on subgroups of finite Abelian groups (1910).
6. She conducted research into the solutions of linear differential equations (1917).
7. She wrote a paper on functions of real variables that could be used to improve the accuracy of calculations (1917).
8. She developed new ways of finding solutions to the cubic equations (1924).
9. She published papers on group theory and the theory of invariants (1926).
