### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Henry Chisholm had an important position in the government of the country being chief clerk to the exchequer.
* The place to go to undertake research in mathematics at that time was Göttingen, which had just set up a course for women, and that is where Grace Chisholm decided to continue her studies.
* Together William Young and Grace wrote 220 mathematical articles and several books.
* It is almost impossible to tell exactly how much of the work in these papers was due to Grace Young.
* We mentioned above that Grace had wanted to study medicine when she was young but her parents had been against this.
* However Grace did study medicine, both in Göttingen and in Geneva but she never took any formal examinations to qualify in the subject.
