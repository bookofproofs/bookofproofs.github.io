**Grace Chisholm Young** was an English mathematician who together with her husband William Young  wrote many mathematical articles and several books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Grace was the youngest of her parents' four children with her mother being 44 and her father 59 years old when she was born.
* Henry Chisholm had an important position in the government of the country being chief clerk to the exchequer.
* Grace had an older brother Hugh Chisholm, born two years earlier, who was also highly talented and went on to achieve fame as the editor of both the eleventh and twelfth editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
* Grace was only six years old when her father retired at the age of 65 and at this time the family moved to Haslemere in Surrey.
* Following her family's wishes, Grace become involved in social work among poor people in London.
* The place to go to undertake research in mathematics at that time was Göttingen, which had just set up a course for women, and that is where Grace Chisholm decided to continue her studies.
* By this time Chisholm's parents were elderly, her father being 86 years old, so she returned from Germany to England to help look after them.
* William Young was not a mathematical researcher, but Grace of course was trained in research at Göttingen, so she encouraged her husband to begin his research career.
* In fact William and Grace put considerable effort into teaching their children and several children's books resulted from this.
* Two further children's books authored by Grace, written to introduce children to science, were Bimbo (1906), and Bimbo and the Frogs (1907).
* Together William Young and Grace wrote 220 mathematical articles and several books.
* It is almost impossible to tell exactly how much of the work in these papers was due to Grace Young.
* We mentioned above that Grace had wanted to study medicine when she was young but her parents had been against this.
* However Grace did study medicine, both in Göttingen and in Geneva but she never took any formal examinations to qualify in the subject.
* The family were devastated by this tragedy and Grace's health began slowly to decline.
* Grace Young outlived her husband by two years, dying at the home of her daughter Janet in Park Road, Croydon.

Born 15 March 1868, Haslemere (near London), England. Died 29 March 1944, Croydon, Surrey, England.
