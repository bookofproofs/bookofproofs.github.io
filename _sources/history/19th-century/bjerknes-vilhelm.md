**Vilhelm  Bjerknes**  was a Norwegian physicist and meteorologist important in the development of weather forecasting.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Norwegian Cyclonic Model, a mathematically based theory of weather prediction.
2. Developed the Riehl equations, which describe the motion of air in the atmosphere.
3. Demonstrated the concepts of rotation and conservation of energy in nature, providing the foundation for modern meteorology.
4. Developed an equation that mathematically describes the advection process of air flow in the atmosphere.
5. Founded the Bergen School of Meteorology, introducing practical mathematics to the field of weather forecasting.
6. Refined the atmospheric pressure equations of his father, Carl Bjerknes, to incorporate the effects of rotation and advection.
7. Developed a theory of the formation of tornados and storms based on mathematical equations and thermodynamic concepts.
8. Predicted the exact time and place of a severe weather event in 1919.

Born 14 March 1862, Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. Died 9 April 1951, Oslo, Norway.
