**János Bolyai** was a pioneer of non-Euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a paper in 1831 entitled “Appendix Scientiam Spatii Absolute Veram Exhibens”  which contained the first rigorous description of hyperbolic geometry.
2. Suggested the Axiom of Parallels in which he stated that through a given point there can only be one line parallel to a given line.
3. Created a consistent system of non-Euclidean geometry, the absolute science of space. 
4. Significantly expanded the concept of Euclidean geometry, introducing new principles and axioms. 
5. Established Cartesian coordinates that fully describe the position of points and lines relative to one another. 
6. Was the first to differentiate between two types of length measurements: spherical and plane.
7. Developed the theory of curvature, a concept which is used in geodesy, fluid mechanics, and relativity.
8. Introduced major advances in infinite series and approximations, which helped propel the development of calculus. 
9. Developed the concept of local isometry, the preservation of distance when mapping one surface to another. 
10. Dedicated his monograph to the work of his father, Farkas Bolyai, who inspired him to pursue mathematics and had worked on parallel postulates himself.

Born 15 December 1802, Kolozsvár, Hungary (now Cluj, Romania). Died 27 January 1860, Marosvásárhely, Hungary (now Târgu-Mureş, Romania).
