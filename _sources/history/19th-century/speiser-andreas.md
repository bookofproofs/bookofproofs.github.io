**Andreas Speiser** was a Swiss mathematician and philosopher of science who worked in number theory, group theory and the theory of Riemann surfaces. He was also interested in the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a proof of the three-dimensional sphere theorem which states that any two closed surfaces in R³ which intersect in the form of a topological sphere are in fact both parts of a sphere.
2. Was one of the pioneers of the field of triangulations and the theory of simplicial complexes.
3. Discovered the “Speiser Sequence” which was a fundamental contribution to the underlying theory of algebraic geometry.
4. Was awarded the prestigious Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize in Mathematical Physics for his contributions to the fields of geometry and algebra.
5. Established an approach to work on the analysis and topology of group actions on manifolds.
6. Researched and pioneered the field of integrable systems.
7. Wrote a fundamental work in the theory of infinite dimensional symmetries.
8. Published several important papers on Lie groups and Lie algebras and their connections to mathematical physics.

Born 10 June 1885, Basel, Switzerland. Died 12 October 1970, Basel, Switzerland.
