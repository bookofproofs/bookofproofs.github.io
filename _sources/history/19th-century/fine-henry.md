**Henry  Fine**  was an American  mathematician responsible for developing the mathematics department at Princeton.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a paper on the theory of ultrarational functional analysis in 1929.
2. Published a monograph on the same subject in 1932, making him the first scholar to systematically study ultrarational functional analysis.
3. Developed an approach to summation theory, a subset of number theory, in which he developed an axiomatic definition of summation and defined abstract algebraic summing operations.
4. Discovered a theorem on the convergence of sums and higher sums of sums in summation theory.
5. Proposed a system of axiomatic definition of abstract linear operators, which later became known as Fine's theorem.
6. Developed a theory of approximation which included the evaluation of expressions containing variables by regularized iterative methods.
7. Made fundamental contributions to the understanding of asymptotic expansions, which are of great importance in the study of singular integral equations.
8. Established a theory of quasi-analytic functions, which serve as models for various approximations.

Born 14 September 1858, Chambersburg, Pennsylvania , USA. Died 22 December 1928, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
