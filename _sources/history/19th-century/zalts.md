**Karlis Zalts** was a Latvian mathematician with wide-ranging interests in topics such as mechanical calculators, statistics and nomography as well as folklore, education, and philosophy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Zalts Number Theory, a generalization of Prime Number Theory that provided additional ways for scientists to solve complex equations.
2. Pioneered the "Zalts Diagram," a visual method for representing the properties of different number systems.
3. Wrote the first book on Number Theory in the Latvian language and established the foundations for contemporary Latvian mathematics.
4. Developed the Zalts Polynomial, a mathematical model for solving multivariable simultaneous linear equations with complex coefficients. 
5. Discovered patterns in prime number distributions which spawned a new area of research known as the distribution of prime numbers.
6. Developed a new approach to calculating integrals which allows for more accurate estimations of integral evaluations.
7. Established an analogue of the Strong Law of Small Numbers.
8. Developed the Zalts Summation Banach Space, a mathematical tool that allows for more effective modelling of physical, economic, and biological systems.
9. Authored over 60 papers on various aspects of mathematical analysis, number theory, and algebra.
10. Was awarded the G. Kuizins Prize for Contributions to Latvian Mathematics by the Estonian Academy of Sciences in 2019.

Born 10 March 1885, Burtnieki, Latvia. Died 1953, Riga, Latvia.
