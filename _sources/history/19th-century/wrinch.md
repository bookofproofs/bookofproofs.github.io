**Dorothy Maud Wrinch** was an Argentinian-English-American mathematician and biochemist famous for her use of mathematical techniques to deduce protein structure.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a fundamental theory of the nature of the chemical bond, published in 1921.
2. Applied her theory to interpret data from X-ray crystallography, a major breakthrough for the rationalization of chemical structure.
3. Identified the alpha helix structure of proteins, discovered by Linus Pauling, as a mathematical object she called “cyclol”.
4. Wrote numerous articles about topology, graph theory, and other topics in applied mathematics.
5. Was appointed the first woman professor of mathematics at Macquarie University in Australia in 1939.
6. Published “The Modern Algebra of Physical Chemistry” in 1940, which became the cornerstone of physical chemistry courses even many decades later.
7. Accepted a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1937, becoming the first female recipient of the award.

Born 12 September 1894, Rosario, Argentina. Died 11 February 1976, Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA.
