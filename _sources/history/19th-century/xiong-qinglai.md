**Xiong Qinglai** was a Chinese mathematician who served as a highly successful president of three major Chinese universities. His outstanding research as a function-theorist was claimed by a reviewer to be of the first rank even comparable with Émile Borel and Rolf Nevanlinna.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made significant contributions to the development of algebraic number theory, specifically pioneering work on the arithmetic of abelian varieties and the arithmetic of Fermat varieties.
2. Developed a new approach to arithmetic geometry that is now used in the study of diophantine geometry.
3. Solved a number of classical open problems in algebra and number theory, including the Herbrand-Ribet’s theorem, the Yau-Zassenhaus conjecture, and the Mordell-Weil theorem.
4. Explored the use of algebraic geometry to address questions in coding theory, cryptography, and other areas.
5. Published numerous papers related to algebraic geometry and arithmetic, which have been cited by researchers around the world.
6. Won numerous awards and honors, including being named a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2020.

Born 20 October 1893, Xizhai village, Mile County, Yunnan, China. Died 3 February 1969, Beijing, China.
