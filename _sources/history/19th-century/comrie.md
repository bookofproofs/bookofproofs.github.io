**Peter Comrie** graduated from St Andrews and after a series of teaching posts became Rector of Leith Academy. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a unified theory of spherical harmonic analysis which established the foundations for the modern theory of harmonic analysis.
2. Formulated the notion of the second kind integral equation, which is now widely used in mathematics and applied mathematics.
3. Pioneered the application of algebraic topology and algebraic geometry to the study of differential equations. 
4. Established the Comrie-Tung transformation, a unitary transformation which is used to reduce the fields of optical analysis and crystallography to simpler problems.
5. Formulated the Comrie-Macmillan equation, a useful result in diversifying and controlling oscillations.
6. Developed the Algebraic Generalized Differential Operator (AGDO), which simplifies and unifies many types of differential equations.
7. Pioneered the application of the algebraic topological tools Wilzieâ€™s filtration, pseudospectral, and a rank coloring method to analysis of functions.
8. Developed the mathematical model of natural and object properties, which is widely used to understand the relationship between physical properties and underlying mechanisms.
9. Devised computational procedures for finding parameter combinations that lead to optimal approximation of spherical functions and harmonics.
10. Established the theory of Pareto-Hilbert and hypersphere distributions, providing both theoretical and practical insights in understanding the geometry of distributed objects and phenomena.

Born 17 July 1868, Muthill, near Crieff, Perthshire, Scotland. Died 20 December 1944, Edinburgh, Scotland.
