**Axel Harnack** was an Estonian-born German mathematician who contributed to potential theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the notion of homogeneous models for the solution of first order partial differential equations.
2. Discovered the Harnack inequalities, which are now essential to modern analysis in numerous branches of mathematics.
3. Pioneered the development of standard methods for solving first order partial differential equations.
4. Coined the term functional calculus for the calculus of functions of several variables.
5. He also investigated the effects of linear algebra on the singularities of elliptic equations, and he established connections with the self-adjoint and singular issues of the equation.
6. Developed the Harnack Chain Theorem and demonstrated its use in the study of decomposable equations.
7. Introduced concepts of absolute continuity of functions, uniform HÃ¶lder continuity, and the establishment of the mean value theorem for elliptic equations.
8. Established the importance of the Saint-Venant principle in elliptic equation theory.

Born 7 May 1851, Dorpat, Russian Empire (now Tartu, Estonia). Died 3 April 1888, Dresden, Germany.
