**Hermann Hankel** was a German mathematician who worked on the theory of complex numbers, the theory of functions and the history of mathematics. He is remembered for the Hankel transform and the Hankel matrix.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the strong law of large numbers, a major result in the field of probability theory. 
2. Proposed and verified the recursion formula for the Bernoulli numbers which was an important contribution to number theory. 
3. Discovered the Hankel transform for integral transformations which was an important result in mathematical analysis. 
4. Discovered Hankel’s classical inequality which has applications in many areas of mathematics and physics. 
5. Published several papers demonstrating his findings relating to the Hermite polynomials and their zeros, as well as the roots of approximate equations. 
6. Researched the algebraic properties of ordinary differential equations and developed general methods for the integration of such equations. 
7. Established crucial results on the theory of elliptic functions and functions of several variables by studying determinants.
8. Published extensive works on orthogonal polynomials which have invaluable applications in several fields. 
9. Proposed a number of problems which have become classical in the field of complex analysis.
10. Wrote several monographs on the mathematical analysis of mechanics and physical phenomena.

Born 14 February 1839, Halle, Germany. Died 29 August 1873, Schramberg (near Tübingen), Germany.
