**Henrietta Leavitt** was an American astronomer who discovered the relation between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variables. This was a vital step in measuring the distance to remote galaxies. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a correlation between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variable stars, which helped to measure distances to galaxies outside of the Milky Way.
2. Discovered that the period of a Cepheid variable star’s brightness is proportional to its intrinsic brightness.
3. Recognized the existence of two distinct types of Cepheid variables.
4. Calculated the period-luminosity law of the Cepheid variables and presented it to the Harvard Observatory in 1908.
5. Improved the accuracy of all star catalogs by double-checking the results of her Harvard College Observatory colleagues.
6. Successfully found hundreds of variables, both in spiral and elliptical nebulae, and helped to classify them.
7. Developed and refined the Harvard Standard Magnitudes—a system for keeping an accurate record of brightness for thousands of stars. 
8. Improved training in astronomical photography by introducing the concept of stellar photometry. 
9. Measured the distances of over 1,700 stars.

Born 4 July 1868, Lancaster, Worcester County, Massachusetts, USA. Died 12 December 1921, Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts, USA.
