**Henrietta Leavitt** was an American astronomer who discovered the relation between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variables. This was a vital step in measuring the distance to remote galaxies.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* George Roswell Leavitt was a Congregationalist minister, born in Lowell, Massachusetts, who had studied at Williams College before being awarded a doctorate in divinity from the Andover Theological Seminary.
* His father was Erasmus Darwin Leavitt, a merchant, while one of George Roswell Leavitt's brothers was also named Erasmus Darwin Leavitt.
* This uncle of Henrietta's was an engineer who gained fame designing the Leavitt pumping engine.
* George Roswell Leavitt married Henrietta Swan Kendrick, a daughter of Henry Kendrick of Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 2 October 1866.
* Henrietta, the subject of this biography, was the oldest of her parents' seven children, the others being Roswell Harvey Leavitt (born 4 October 1871 and died an infant), Martha Almira Leavitt (born 1 August 1873), George William (born 2 September 1875), Mira Fay Leavitt (born 20 September 1878 and died aged 2), Caroline Reed Leavitt (born 16 May 1880) and Darwin Ashley Leavitt (born 15 June 1882).
* At the time of the 1870 census, Henrietta was two years old and living in her grandfather's home in Lowell, Middlesex, Massachusetts.
* The head of the household was Erasmus Darwin Leavitt (Sr.), at that time 60 years old and retired, and the house was run by his wife Almira who was 57.
* At least ten others were living in the house (all named Leavitt), including Erasmus Darwin Leavitt (Jr.), at that time 34 years old, and Henrietta's mother and father.
* George Roswell Leavitt became pastor at the Pilgrim Congregational Church in Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts and, by the time that his second child was born in 1871, the family were living in Cambridge.
* The 1880 census gives us a picture of the Leavitt family living at 9 Warland Street, close to the church where George was the pastor.
* Five of their seven children are there, with the two eldest, Henrietta and Martha, being at school.
* Also living with them is Mary Kendrick, Henrietta's aunt, and a 25 year old servant Catherine McDonald.
* Living next door, at 11 Warland Street, is Erasamus Darwin Leavitt, Henrietta's grandfather, with his wife Almira and daughter Almira (who is recorded as having spinal difficulties).
* The Leavitt family moved to Cleveland, Ohio and in 1885 Henrietta Leavitt enrolled at Oberlin College.
* The course that Leavitt took at the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women was very arts based and contained little science.
* Delighted to have Leavitt's assistance without having to pay her, he set her the task of studying photographic plates from which she had to record the required data.
* However, it was known that many stars changed in brightness so one of Leavitt's tasks was to look out for such variable stars.
* In September 1896 Leavitt applied for a passport to travel abroad.
* The application was to allow her to go abroad and return "in about two years." The application gives a physical description of Leavitt: Age - 28, Stature - 5 ft 8 ins, Forehead - High, Eyes - Gray, Nose - Long, Mouth - Medium, Chin - Long, Hair - Black, Complexion - Light, Face - Long.
* On her return, Leavitt went to Harvard to discuss her work with Pickering.
* He made some suggestions on how she might make some improvements to her manuscript and then Leavitt set off for Beloit, Rock, Wisconsin where her father was now the Congregational Minister.
* The 1900 census records the family living at 1263 Chafin Street in Beloit; Leavitt's parents and their five surviving children are all at this address.
* Aiming to take up her position by the end of July, Leavitt set out for Cambridge but, stopping to visit a relative in Ohio, she discovered the relative was ill and so she spent time helping out.
* She lived with her uncle Erasmus Darwin Leavitt, the engineer, in a large villa he had built on Garden Street in Cambridge, only a short walk from the Observatory.
* It was these plates that Leavitt was working on, measuring magnitudes and position of stars.
* In 1908 Leavitt published a full account of her work in the 21-page paper 1777 Variables in the Magellanic Clouds.
* This allowed Leavitt to make the vitally important observation that the periods of the variables was related to their absolute magnitudes.
* Leavitt needed to continue to work on making further measurements.
* By December 1908 Leavitt was in hospital in Boston.
* On her release she went to Beloit to stay with her parents and two unmarried brothers, George William Leavitt, now a missionary, and Darwin Ashley Leavitt, now a Congregationalist minister.
* Leavitt did not refer to these variable stars as Cepheid variables, but they are known today by that name after the first such star discovered in 1784 by John Goodricke.
* Leavitt's discovery allowed the scale of the universe to be determined, although more work was required since the relation that she discovered only allowed relative distances to be determined while other techniques were required to determine the distance to at least one such variable star to calibrate the scale.
* Leavitt was not given the chance to participate in this as Pickering used her skills on other projects.
* For the next four years Leavitt worked at the Harvard Observatory, except for a break of three months in the first half of 1913 when she had surgery to her stomach.
* Harlow Shapley was working on the size of the Milky Way galaxy and he contacted Pickering in August 1917 with questions for Leavitt concerning variables in globular clusters.
* Only after writing again in July 1918 did Shapley receive a response from Pickering saying that Leavitt had plates to investigate his question.
* In March 1921 Shapley became Director of the Harvard Observatory and by this time Leavitt was Head of Stellar Photometry.
* Leavitt died at 10.30 p.m. on 12 December, and her funeral was held at the Chapel of the 1st Congregational Church on 14 December.
* Although Leavitt died without making a will, she owned a share of two adjacent properties in Beloit and her share went, after her death, to her brothers (since her mother had died before this was settled).
* In 1925 GÃ¶sta Mittag-Leffler wrote to Leavitt at the Harvard Observatory, not being aware that she had died.
* The letter was given to Shapely who informed Mittag-Leffler of Leavitt's death.
* However, his reply does him no credit for it is clear that he was trying to take much of the credit for Leavitt's discovery, probably in the hope that Mittag-Leffler would nominate him for a Nobel prize!

Born 4 July 1868, Lancaster, Worcester County, Massachusetts, USA. Died 12 December 1921, Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts, USA.
