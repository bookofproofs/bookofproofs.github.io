**Kazimierz Bartel** was a Polish mathematician who went on to become president of Poland up to the first World War.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It became part of Austria when Poland was partitioned in 1772, and it was still a part of that country when Bartel was born there - so officially he was born in Lemberg.
* Bartel was awarded his doctorate in 1911 and, three years later, he was made a professor at the Lemberg Polytechnic.
* Bartel was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian army for the duration of World War I.
* For Bartel, as for many Poles, the war was seen as a positive step which could lead to Poland regaining its sovereignty.
* Bartel returned to his professorship at what was now called Lwów Polytechnic and in fact his book Descriptive geometry (Polish) was published around this time.
* Bartel took a very active part in this defence of Lwów, commanding the railway troops in their battles with the Ukrainian army.
* In 1919 Bartel gave up his professorship of mathematics at Lwów Polytechnic to assist in reforming Poland with a democratic constitution.
* Bartel became a member of Poland's Sejm, its parliament, in 1922.
* Pilsudski became Minister of Defence and Bartel was made Prime Minister of Poland.
* From 1926 until 1930, Bartel was Prime Minister of Poland on five separate occasions.
* As Prime Minister, Bartel was also keen to protect minorities in Poland.
* During these years when Bartel was again an academic, he applied his knowledge and skills in geometry to a historical study of perspective in European painting.
* This text of Bartel's is admirably straightforward in its methods.
* After Bartel's death, a third edition was prepared by Antoni Plamitzer who only made minor changes to the text of the third edition.
* In 1940 Bartel was appointed to Moscow and offered a seat in the Soviet parliament.
* During the following night 36 other professors, Bartel's colleagues, were likewise arrested.
* Bartel was not murdered with them.
* Bartel was being held at Pelczynska street, and here it looks as if his treatment was reasonable.
* Bartel received many honours and decorations.

Born 3 March 1882, Lemberg, Austria-Hungarian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 26 July 1941, Lwów, Poland.
