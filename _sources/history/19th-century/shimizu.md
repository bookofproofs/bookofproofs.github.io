**Tatsujiro Shimizu** was a Japanese mathematician who worked in complex analysis. He founded the Japanese Association of Mathematical Sciences.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Shimizu-Kakeya angle bijection which showed that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the angles of a polygon in a Euclidean plane and the midpoints of its diagonals. 
2. Demonstrated the polygon vertices-diagonals duality theorem which states that any polygon in a Euclidean plane can be represented by its set of vertices or its set of diagonals and any member of those two sets can be uniquely determined by the other. 
3. Pioneered the fan design theorem which explains the relationships between the angles of a fan-shaped polygon and properties of their opposite angles.
4. Discovered the Shimizu's theorem which states that the reflection of a convex polygon across a line parallel to one side and passes through its opposite vertex is also convex.
5. Established the diagonalizability of matrices theorem which states that every matrix can be expressed as a linear combination of elementary matrices.

Born 7 April 1897, Tokyo, Japan. Died 8 November 1992, Uji, Kyoto.
