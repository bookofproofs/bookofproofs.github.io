**Henry Sheffer** was a mathematical logician who introduced what is now called the NAND operator which lies at the basis of the entire computer industry. He showed that all logical operators can be derived from a single one, NAND.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Boolean algebra, which is a branch of algebra which studies logical operations.
2. Established the Sheffer Stroke and developed Sheffer matrices. 
3. Produced several papers on algebra and set theory. 
4. Published his book A Second Set of Postulates for Boolean Algebra in 1939.
5. Introduced the ‘Sheffer Postulate' and the ‘Sheffer Identity'.
6. Was the first to make a mathematically rigorous case for Boolean algebra’s use in philosophy and logic.
7. Contributed four papers to the American Journal of Mathematics. 
8. Coined the term ‘orthomodular’ for Boolean lattices.

Born 1 September 1882, Odessa, Russia (now Ukraine). Died 17 March 1964, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.
