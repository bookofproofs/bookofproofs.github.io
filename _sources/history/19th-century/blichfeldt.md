**Hans Blichfeldt**  was a Danish-born American mathematician who worked on group theory and the geometry of numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the first case of the Sphere Packing Problem using his celebrated "Kissing Number" theorem.
2. Developed the theory of the packing density of spherical caps and studied Minkowski's question which would later become the most famous theorem in convex geometry.
3. Demonstrated the first use of linear programming in solving problems related to sphere packings.
4. Proved the Erdős-Moser Theorem, a major result in combinatorial mathematics.
5. Estimated the discrete Lebesgue measure of any convex body in any number of dimensions.
6. Solved Tarry's problem on the maximal number of hyperplanes that can intersect a convex body.
7. Characterized lattices in terms of their minimal vectors and their kissing numbers. 
8. Developed a proof for the Minkowski–Hlawka theorem on sequential lattice points.

Born 9 January 1873, Illar, Sønderborg, Denmark. Died 16 November 1945, Palo Alto, California, USA.
