**Hans Blichfeldt**  was a Danish-born American mathematician who worked on group theory and the geometry of numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Erhard Blichfeldt married Nielsine Maria Scholer and their son Hans soon showed remarkable mathematical ability.
* Despite the family being poor, they were well educated and Hans's father helped him with his studies.
* Hans showed a talent for all subjects, but he shone in mathematics.
* At an early age Hans took the university entrance examinations.
* Looking for a better life and to escape the poverty which they lived in, Hans's family decided to emigrate to the United States when he was 15 years of age.
* This was not the immediate solution to all of Hans's problems for once in the United States he spent four years as a labourer working on farms and in sawmills.
* As a surveyor Blichfeldt had the opportunity to show his mathematical skills.
* Although this is no real sign of mathematical ability, it is usually taken as such by non-mathematicians and in the case of Blichfeldt his fellow surveyors were absolutely correct in persuading him to study mathematics at university.
* The first intake of students to the university was in 1891 and three years later in 1894 Blichfeldt began his mathematical studies there.
* To study in Europe, however, required money and Blichfeldt was not well off.
* He would certainly not have been able to find enough money without the generous help of one of his Stanford professors, Rufus L Green, who gave Blichfeldt a loan of the necessary funds.
* Within a year Blichfeldt submitted his dissertation On a certain class of groups of transformation in three-dimensional space which gained him a doctorate with distinction.
* Returning to the United States, Blichfeldt worked as an instructor at Stanford beginning in 1898.
* It is a remarkable story of achievement how Blichfeldt started his working life as a labourer and ended his career as head of department of a major university.
* Blichfeldt wrote papers on the geometry of numbers and he has an important book Finite Collineation Groups.
* He also comments on what sort of man Blichfeldt was.

Born 9 January 1873, Illar, SÃ¸nderborg, Denmark. Died 16 November 1945, Palo Alto, California, USA.
