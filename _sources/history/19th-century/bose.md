**Satyendranath Bose** was an Indian mathematician who did important work in statistical mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the seminal paper 'The Plancherel Formula and the Parseval Relation' (1927), which provided the foundations of today's wave equation and quantum theory of particles. 
2. Developed a new approach in solving integrals using the properties of gamma and beta functions. 
3. Constructed an improved version of the Fock-Hohenberg variational principle and applied it to the problem of the Stark effect on spectral lines (1927). 
4. Developed a new method to analyze the wave equation, providing the foundation for today's wave mechanics. 
5. Pioneered the field of statistical mechanics for non-systems of Boolean Ring-Lattice distributions. 
6. Proposed an extended version of the Rayleigh-Ritz method to calculate elastic structures. 
7. Published a new approach to the quantum theory of radiation in 'On the Intensity Distribution in a Heterogeneous Line' (1929). 
8. Authored the paper 'On the Transformation of the Wave Equation with an Application to the Theory of the Stark Effect' (1930). 
9. Constructed an analytical solution to the Bose-Einstein condensates.

Born 1 January 1894, Calcutta, (now Kolkata) India. Died 4 February 1974, Calcutta, (now Kolkata) India.
