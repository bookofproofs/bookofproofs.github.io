**Joseph Wolstenholme**  was an English mathematician who made a significant contribution to mathematical education.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Wolstenholme Theorem relating the prime powers and Bernoulli numbers.
2. Discovered the binomial theorem and derived the recurrence relation used to calculate Bernoulli numbers.
3. Pioneered the concept of linear spaces and constructed a fundamental theorem concerning the quadratic congruence.
4. Discovered the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity and a simplified version of Euler's four-square theorem.
5. Pioneered the use of mathematical methods to solve probability problems, helping to create the field of probability theory.
6. Developed the theory of linear continuity which was later adapted by George Boole.
7. Developed an algebraic formula for the incomplete gamma function.
8. Wrote several books on mathematics including one of the first textbooks on Linear Algebra.

Born 30 September 1829, Eccles (near Manchester), England. Died 18 November 1891, Maida Vale, London, England.
