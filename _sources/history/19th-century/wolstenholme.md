**Joseph Wolstenholme**  was an English mathematician who made a significant contribution to mathematical education.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Joseph studied at Wesley College in Sheffield, then entered St John's College, Cambridge on 1 July 1846 and, four years later, he graduated as Third Wrangler (he was ranked third in the list of first class degrees given in mathematics that year).
* Wolstenholme was awarded a fellowship to St John's College in March 1852.
* On four occasions during the years that he held the fellowship at Christ's College Wolstenholme was an examiner for the mathematical tripos (1854, 1856, 1863, 1870).
* However, Wolstenholme continued to take pupils at Cambridge for two years after resigning his fellowship.
* In 1871 Wolstenholme was appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper's Hill, near London.
* Wolstenholme's problems have proved a help and a stimulus to many students.
* During that period he became friends with Wolstenholme.
* She later incorporated Wolstenholme into one of her most famous books To the Lighthouse.
* In this book Mr Augustus Carmichael is based on Wolstenholme.
