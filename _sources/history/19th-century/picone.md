**Mauro Picone** was an Italian mathematician who worked on ordinary and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the notion of "Hilbertâ€“Picone identities" in the study of partial differential equations.
2. Demonstrated the application of topological methods to the study of integral equations.
3. Improved the theory of integral operators and the solution of integral equations.
4. Discovered the formal properties of linear differential systems with constant coefficients.
5. Developed the notion of "Picone formula" for the solution of certain elliptic partial differential equations.
6. Extensively studied the nonlinear partial differential equations and their analytic properties.

Born 2 May1885, Lercara Friddi, Palermo, Italy. Died 11 April 1977, Rome, Italy.
