**Dmitrii Matveevich Sintsov** was a Russian mathematician who worked on the theory of conics and  the theory of nonholonomic differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Sintsov-Fenichel Theorem, proving the existence of a certain mathematical order.
2. Constructed a Three Point Method to solve two point boundary value problems. 
3. Coined the concept of k-regular systems, forming a basis from which various properties of systems of differential equations can be derived. 
4. Proved the Gronwall Inequality which states that the solution to an inhomogeneous linear differential equation is bounded by an exponential function of time. 
5. Established the concept of uniform asymptotic solutions in the study of nonlinear differential equations. 
6. Successfully applied Liapunov's theory to the stability analysis of systems of differential equations.
7. Managed to construct the well known parameters of the Poincare section of a differential equation. 
8. Developed the classical modal interpretation of parametric resonance oscillations.

Born 21 November 1867, Viatka (now Kirov), Russia. Died 28 January 1946, Kharkov, Ukraine.
