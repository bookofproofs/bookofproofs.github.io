**Georges Darmois**  was a French mathematician and statistician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of reciprocity laws in algebraic number fields.
2. Published a treatise on Hilbert's Theory of Modular Forms.
3. Wrote a book, Leçons de Géométrie différentielle, introducing the modern notion of a differential manifold.
4. Co-authored Éléments de la Géométrie de l'espace à cinq et à six dimensions, a groundbreaking text in the study of five and six-dimensional geometry.
5. Established a basic analytic framework for the study of relativity and gravitation.
6. Co-authored Traité de géométrie différentielle, which developed the modern theory of connections.
7. Discovered the concept of a symmetric matrix in abstract algebra.
8. Defined the concept of solving polynomial equations using representation theory.
9. Made advances in differential geometry, including establishing the notion of an affine connection.
10. Pioneered the modern theory of non-Euclidean geometry, which laid the groundwork for the study of differential geometry.

Born 24 June 1888, Éply, Meurthe-et-Moselle, France. Died 3 January 1960, Paris, France.
