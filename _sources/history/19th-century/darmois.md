**Georges Darmois**  was a French mathematician and statistician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* For his war service, Darmois served in the artillery, in particular being assigned to work on anti-aircraft batteries.
* After he had been released from military service, Darmois was appointed as a lecturer at the Faculty of Sciences at Nancy.
* He chose Darmois who, of course, he knew well from working with him before World War I.
* In 1928 Darmois' first publication on statistics appeared being the monograph Statistique Mathématique, Encyclopédie scientifique appliquées Ⓣ(Mathematical statistics,  Encyclopedia of mathematical applications) which was a published version of the lectures he was giving at the Institute of Statistics of the University of Paris.
* Darmois was also an invited speaker at the Congress (although not a plenary speaker) and he gave the lecture Sur l'analyse et comparasion des séries statistiques qui se développent dans le temps Ⓣ(On the analysis and comparison of statistical series which could be developed in time (the time correlation problem)).
* In some domains, success was instantaneous; George Darmois' ideas, by dint of obstinacy, managed to permeate the least prepared environments and eventually made them prevail against routine.
* Darmois had been involved with the Institut from its beginnings, giving lectures there while still on the faculty at Nancy.
* Darmois had always been influenced by R A Fisher's work in statistics and in 1934 Fisher began interacting with those at the Institut Henri Poincaré.
* In 1934 Darmois published the book Statistique et Applications Ⓣ(Statistics and applications) which considers applications of statistics to areas such as economics and psychology.
* Fisher's theory of estimation, which originated in the early 1920s, had attracted some American attention (Hotelling and Doob) and Darmois was the first European to contribute to the theory.
* His next book, or pamphlet, 'L'Emploides Observations Statistiques: Méthodes d'Estimation'  Ⓣ(Employment Statistics Observations: Estimation Methods) (1936) expounded a fresh the theory and Darmois sent Fisher a copy.
* Fisher replied in June 1936 thanking Darmois for his "excellent little book" and a brief correspondence on the theory of maximum likelihood ensued.
* Fisher lectured in Paris in 1938 and, in the first half of 1940, Darmois visited London.
* In June of that year, while he was in London, France capitulated to the German invaders and it was decided that Darmois should not return to France.

Born 24 June 1888, Éply, Meurthe-et-Moselle, France. Died 3 January 1960, Paris, France.
