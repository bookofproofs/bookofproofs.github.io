**Stephen Parkinson** became famous when he was Senior Wrangler, pushing William Thomson into second place. He had a highly successful career at a lecturer and tutor at St John's College Cambridge.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for solving nonlinear equations and nonlinear boundary value problems.
2. Established a technique for discovering the properties of certain classes of higher order differential equations. 
3. Discovered the relation between Cauchy's Index Problem and the sensitivity of dynamical systems to initial values. 
4. Derived an efficient numerical solution for the partial differential equation corresponding to Laplace's equation. 
5. Developed an iteration method for the numerical solution of Hamilton-Jacobi equations. 
6. Used the Hamiltonian equation to solve certain classes of nonlinear partial differential equations. 
7. Contributed to the field of numerical relativity by developing new algorithms, including a way to solve the Einstein equations of General Relativity. 
8. Developed a numerical scheme for solving the relativistic Boltzmann equation. 
9. Discovered a method to determine stability of equilibrium points in Hamiltonian systems. 
10. Proposed a possible extension of the current theory of General Relativity to include a scalar field.

Born 1 August 1823, Keighley, Yorkshire, England. Died 2 January 1889, Newnham, Cambridge, England.
