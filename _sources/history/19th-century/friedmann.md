**Alexander Friedmann** was a Russian physicist and mathematician best-known for his work on the theory of relativity and in particular for introducing the possibility of an expanding universe.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first mathematical model in cosmology – the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Model – to describe the evolution of our universe.
2. Developed the Friedmann equations, which describe the expansion of the universe and its dynamics.
3. Discovered the possibility of a universe that is constantly expanding and contracting.
4. Established the idea that the universe is finite yet unbounded, meaning it has no specific endings or boundaries.
5. Proposed the idea of an expanding universe layered with inhomogeneities that can aggregate and form galaxies.
6. Developed mathematical solutions of Einstein’s field equation of general relativity.
7. Developed the theory of homogeneous isotropic cosmology, including the concept of a closed universe.
8. Advanced the understanding of the ‘world model’ – that space-time is a ‘space’ that contains all possible world’s.
9. Helped bridge the connection between physical theories and mathematics in order to progress our understanding of the universe.
10. Pioneered the use of statistical methods in scientific fields for the study of cosmology.

Born 16 June 1888, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 16 September 1925, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia again).
