**Evgeny Yakovlevich Remez** was a Belarus mathematician. He is known for his work in the constructive function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Evgeny Remez was the first mathematician to develop an algorithm for determining the distance between two points on a sphere.
2. He also developed an algorithm to calculate the area of a triangle on a sphere.
3. He established a method of polynomial approximation which is now known as the Remez algorithm.
4. He was the first to prove Bernstein's inequality, a result in Fourier analysis.
5. He developed the mathematical theory known as the spectral theory of linear operators in Hilbert space.
6. He introduced the concept of the “spectral density”, an important tool in spectral theory.
7. He published numerous original works on the calculus of variations and the theory of extremal problems.
8. He was the first to prove the Hicks theorem on analytic branches. 
9. He developed a unified theory of point transformations, providing a new and more powerful tool for solving systems of linear equations. 
10. He proposed a theorem related to the singularities of conformal mappings, now known as the Remez theorem.

Born 17 February 1896, Mstsislau, Mahiliou gubernia, Belarus. Died 31 August 1975, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine).
