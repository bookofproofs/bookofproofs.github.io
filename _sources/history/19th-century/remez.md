**Evgeny Yakovlevich Remez** was a Belarus mathematician. He is known for his work in the constructive function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Remez graduated in 1924 and began to teach both at the Institute of Public Education and at the Mechanical Trade School.
* Remez lived in Kiev, teaching at various institutions there, for most of his life.
* The Institute of Mathematics had only been founded in Kiev shortly before Remez began to work there.
* Now we said above that Remez obtained his Ph.D. in 1929.
* Professorships were only open to those holding the degree of Doctor of Sciences, so it was important to Remez that he work towards this degree.
* In the mid 1930s, he developed general computational methods of Chebyshev approximation and the Remez algorithm which allows uniform approximation.
* Remez generalised Chebyshev-Markov characterisation theory and used it to obtain approximate solutions of differential equations.
* For some mathematicians, Remez is best known as the author of the book General computation methods for Chebyshev approximation.
* Of course this was a topic which developed quickly over the following years, much of the development being due to Remez and his students.
* Not only did Remez develop techniques which originated with Chebyshev, but he also became an expert on Chebyshev and his work.
* Remez lectured at this meeting on Chebyshev's work on approximation theory.
* In 1974 Remez published Some of the principal divisions of P L Chebyshev's scientific activity (Ukrainian) which discussed Chebyshev's contributions to number theory, the theory of mechanisms, approximation of functions, minimax problems, and cartography.

Born 17 February 1896, Mstsislau, Mahiliou gubernia, Belarus. Died 31 August 1975, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine).
