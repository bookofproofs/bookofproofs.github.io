**Prasanta Mahalanobis** was an Indian mathematiccian who made important contibutions to statistics and to its application in meteorology and anthropology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Indian Statistical Institute in 1931 and served as its director until 1972.
2. Developed and popularized the 'Mahalanobis distance', a statistical measure of similarity between data sets.
3. Played a major role in the design and execution of the first sample survey to collect economic data in India in the 1930s.
4. Worked on the theory of sequential estimation,which is the foundation for sample survey techniques adopted even today.
5. Introduced sampling techniques for controlling quality in production during World War II.
6. Developed the Method of Structural Analysis, a multivariate technique for analyzing data.
7. Formulated an exact test for the standardized normal deviates, which is now known as the Mahalanobis “T" square test.
8. Helped develop India’s first satellite, Aryabhata, in 1975.

Born 29 June 1893, Calcutta (now Kolkata), India. Died 28 June 1972, Calcutta (now Kolkata), India.
