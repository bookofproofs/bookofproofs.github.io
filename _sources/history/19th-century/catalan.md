**Eugène Catalan** was a Belgian mathematician who defined the numbers called after him, while considering the solution of the problem of dissecting a polygon into triangles by means of non-intersecting diagonals.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Catalan proved Fermat’s Last Theorem for the special case of exponent n = 4. 
2. Catalan was the first to identify the importance of the Catalan numbers and their relationship to combinatorial problems. 
3. He demonstrated success in locating pairs of amicable numbers, discovering the pairs 17296 and 18416 and 9363584 and 9437056 in 1866. 
4. He proved two theorems of number theory: The first, the theorem of Mihailo Petrović, states that every prime number greater than 3 is of the form 6n + 1 or 6n - 1, while the second states that any number can be expressed as the sum of three triangular numbers. 
5. He also formulated a conjecture, now known as Catalan’s conjecture, stating that 8 and 9 are the only consecutive powers of two with distinct prime numbers. 
6. Catalan studied surfaces of constant negative curvature and defined what is now known as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

Born 30 May1814, Bruges, French Empire (now Belgium). Died 14 February 1894, Liège, Belgium.
