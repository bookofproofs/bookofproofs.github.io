**George Stokes** established the science of hydrodynamics with his law of viscosity describing the velocity of a small sphere through a viscous fluid.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Society in 1854, in recognition of his important contributions to mathematics. 
2. Stokes formulated the Navierâ€“Stokes equations, a set of partial differential equations which describe fluid motion.
3. He developed the mathematical theory of the hydrodynamic drag force and introduced the concept of dynamic viscosity. 
4. He derived a formula for the speed at which a heavy particle falls in a viscous medium (Stokes' law), and used this to explain the drag on a sphere falling in a viscous fluid. 
5. Stokes' theorem, an important theorem in vector calculus, is also named after him. 
6. He was a notable contributor to the theory of elasticity and coined the term fluorescence to describe the phenomena where some materials emit light when illuminated. 
7. He also did important work in finite differences and provided the first rigorous treatment of Fourier's theorem. 
8. He established a rigorous connection between the wave theory of light and electromagnetism.

Born 13 August 1819, Skreen, County Sligo, Ireland. Died 1 February 1903, Cambridge, England.
