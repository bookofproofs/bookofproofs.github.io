**Charles-François Sturm** is best remembered for the Sturm-Liouville problem, an eigenvalue problem in second order differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He introduced the concept of a Sturm sequence, which is related to the numerical solution of differential equations, and was the first to prove a Sturm-Liouville theorem.
2. He devised the Sturm test for determining the roots of a polynomial equation and the Sturm theorem for testing the convergence of a series.
3. He developed a new method for numerical integration and applied it to the integral of a function over a closed interval.
4. He studied the properties of orthogonal polynomials and developed his own version of Fourier analysis.
5. He was the first to prove that the radius of a circle inscribed in any triangle is uniquely determined by the sides of the triangle.
6. He contributed to the theory of elliptic functions and studied their application to trigonometry.
7. He also studied extensions of the Pascal triangle, describing accurate approximations to the binomial coefficient and other exponential functions.

Born 29 September 1803, Geneva, Switzerland. Died 18 December 1855, Paris, France.
