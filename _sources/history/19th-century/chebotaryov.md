**Nikolai Chebotaryov** proved his density theorem generalising Dirichlet's theorem on primes in an arithmetical progression.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Nikolai entered the University of Kiev in 1912 where he became a student of Grave.
* In this same year, 1922, Nikolai was to prove the theorem for which he is best known, the density theorem, which had been conjectured by Frobenius in a paper written in 1880 but only published in 1896.
* It was an unhappy situation and Chebotaryov resigned after a few months.
* Chebotaryov received his doctorate from the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences with a doctoral thesis based on his 1922 result, the density theorem.
* Chebotaryov worked on the algebra of polynomials, in particular examining the distribution of the zeros.

Born 15 June 1894, Kamianets-Podilskyi, Ukraine. Died 2 July 1947, Moscow, USSR.
