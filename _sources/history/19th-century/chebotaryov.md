**Nikolai Chebotaryov** proved his density theorem generalising Dirichlet's theorem on primes in an arithmetical progression.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first rigorous proof of the uniqueness theorem of convex functions.
2. Developed a method of solving nonlinear algebraic equations, later called the Chebotaryov method.
3. Established the method of nonlinear integral equations and developed its applications.
4. Investigated the theory of best approximation of linear operations in a normed linear space.
5. Discovered the Chebotaryov theorem, which states that the surjective isomorphism between Banach algebras is continuous.
6. Led the solution of The Kneser-Moser problem in combinatorial geometry. 
7. Demonstrated the existence of adequate solutions in a variety of problems of the calculus of variations.
8. Discovered a method of nonlinear approximations which provided a solution of certain problems of the calculus of variations. 
9. Advanced the theory of Banach spaces and developed its applications to the theory of linear operators and equations. 
10. Proved F. Riesz's conjecture concerning the relationship between the Hausdorff-Young theorem and the Bohnenblust-Hille inequality.

Born 15 June 1894, Kamianets-Podilskyi, Ukraine. Died 2 July 1947, Moscow, USSR.
