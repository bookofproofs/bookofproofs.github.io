**Thomas Clausen** was a Danish mathematician who wrote over 150 papers on pure mathematics, applied mathematics, astronomy and geophysics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for finding closed forms of certain groups of mathematical functions.
2. Established a detailed analysis of the possible structures in algebra and the functional equations associated with the structures.
3. Discovered the important concept of transitivity in algebra, which is a key concept in the study of algebraic structures.
4. Was the first to correctly identify and solve the General LÃ¶b Theorem, an important theorem in the theory of recursive functions.
5. Contributed significantly to the development of mathematical logic, particularly in relation to recursion theory.
6. Played a key role in the development of categorical logic, an area of mathematics and philosophy that studies the relationship between categories and logical principles.
7. Was an early leader in the development of computational complexity theory and the formalization of computational tasks.

Born 16 January 1801, Snogbaek, Denmark. Died 23 May 1885, Dorpat, Russia (now Tartu, Estonia).
