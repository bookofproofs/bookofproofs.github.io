**Vernon Morton** was an English mathematician who  was head of Pure Mathematics at Aberystwyth for many years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* When Morton attended, the school included both a junior and a secondary school.
* The headmaster during Morton's time at the school was James Harvey Hichens (1859-1938), who had an Oxford degree in chemistry, and he had done a remarkable job in raising the standards of the school with many pupils being successful in the Oxford and Cambridge Scholarship Examinations.
* However, Morton never fully recovered from the gas attack and suffered the consequences for the rest of his life.
* In 1920 Morton won a Junior Mathematical Scholarship and when he graduated in 1921 he won a Senior Mathematical Scholarship.
* Dixon was particularly interested in applications of algebra to geometry and Morton was inspired by him to undertake research in this area.
* While at Oxford, Morton advised his fellow student Mary Cartwright.
* It was a painful decision, over which she agonised for some time, but Morton gave her very sensible advice.
* After leaving Oxford, Morton was appointed as a lecturer at Brighton Technical College.
* (This College was later named Brighton College of Technology and now is known as City College Brighton & Hove.) Morton taught there for a year which, he later said, gave him very valuable teaching experience.
* In 1925 Morton married Olive Norris, the daughter of George and Olive Norris of Oxford.
* Vernon and Olive Morton lived at Eryl Mor, Brynymor Road, Aberystwyth and they had one son, David Charles Morton.
* Morton was promoted to Independent Lecturer and Head of the Pure Mathematics Department in 1926 and to Professor in 1933.
* From these reports you can follow the progress of the Department of Pure Mathematics under Morton's leadership over a period of 25 years.
* Morton's services in many capacities were frequently sought and highly valued by the University of Wales and by the College.
* When he reached the age of 65, Morton retired from his chair at Aberystwyth in 1961.
* We note that William Barry Pennington (1923- 1968) was appointed to fill Morton's chair at Aberystwyth when he retired in 1961.
* Aberystwyth University now awards the V C Morton Prize for outstanding performance by any Mathematics undergraduate.

Born 26 June 1896, Sheffield, England. Died 26 March 1978, Oxford, England.
