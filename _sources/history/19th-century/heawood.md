**Heawood** made important contributions to the four colour theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Invented the Heawood graph enumeration (1901).
2. Made significant contributions to the use of graph theory in map coloring (1963).
3. Coined the terms “perfect graph” and “planar graph” (1901).
4. Published “Periodic Graphs” (1954), the first book on graph theory.
5. Researched the enumeration of chemical trees and the shape of molecules (1950's).
6. Discovered the four-color theorem (1890).
7. Published the first survey of graph theory (1890).
8. Proved the “four color theorem” (1911). 
9. Researched matchings in graphs (1931).
10. Pioneered the study of the algorithms that produce chemical structures (1950's).
