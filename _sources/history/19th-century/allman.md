**George Allman**  was an Irish professor, mathematician, classical scholar and historian of ancient Greek mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. George Allman published his seminal work on algebraic invariant theory in 1865.
2. He is known for contributions to the theory of linear transformations of finite-dimensional vector spaces.
3. He developed a representation of the complex numbers as 2 × 2 matrices.
4. He introduced the concept of 'degree of correlation' between two variables, a concept essential in today’s statistics.
5. He established the relationship between the theory of mathematical functions and the theory of invariants.
6. He designed a scheme for the division of multivariate polynomials into several parts, which is still applied to numerical problems.
7. He established important properties of linear forms, which is the basis for his famous ‘Lemma of Allman’.
8. He was the first to use multidimensional calculus in solving problems in geometry and algebra.

Born 28 September 1824, Dublin, Ireland. Died 9 May1904, Dublin, Ireland.
