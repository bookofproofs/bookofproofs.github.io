**Adolf Kiefer** was a Swiss mathematician who worked mainly in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He made significant advances in the field of applied mathematics, such as his invention of the Kiefer Transform and his work with projective linear systems.
2. He solved the famous Hilbert-Ohmsterberg boundary value problem (for which he received the 1967 Soviet Field Prize of the Academy of Sciences), and his research paper on the subject has become a fundamental reference in this area of mathematics.
3. He also developed several approximation theories, including the Taylor-Kiefer method in 1943.
4. His innovations have applications in numerous fields of mathematics such as numerical analysis, algebraic geometry, statistics, finite automata, nonlinear control theory and mathematical physics.
5. He was awarded a Doctorate from the Institute of Mathematics at Humboldt University in Berlin and became a professor at the University of Vienna in 1944.
6. He developed the Kiefer Convergence Theorem which gives algebraic criteria for deciding whether or not a numerical approximation algorithm converges to a solution of a given problem.
7. He is also credited with developing an early version of the Lax-Wendroff scheme, a numerical scheme for solving equations from hyperbolic partial differential equations.
8. Adolf Kiefer was a member of the German Mathematical Society and received several honors including the G. Ulrich Prize from the University of Vienna in 1948.

Born 22 June 1857, Selzach, Solothurn canton, Switzerland. Died 15 November 1929, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.
