**Li Shanlan** was the greatest Chinese mathematician of the 19th century who translated Western works and gave many summation formulas.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed new formulas for finding the variance and average of data sets.
2. Expanded the field of trigonometry, outlining Li Shanlan's theorem in 1871.
3. Discovered several algebraic consequences of Jacobi's equation in 1874.
4. Developed a new form of the Law of Excluded Middle.
5. Succeeded in solving a longstanding problem which had not been addressed before in the field of number theory.
6. Discovered solutions to complex equations using insights from probability theory.
7. Developed a novel form of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
8. Pioneered the study of elliptical function theory.
9. Demonstrated that Pythagorean theorem can be extended to elliptical solutions.
10. Found new proofs for algebraic identities as well as providing a number of new conclusions.

Born 2 January 1811, Haining, Zhejiang Province, China. Died 9 December 1882, Peking (now Beijing), China.
