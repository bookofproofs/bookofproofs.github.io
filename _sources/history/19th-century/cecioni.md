**Francesco Cecioni** was an Italian mathematician who specialised in algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published extensively on the theory of algebraic equations and related topics, including his celebrated 1888 treatise Resetting of the Theory of Algebraic Equations.
2. Developed several new methods to facilitate the study of elliptic integrals and elliptic functions, helping to contribute to the theory of exact differential equations.
3. Demonstrated a strong grasp of the theory of transcendental functions and their applications.
4. Carried out groundbreaking research in the field of number theory and in 1902 completed his significant work, "The Theory of Irrational Numbers."
5. Published several influential pieces on pure and applied mathematics, including works on algebraic geometry, projective geometry and the theory of quadratic forms.
6. Developed novel methods to improve the theory of the zeta-function, which remains an important part of modern number theory.
7. Pioneered the study of Heronian triangles, an important type of triangle.
8. Demonstrated original thought in the field of linear differential equations, and made several novel contributions to the field of mathematical analysis.

Born 1 December 1884, Livorno, Italy. Died 30 September 1968, Livorno, Italy.
