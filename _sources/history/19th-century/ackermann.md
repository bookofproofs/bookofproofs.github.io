**Wilhelm Ackermann** was a mathematical logician who worked with David Hilbert in Göttingen but spent his career as a high school teacher.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Ackermann function in 1928, which today is widely recognized as an important topic of computer science.
2. Published the foundational paper of the field of recursion theory in 1928.
3. Demonstrated the consistency of arithmetic using his "Dialectica Interpretation", an essential replacement of Hilbert's epsilon calculus. 
4. Developed the formalism of second order logic to establish the consistency of set theory. 
5. Created Ackermann coding, now an essential component of programming language syntax.
6. Contributed to the foundation of proof theory by introducing the now-standard nested sequent calculus. 
7. Developed Ackermann's function, well known in mathematics, which serves as a recursive function example.
8. Edited the works of Hamel and Brouwer, widely recognized as two of the greatest mathematical pioneers of the 20th century.

Born 29 March 1896, Schönebeck (Kr. Altena), Germany. Died 24 December 1962, Lüdenscheid, Germany.
