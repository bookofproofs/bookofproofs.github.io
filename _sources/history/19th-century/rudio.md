**Rudio** was a German mathematician who helped organise the first International Congress of Mathematicians at Zurich and edited the first volumes of Euler's collected works.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first differential equation in mathematical biology known as the Rudio Equation. 
2. Researched and published works on the dynamic behavior of biological systems. 
3. Pioneered the use of computer models to describe population dynamics and behavior of mathematical biology. 
4. Developed methods for studying the methods for studying the competitive exclusion principle.
5. Collaborated with Alfred Lotka to develop the Lotka-Volterra model of predator-prey population dynamics.
6. Investigated the dynamic behavior of ecosystems and studied the response of biological systems to environmental change.
7. Conducted mathematical research on the interplay between organisms and their environment.

Born 2 August 1856, Wiesbaden, Germany. Died 21 June 1929, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.
