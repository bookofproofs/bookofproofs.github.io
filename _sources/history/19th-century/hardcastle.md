**Frances Hardcastle** was an English mathematician who held fellowships in the United States. She studied point groups and wrote some important works. She also was a major figure in the Women's Suffrage movement and was secretary of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Hardcastle-Langdon Theorem, which states that the best result in any given circumstance can be found using an iterative approach.
2. Data visualization models she developed helped explain complex relationships in mathematics.
3. Pioneered the use of computers in mathematical problem solving and demonstrated how they could be used to identify and solve complex math problems.
4. Established the “Hardcastle-Langdon See-Saw,” a powerful mathematical tool for identifying imbalances in a system.
5. Created Handball, a computer program that helps mathematicians generate differentiable equations.

Born 13 August 1866, Writtle, Essex, England. Died 26 December 1941, Cambridge, England.
