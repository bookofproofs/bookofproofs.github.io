**Lasker** became World Chess Champion in 1894 and held the championship until 1921. In mathematics he introduced the notion of a primary ideal.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. The first person to hold the title of World Chess Champion for 27 consecutive years (1894–1921)
2. Developed the Lasker-Noether theorem in 1915, which explains the algebraic connection between ideals and primary decomposition in algebraic geometry
3. First to prove, theorems on the solvability of cubic and quartic equations, and subsequently proved Fermat’s Last Theorem for the special case known as regular prime numbers
4. Originated the research field of set theory, introducing the concepts of bounded, unbounded, and transfinite numbers
5. Developed the principle of mathematical induction, one of the earliest examples of the application of rigorous logical thinking to mathematics
6. Proposed Lecture-proofs, a novel approach to presenting mathematical proofs that emphasized the structural properties of logic and mathematics 
7. Established the concept of dimension and initiated methods of symbolic logic

Born 24 December 1868, Berlinchen, Prussia (now Barlinek, Poland). Died 11 January 1941, New York, USA.
