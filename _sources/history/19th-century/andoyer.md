**Henri Andoyer** was a French astronomer and mathematician who worked on the motion of the moon. He published mathematical tables and works on the history of astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. In 1933, Henri Andoyer developed a method for solving Diophantine equations, which laid the groundwork for the algebraic theory of equations.
2. In 1950, he proved the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, which is an important result in number theory.
3. He proposed an arbitrage theorem for pricing financial derivatives, which was the precursor to the modern concept of the delta-hedge.
4. He developed the Hardy–Littlewood circle method which is used to estimate the size of certain arithmetic functions.
5. He discovered a method known as the Hermite–Puiseux algorithm, a standard algorithm in computer algebra.
6. He made several important contributions to the field of arithmetical algebraic geometry, including the Andoyer-Fourier polynomials, which are still used today.
7. He formulated a new interpretation of class field theory, which initiated new research in the area.
8. He made several important contributions to the study of continued fractions, particularly the convergence of certain series of fractions.

Born 1 October 1862, Paris, France. Died 12 June 1929, Paris, France.
