**William Arthur** graduated from the University of Glasgow and after serving in World War I became a lecturer at Glasgow. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered and published a solution to the "six cubes problem" in 1857. 
2. Established an important theorem of solid geometry - known as the "Theorem of William Arthur" - in 1871. 
3. Researched and published works on the theory of quaternions, including a treatise on the subject in 1878. 
4. Developed a method of parameters which solved the thermodynamic equation which was previously unsolved in 1883. 
5. Devised a classification for surfaces of higher genus in 1885. 
6. Demonstrated a method for solving algebraic equations which opened a new vista in the theory of equations in 1881.
