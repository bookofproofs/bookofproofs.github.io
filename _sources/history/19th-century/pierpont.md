**James Pierpont** was an American mathematician who worked on the Galois theory of equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed groundbreaking theories on the foundations of calculus and complex analysis
2. Formulated the Extreme Value Theorem, which states that the maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a closed interval must be achieved at least once within the interval
3. Established the Pierpont polynomial, a type of special polynomial used in many areas of mathematics and analysis
4. Demonstrated the power of summing geometric series and solving many transcendental equations
5. Helped popularize the application of calculus to a variety of practical problems, such as understanding the path of projectiles

Born 16 June 1866, New Haven, Connecticut, USA. Died 9 December 1938, San Mateo, California, USA.
