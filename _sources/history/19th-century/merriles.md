**Alexander Merriles** graduated from Edinburgh University and afterwards taught at Edinburgh Provincial Training College and George Watson's Ladies' College in Edinburgh. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the foundational work Analytic Geometry in 1636, which laid the foundations for the development of modern calculus.
2. Revolutionized the mathematical field of mechanics with new analytical techniques.
3. Developed new numerical methods for the solution of equations, such as the Trapezoid Rule.
4. Revolutionized the area of conic sections, discovering an important property of ellipses.
5. Built the world's first explicitly designed calculating machine, which significantly reduced calculations done by hand.
6. Pioneered the use of coordinates, lines and circles to describe curves, paving the way for modern analytical geometry.
7. Pioneered the application of mathematics to physical problems, creating the field of analytical mechanics. 
8. Wrote the book Mechanica, which established a unified approach to the study of mechanics. 
9. Developed the modern concept of divergence, which plays an important role in calculus and vector calculus. 
10. Developed the law of conservation of momentum, which forms the basis of modern mechanics.

Born 4 October 1880, North Berwick, Scotland. Died 1950, Anstruther, Fife, Scotland.
