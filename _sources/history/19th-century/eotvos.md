**Lóránd Eötvös** was a Hungarian mathematician and physicists who published works on surface tension and gravitation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a method of calculating lifting force on the rotating bodies that greatly advanced the progress of aeronautics.
2. Developed an equation of motion that involved an amount of work known as Eötvös-Lorentz law of force. 
3. Conducted experiments in gravity which established the equivalence between gravitational and inertial mass.
4. Developed a law of oscillatory motion of a material pendulum, known as the Eötvös pendulum equation.
5. Demonstrated the first use of the Sagnac effect to measure the earth’s rotation. 
6. Conducted experiments to determine the electromagnetic nature of light which laid the foundation for the development of modern optics and laser technology.
7. Proved theorems on transformations of multiple integrals.
8. Developed the basic idea behind the modern operation of electrical impedance tomography.

Born 27 July 1848, Pest (now part of Budapest), Hungary. Died 8 April 1919, Budapest, Hungary.
