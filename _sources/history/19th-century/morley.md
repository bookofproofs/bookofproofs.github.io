**Frank Morley** wrote mainly on geometry but also on algebra. He is best known for his theorem about the trisectors of the angles of a triangle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the foundations of modern algebraic notation, including the use of symbolic notation for addition and multiplication
2. Developed the concept of a commutative group and provided algebraic proofs for the associative law of operation
3. Discovered a number of novel algebraic identities, including the Binomial Theorem, which allowed for general expressions of polynomials
4. Developed the classical theory of quadratic forms, providing solutions to certain special cases
5. Wrote various influential textbooks on algebra and geometry, which helped to popularize these topics in England and the United States
6. Pioneered the field of abstract algebra, which revolutionized the way in which equations could be solved and related to other branches of mathematics

Born 9 September 1860, Woodbridge, Suffolk, England. Died 17 October 1937, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
