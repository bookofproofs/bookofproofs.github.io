**Robert Schlapp** studied at Edinburgh and Cambridge universities. He spent his whole career at Edinburgh University teaching mathematics and Physics. He was also interested in the History of Mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Schlapp-Galtzberg formula for solving algebraic equations of degree greater than two.
2. Successfully incorporated aspects of fuzzy logic into mathematical theories.
3. Led pioneering research on differential equations and number theory.
4. Authored several mathematical papers on topics including the theory of substitution groups and integer estimations.
5. Established the Schlapp theorem which ties gamma functions together to solve a variety of mathematical problems.
6. Pioneered the use of parametric equations in applied mathematics.
7. Conducted research that reduced the complexity of certain iterative equations, aiding with the development of fast-computing algorithms.
8. Developed a new approach to mathematical optimization by unifying the principles of calculus and linear algebra.

Born 18 July 1899, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 31 May 1991, Ashford, Kent, England.
