**Charles Loewner** was an American mathematician who made important progress on the Bieberbach conjecture.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the theory of convex sets, the foundation of modern convex analysis. 
2. Developed the theory of loose, general, convexity on two-dimensional surfaces. 
3. Introduced the notions of area and length of circles, and developed the concept of the Minkowski sum. 
4. Proved the first Riemann–Loewner equations for the determination of conformal maps of multiply connected domains in the plane. 
5. His theorem on spaces of positive curvature disproves a claim of Ludwig Bieberbach.
6. Developed a function to integrate elements of abstract linear spaces. 
7. Proved the theorem in bounded linear groups on sphere pairs.

Born 29 May 1893, Lany, Bohemia (now Czech Republic). Died 8 January 1968, Stanford, California, USA.
