**Joseph Tilly** was a Belgian soldier who published works on non-Euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Tilly studied the principles of geometry, Euclid's fifth postulate and non-euclidean geometry without being aware that this had become a major topic of interest.
* It was only in 1866 that he learnt about the work of the famous Russian mathematician on non-euclidean geometry, then in 1870 Tilly published a work Études de méchanique abstraite  on Lobachevsky space.
* Until this point Tilly had worked in isolation and it is certainly worth emphasising just how much harder this had made his research.
* It was also made more difficult by the fact that Tilly did not have easy access to library material which is so necessary in order to write an authoritative historical work.
* There were complaints that Tilly had unduly emphasised the scientific education of future officers at the École Militaire.
* An inspector at the military school declared that Tilly was not allowed to use differentials, and that he must cease immediately from any mention of the infinitely small.
* Tilly must have carried on with his methods of teaching calculus despite these warnings and as a consequence he was dismissed from his post and forced into early retirement in August 1900.

Born 16 August 1837, Ypres, Belgium. Died 4 August 1906, Munich, Germany.
