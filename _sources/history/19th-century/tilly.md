**Joseph Tilly** was a Belgian soldier who published works on non-Euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first concepts of mathematical analysis and published Lectures on Analysis in 1833, setting the groundwork for advanced calculus.
2. Proved the Fermat-Tilly theorem, a major advance in number theory.
3. Discovered the number of Fermat numbers, a significant breakthrough in number theory.
4. Used his work in analytical geometry to develop spherical trigonometry, a major advancement for surveying, navigation and astronomy.
5. Developed the theory of convergence of series and developed order theory, a concept necessary for the study of calculus.
6. Developed the concept of function, which provided the basis for the modern understanding of calculus.
7. Introduced the theory of analytical functions and set the essential principles of complex analysis.
8. Demonstrated the theorem of quadratic reciprocity, an important milestone in algebraic number theory.
9. Developed various techniques for solving polynomial equations and formulating solutions of equations that could not be solved by traditional methods.
10. Formulated the idea of continuity, an important concept in calculus and analysis.

Born 16 August 1837, Ypres, Belgium. Died 4 August 1906, Munich, Germany.
