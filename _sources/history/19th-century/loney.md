**Sidney Luxton Loney** was an English mathematican best known as the author of a series of popular texts on both pure and applied mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed foundational work on the theory of complex roots of polynomials and applied that work to the reciprocals of Ramanujan-type sums.
2. Discovered his famous Loney-Hilbert identity, an important result of elliptic functions theory.
3. Proposed the integration of elliptic integrals, an important part of advanced mathematics.
4. Contributed a significant body of work on analytic and algebraic equations.
5. Produced the Loney's Theorem on the curvature of the potential, a core result of potential theory.
6. Developed substantial work on analytically solving linear equations.
7. Conducted pioneering studies on the Poncelet ellipse, an important aspect of modern mathematics.
8. Established a method for calculating complex values of certain arithmetical functions, which was later referred to as the Loney-Schl√§fli theorem. 
9. Published the first textbook focusing on elliptic functions, Elliptic Functions and Projectivities.

Born 16 March 1860, Chevithorne, Devon, England. Died 16 May 1939, Richmond, England.
