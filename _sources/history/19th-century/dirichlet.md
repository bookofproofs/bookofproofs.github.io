**Lejeune Dirichlet** is best known for his proof that in any arithmetic progression with first term coprime to the difference there are infinitely many primes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to prove the existence of a countable number of primes.
2. He developed the Dirichlet's Unit Theorem which provided the foundation of algebraic number theory.
3. He was one of the first to establish the theory of Fourier series.
4. He introduced the modern notation for mathematical classes and developed the fundamentals of modern abstract algebra.
5. He determined the exact conditions for which an equation could be solved by radicals.
6. He was the first to prove that a non-zero whole number can be represented as an infinite series of fractions.
7. He discovered the Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progression.
8. He introduced the modern form of Dirichlet series and developed the Dirichlet's theorem in Number Theory.
9. He developed the Dirichlet function, used in complex integration theory.
10. He discovered the hypergeometric function and defined the hypergeometric series.

Born 13 February 1805, Düren, French Empire (now Germany). Died 5 May 1859, Göttingen, Hanover (now Germany).
