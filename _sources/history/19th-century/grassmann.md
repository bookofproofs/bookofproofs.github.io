**Hermann Grassmann** is chiefly remembered for his development of a general calculus for vectors.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed comprehensive theory of multi-dimensional vector spaces.
2. Developed a calculus for mechanism that can represent higher dimensions.
3. Derived several geometric formulas for integration and differentiation.
4. Developed the theory of exterior differential forms.
5. Established the principle of Grassmann algebra for vector and linear spaces.
6. Established Grassmann's Law of extension, a formula relating deviations from linearity to the covariance of two variables in a linear algebra equation.
7. Developed a new system of logic that extended Boole and Schlick's work, using the principles of multidimensional vector space.
8. Discovered the principle of associative algebra, relating the operations of addition and multiplication.
9. Explored non-Euclidean geometry and its implications within the linear algebraic systems.
10. Investigated the properties of curvature and derived formulas that have since been applied to physics, architecture and engineering.

Born 15 April 1809, Stettin, Prussia (now Szczecin, Poland). Died 26 September 1877, Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland).
