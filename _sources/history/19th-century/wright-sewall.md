**Sewall Green Wright**  was an American geneticist who worked on on evolutionary theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of Wright’s coefficients of inbreeding and inbreeding depression for population genetics.
2. Developed the B u G and pooled t statistics for testing significance in quantitative genetics.
3. Produced the first experimental evidence for the existence of a particular type of genetic mutation through his research on mutations in fruit flies.
4. Constructed the first mathematical population model to analyze the impact of shrinking population sizes, which led to the creation of the conservation movement.
5. Developed a modified version of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique that allowed for the analysis of more than one type of variable on a given experiment.
6. Developed the Wright-Fisher model, which enabled the field of population genetics to make predictions about the evolution of gene traits in different species.

Born 21 December 1889, Melrose, Massachusetts, USA. Died 3 March 1988, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.
