**Charles G Darwin** was the grandson of the famous biologist. He worked in Quantum Mechanics and had controversial views on Eugenics. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an improved version of the theory of potentials in the late 1920s.
2. Published a series of papers in the late 1920s and early 1930s that solved a variety of mathematical problems related to the calculus of variations, the theory of potentials, and the hydrodynamics of vortices.
3. Was a leading contributor to the development of the statistical theory of magnitude-frequency relationships in seismology.
4. Developed a new mathematical model for calculating small variations in the earthâ€™s gravity field.
5. Co-authored several influential books on applied mathematics, including The Quantum Theory of Radiation, The Variational Principles of Mechanics, and Wireless Telegraphy.
6. Pioneered the use of special functions in the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.
7. Introduced the theory of non-Newtonian orbits, which was later adopted by the Moon-Mars mission planners.
8. Formulated a new model of the evolution of species based on mathematical principles.

Born 19 December 1887, Newnham Grange, Cambridge, England. Died 31 December 1962, Newnham Grange, Cambridge, England.
