**Júlio César de Mello e Souza** was a Brazilian mathematician who wrote very popular texts such as _The man who counted_ under the pseudonym Malba Tahan. Brazil's National Day of Mathematics was instituted in 2013 to be on 6 May, Mello e Souza's birthday

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of singular points in the classical analytical mechanics, leading to the timeless theory of mechanical systems. 
2. Solved the problems of systems' stability and Hamilton-Jacobi equations with analytical mechanics.
3. Made substantial contributions to the theory of differential equations, numerical analysis and optimization. 
4. His work showed a link between the classical theories of Lagrange, Jacobi, Hamilton and Poincaré. 
5. Established the mathematical model of a gas composed of an ideal mixture of two components. 
6. Developed a mechanical theory to explain the heat and temperature effects of a gas mixture. 
7. Proposed a new model for the kinetic study of gas phases, which included the diffusion and convective regime. 
8. Published several books exploring the history of mathematics, including calculus and algebra.

Born 6 May 1895, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Died 18 June 1974, Recife, Brazil.
