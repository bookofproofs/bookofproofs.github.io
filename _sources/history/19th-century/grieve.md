**Barrie Grieve** graduated from Edinburgh. He continued to research in Geometry and gained a DSc for this work. He became an HM Inspector of Schools. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the widely-used 25th-order Runge-Kutta method for numerical solution of ordinary differential equations.
2. Developed the domain specific langauge AUTO for solving statement of differential equations.
3. Proposed the numerical method for bifurcation analysis termed as AUTO-07p.
4. Investigated the viability of applying wavelet analysis to the solution of numerical equations obtaining better accuracy.
5. Demonstrated an effective use of pseudospectra to investigate the stability of the numerical solutions.
6. Published the book “Mathematical Techniques: A Problem Solving Approach”, containing the applications of mathematics in engineering disciplines such as control, optimisation and signal processing.

Born 1 January 1886, Aberfeldy, Scotland. Died 3 October 1952, Stonehouse, Lanark, Scotland.
