**Elwin Christoffel** published works on conformal mappings, Riemann's o-function, the theory of invariants, and the Christoffel reduction theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theorem relating the surface area of a curved surface to its corresponding curvature of curvature. 
2. Constructed a set of fifteen basic equations for the structural analysis of membranes. 
3. Discovered an integral equation for the behavior of a vibrating membrane. 
4. Demonstrated that curved surfaces can be expressed as the sum of an infinite series of periodic curves. 
5. Researched the use of cotangential coordinates to represent a type of curve.
6. Explored the properties of geodesic lines on different surfaces, including flat and parabolic surfaces. 
7. Resolved a problem involving the computation of the volume of a hypersphere in n-dimensions. 
8. Developed a generalized expression for calculating the principal curvatures of surfaces. 
9. Demonstrated the use of a series of three vectors to represent a higher order version of a triangle. 
10. Studied the properties of variations of curvature related to the position of a point on an arbitrary surface.

Born 10 November 1829, Montjoie Aachen (now Monschau), Germany. Died 15 March 1900, Strasbourg, France.
