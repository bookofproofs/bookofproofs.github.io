**Mikhail Subbotin**  was a Soviet Polish mathematician and astronomer who worked on general properties of motion in the _n_-body problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Subbotin entered the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at Warsaw University in 1910.
* At the Russian University of Warsaw, Subbotin was awarded the Copernicus Scholarship after a competition run by the department.
* Subbotin graduated from the University of Warsaw in 1914 and began his career with an appointment as a junior astronomer at the university.
* The Russian University of Warsaw was evacuated to Rostov-on-Don in 1915 and Subbotin went with the rest of the university.
* A German governor general was installed in Warsaw and a new Kingdom of Poland was declared on 5 November 1916 but by this time Subbotin was working for his Master's Degree in Rostov-on-Don.
* In 1917 Subbotin submitted his thesis and was awarded his Master's Degree in Rostov-on-Don.
* Despite his early appointment as a junior astronomer, Subbotin's work at this time was firmly in the area of mathematics.
* From the evacuated university in Rostov-on-Don, Subbotin moved to the Polytechnic Institute in Novocherkassk.
* In 1921, while progressing well in his career in Novocherkassk, Subbotin received an invitation to work at the Main Russian Astrophysical Laboratory.
* The Russian Astrophysical Laboratory in Tashkent had been created out of the Tashkent Observatory and, in 1925, the Tashkent Observatory became independent again with Subbotin as the first Director of the newly re-established Observatory.
* Subbotin nearly died of hunger in the siege but, seriously ill, he was evacuated in February 1942 just in time to save his life.
* Subbotin had been taken to Sverdlovsk in February 1942 to recover his health.
* The University of Leningrad was re-established at Saratov and by the end of 1942 Subbotin was in Saratov as the Director of the Leningrad Astronomical Institute.
* Subbotin recommended that the Institute become the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1943 and his recommendation was followed.
* When the situation allowed, the Institute was returned to Leningrad with Subbotin as its head.
* Subbotin's early work was in the theory of functions and probability.
* Subbotin not only showed the possibility of improving the convergence of the trigonometric series by which the behaviour of perturbing forces is represented, but also gave an expression for determining Laplace coefficients and presented formulas for computing the coefficients of the necessary members of the trigonometric series.

Born 29 June 1893, Ostrolenka, Russian Empire (now Ostrołęka, Poland). Died 26 December 1966, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
