**Mikhail Subbotin**  was a Soviet Polish mathematician and astronomer who worked on general properties of motion in the _n_-body problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Subbotin Transform, a method of solving linear differential equations using integral transforms. 
2. Contributed to the development of the concept of integral equations.
3. Developed the Subbotin formula, which is used to calculate eigenvalues of given matrices. 
4. Derived the formula for calculating the highest frequency of a sound wave in gases. 
5. Obtained solutions for air flow past a circular cylinder, serving as a precursor to the study of aerodynamics. 
6. Discovered certain inequalities related to eigenvalues of matrices. 
7. Proposed new methodologies to reduce complexity in programming algorithms. 
8. Formulated a mathematical basis for a number of problems in cataloguing. 
9. Created a theory of the homogeneization of linear differential equations.
10. Developed the Subbotin Classification, a method of classifying Integers.

Born 29 June 1893, Ostrolenka, Russian Empire (now Ostrołęka, Poland). Died 26 December 1966, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
