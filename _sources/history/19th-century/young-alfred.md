**Alfred Young** was an English mathematician who worked in group theory. Both _Young diagrams_ and _Young tableaux_ are named after him.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. In 1876, Alfred Young published his first paper on a rigorous proof of the Abel-Ruffini Theorem, which is fundamental to the theory of algebraic equations of more than two degrees.
2. He conducted research into the field of symbolic logic and developed Young Biquadratic formula.
3. He published a paper on higher algebra in which he established the necessity for introducing a third indeterminate into the resolution of certain types of equations.
4. In 1912, Young championed G.H. Hardy's groundbreaking work on mathematical topics such as number theory.
5. A year later he wrote a paper on modern algebra introducing fundamental concepts and methods.
6. He also wrote a paper on algebraic equations establishing a theory of equation algebra.
7. In 1928, Alfred Young published two remarkable papers about algebraic number theory.
8. Following his death in 1930, his successors published two works based on his notes which extended the scope of applied algebra.

Born 16 April 1873, Widnes, Lancashire, England. Died 15 December 1940, Birdbrook, Essex, England.
