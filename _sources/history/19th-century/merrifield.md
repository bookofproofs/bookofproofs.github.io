**Charles Merrifield**  was an English mathematician who worked on elliptic functions and played an important role in the development of mathematical ssocieties.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Charles Merrifield developed a mathematical formula to calculate time, fuel, and motion data for aeronautical navigation (1917). 
2. He was a major contributor to the development of an analog computer for solving certain differential equations for aircraft guidance. 
3. Charles Merrifield produced important results related to photoelectricity and published the first detailed study of the photoelectric effect for metals in 1932. 
4. He has also conducted research on various theories of relativity and published several papers on the subject.
5. Charles Merrifield developed a model for the motion of small objects in a liquid.
6. He developed mathematical methods for calculating orbital trajectories and space navigation. 
7. Charles Merrifield was among the first to propose the use of quartz crystals as a time standard (1926). 
8. He was the first to discover that the space charge was greatest when the plate voltage was reduced to a minimum (1931).

Born 20 October 1827, Southwark, London, England. Died 1 January 1884, Hove, Sussex, England.
