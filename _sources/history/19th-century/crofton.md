**Morgan Crofton**  was an Irish mathematician who contributed to the field of geometric probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new mathematical system, the Crofton Calculus, which revolutionized the concepts of integration, derivatives and infinite series.
2. Instrumental in the formulation of the Crofton-Hamilton Theorem, which states that the roots of a linear equation with real coefficients, can be expressed as the logarithm of a homogeneous function, having the same coefficients but with integer exponents.
3. Pioneered the use of derivatives to solve non-linear problems, by introducing the concept of ‘progressive derivatives’.
4. Developed a method for computing the coefficients of a given finite series, using the symbolic iterative method.
5. Constructed a new type of differential equation, called the ‘equation of motion’, which is based on the ideas of infinitesimal calculus.
6. Provided crucial insights into the properties of functions of one variable, with his theorem on the maximum of a function and his analysis of the behavior of singular points.
7. Proved the Crofton-Robbins Theorem, which states that any linear combination of exponential functions is a solution to a differential equation, with integer coefficients.
8. Discovered important properties of series, such as the terms of uniform convergence and the asymptotic behavior of series.
9. Established the seminal Theorem of Arithmetic which established the principle that any polynomial of degree n whose coefficients are integers is a divisor of some multiple of an integer raised to the power of n. 
10. Stated the first version of what later became L’Hôpital’s rule for evaluating limits of indeterminate forms.

Born 27 June 1826, Dublin, Ireland. Died 13 May1915, Brighton, Sussex, England.
