**Tadeusz Ważewski** was a Polish mathematician who contributed to the theory of differential equations, control theory and the theory of analytic spaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Ważewski theorem of additive number theory which provides an incredibly succinct formulation of the number of ways a given number can be written as a sum of two integers.
2. Established rudimentary criteria for determining a string's primes and nontotients, a major step forward in solving algebraic Diophantine equations.
3. Proved that any Diophantine equation has only a finite number of solutions.
4. Published groundbreaking research on the Euler-Maclaurin summation formulae.
5. Proved the Diophantine Frobenius theorem which enables calculation of a finite number of primitive solutions for any diophantine equation with integer coefficients.
6. Investigated the properties of continuants which have since become a basic tool in the field of number theory.
7. Developed a method for efficiently solving linear Diophantine equations.
8. Explored the theory of plane partitions which are of fundamental importance in Combinatorics.
9. Developed the method of plane partitions which is still in use today.
10. Pioneered the inversion process which is used to calculate starting values of ratio-expansions.

Born 24 September 1896, Galicia, Poland. Died 5 September 1972, Rabka-Zdrùj, Poland.
