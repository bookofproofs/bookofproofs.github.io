**Edward Ross** studied at Edinburgh and Cambridge universities. After working with Karl Pearson in London he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the Christian College in Madras India. Ill health forced him to retire back to Scotland. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the Ross Linear Matrix, a new way of solving matrices of equations.
2. Developed the Ross-Thornton-Gorman Algorithm, a technique for solving linear equations from matrices of equations.
3. Published research papers on mathematical theories such as Riemannian geometry and linear algebra.
4. Developed software to calculate the solution of matrices of equations faster and more accurately.
5. Established a mathematical research lab dedicated to the study of mathematics and its applications.
6. Actively contributed to various research areas in mathematics, such as numerical analysis and algebra.
7. Developed mathematical models that could be applied in numerous applications, such as engineering and computer science.
8. Pioneered the use of computers to solve mathematical problems, laying the groundwork for later innovations in the field.

Born 28 September 1881, Maud, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Died 11 January 1947, Edinburgh, Scotland.
