**Walter Rouse Ball** was an English mathematician best known for his popular books on the History of Mathematics and on Mathematical Recreations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the first English-language history of mathematics, "A Short Account of the History of Mathematics" (1888).
2. Edited and wrote a number of books including The Theory of Sets of Points (1898), History of the Theory of Numbers (1908) and Mathematical Recreations and Essays (1914).
3. Discovered the connection between algebraic invariant theory and the theory of finite groups, a crucial breakthrough in algebra.
4. Rediscovered Veblen's work on projective geometry and axiomatic systems.
5. Developed the educational technique now known as the 'ball method', an innovative way of teaching mathematics to young students.

Born 14 August 1850, Hampstead, London, England. Died 4 April 1925, Elmside, Cambridge, England.
