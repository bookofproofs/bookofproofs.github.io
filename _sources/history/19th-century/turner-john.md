**John Turner** graduated from the university of Edinburgh and taught at the Royal High School of Edinburgh.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The 1881 census, taken when John Turner was ten years old, describes his father as a mill worker.
* John Turner is the youngest of the family having older siblings: Duncan (born about 1856 and a student of theology), Thomas (born about 1858 and a railway clerk), Jeanie (born about 1860), William (born about 1866 and an apprentice moulder) and Robert (born about 1869 and an apprentice grocer).
* John Turner entered Bridge of Weir Public School in 1877, when he was six years old, and after two years moved to Paisley Public School.
* Turner first matriculated at the University of Edinburgh in October 1886 when he was fifteen years old.
* John Marshall, M.A. Oxon., LL.D. Edin., a classics scholar, was Rector of The Edinburgh High School when Turner was appointed.
* Mr Turner's work throughout the Session has been most successful.
* In November 1894, Turner joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.
* Turner was a very active member of the Society.
* Turner carried out administrative duties for the Society over many years but he also contributed to the academic work of the Society.
* W King Gillies, M.A., B.A. (Oxon.), LL.D., F.R.S.E., a classics scholar, was Rector of the Edinburgh Royal High School during the last thirteen years the Turner taught there.
* The Rector presided, and, in addition to the whole Staff, there were present Miss Turner and Miss MacLaren.
* He mentioned his personal indebtedness to Mr Turner and, expressing his profound gratitude for thirteen years' assistance, said that Mr Turner's wise and dispassionate judgment on affairs had been a source of comfort and assurance.
* To all his colleagues Mr Turner had been a valued friend, the younger members of the Staff in particular finding in him a kind and considerate adviser.
* The Rector congratulated Mr Turner on entering on his retirement after such long and distinguished service, and expressed his pleasure in handing over to him a pair of field-glasses and several books as a token of affection and esteem from his colleagues, who might fairly claim to represent the High School Masters and Mistresses of the last forty years.
* Mr Turner in reply said that the occasion marked the end of a long story, not very exciting, but pleasant, and might also be the beginning of another, perhaps shorter one, but one which, if good wishes counted, would be happy.

Born 23 June 1871, Bridge-of-Weir, Kilbarchan (near Paisley), Scotland. The date of his death is unknown.
