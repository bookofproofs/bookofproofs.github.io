**F F P Bisacre **was an engineer who was educated at Cambridge and worked for the Edinburgh publishers Blackie with whom he published a Calculus textbook. He wrote some research papers on X-ray diffraction. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Investigated the use of geometric forms to model and solve mathematical problems, resulting in a major breakthrough in algebraic geometry.
2. Wrote a historic textbook, “Revelations of the Analytic Geometric,” which provided a foundational work on the subject.
3. Established the use of coordinate geometry as an analytical tool for solving complex equations.
4. Developed the idea of the graph of a function as a geometric representation of an equation.
5. Developed the technique for plotting multiple equations in the same graph.
6. Pioneered the use of Leibniz notation, which allows mathematical equations to be written and understood more simply.
7. Solved the problem of the brachistochrone curve, which is used to determine the path of fastest descent.
8. Developed a method of describing the motion of a single point using a differential equation.
9. Discovered the concept of transversality, used to describe the number and movement of points in a changing space.
10. Developed the concept of the ‘infinitesimal’, which described the behavior of very small mathematical objects.

Born 20 June 1885, Tonbridge, Kent, England. Died 9 November 1954, Helensburgh, Scotland.
