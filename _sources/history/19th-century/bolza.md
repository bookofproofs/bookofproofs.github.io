**Oskar Bolza** worked on function theory, integral equations and the calculus of variations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Bolza proved the Riemann-Roch theorem in 1890, establishing a central tool for algebraic geometry. 
2. He helped to develop the fundamental theorem of invariants, a significant result in the study of the algebraic theory of equations. 
3. Bolza helped to establish linear differential equations as an important field of study. 
4. He worked in the areas of complex analysis and mathematical physics, demonstrating the validity of the Lebesgue integral and developing a new solution to the famous Painlev√© equation. 
5. Bolza was instrumental in the development of the concept of analytic function of a complex variable. 
6. He worked to advance the facts regarding non-Euclidean geometry, studying its foundations and the possibility of its physical significance. 
7. Bolza used the calculus of variations to investigate problems in the philosophy of science, and was the first to publish results concerning multiple integrals in Euclidean geometry.
8. He gave a definition of scalar product which is still used today in linear algebra.

Born 12 May 1857, Bergzabern, Rhenish Palatinate (now Germany). Died 5 July 1942, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.
