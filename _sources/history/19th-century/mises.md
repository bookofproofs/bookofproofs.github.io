**Richard Von Mises** was an applied mathematician who worked on fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, aeronautics statistics and probability theory. He gave the first university course on powered flight in 1913.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first theory of probability and statistics, which became the foundation of modern probability theory.
2. Developed the theory of probabilistic randomness in a way that allowed mathematical development of central limit theorem.
3. Developed a method of finding stable solutions to systems of differential equations.
4. Developed a foundational version of the theory of aerodynamic turbulence. 
5. Helped develop the mathematical foundations for fluid dynamics, including the Navier-Stokes equations and the equations of motion for fluids with viscosity. 
6. Developed an early version of the calculus of variations with his brother, Walter von Mises. 
7. Developed statistical methods for determining the probability of aviating structures.
8. Pioneered the application of mathematical entities such as group theory to physical problems. 
9. Developed a mathematical theory of stress and strain under various loading conditions. 
10. Contributed to the development of stochastic calculus.

Born 19 April 1883, Lemberg, Austria Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 14 July 1953, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.
