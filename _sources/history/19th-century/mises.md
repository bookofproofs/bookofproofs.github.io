**Richard Von Mises** was an applied mathematician who worked on fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, aeronautics statistics and probability theory. He gave the first university course on powered flight in 1913.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ludwig, who was about eighteen months older than Richard, went on to become an economist who contributed to liberalism in economic theory and made his belief in consumer power an important part of that theory.
* It was on the technical course that von Mises embarked, studying mathematics, physics and engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna.
* Von Mises was awarded a doctorate from Vienna in 1907 and the following year he was awarded his habilitation from Brünn, becoming qualified to lecture on engineering and machine construction.
* Even before the outbreak of the war von Mises had qualified as a pilot and he gave the first university course on powered flight in 1913.
* When war broke out von Mises joined the Austro-Hungarian army and piloted aircraft.
* After the end of the war von Mises was appointed to a new chair of hydrodynamics and aerodynamics at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden.
* These words by Schmidt show great wisdom, and the authorities did indeed create the full professorship and made an inspired choice for the first holder in von Mises.
* Von Mises was an incredibly dynamic person and at the same time amazingly versatile like Runge.
* Von Mises was also an excellent lecturer.
* Von Mises in one sense was not Jewish for he was a Roman Catholic by religion.
* Von Mises certainly qualified under this clause and it would have allowed him to keep his chair in Berlin in 1933.
* He promised von Mises that if he would support him to succeed as Director of the Institute then he would ensure that von Mises would not lose his pension rights.
* In October 1933 von Mises wrote his letter to support Vahlen as his successor.
* Having taken up the new chair in Istanbul, von Mises received a letter in January 1934 denying him any rights at all.
* It was something that von Mises continued to feel extremely aggrieved about, writing to the Ministry in 1953, shortly before his death, still trying to restore his rights.
* In 1939 von Mises left Turkey for the United States.
* Von Mises worked on fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, aeronautics, statistics and probability theory.
* This judgement by Ostrowski is rather harsh, however, and many consider von Mises' theories to be important in the development of the subject.
* that the basis for the applicability of the results of the mathematical theory of probability to real 'random phenomena' must depend on some form of the frequency concept of probability, the unavoidable nature of which has been established by von Mises in a spirited manner.
* von Mises' notion of a random sequence in the context of his approach to probability theory.
* in looking over the work of von Mises ...
* von Mises has always been a truly broad-minded man ...
* von Mises chose the topics according to a very definite view-point, determined by his ideas about the essence and method of every thoroughly scientific research.
* In von Mises' book Positivism: A Study in Human Understanding (1951) he expressed his views on science and life.
* This interest in philosophy was only one of von Mises' interests outside the realm of mathematics.
* In 1950 von Mises was offered honorary membership of the East German Academy of Science.
* This was difficult for von Mises, particularly in McCarthy era America where any link with communism would have been viewed as a serious offence.

Born 19 April 1883, Lemberg, Austria Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 14 July 1953, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.
