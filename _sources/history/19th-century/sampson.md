**Ralph  Sampson** was an Irish astronomer who worked on the theory of the motions of Jupiter's four Galilean satellites.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Only at age fourteen did Ralph's formal education begin when he entered the Liverpool Institute.
* After two years as a lecturer in mathematics in London, Sampson returned to Cambridge in 1891 when he became the first holder of the Isaac Newton Studentship in Astronomy and Physical Optics.
* Sampson used a series of accurate observations from Harvard College Observatory to amend the existing theory of the satellite orbits, but the disagreement between theory and observation persisted.
* Sampson also did a superb job editing one volume of the papers of his former tutor, John Couch Adams.
* The whole work was published in several volumes between 1896 and 1900, with Sampson's volume appearing in 1900.
* In 1910 Sampson was appointed to a professorship at the University of Edinburgh and also as Astronomer Royal for Scotland.
* More significant was that during Sampson's presidency, women were admitted as fellows on equal terms to men.
* Sampson received many honours for his contributions.

Born 25 June 1866, Schull, Co Cork, Ireland. Died 7 November 1939, Bath, England.
