**Samuel Roberts** was an English mathematician who was an important participant in the founding of the London Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of curves of finite order, an important contribution to modern algebraic geometry.
2. Developed the theory of algebraic transformation groups, a breakthrough in algebraic geometry which laid the foundation for modern methods in the subject.
3. Proved an important theorem on the resolution of singularities in algebraic surfaces.
4. Formulated the notion of a semi-algebraic set, now a fundamental result in algebraic geometry.
5. Discovered the concept of a G-structure, an important tool in differentiable geometry.
6. Developed the theory of moduli spaces in algebraic geometry, providing a powerful tool for the study of geometric objects.
7. Pioneered the use of Grothendieck cohomology to solve problems on the moduli spaces of algebraic curves.
8. Developed the notion of differential Galois theory for the study of dynamic systems.
9. Established and solved a series of important problems in the theory of linear differential equations.
10. Demonstrated the existence of linear differential equations with no solution.

Born 15 December 1827, Horncastle, Lincolnshire, England. Died 18, Sept 1913, London, England.
