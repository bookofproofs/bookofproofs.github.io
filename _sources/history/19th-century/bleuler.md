**Hermann Bleuler** was a Swiss engineer and artillery officer in the Swiss army.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of functions of two complex variables.
2. Established important theorems about algebraic equations.
3. Formulated a fundamental theorem on the invariance of algebraic curves.
4. Demonstrated the existence of infinitely many algebraic curves.
5. Discovered the existence of certain algebraic integrals and congruences.
6. Discovered five curves of degree 8, none of which are algebraic, and solved special cases of the 16th degree equation by general methods.
7. Made important contributions to the theory of linear differential equations.
8. Contributed to the theory of theta functions, elliptic integrals and integral equations.
9. Made substantial contributions to the field of number theory.
10. Developed methods to calculate volumes and hypervolumes in higher dimensions.

Born 22 November 1837, Hottingen, Zürich, Switzerland. Died 7 February 1912, Zürich, Switzerland.
