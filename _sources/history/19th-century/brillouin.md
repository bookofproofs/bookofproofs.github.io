**Marcel Brillouin** worked on topics ranging from history of science to the physics of the earth and the atom.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Brillouin-Wigner perturbation method for obtaining approximate solutions to quantum mechanical problems. 
2. Developed the Brillouin-Keller theory for handling the resonance spectra in atomic nuclei.
3. Formulated the integral transformation for computing the coefficients of the Legendre polynomials.
4. Established the reciprocal relation between particles and waves in the study of radiation pressure in optical materials.
5. Proposed a statistical theory of product functions for computing the sum of multiple scattering processes in a scattering medium.

Born 19 December 1854, Melle, Deux-SÃ¨vres, France. Died 16 June 1948, Paris, France.
