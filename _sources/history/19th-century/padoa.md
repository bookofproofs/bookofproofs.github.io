**Alessandro Padoa**  was an Italian mathematician and logician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote an important treatise on the theory of equations, called Problèmes plaisants et délectables qui se font par les nombres (Pleasant and Delightful Problems with Numbers).
2. Developed a method of evaluating sums of alternating series.
3. Founded the Association des Calculateurs Electroniques (Association of Electronic Calculators).
4. Developed new rules for evaluating the multi-dimensional integrals.
5. Analyzed and highlighted the importance of continuous and discontinuous curves in mathematics.
6. Published his most notable work, La Théorie des Fonctions Algébriques (The Theory of Algebraic Functions), which served as the basis for algebraic geometry.
7. Wrote an article concerning the French Academy of Sciences' decisions regarding algebraic research.
8. Created the notion of an algebraic field, which would lead to the study of algebraic keyword structures in the 20th century.
