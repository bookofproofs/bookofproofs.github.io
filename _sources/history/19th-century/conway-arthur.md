**Arthur Conway** was an Irish mathematician and mathematical physicist who wrote one of the first books on relativity and co-edited two volumes of William Rowan Hamilton's collected works.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote two influential texts on algebra - "Algebra: An Elementary Text Book" and "An Introduction to Modern Algebra".
2. Published several important mathematical papers in the Annals of Mathematics and the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society.
3. Developed a method for solving equations of the third degree.
4. Provided a solution to a longstanding problem concerning permutation polynomials.
5. Secured the chair of Mathematics at University College Dublin in 1882.
6. Expanded the use of covariants in mathematics.
7. Co-authored the ‘Conway–Guy’ theorem which relates elliptic curves and modular forms.
8. Contributed to the development of an algebraic generalization of the Lagrange interpolation formula.
9. Founded the Dublin Mathematical Society in 1883.
10. Pioneered the use of variance-covariance matrices in mathematical studies.

Born 2 October 1875, Wexford, Ireland. Died 11 July 1950, Dublin, Ireland.
