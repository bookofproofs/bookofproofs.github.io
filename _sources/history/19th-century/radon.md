**Johann Radon** worked on the calculus of variations, differential geometry and measure theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Radon transform, a mathematical tool which enabled researchers to reconstruct 2D images from 2D projections. 
2. Initiated the field of tomography, a technique of imaging body structures and organs inside the body using X-rays. 
3. Discovered the Radon-Nikodym Theorem in 1922, a fundamental result in measure theory, probability and functional analysis.
4. Established the foundations of what later became known as integral geometry, a field at the meeting point of linear algebra and Euclidean geometry.
5. Developed a technique for interpolation in two or more dimensions known as the Radon interpolation formula.
6. Published several research papers on trigonometric series and the foundations of calculus.
7. Co-developed the Radon–Hurwitz theorem which is important in number theory.
8. Pioneered the study of graphical calculus, pioneering novel ways of visualizing and manipulating mathematical equations.

Born 16 December 1887, Tetschen, Bohemia (now Decin, Czech Republic). Died 25 May 1956, Vienna, Austria.
