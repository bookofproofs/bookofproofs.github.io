**Johann Radon** worked on the calculus of variations, differential geometry and measure theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Johann then attended secondary school in Leitmeritz (now Litomerice) in Bohemia between 1897 and 1905.
* In 1919 Radon became an extraordinary professor at Hamburg shortly after being promoted to an extraordinary professorship in Vienna in an attempt to keep him there.
* The University of Hamburg was a new university, opening in May 1919 shortly before Radon was appointed on the recommendation of Blaschke.
* Radon had an enjoyable social life in Greifswald; he enjoyed sailing and playing the lute.
* In 1928 Radon moved again, this time to the University of Breslau where he succeeded Adolf Kneser on his retirement.
* After happy times in Greifswald and Erlangen, fate was cruel to Radon in Breslau.
* Radon himself became ill and underwent surgery in 1939; he was recovering in hospital when informed of Hermann's death.
* Radon joined them at Wechselburg where there were no books, lecture notes, or resources of any kind.
* Radon gave a course on complex analysis completely from memory having no materials available to help him.
* Radon applied the calculus of variations to differential geometry which led to applications in number theory.
* It was while he was studying applications of the calculus of variations to differential geometry that he discovered curves which are now named Radon curves.
* Radon had a long association with the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

Born 16 December 1887, Tetschen, Bohemia (now Decin, Czech Republic). Died 25 May 1956, Vienna, Austria.
