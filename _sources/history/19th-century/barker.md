**Thomas Barker **had an outstanding undergraduate career, being Senior Wrangler in the mathematical tripos at Cambridge and 1st Smith's Prizeman in 1862. He went on to play an important role in Owens College, Manchester where he was professor of pure mathematics for twenty years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algebraic method for finding the roots of a quartic equation (1813).
2. Published "Introduction to Differential and Integral Calculus" (1826).
3. Wrote "Elements of Algebra", a two-volume work (1845).
4. Authored "Geometry: A Treatise On Plane And Spherical" (1842).
5. Proposed a practical apparatus for computing derivatives and integrals (1834).
6. Produced an early account of the theory of equations (1839).
7. Proposed the modern concept of a group (1821).
8. Developed a method of continued fractions to evaluate certain infinite series and integrals (1832).
