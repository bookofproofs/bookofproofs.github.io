**Thomas Havelock **was an English applied mathematician, hydrodynamicist and mathematical physicist. He became a professor at the Armstrong College in Durham. He had close contacts with the Department of Naval Architecture for many years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new model of differential equations for the study of fluid and gas dynamics.
2. Discovered the concept of weak solution for the partial differential equations governing dynamic fluid behavior.
3. Discovered the numerical difference approximation to solved partial differential equations.
4. Pioneered the use of computational methods for the study of fluid dynamics, leading the way to modern numerical simulations.
5. Constructed Havelock Solutions to illustrate the behavior of turbulent flows.
6. Made significant advancements in the study of singularity theory, an essential part of modern mathematical analysis.
7. Published several influential papers on mathematical subjects including differential equations, partial differential equations, and boundary value problems.
8. Demonstrated an understanding of the structure and dynamics of physical systems through mathematical models, a technique known as mathematical modeling.

Born 24 June 1877, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, England. Died 1 August 1968, Gosforth, Northumberland, England.
