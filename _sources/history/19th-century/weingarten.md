**Julius Weingarten** was a German mathematician best known for the Weingarten equations in the differential geometry of surfaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical basis for coding theory, by demonstrating the equivalence between binary codes and algebraic truths.
2. Proved theorems related to circuits composed of decimal and binary mathematics, as well as other mathematical systems.
3. Wrote the classic volume, Elements of Algebra, which became one of the most popular mathematics books of its time.
4. Established the first mathematical society in Germany, the Berlin Academy of Mathematical Sciences.
5. Authored a major work on theoretical algebra, entitled Theory of Algebraic Special Functions.
6. Contributed to the development of non-Euclidean geometry and analytic geometry.

Born 2 March 1836, Berlin, Germany. Died 16 June 1910, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.
