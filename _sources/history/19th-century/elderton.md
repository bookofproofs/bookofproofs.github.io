**Ethel Elderton** was a statistician who worked for Francis Galton and Karl Pearson. Although her work was an important contribution applying statistics to social problems, much of it makes difficult reading today because it is written with a eugenic perspective.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* William Elderton had been born in Kendal, Westmorland, but had been brought up in Marylebone, London, where his father Charles Merrick Elderton was a practising barrister.
* William and Sarah Elderton had eight children: Robert Lapidge Elderton (1876-1958); William Palin Elderton (1877-1962); Ethel Mary Elderton (1878-1954, the subject of this biography); Isabel Edith Elderton (1880-1975); Margaret Florence Elderton (1882-1972); Merrick Beaufoy Elderton (1884-1939); Thomas Howard Elderton (1886-1970); and Silvia Ruth Elderton (1888-1972).
* Before was give details of Ethel Elderton's life, let us say a little about her siblings.
* Most of Ethel's brothers had careers involving mathematics: Robert Lapidge Elderton was for many years a member of the staff of the National Provident Institution and an Associate of the Institute of Actuaries; William Palin Elderton became an actuary and was the joint author of a statistics book with his sister Ethel; Thomas Howard Elderton, later Sir Thomas Elderton, K.C.I.E., became Chairman of the Calcutta Port Trust; and Merrick Beaufoy Elderton studied mathematics at Clare College Cambridge and was appointed a mathematics master at Sherborne School.
* Ethel's sisters all became schoolmistresses: Isabel did not marry; Margaret married Robert Kelsall, who had a military career, in December 1918; and Silvia married the schoolmaster Charles Arthur Freer Green in April 1915.
* At the time of the 1881 census, Ethel Elderton is two years old and living at Parsons Green Rectory House, Fulham where her father was running a school with the help of a tutor.
* At the time of the 1891 census, Ethel Elderton is twelve years old and living at 32 Montrell Road, Streatham with her mother, her seven siblings, and two domestic servants.
* Ethel was a pupil at Streatham High School, graduating in 1895 and later that year began her studies at Bedford College, London.
* Harding was still the professor of mathematics at Bedford College when Elderton studied there.
* Alice Lee was Harding's assistant, she taught Elderton and was impressed by her abilities.
* Elderton passed the matriculation examination for the University of London in 1897.
* Although Elderton, having matriculated, was in a position to take a degree she chose not to take a degree becoming a school teacher.
* Elderton's mother and the three oldest girls are all school mistresses, the girls assisting their mother run the school, while Silvia is still studying at school.
* William Palin Elderton is the only one of the children not to be living there.
* Schuster was a student of Professor W F R Weldon, the prime mover in the foundation of the "biometric school." Miss E M Elderton was appointed as an assistant to Schuster and together they made up the staff of the Eugenics Record Office which was under Galton's general oversight.
* In fact Elderton had been recommended by Alice Lee who had taught her at Bedford College.
* On the advice of Dr Alice Lee, he selected Miss Ethel M Elderton - a most happy choice.
* In 1907 Elderton co-authored with Edgar Schuster the paper The Inheritance of Psychical Characters, published in Biometrika.
* One of Elderton's most influential papers was A first study of the influence of parental alcoholism on the physique and ability of the offspring.
* Miss Elderton has spent her time and her manifest skill on material which, it should have been obvious from the beginning, could not repay her.
* It is worth looking at the two different driving forces behind Elderton's work.
* In would appear that Elderton accepted these aims.
* There is, however, some evidence that Elderton may not have totally accepted the aims of eugenics but have been merely following the lead provided by Pearson and Galton.
* The suggestion was taken up by Ethel Elderton and her brother William Palin Elderton, who had also undertaken work for Pearson.
* By March 1909 the Eldertons had essentially completed the text but a title had to be decided on and a publisher found.
* It may indeed be Palin Elderton who was against the eugenics connection, but we suggest that Ethel Elderton, with whom Galton and Pearson were corresponding about publishing the book, must also have taken that view.
* It must have been quite difficult for the Eldertons to argue against Galton, but clearly they did so since the book appeared with the title A Primer of Statistics.
* In 1925 Pearson founded the Annals of Eugenics which he edited with Ethel Elderton's help.
* We should note the high regard that both Pearson and Galton had for Elderton.
* This was awarded to the person who "in the ten years next preceding the date of the award, published the most noteworthy contribution to the development of mathematical or statistical methods applied to problems in Biology." In 1931 Elderton was awarded a D.Sc. by the University of London and, in the same year, was promoted to a readership in the University of London.

Born 31 December 1878, Fulham, London, England. Died 5 May 1954, Stanborough Park, near Watford, Hertfordshire, England.
