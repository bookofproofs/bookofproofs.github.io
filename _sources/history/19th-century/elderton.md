**Ethel Elderton** was a statistician who worked for Francis Galton and Karl Pearson. Although her work was an important contribution applying statistics to social problems, much of it makes difficult reading today because it is written with a eugenic perspective.

Born 31 December 1878 Fulham, London, England. Died 5 May 1954 Stanborough Park, near Watford, Hertfordshire, England.
