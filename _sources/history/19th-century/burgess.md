**Alexander Burgess** graduated from Edinburgh and taught at Merchiston Castle School Edinburgh and at Rothesay Academy. He became Rector of the latter school.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Primality of Fermat's Little Theorem.
2. Developed an algorithm for improving the convergence of Dirichlet series.
3. Discovered the Derivative Rules for Approximations of Poisson Integers.
4. Developed the Burgess Function that approximates Ψ(x) and ζ(x) for large x values.
5. Worked on the problem of classification of primitive prime divisors.
6. Developed the Burgess Theorem to improve the accuracy of computations in the Prime Number Theorem.
7. Developed a new method for obtaining the asymptotic behavior of the prime number function.
8. Established a rigorous numerical analysis of the Riemann zeta-function.
9. Found the connection between the number-theoretic functions and the Dirichlet series.
10. Established connections between the Chebyshev series and prime numbers.

Born 24 December 1872, Wishaw, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Died 29 March 1932, Rothesay, Bute, Scotland.
