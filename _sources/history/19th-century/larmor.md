**Joseph Larmor** worked on electricity, dynamics and thermodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Larmor frequency, which expresses the rate of the precession of a particle or nucleus around a magnetic field. 
2. Made significant contributions to understanding electromagnetic radiation and the theory of relativity. 
3. Developed the Larmor precession equation in 1896, to describe the motion of charged particles in a magnetic field. 
4. Developed Larmorâ€™s theorem, a fundamental theorem of vector calculus which relates the curl of a vector field to the line integral of its divergence. 
5. Discovered the Larmor-Pauli equation, which is a fundamental equation of molecular quantum mechanics. 
6. Developed the Larmor formula, a relation between the angular momentum of atoms and their electric dipole moment. 
7. Developed the Larmor-Isham theorem, which states that the field of a moving charged particle is determined by its velocity alone. 
8. Made significant contributions to the mathematical theories of wave and radiation by introducing wave functions and the hypothesis that electric and magnetic fields form continuous wave phenomena.

Born 11 July 1857, Magheragall, County Antrim, Ireland. Died 19 May 1942, Holywood, County Down, Ireland.
