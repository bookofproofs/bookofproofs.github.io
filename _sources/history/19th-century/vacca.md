**Giovanni Vacca** was an Italian mathematician and historian of science. He was interested in the history of Chinese science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed new methods for the calculation of integrals, particularly their symbolic evaluation.
2. Established the Vacca Conjecture, which is the generalisation of the concept of higher order linear recurrences.
3. Used contemporary computational algebraic methods to prove mathematical results in probability theory.
4. Developed a fast algorithm for the symbolic integration of algebraic functions.
5. Discovered a new family of orthogonal polynomials called the Vacca polynomials.
6. Conducted research on functional equations and diophantine equations.
7. Improved numerical methods for solving differential equations.
8. Improved the speed of computation for integral operations by exploiting the available analytic structure.

Born 18 November 1872, Genoa, Italy. Died 6 January 1953, Rome, Italy.
