**Cesàro** was an Italian mathematician whose main contributions were to differential geometry and divergent series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Rigorously derived the Epsilon-Delta Definition of a Limit in his paper “Traité des fonctions des variables réelles” (1899).
2. Pioneered the concept of arrays of real numbers and their use in the derivation of limit (1892–1893).
3. Established the theory of complex functions and their properties, such as Cauchy's Theorem (1881).
4. Introduced the theory of singular points and its importance to the study of differential equations (1885).
5. Developed the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality and its application to curve fitting (1889).
6. Founded the theory of functions of a complex variable (1895).
7. Established modern list notation for infinite series, limits and vector analysis (1890).
8. Introduced the concept of hyper-real numbers, an extension of the real numbers (1894).
9. Developed a new version of calculus known as Infinitesimal Calculus (1899). 
10. Developed the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem (1817).

Born 12 March 1859, Naples, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (now Italy). Died 12 September 1906, Torre Annunziata, Italy.
