**Amédée Mannheim** was a French mathematician and the inventor of the modern slide rule.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algebraic notation for solving certain equations. 
2. Found a solution to the cubic equation with the help of a single angle. 
3. Extended the theory of partial differential equations and added to their system of notation.
4. Developed a mathematical theory for the description and prediction of the motion of projectiles.
5. Pioneered the algebraic approach to the calculus of successive approximations. 
6. Established the modern rules of mathematical notation.
7. Developed the modular calculus.
8. Discovered the general equation of curves of second order.
9. Formulated the theory of one-to-one transformations.

Born 17 July 1831, Paris, France. Died 11 December 1906, Paris, France.
