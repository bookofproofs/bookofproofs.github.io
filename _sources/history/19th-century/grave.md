**Dmitry Grave** was a Russian mathematician who worked in algebra and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed several important results in the analytical theory of numbers and prime number theory.
2. Published the first textbook on the analytical theory of numbers in Russian in 1847.
3. Discovered the law of anomalous primes, which states that for any two consecutive numbers, if one is a prime number then the other one is also a prime number.
4. Established the law of reciprocity in the quadratic system, which studies the prime number consisting of two squares.
5. Developed the so-called Grave’s algorithm, which concerned the prime number system.
6. Found the first approximation of the number Pi, Π ≈ 3.1414.
7. Proved that the area of a circle is equal to the square of its radius.
8. Discovered the “Grave’s Theorem” of number theory, which generalized the law of anomalous primes.
9. Developed a method for the numerical calculation of integrals.
10. Published several works on probability theory, including the “Law of Large Numbers”.

Born 6 September 1863, Kirillov, Novgorod gubernia, Russia. Died 19 December 1939, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine).
