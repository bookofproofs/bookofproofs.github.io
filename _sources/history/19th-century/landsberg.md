**Georg Landsberg** was a German mathematician, known for his work in the theory of algebraic functions and as a co-author with Kurt Hensel of a classic text on the theory of algebraic functions of one variable.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Bernhard Landsberg was a businessman, but we have not been able to find any further information about him.
* We have, however, found background information about his wife, Philippina, the mother of Georg the subject of this biography.
* Bernhard and Philippina married and had at least two children, Georg, the subject of this biography, and a daughter Regina Landsberg.
* Philippina Landsberg died on 3 January 1898 in Breslau.
* Landsberg attended the St Elisabeth Gymnasium in Breslau.
* New buildings which had been built in the 1830s were being extended while Landsberg was a pupil as the popular school ran out of space.
* When Landsberg began his schooling there the headmaster was Karl Rudolf Fickert (1807-1888).
* Fickert, a classics scholar of high repute, had been headmaster from 1845 but retired in 1880 in the middle of Landsberg's time at the school.
* After completing his studies at the St Elisabeth Gymnasium, Landsberg then studied at the Universities of Breslau and Leipzig between 1883 and 1889.
* In addition to studying mathematics, Landsberg's other main subject at Breslau was physics which he was taught by Oskar Emil Meyer (1834-1909), Felix Auerbach (1856-1933), and Joachim Leonhard Weber (1848-1919).
* Although Landsberg's main topics at Breslau were mathematics and physics, he also studied a wide range of other topics.
* At Breslau, Landsberg also studied astronomy with Johann Gottfried Galle (1812-1910) who had moved to Breslau 1851 as Director of the Observatory, becoming Professor of Astronomy there from 1856.
* Landsberg took a chemistry course with Thomas August Theodor Poleck (1821-1906) who was appointed director of the pharmaceutical institute at the University of Breslau in 1867.
* Landsberg also studied with the biologist Ferdinand Julius Cohn (1828-1898) who worked at Breslau from 1849 until he retired.
* At Leipzig Landsberg took a narrower range of courses all within mathematics and physics.
* The only other lecturer that Landsberg studied with at Leipzig was the physicist Gustav Heinrich Wiedemann (1826-1899).
* Landsberg's doctorate was awarded by the University of Breslau in 1890.
* In 1890 Landsberg went to Berlin where he studied on his own, working towards his habilitation.
* (The house where Landsberg lived had been built around 1850 for the university's first gymnastics teacher, Dr Karl Wassmannsdorff (1821-1906).
* In the rear of the building, when Georg Landsberg was living there, Wassmannsdorff ran a private gym); and 1904, Hauptstrasse 118.
* It was Landsberg who encouraged Nielsen to study the mathematical problems underlying his doctoral dissertation of 1913.
* In a short autobiography appended to the thesis, he expresses his devotion to Landsberg, who had died shortly before.
* Landsberg studied the theory of functions of two variables and also the theory of higher dimensional curves.
* In particular the influence of Dedekind and Weber's 1882 joint article is pervasive throughout the book; Hensel and Landsberg explicitly pointed out the close connections with the theory of algebraic numbers, that had characterised the latest development of the field presented in their book.
* The approach developed by Hensel and Landsberg displays very clearly the close attachment of Dedekind's images of mathematical knowledge to those characteristic of nineteenth-century algebra.
* It was this call to Giessen that prompted the University of Kiel to promote Landsberg to an ordinary professorship.

Born 30 January 1865, Breslau, Prussia (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland). Died 14 September 1912, Kiel, Germany.
