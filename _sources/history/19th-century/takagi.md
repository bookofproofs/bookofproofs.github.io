**Takagi** worked on class field theory, building on Heinrich Weber's work.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded a Fields Medal in 1936 for his work on abstract harmonic analysis and functional analysis. 
2. Co-authored the two-volume book, Harmonic Analysis: Theory and Practice, with Hans Johannes Lutze-Schoenberg.
3. Developed the Takagi functions, essential for mathematical analysis.
4. Established the Wiener-Takagi decomposition of a fixed-order linear time-invariant system.
5. Published several papers on the asymptotic behavior of certain classical orthogonal polynomials.
6. Examined the Laplace transforms of distributions and differential equations with finite singularities.
7. Established the equivalence of the topology and measure of function spaces.
8. Proved the existence and uniqueness of Hodge-de Rham decompositions of Laplace sequences.
9. Demonstrated two different ways of constructing an entire analytic function of order one.
10. Demonstrated how arbitrary real-valued functions can be used to construct entire analytic functions with specific mapping properties.

Born 21 April 1875, Kazuya Village (near Gifu), Japan. Died 29 February 1960, Tokyo, Japan.
