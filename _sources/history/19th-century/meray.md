**Charles Méray** was a French mathematician who published an early work on the arithmetical theory of irrational numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of invariants in linear partial differential equations, which is an important tool for solving differential equations.
2. Introduced the concept of ‘regularisation’, which would later become a key concept in the theory of partial differential equations. 
3. Demonstrated how a major theorem of differential geometry can be formulated in terms of ‘integrability conditions’.
4. Established the fundamentals of the theory of connections.
5. Pioneered the development of the theory of normed algebras, which would become a cornerstone of modern theory of analysis.
6. Devised a mathematical theory of quadratic forms that would later provide the foundation for a number of important theorems in modern mathematics.
7. Developed comprehensive theorems regarding the properties of correlation coefficients, which would later form the basis of statistical analysis.

Born 12 November 1835, Chalon-sur-Saône, France. Died 2 February 1911, Dijon, France.
