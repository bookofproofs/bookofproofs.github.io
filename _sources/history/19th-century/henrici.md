**Olaus  Henrici** was a German mathematician who became a professor in London.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new procedure for determining the area of a triangle and a circle.
2. Formulated a general theory of trigonometric series during his dissertation in 1798.
3. Worked out the formulas for finding the coefficients of trigonometric series through integration.
 4. Proved fundamental theorems in probability and precisely evaluated the Gaussian normal distribution.
5. Developed methods to approximate integrals and calculate the coefficients of Taylor series expansion.
6. Established theorems regarding generalized binomial and hypergeometric series.
7. Applied his mathematical techniques to solve multiple problems related to astronomical observations.

Born 9 March 1840, Meldorf, Holstein (now Germany). Died 10 August 1918, Chandler's Ford, Hampshire, England.
