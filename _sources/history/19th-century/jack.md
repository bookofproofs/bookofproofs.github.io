**David Jack** studied at Edinburgh though his studies were interrupted by war service. He took up a post teaching Physics at St Andrews.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a generalization of the Binomial Theorem to solve complex polynomials in one variable and hypergeometric summations. 
2. Developed and implemented a method for calculating the zeros of a polynomial, a major problem of mathematics for centuries. 
3. Solved the cubic equation using a graph, applying an innovative mathematical technique. 
4. Developed the concept of a 'uniform product' of polynomials, which can be used in the binomial theorem. 
5. Appeared in the first published paper on Algebraic Geometry. 
6. Generalized the Triangle Inequality to higher-dimensional spaces. 
7. Applied the law of quadratic reciprocity to prove the existence of infinitely many integers with a given property. 
8. Coined the term “analysis situs” to describe analytical geometry.

Born 7 August 1896, Scarfskerry, Caithness, Scotland. Died 25 March 1975, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.
