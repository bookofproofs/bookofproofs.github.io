**Leonida Tonelli** was an Italian mathematician who worked on the theory of functions and the calculus of variations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first mathematician to explicitly use the axiomatic method in mathematical analysis. 
2. Tonelli proved the existence of a non-empty convex subset that could be used to prove existence of solutions for certain equations. 
3. He worked on mathematical analysis, the calculus of variations, and partial differential equations.
4. He formulated the Tonelli Theorem, also known as the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem for non-negative measurable functions. 
5. He became an expert in the domain of Fourier series, which resulted in the development of the Tonelli Formula for series expansion. 
6. Tonelli developed the Tonelli Trick and Tonelli Quotient that can be applied in integration techniques. 
7. He worked on the problem of continuity and composed a work of rigorous calculus. 
8. He solved the Plateau problem in 1924 which states that a given surface can be decomposed into a finite number of polygons.

Born 19 April 1885, Gallipoli, Lecce, Italy. Died 12 March 1946, Pisa, Italy.
