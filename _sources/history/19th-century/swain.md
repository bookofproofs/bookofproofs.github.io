**Lorna Mary Swain**  was a British mathematician who was one of few early female lecturers at the University of Cambridge.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):

* Swain's mathematical interests were in fluid dynamics so, as GÃ¶ttingen was out of the question, she went to Manchester to work with Horace Lamb.
* In 1920 Swain was appointed Director of Studies at Newnham College.
* In 1926 Lorna Swain was promoted to College Lecturer and she then had the opportunity to give advanced courses on hydromechanics and dynamics.
