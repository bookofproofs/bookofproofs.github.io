**Fabian Franklin** was a Hungarian born American mathematician who worked on combinatorics. He was married to Christine Ladd-Franklin.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first unified theory of elasticity and plasticity in 1922.
2. Authored several books on topics such as elasticity and mathematics of plastics.
3. Devised and published an analytic criterion for the effects of the stress concentration in 1934.
4. Wrote the first book about engineering problems with an elastic theory and an elastic-plastic theory in 1947.
5. Pioneered the use of torsion and extension as generalized axes of force for such theories.
6. Developed the idea of generalized plasticity, which revolutionized the field of plasticity and continues to be applied in materials engineering today. 
7. As a consultant, compared the effects of circular holes in material plates subjected to bending pressure. 
8. Authored numerous papers related to finite element analysis, plasticity theory, and the analysis of plates and shells. 
9. Developed mathematical theory to solve elasticity problems using complex variables. 
10. Investigated and published the mathematical analysis of plastic flow of metals such as aluminum and steel.

Born 18 January 1853, Eger, Heves County, Hungary. Died 9 January 1939, New York, New York, USA.
