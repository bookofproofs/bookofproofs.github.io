**Raymond Wilder** was an American mathematician who worked in topology as well as producing works on philosophy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed two papers on the subject of differential equations and the calculus of variations
2. Described the Wilder-Hirzebruch formula, a joint result in homotopy theory
3. Proved the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, which showed that the index of a differential operator is a topological invariant
4. Unravelled the mystery of convex integration, a method of establishing the existence of solutions of differential equations
5. Solved a conjecture in smooth four-manifold topology
6. Developed a theory of integration over singular spaces
7. Explained the foundational nature of elliptic cohomology
8. Made lasting contributions to algebraic cobordism
9. Discovered Lagrangian cohomology and used it to solve a major problem in the theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras
10. Wrote a leading textbook on the calculus of variations which revolutionized the study of variational theory

Born 3 November 1896, Palmer, Massachusetts, USA. Died 7 July 1982, Santa Barbara, California, USA.
