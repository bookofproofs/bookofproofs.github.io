**Raymond Wilder** was an American mathematician who worked in topology as well as producing works on philosophy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Music played a large part in the family, and Raymond learnt to play the piano, in particular playing to accompany silent films in local cinemas.
* Wilder then taught mathematics at Brown during 1920-21 while studying for his master's degree in actuarial mathematics which he received in 1921.
* Wilder moved to the University of Texas in 1921 where again he was appointed as an instructor while he worked for his doctorate.
* After Wilder persuaded Moore to let him take the course, Moore proceeded to ignore him until he solved one of the hardest problems Moore posed to the class.
* Wilder gave up his plans to study actuarial mathematics and became Moore's research student.
* He suggested Wilder write up the solution to the problem  for his doctorate which indeed he did, becoming Moore's first Texas doctorate in 1923 with his dissertation Concerning Continuous Curves.
* Wilder's thesis contained a new approach to the Schönflies programme.
* He continued to undertake research with this aim and in 1930, in A converse of the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem in three dimensions, Wilder showed that a subset of Euclidean 3-space whose complementary domains satisfied certain homology conditions was a 2-sphere.
* Wilder's hostility to mindless patriotism and his predilection for liberal thought accompanied him throughout his life.
* The initial phase of Wilder's research on the Schönflies programme, which we described above, was in in set-theoretic topology and lasted until around 1930.
* The final three chapters of the book discuss Wilder's contributions in the theory of positional topological invariants.
* It was around the time that Wilder published the first edition of Topology of Manifolds  that his research interests underwent a major change.
* Wilder's ideas continued to develop along the lines of cultural anthropology.
* In 1981 Wilder published another major text Mathematics as a cultural system  which has a similar title to the talk he gave to the International Congress of Mathematicians thirty years earlier.
* After Wilder retired from the University of Michigan in 1967 he moved to the University of California at Santa Barbara.
* At the time of Wilder's death in Santa Barbara there were 23 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren in his family.
* Wilder contributed much to American mathematics.
* Wilder played a major role in the Mathematical Association of America being its president during 1965-66.

Born 3 November 1896, Palmer, Massachusetts, USA. Died 7 July 1982, Santa Barbara, California, USA.
