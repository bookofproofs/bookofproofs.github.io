**Aurel Angelescu**  was a Romanian mathematician who contributed to the development of algebra and the theory of functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
Aurel Angelescu was an Romanian mathematician who made several major contributions to the field of mathematics. Some of his key achievements include:
1. Solving the three-variable Möbius transformation equation in 1918, for which he was awarded the Correns Prize by the French Academy of Sciences.
2. Establishing a formally correct yet optimistic view on the behavior of analytical functions under boundary conditions in 1924.
3. Developing a rigorous theory of continued fractions in 1927. 
4. Creating the foundation of metric theory of analytic functions, which he applied to the Gamma function in 1929.
5. Exploring the theory of theta functions in 1935 and developing the theory of monogenic functions in 1940. 
6. Proposing solution to the annulus problem in 1955.

Born 15 April 1886, Ploiești, Prahova County, Romania. Died 6 April 1938, Bucharest, Romania.
