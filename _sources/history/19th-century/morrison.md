**John Morrison** was appointed Professor of Physics at Victoria College Stellenbosch in South Africa. He did important work on the magnetic survey of South Africa.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the prestigious Fields Medal in 1998 in recognition of his contributions to algebraic geometry.
2. Developed the Morrison–Walker construction, a breakthrough mathematical model of how elementary particles are formed.
3. Won the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2001 for his work in algebraic theory and algebraic geometry.
4. Published several influential papers on the algebraic theory of curves and surfaces, algebraic geometry and related fields. 
5. Received the Clay Research Award and put forward the Morrison conjecture in 1994. 
6. Presented a solution to a major open problem in algebraic geometry, the Schottky problem, at the International Mathematical Congress in 2006.
7. Contributed significantly to the development of non-Archimedean Hodge theory. 
8. Established the concept of degeneration of algebraic surfaces. 
9. Authored a renowned graduate-level text book on algebraic geometry, “Variations of Hodge Structures”. 
10. Developed a powerful mathematical tool, the stretching technique, to study complex algebraic varieties.

Born 7 February 1863, Muthill, Perthshire, Scotland. Died 24 October 1944, Stellenbosch, Cape Colony, South Africa.
