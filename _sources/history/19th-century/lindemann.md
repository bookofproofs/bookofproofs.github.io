**Ferdinand von Lindemann** was the first to prove that `$\pi$` is transcendental, i.e. `$\pi$` is not the root of any algebraic equation with rational coefficients.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated one of mathematics’ first analytic proofs of the irrationality of π (pi) in 1882.
2. Published the first paper on entirely new and rigorous approach to the field of analytic number theory in 1888.
3. Was the first to suggest the use of prime gap record to prove the existence of infinitely many prime numbers in 1889.
4. Developed a famous result called Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem in 1891, which showed that if a certain transcendental number can be constructed in radicals, then it is actually a logarithm of an algebraic number.
5. Solved in 1884 the hypergeometric differential equation, a special case of the Gauss hypergeometric equation.
6. Proved his famous Lindemann theorem in 1882 which states that Pi is transcendental and cannot be expressed as an algebraic number, meaning it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. 
7. Researched on the transcendence of logarithm of an algebraic, a theoretical proper of algebraic irrational numbers, which he later formulated in his famous paper on the “Transcendence Theory” in 1891.

Born 12 April 1852, Hannover, Hanover (now Germany). Died 6 March 1939, Munich, Germany.
