**George Hill** was an American astronomer and mathematician. who worked on the three-body problem and  later on the four-body problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an improved method for solving the differential equation of spherical harmonics.
2. Developed an expression for the series solution to a wave equation.
3. Proved that a wave equation is solvable using Laplace’s equation.
4. Co-created the Hill–Stewart method for solving partial differential equations.
5. Contributed to the study of the mathematical theory of elasticity.
6. Developed a mathematical model for wave propagation in a waveguide.

Born 3 March 1838, New York, USA. Died 16 April 1914, West Nyack, New York, USA.
