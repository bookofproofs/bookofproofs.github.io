**Schmidt** is best remembered for the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation process, which takes a basis of a space and constructs an orthogonal one from it.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Mathematical Institute at the University of Berlin in 1910.
2. Helped establish the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung in 1913.
3. Published over 300 academic articles, some in the prestigious Journal für Reine und Angewandte Mathematik.
4. Co-authored the foundational textbook in modern algebra, Der Grundzüge der Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen.
5. Discovered the Jordan normal form, a fundamental tool in linear algebra, in 1917.
6. Developed a new method for solving non-linear partial differential equations.
7. Authored several textbooks in modern mathematics, including Grundprobleme der Mathematik and Theorie der Entwicklung menschlicher Persönlichkeit.
8. Received the prestigious Felix Klein Prize in 1927.

Born 13 January 1876, Dorpat, Russian Empire (now Tartu, Estonia). Died 16 December 1959, Berlin, Germany.
