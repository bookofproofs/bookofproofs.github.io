**René Baire** worked on the theory of functions and the concept of a limit.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the modern theory of “measurable functions” in his 1899 book, “Leçons sur Les Fonctions Measurables.” 
2. Pioneered the application of set theory to study the properties of functions in his 1906 book, “Les Fonctions Analytiques.” 
3. Developed the Baire category theorem for proving the existence of functions in 1901. 
4. Was one of the first mathematicians to investigate and apply the axiom of choice in 1912. 
5. Attained the highest rank in the French academic hierarchy, becoming a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor. 
6. Authored over more than 100 mathematical publications, including his 1906 classic “Les Fonctions Analytiques.” 
7. Introduced the concepts of Fraenkel-Mostowski measure and Lebesgue measure in Appendix 5 of his 1903 book, “Calcul des Probabilités.” 
8. In 1922, became the first to be elected to the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction.
