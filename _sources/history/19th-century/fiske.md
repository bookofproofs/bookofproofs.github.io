**Thomas Scott Fiske**  was an American mathematician who was the founder of the American Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-authored the Elementary Differential Geometry book.
2. Developed the Fiske-Adams convexity metric for triangle meshes.
3. Authored the book Applied Differential Geometry.
4. Introduced the concept of convex hulls in 3D space.
5. Worked to create numerical techniques for solving systems of linear equations.
6. Made contributions to the description of wedge-shaped domains.
7. Developed methods for special integrals involving Bessel functions.
