**Thomas Scott Fiske**  was an American mathematician who was the founder of the American Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However, it mentions his father, Thomas Scott Fiske Sr., who was the first son of David Fiske (born 1792) and his first wife Abigail Nourse.
* David and Abigail Fiske married in January 1823.
* David Fiske was a farmer and deacon in the Congregational Church of Amherst.
* Thomas Scott Fiske Sr. (born 22 November 1823) was David and Abigail Fiske's first child.
* Both Thomas Scott Fiske Sr. and Clara Pittman were descended from English families.
* Thomas Scott Fiske Jr, the subject of this biography, had a younger brother James Porter Fiske who was born in New York City on 22 November 1866.
* James Porter Fiske became a surgeon and we shall say a little more about him later in this biography.
* Thomas Scott Fiske Jr attended the Old Trinity Church School in New York City, then the Pingry School in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
* Fiske entered Columbia College in 1882, thirty years before it became Columbia University, receiving his A.B. in 1885 and his A.M. in 1886.
* In 1887, in Fiske's second year of graduate studies, Howard Van Amringe suggested that he should spend at least six months in England at the University of Cambridge.
* With letters addressed to Arthur Cayley, James Glaisher, Andrew Forsyth and George Darwin, Fiske was well placed to take advantage of his time at Cambridge.
* Back in the United States, Fiske completed his research being awarded his doctorate in 1888 after submitting his thesis The Theory of Concomitants of Algebraic Form.
* Fiske is of little importance as a research mathematician.
* Fiske's monograph Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable was published by John Wiley & Sons in 1906.
* Fiske designed the size and colour of the cover to be the same as James Glaisher's Messenger of Mathematics where he had published papers written using the material from his thesis.
* Fiske served the new Society in a variety of ways, for example as secretary from 1888 to 1895, as treasurer from 1890 to 1891, as editor-in-chief of the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society from 1891 to 1899, as vice-president of the Society from 1898 to 1901, as editor of the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society from 1899 to 1905 and as president of the Society from 1903 to 1904.
* On 29 December 1904 Fiske delivered his Presidential Address to the Eleventh Annual Meeting of the American Mathematical Society.
* On 1 February 1913, Fiske married Natalie Page of New York City.
* We promised above to give more details of Fiske's roles both within Columbia University and also broader roles.
* Fiske was teaching two courses: 'Fundamental concepts in mathematics'; and 'Theory of functions'.
* is in part not only a tribute to the mathematical and logical ingenuity of one C S Peirce but to that most enthusiastic promoter of the cause of mathematics, Thomas S Fiske.
* Since the last quarter century has been devoted to adding mathematical and scientific brushstrokes to the Peirce portrait, the writer now recalls with great satisfaction the impact of the Fiske lectures in a graduate course at Columbia University in the mid-twenties.
* In the course of sympathizing with my friend Helen and myself and advising us on a future course of action, Professor Fiske walked us merrily down Broadway to 42nd   Street one evening after class, all the while plying us with fruit from the stands along the line in those different times.
* In 1941, when James Fiske was 74 years old, he was killed in a three car collision while returning from Los Angeles to New York.

Born 12 May 1865, New York, USA. Died 10 January 1944, Poughkeepsie, New York, USA.
