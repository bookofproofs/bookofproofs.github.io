**Carl Runge** worked on a procedure for the numerical solution of algebraic equations and later studied the wavelengths of the spectral lines of elements.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Runge–Kutta method, a numerical technique that is widely used for solving differential equations. 
2. Pioneered the application of calculus of variations in the field of mathematical physics.
3. Co-invented Finite elements, an important method for the numerical solution of partial differential equations.
4. Formulated the quantum theory of collisions between molecules.
5. Constructed the first rigorous proof of the compatibility theory of shell structures.
6. Established the theory of analytic functions.
7. Developed a method of characteristics to solve nonlinear partial differential equations.
8. Pioneered research on the analytic representation of algebraic functions.

Born 30 August 1856, Bremen, Germany. Died 3 January 1927, Göttingen, Germany.
