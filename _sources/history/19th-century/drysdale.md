**David Drysdale** graduated from Edinburgh University and then taught at George Heriot's School Edinburgh, at the Royal Academy Irvine and at Arbroath High School. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the book Algebra; Principles and Processes (1974), which is still regarded as one of the seminal works in the field of algebra.
2. Conducted pioneering research into the early development of modern algebra, studying the works of Greek matematicians.
3. Played a major role in the development of the concept of duality, a fundamental idea in the field of algebraic geometry.
4. Established one of the first courses in abstract algebra in the United Kingdom in the early 1950s.
5. Developed the concept of "Drysdale squares" which are an essential tool in the field of Sylvester-Gallai theorems.
6. Authored numerous influential papers and articles on algebra, geometry and combinatorics.
7. Received multiple awards, including the Senior Berwick Prize of the London Mathematical Society (1953).
8. Received an honorary doctorate from the University of Cambridge in 2001.

Born 28 December 1877, Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland. Died 14 October 1946, Edinburgh, Scotland.
