**Ladislaus Bortkiewicz**  was a Russian economist and statistician. He made contributions to mathematical economics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Bortkiewicz developed a mathematical theory of the law of small numbers and a law of large numbers.
2. He introduced the method of moments for the fitting of statistical distributions, and applied statistical methods to experiments on the passage of electric current through partially heated and cooled cathodes.
3. He developed a mathematical foundation for the correlation coefficient, which is now known as the Pearson correlation coefficient.
4. His work laid the foundation for modern probability theory and led to more accurate models of many phenomena.
5. He established a model of how statistical data should be collected, an early example of statistical data validation.
6. Bortkiewicz developed a statistical model of change in the size of bills of exchange before their maturity that is still in use today.
7. He applied statistical methods to the study of economic data, paving the way for the emergence of econometrics in the 20th century.
8. Bortkiewicz was a leading figure in bridging the gap between mathematical and economic approaches in the sciences.

Born 7 August 1868, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 15 July 1931, Berlin, Germany.
