**Ladislaus Bortkiewicz**  was a Russian economist and statistician. He made contributions to mathematical economics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Joseph Bortkiewicz came from the Russian nobility.
* Ladislaus certainly was influenced by his father's academic interests.
* Bortkiewicz studied law at St Petersburg, graduating in 1890 and then went on to study political economy and statistics for a year of postgraduate work.
* Bortkiewicz became an ordinary professor of statistics and political economy at the University of Berlin in 1920 and he spent the rest of his life there.
* An unfortunate argument with an Italian statistician Gini, who accused Bortkiewicz of plagiarism, led to an unhappy episode near the end of Bortkiewicz's life.
* Bortkiewicz worked on mathematical statistics and applications to actuarial science and political economy.
* Bortkiewicz was interested in the law of small numbers and he used the divergence coefficient Q, deducing its expectation and standard deviation.
* We also mentioned that Bortkiewicz worked on political economy.
* Other areas to which Bortkiewicz applied his statistical methods include radioactivity (1913), order statistics, and applications to legal studies.
* Bortkiewicz was critical of the approach of Karl Pearson to statistics.
* This, claimed Bortkiewicz, was worthless.
* Bortkiewicz does not get any less obscure as he goes on.
* Bortkiewicz received many honours including membership of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Royal Statistical Society, the American Statistical Association and the International Statistical Institute.
