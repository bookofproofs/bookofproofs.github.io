**Sofia Kovalevskaya** was a Russian born mathematician who made valuable contributions to the theory of differential equations. She finished her career in Sweden.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. She was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics from a European university.
2. She won the Beckman prize from the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1888, becoming the first female laureate of the Academy.
3.She was the first woman to receive a full professorship in modern Europe (at the University of Stockholm).
4. She was the first to generate and research the theory of partial differential equations.
5. She was the first to develop and make significant contributions to the theories of analytic mechanics and topology.
6. She was the first to solve the problem of the rotation of a solid body around a fixed point, known as the “Kovalesky-Kowalewski theorem”.
7. She was the first to develop and publish a well-known theorem on the dynamics of Saturn’s rings.
8. She authored a number of papers on mathematics and mechanics, establishing her as a prominent figure in the field.

Born 15 January 1850, Moscow, Russia. Died 10 February 1891, Stockholm, Sweden.
