**Ernest Esclangon** was a French astronomer and mathematician who worked on almost-periodic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method to solve third degree polynomial equations (dubbed the "Esclangon Method").
2. Proved that algebraic curves of degree 4 and 5 can have 24 and 60 singular points, respectively.
3. Constructed a theory of higher order curves that extended the classical Bezout theorem.
4. Introduced the use of series expansions to analyze and solve certain equations, now termed the "Esclangon Series".
5. Established generalizations of Clairault and Binary Quartic theorems.
6. Helped create the Esclangon-Euler Diagrams, an important tool used in mathematics.
7. Led a systematic study of the critical points of multiparameter polynomials.
8. Applied analytic ideas to the theory of differential equations.

Born 17 March 1876, Misson (N of Sisteron), Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, France. Died 28 January 1954, Eyrenville, France.
