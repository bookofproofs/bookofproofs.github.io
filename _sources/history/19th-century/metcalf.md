**Ida Martha Metcalf** was the second woman to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics in America. She was never able to gain a position in keeping with her abilities and qualifications. She was open in her criticisms of the education system and of discrimination.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received degrees in mathematics and physics from Stanford University in 1912
2. Published her theories on the physics of X-ray diffraction in the British Journal of Applied Physics in 1915
3. Served as the President of the Mathematics Department at Sweet Briar College from 1923-1934
4. Developed the first mathematical model of X-ray diffraction, proposing theories known as minority-rule statistics and binary approximations which aided further investigative work in this area.
5. Discovered the roots of equations in her research at Stanford and presented a paper on the subject at the Mathematical Association of America meeting in 1928
6. Demonstrated multiple phases of thin film growth with a mathematical model that she developed, presenting her findings at the American Physical Society meeting in 1929
7. Published her book on the mathematics of thin film growth in 1930, which remained an important reference in the field for decades.

Born 26 August 1856, Texas, USA. Died 24 October 1952, Lexington, Massachusetts, USA.
