**Pierre Fatou**  was a French mathematician and astronomer who worked in several branches of analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of generalized iterated functions, an extension of the traditional iterated function system used to define fractal-like objects.
2. Formulated the idea of infinitely many iterations of a given object in an infinite sequence, which laid the foundations for the study of dynamical systems.
3. Proved the existence of the iteration process independently of recursion theory, which enabled a more broad application by other areas of mathematics.
4. Discovered the ubiquity of periodic points in dynamical systems and developed a theory of the dynamics of the iteration process.
5. Demonstrated the rationality of certain probability functions in the iteration process, providing the first set of mathematical tools necessary to analyze the phenomenon of chaos.
6. Demonstrated the existence and structure of attractors in dynamic systems, objects of extreme interest in the recent development of chaos and complexity theory.
7. Authored the landmark 1925 paper on the iteration of polynomial functions and the 1924 paper introducing the concept of the Julia set.

Born 28 February 1878, Lorient, France. Died 9 August 1929, Pornichet, France.
