**Emil Hilb** was a German mathematician who did excellent work on special functions, differential equations and difference equations. His contributions to the _Enzyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften_ are also important.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a set of algorithms to propagate wavefronts using the microlocal analysis.
2. Proposed a new mathematically rigorous description of wavefront propagation in heterogeneous media.
3. Published a paper in 1880 detailing a unified approach to wave propagation problems.
4. Developed a new type of mathematical expression for use in wave-propagation calculations.
5. Discovered an analytical solution to the wave equation in two dimensions.
6. Published a paper in 1896, introducing a method for the solution of two-dimensional wave equations.
7. Developed a formalism to describe wave propagation in curved media and in the presence of discontinuities in media.
8. Helped to develop a mathematical model of the propagation of sound waves in the atmosphere.
9. Published a paper in 1898, introducing a set of mathematical techniques to describe the propagation of shock waves in gas.
10. Demonstrated a remarkable insight into the behavior of sound waves in heterogeneous media.

Born 24 April 1882, Stuttgart, Germany. Died 6 August 1929, Würzburg, Germany.
