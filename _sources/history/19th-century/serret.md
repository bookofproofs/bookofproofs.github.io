**Joseph Serret** was a French mathematician best remembered for the Serret-Frenet formulas for a space-curve.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered and proved a version of the Cauchy-Riemann differential equations, which showed a fundamental connection between complex analysis and calculus.
2. Wrote influential textbooks on topics in calculus and analytic geometry.
3. Published important papers on mathematical topics such as differential equations, higher algebra, and higher geometry.
4. Proved that the tangent line at a given point on an algebraic curve is determined by the equation of the curve.
5. Was among the first to apply calculus to solve problems in physics and astronomy such as the problem of calculating the moon's orbit around the Earth.
6. Showed that the apsidal precession (the change in the orientation of an orbital ellipse as it rotates around its focus as time passes) is consistent with the principle of energy conservation.
7. Contributed to the development of differential geometry.
8. Used the theory of curves to study the motion of a planet under an inverse-square law of attraction.

Born 30 August 1819, Paris, France. Died 2 March 1885, Versailles, France.
