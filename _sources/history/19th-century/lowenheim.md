**Leopold Löwenheim** was a German mathematician who worked on mathematical logic and is best-known for the Löwenheim-Skolem paradox.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first axiomatic system of set theory in 1908.
2. Introduced a method of constructing truth tables which has revolutionized logic and set theory.
3. Proved the theorem of Löwenheim–Skolem, a major result in first-order logic.
4. Pioneered the use of the notion of variable range in symbolic logic.
5. Discovered the Löwenheim–Mostowski theorem.
6. Formulated the “Fundamental Theorem of Logic”.
7. Extended the notion of induction to the non-finite setting.
8. Proved the theorem of Löwenheim–Skolem–Tarski and confirmed the impossibility of certain deductions within the system. 
9. Helped to develop the theory of quantification in the early part of the 20th century.
10. Produced the important work “Mathematical Logic” in 1912.

Born 26 June 1878, Krefeld, German. Died 5 May 1957, Berlin, Germany.
