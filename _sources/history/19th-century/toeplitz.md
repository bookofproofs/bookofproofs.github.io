**Toeplitz** worked on infinite linear and quadratic forms. In the 1930's he developed a general theory of infinite dimensional spaces and criticised Banach's work as being too abstract.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of integral equations in 1904 and established a theory of positive linear operators.
2. Established the theory of mathematical transformation groups, now known as Toeplitz groups, in 1907.
3. Established the branch of mathematics called functional analysis in 1910.
4. Discovered the theorems of ideal theory in 1912.
5. Developed the field of integral equations in 1920 and extended it to the theory of integral operators and linear functionals.
6. Published the seminal book on “Integral Equations” in 1932.
7. Was among the first to develop the theories for deductive approximation in the 1940s.
8. Devised the recursive algorithm for the inversion of Toeplitz matrices in the 1950s.
9. Developed a unified theory of stable polynomials in 1965.
10. Co-developed the theory of shifted Toeplitz operators with K. Tedford in the 1990s.

Born 1 August 1881, Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 15 February 1940, Jerusalem (under the British Mandate at the time).
