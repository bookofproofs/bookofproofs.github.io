**Ada Lovelace** was a daughter of Lord Byron who became interested in Babbage's analytic engine and described how it could be programmed.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ada's parents married on 2 January 1815 but separated on 16 January 1816, a month after she was born.
* On 25 April 1816 Lord Byron went abroad and Ada never saw her father again.
* Lord Byron never returned to England and died in Greece when Ada was eight years old.
* Lady Byron was given sole custody of her daughter Ada, who was declared a Ward in Chancery in April 1817, and she tried to do everything possible in bring up her child to ensure that she would not become a poet like her father.
* Lady Byron had been interested in the study of mathematics herself.
* Given this mathematical frame of mind, which Lord Byron clearly did not share, it was natural that Lady Byron should try to encourage Ada in that direction.
* Music, Lady Byron believed, was a topic that provided a girl with the right social skills so this was also emphasised in Ada's education.
* However although Lady Byron devoted much energy to organise Ada's upbringing she herself seems to have spent very little time with her.
* The grandmother that Lord Byron refers to in this quote was Lady Noel, Lady Byron's mother, who was indeed much more in daily contact with Ada than was her mother.
* A number of tutors were employed, often for only a short period, to direct Ada's education.
* At age about six she had a Miss Lamont as a tutor and, despite her mother's emphasis on mathematics, Ada's favourite subject was geography while arithmetic she only studied reluctantly in order to please her mother.
* On discovering that Ada preferred geography to arithmetic, Lady Byron insisted that one of Ada's geography lessons be replaced by an arithmetic lesson and shortly after this Miss Lamont was replaced as Ada's tutor.
* Some members of the family feared that Lady Byron was insisting that her daughter be driven too hard.
* Lady Byron ignored the family concerns and kept a constant pressure on her daughter to work hard and long at her lessons.
* Ada's mathematical education was undertaken by a number of private tutors.
* William Frend, who had tutored Lady Byron in mathematics, was involved in Ada's mathematical education but by this time he was an old man who had not kept pace with mathematical developments.
* Dr William King was also engaged as a tutor to Ada in 1829 but his interest in mathematics was not very deep and he confessed that he had studied mathematics by reading it rather than by doing it.
* We say King "the tutor" since by 1834 there was a second William King in Ada Byron's life, namely the man she would marry in the following year.
* Returning to the tutors Lady Byron employed to teach the thirteen year old Ada we might also mention Miss Arabella Lawrence who Lady Byron instructed to change Ada's "argumentative disposition".
* Few can have done more to mould the character of their child than Lady Byron did! The young Ada, however, had long suffered some health problems and in 1829 contracted measles from which she took a long while to recover.
* In 1833 Ada Byron was presented at court and, on the 5 June that year, she met Charles Babbage at a party.
* Two weeks later Ada and her mother visited Babbage's London studio where the Difference Engine was on display.
* Ada Byron enjoyed attending mathematics and scientific demonstrations with Mary Somerville, but she also enjoyed her company on other occasions.
* Ada King became Countess of Lovelace when her husband William King, whom she married on 8 July 1835, was created an Earl in 1838.
* They had three children; Byron born 12 May 1836, Annabella born 22 September 1837 and Ralph Gordon born 2 July 1839.
* As we mentioned above, in 1833 Ada Byron (as she still was at that time) had become interested in Babbage's analytic engine and, ten years later, she produced an annotated translation of Menabrea's Notions sur la machine analytique de Charles Babbage (1842).
* In the annotations, which were called "Notes", Ada Lovelace described how the Analytical Engine could be programmed and gave what many consider to be the first ever computer program.
* Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.
* Perhaps had her husband been a stronger personality, particularly had he been able to match her intellectual abilities, some of the problems might have been avoided, for it was Lady Byron who dominated the whole family.
* However around 1850 Lovelace fell out with her mother, almost certainly when she discovered that for years her mother had lied to her about her father Lord Byron.
* Lady Byron had tried all her life to make sure her daughter was as different from Lord Byron as possible and eventually Lovelace discovered the extent of her mother's manipulation.
* In 1852, when only 37 years of age, Ada died of cancer.

Born 10 December 1815, Piccadilly, Middlesex (now in London), England. Died 27 November 1852, Marylebone, London, England.
