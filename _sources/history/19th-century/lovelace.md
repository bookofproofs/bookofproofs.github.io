**Ada Lovelace** was a daughter of Lord Byron who became interested in Babbage's analytic engine and described how it could be programmed.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. First published computer algorithm in 1843
2. Pioneer in the development of the Analytical Engine
3. Introduced the mathematical concepts of looping and iteration into programming
4. Developed a system for classifying analytic functions
5. Devised the method of tabulating polynomial functions
6. Invented the first software compiler and developed the first computer language
7. Used computational methods to analyze Bernoulli numbers and other mathematical functions

Born 10 December 1815, Piccadilly, Middlesex (now in London), England. Died 27 November 1852, Marylebone, London, England.
