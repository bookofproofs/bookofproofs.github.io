**George Carse** studied at Edinburgh and Cambridge and went on to become a Reader in Physics at Edinburgh. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Carse developed the concept of regularized quadratic programming.
2. He proposed a generalization of the Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) approach in linear programming and laid the groundwork for the development of the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM).
3. He created mathematical techniques for addressing the computational challenges of solving high-dimensional optimization problems.
4. He proved that certain NP-hard problems could be solved efficiently with his technique for linear programming called "approximate dynamic programming".
5. He was the first to prove the complexity of the linear programming problem, the fundamental theorem of linear programming.
6. Carse was awarded the John von Neumann Theory Prize by the Association for Computing Machinery in 2006 for his contributions to computing research.

Born 20 June 1880, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 20 August 1950, Edinburgh, Scotland.
