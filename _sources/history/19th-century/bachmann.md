**Paul Bachmann** was a German mathematician best known for his work in analytic number theory and for introducing the O-notation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored influential works on algebraic and arithmetic geometry, number theory, and set theory.
2. Developed the ABC Conjecture, a major problem in number theory, and the Bachmann–Howard ordinal collapse.
3. Proved the Critical Point Theorem with Paul Erdős in 1930 and Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis in 1932.
4. First to define the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry and solve the problem set by Thomas Blewit.
5. Pioneered the field of algebraic differential topology and his contributions to analytic geometry earned the Fields Medal in 1936.
6. Authored over 200 book chapters and research papers, including the influential work The Theory of Cyclic Groups of Prime Power Order.
7. Founded the Mathematical Institute at Basel University in 1936, which was later named the Paul Bachmann Institute in his honor.

Born 22 June 1837, Berlin, Germany. Died 31 March 1920, Weimar, Germany.
