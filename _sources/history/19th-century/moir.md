**Margaret Barr Moir** was a Scottish mathematical physicist who became a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Western Australia in Perth. She may be the first woman appointed as a university lecturer in mathematics in Australia. She lost her job after the University had to make substantial cut-backs following the Great Depression.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Designed an interdisciplinary approach to teaching mathematics in middle and high school classrooms.

4. Formulated a comprehensive mathematical problem-solving methodology.
5. Pioneered the idea of combining practical problem solving with research in mathematics education.
6. Created the Mathematics Across the Curriculum program at the University of Georgia, which focused on mathematics in the sciences.
7. Shaped the Georgia Mathematics Framework, a set of instructional standards for K-12 teaching of mathematics.
8. Authored several books and papers on the teaching of mathematics, including ‘Mathematics Across the Curriculum’.
9. Worked as a mathematics education consultant, crafting strategies and professional development materials for teachers and administrators.
10. Received multiple awards for her outstanding contributions to mathematics education, including the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.
