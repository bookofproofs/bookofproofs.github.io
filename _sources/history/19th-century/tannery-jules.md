**Jules Tannery** was a French mathematician whose main contributions were to the history and philosophy of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Delphin and Opportune Tannery had three children, the eldest being a daughter while the second oldest was Paul Tannery and Jules was the youngest.
* Delphin Tannery's job with the railways involved him moving around the country depending on where railways were being constructed.

* At Caen Jules proved himself to be a truly outstanding pupil, winning prizes and delighting his parents who were very keen to see their sons achieve great things with their education.
* Completing his secondary education in 1866, Tannery sat the entrance examinations in science for both the École Normale Supérieur and the École Polytechnique.
* Graduating in 1869 and placed top of among all the graduates in that year, Tannery became a mathematics teacher at the Lycée in Rennes, then in 1871 he moved to teach the Lycée at Caen.

* In 1872 Tannery returned to Paris and began teaching at the École Normale Supérieur.
* Tannery was an outstanding teacher of mathematics and he taught at a number of different establishments.
* Tannery played an important role in the pedagogical reforms in France at the beginning of the twentieth century.
* Through his lectures and supervisory duties at the École Normale this gifted teacher gave valuable guidance to many students and inspired a number of them to seek careers in science (for example, Paul Painlevé, Jules Drach, and Émile Borel).
* Tannery worked on Galois' notes and letters.
* Jules made an eloquent speech of dedication.
* It is worth noting that Tannery had been an editor of the Bulletin des Sciences Mathématiques since 1876 and he continued in that role until his death.
* Tannery made an impressive contribution to the Bulletin, writing large numbers of reviews.
