**Hermann Laurent** was a Luxembourg mathematician and statistician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Hermann's paternal grandparents were Jean Baptiste Laurent, who owned a small farm, and Marie-Jeanne Maistre.
* The second of Jean and Marie's four children was Augustin Laurent, who in later life always signed himself Auguste.
* When Hermann Laurent was born his father was the professor of chemistry at the University of Bordeaux, a position he had taken up in early 1839 having been appointed on 30 November 1838.
* Hermann Laurent was born at the home of his mother's parents in Luxembourg.
* At this time the Laurent family were awarded a state pension, and Hermann was sent to study first at the École Polytechnique in Paris and then at the École d'Application at Metz.
* Laurent, as a former military man, returned to active service to fight for his country against the Prussians.
* Laurent resigned from military service and took up his post again as répétiteur at the École Polytechnique.
* In 1871 Laurent was appointed as an actuary for the Compagnie d'Assurance de l'Union.
* Laurent did this in 1895 when he published Traité d'arithmétique under the names of two of his friends C A Laisant and E Lemoine.
* For non-integral nnn, however, one obtains a branch point and it was Laurent who overcame this difficulty in 1884 by choosing an open circuit called the 'Laurent loop'.
* Laurent married Berthe Moutard in 1874.
* Particularly given the topics on which Laurent worked, it is easy to assume that Laurent series must be named after him.
* However this is not the case and Laurent series are in fact named after Pierre Laurent.

Born 2 September 1841, Echternach, Luxembourg. Died 19 February 1908, Paris, France.
