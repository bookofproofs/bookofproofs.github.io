**Hermann Laurent** was a Luxembourg mathematician and statistician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for classifying the convergence and divergence of sequences of real numbers. 
2. Provided a framework for the development of calculus of transformations. 
3. Defined the differential of a function as the sum of infinitesimal changes that occur when a parameter is varied an infinitely small amount. 
4. Explored properties of analytic geometry and complex numbers. 
5. Developed a proof for the Cauchy-Riemann condition for differentiable functions of a complex variable. 
6. Derived a formula for determining the area embedded in a curve. 
7. Proved the Laurent series theorem for power series with rational exponents. 
8. Published works on the theory of partial differential equations, Fourier series, and singular points in power series.

Born 2 September 1841, Echternach, Luxembourg. Died 19 February 1908, Paris, France.
