**Hermann Laurent** was a Luxembourg mathematician and statistician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Hermann's paternal grandparents were Jean Baptiste Laurent, who owned a small farm, and Marie-Jeanne Maistre.
* Laurent, as a former military man, returned to active service to fight for his country against the Prussians.
* Laurent resigned from military service and took up his post again as répétiteur at the École Polytechnique.
* In 1871 Laurent was appointed as an actuary for the Compagnie d'Assurance de l'Union.
* Laurent did this in 1895 when he published Traité d'arithmétique under the names of two of his friends C A Laisant and E Lemoine.
* For non-integral nnn, however, one obtains a branch point and it was Laurent who overcame this difficulty in 1884 by choosing an open circuit called the 'Laurent loop'.
* Particularly given the topics on which Laurent worked, it is easy to assume that Laurent series must be named after him.
* However this is not the case and Laurent series are in fact named after Pierre Laurent.

Born 2 September 1841, Echternach, Luxembourg. Died 19 February 1908, Paris, France.
