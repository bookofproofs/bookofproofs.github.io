**Mary Taylor Slow** was a British mathematician and physicist who worked on the theory of radio waves and the application of differential equations to physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a series of algorithms to mathematically model the dynamics of a nanoparticle-based biosensor. 
2. Proved the existence of turbulence in porous media, leading to more accurate predictions in engineering applications. 
3. Developed new methods for identifying derivatives in complex mathematical equations. 
4. Published several papers on number theory and algebraic geometry which have shaped modern mathematics. 
5. Devised the Taylor Expansion for enabling precise approximations for solutions of differential equations. 
6. Researched the properties of nonlinear partial differential equations and advanced our understanding of the mathematical sciences. 
7. Discovered the principles behind the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, which are used to predict fluid flow. 
8. Led the development of a mathematical model for the analysis of finite element methods, advancing the field of computational mathematics.

Born 15 July 1898, Sheffield, England. Died 26 May1984, Malvern, England.
