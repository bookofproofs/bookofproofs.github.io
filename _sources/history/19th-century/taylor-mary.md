**Mary Taylor Slow** was a British mathematician and physicist who worked on the theory of radio waves and the application of differential equations to physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* John Edward Taylor (1856-1932) studied at the University of London and was awarded an M.A., a B.Sc., an a B.D. (Hons).
* Mary attended Pomona Street Elementary School in Sheffield before continuing her education at Sheffield High School.
* Taylor was awarded a BA by Cambridge in 1919, having studied both the Mathematical Tripos and the Natural Science Tripos.
* As well as teaching mathematics, Taylor became interested in the theory of radio waves and began research on the topic under the direction of Edward Appleton who was at this time working at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge.
* Taylor left Cambridge and went to GÃ¶ttingen in Germany where she continued to study aspects of electromagnetic waves.
* Taylor returned to England in 1929 and was appointed as a Scientific Officer at the Radio Research Station in Slough, Berkshire.
* Mary Slow then taught mathematics in local schools, in particular Worcester Grammar School for Girls, and Lawnside, Malvern.
* He set about educating himself and was rewarded with a London B.Sc. (external) and then found his first job at the Slough Radio Research Station, where his work with Watson-Watt and Wilkins drew him into the radar story, and provided him with a wife, Dr Mary Taylor, a brilliant mathematician.

Born 15 July 1898, Sheffield, England. Died 26 May 1984, Malvern, England.
