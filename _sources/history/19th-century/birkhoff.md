**George Birkhoff** was an American mathematician who was educated at Chicago and Harvard. He became a Professor at Harvard. His most important work was the Ergodic Theorem he discovered in 1931.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the basic foundations of what later became known as ergodic theory.
2. Developed the concept of polynomial algebras.
3. Used algebraic techniques to link measure and topology.
4. Discovered entropy, a measure of disorder in terms of probabilities that is applied to various systems in a wide range of scientific disciplines.
5. Formulated the definition of a lattice of subgroups, leading to significant advances in the study of Abstract Algebra.
6. Founded the school of algebraic topology.
7. Coined the term ‘chromatic number’ which is now used in graph theory in the description of a graph’s coloring.
8. Developed the topological Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem.
9. Produced important contributions to the study of differential equations.
10. Pioneered the study of nonlinear mechanics.

Born 21 March 1884, Overisel, Michigan, USA. Died 12 November 1944, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
