**George Halsted** was an American mathematician who explored foundations of geometry and introduced non-Euclidean geometry into the United States. He was interested in mathematical education and in the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. George Halsted is considered to be the "father of modern algebra" as his work on matrices and determinants established principles that are still used today.
2. He wrote a trio of papers in the late 1880s that set forth his views on linear algebra, called the "Trinity of Algebra." 
3. He established a basic algebraic structure known as Halstedâ€™s matrices which was the foundation for modern matrix theory.
4. He developed the notion of a linear transformation and introduced the concept of a minimal polynomial for matrices.
5. He was a pioneer in the area of non-commutative algebra and introduced the idea of a non-commutative ring.
6. He introduced the concept of Puiseux series and pioneered the study of quaternions. 
7. He also developed the theory of linear congruences and established the concept of a ring.
8. He wrote several influential books, including A Treatise on Elementary Algebra and Treatise on Linear Algebra.

Born 23 November 1853, Newark, New Jersey, USA. Died 16 March 1922, New York, USA.
