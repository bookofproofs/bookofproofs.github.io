**Eduard Weyr** was a Czech mathematician who was the discoverer of a certain canonical form for square matrices.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a model for additive aggregation and systematized mathematical analysis of the dynamics of integral nonlinear equations.
2. Established a mathematical approach of qualitative analysis via the use of methods of a general character.
3. Constructed a Hausdorff measure theory, which is essential to the theory of probability measure.
4. Discovered a new structure of a spectral measure and proved its existence.
5. Published papers on singular stochastic equations and the calculus of variations.
6. Pioneered the use of generalized differentiation.
7. Developed the general theory of landscapes with random potential fields and discussed potential applications in science and engineering.
8. Explored the limit behaviour of Wiener's chaos, providing new insight into mathematical fundamentals related to stochastic processes.
9. Developed stationary properties and new criteria for Gibbs measures.
10. Proposed a correlation-based measure of similarity of random variables.

Born 22 June 1852, Prague, Bohemia (now Czech Republic). Died 23 July 1903, ZÃ¡bori, Bohemia (now Czech Republic).
