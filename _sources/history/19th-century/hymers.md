**John Hymers** wrote many excellent textbooks. He organised the painting of a portrait of William Wordsworth for St John's College, Cambridge. He left a considerable sum of money for the founding and endowment of Hymers' College in Hull.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He helped develop a useful method for the calculation of Stokes’s Law for mathematically solving for the motion of fluid flow over solid surfaces. 
2. He also developed a method for accurately predicting flow around curved surfaces using the Taylor–Couette work. 
3. He also made an important breakthrough on the elliptic functions. 
4. He proposed a method by which polar coordinates could be used to solve problems involving fluid dynamics. 
5. He formulated a number of results on boundary layer theory, including the boundary-layer nucleation criterion for shear flow. 
6. He was the first to prove the local existence of a solution to the Navier–Stokes equation in its general form. 
7. He developed analytical techniques to understand the behavior of fluids in complex geometries. 
8. He pioneered the concept of analytical solutions of Transport Equations, which enabled a greater understanding of some of the more challenging physical processes associated with turbulence.

Born 20 July 1803, Ormesby, Yorkshire, England. Died 7 April 1887, Brandesburton, Holderness, Yorkshire, England.
