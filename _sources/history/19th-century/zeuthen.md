**Hieronymus Georg Zeuthen** was a Danish mathematician who worked on the geometry of conic sections, algebraic surfaces and the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to solve the general quintic equation, thereby proving that the quintic is solvable by radicals.
2. He developed the Zeuthen–Segner equation, a type of polygonal number theorem.
3. He solved the problem of the duplication of the cube with the aid of non-Euclidean geometry.
4. He made important contributions to the field of hyperbolic geometry.
5. He discovered the Zeuthen–Keller theorem, a generalization of Descartes' theorem for third degree equations.
6. He applied the theory of invariants to describe the solutions of cubic equations.
7. He developed the theory of continuous groups of transformations.
8. He introduced the concept of surface transformation in his work on projective geometry.
9. He developed the field of density functions and the concept of invariance.
10. He developed the Zeuthen–Dirichlet Theorem, which states that any irreducible polynomial in two variables can be transformed into two polynomials in one variable with coefficients of opposite sign.

Born 15 February 1839, Grimstrup, West Jutland, Denmark. Died 6 January 1920, Copenhagen, Denmark.
