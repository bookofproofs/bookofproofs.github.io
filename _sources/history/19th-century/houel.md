**Jules Hoüel** was a French mathematician who publicised non-Euclidean geometry. He also worked on mathematical astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed various theories on invariants and covariants, in particular associative and commutative algebras.
2. Established new concepts such as the notion of an algebraic function and the basis for the study of ideal theory in algebraic geometry.
3. Provided a comprehensive treatment of the theory of ordinary differential equations in his work 'Théorie des Fonctions d’Une Variable Complexe'.
4. Authored a treatise on the mathematics of mechanics, 'Theory of Differential Equations'.
5. Contributed to the foundation of analytical geometry and the development of theories revolving around projective geometry.
6. Developed the Bézout theorem, which is an important result concerning the number of solutions to a system of two polynomial equations.
7. Pioneered the use of non-standard analysis in analyzing the foundations of calculus.

Born 7 April 1823, Thaon, Calvados, France. Died 14 June 1886, Périers sur le Dan (near Caen), France.
