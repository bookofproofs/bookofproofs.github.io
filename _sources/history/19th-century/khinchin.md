**Aleksandr Yakovlevich Khinchin** was a Russian mathematician who contributed to many fields including number theory and probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed and proposed the theory of linear forms, a central result in the mathematical theory of probability.
2. Wrote influential works on measure theory, including the book "Mathematical Foundations of Probability Theory".
3. Provided an exact formulation of the law of large numbers, which is fundamental in probability theory.
4. Developed the Khinchin axioms, which characterize the values of certain sums in probability theory.
5. Estimated the speed of convergence in the central limit theorem, known as the Khinchin theorem.
6. Introduced the concept of entropy as a measure of information in probability theory.
7. Discovered the theory of pair correlation of arithmetical functions and developed an asymptotic formula for estimating the number of prime numbers.
8. Showed that certain sum of an arithmetic function could be reduced to one sum over primes at most of the same order, known as the Khinchin–Lévy theorem.
9. Established the Gauss–Kuzmin–Wirsing theorem from which many other arithmetic results eventually flowed.

Born 19 July 1894, Kondrovo, Kaluzhskaya guberniya, Russia. Died 18 November 1959, Moscow, USSR.
