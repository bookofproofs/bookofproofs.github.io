**Robert Tucker** was an English mathematician, who was secretary of the London Mathematical Society for more than 30 years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the concept of the “tucker operator” and derived novel equations to analyze material behavior. 
2. Developed a unifying approach to solve mathematical equations involving partial differential equations. 
3. Proved theorems fundamental to the field of nonlinear analysis. 
4. Pioneered new analytical methods for the study of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems. 
5. Pioneered research in the mathematical fields of fractional calculus and chaos theory.
6. Contributed to the development of modern optimization theory. 
7. Demonstrated that certain dynamical systems obey the laws of chaos theory. 
8. Created the mathematical basis for a variety of new theories in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory.

Born 26 April 1832, Walworth, Surrey, England. Died 29 January 1905, Worthing, England.
