**George Gibson** graduated from Glasgow University and went on to become Professor there. He published several important textbooks and was an enthusiast for the History of Mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Robert Gibson had taught himself Latin to be able to carry out research for a book he wrote on the history of Greenlaw.
* George attended the Free Church School in Greenlaw until he was sixteen years old when he matriculated at the University of Glasgow.
* Because of his health problems, Gibson only took an ordinary degree rather than an honours degree.
* Gibson remained an Assistant until 1891 when a new Ordinance came into force which meant that from November of that year he became a Lecturer in Mathematics.
* In 1895 Gibson was appointed as professor of mathematics at the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College (now Strathclyde University).
* In 1909 Gibson was named professor at Glasgow University where he succeeded William Jack.
* He was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 2 December 1889 having been proposed by Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), William Jack, Sir Thomas Muir, and George Chrystal.
* After Gibson's death his friends raised funds to endow a lecture on the history of mathematics, to be given about every four years.

Born 19 April 1858, Greenlaw, Berwickshire, Scotland. Died 1 April 1930, Glasgow, Scotland.
