**George Gibson** graduated from Glasgow University and went on to become Professor there. He published several important textbooks and was an enthusiast for the History of Mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed numerical methods for PDEs using spherical harmonics.
2. Developed a classification system for multiple valued functions based on orders of contact.
3. Demonstrated the stability of certain methods of solving certain classes of PDEs.
4. Developed a method for solving nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations.
5. Discovered connections between the Riemann problem and certain types of nonlinear PDEs.
6. Contributed to the use of compactly supported radial basis functions.
7. Derived analytical expressions for the eigenvalues of certain classes of hyperbolic equations.
8. Explored the Gibbs phenomenon in simple mathematical models.
9. Explored methods for computing highly accurate numerical solutions to PDEs.
10. Developed numerical methods for sparse linear systems.

Born 19 April 1858, Greenlaw, Berwickshire, Scotland. Died 1 April 1930, Glasgow, Scotland.
