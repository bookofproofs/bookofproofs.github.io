**Hendrik  Kramers** was a Dutch physicist who worked with Niels Bohr to understand how electromagnetic waves interact with matter.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of renormalization group which changed the way physicists think about interactions between particles by showing that small effects at the atomic level could cause large changes in the behavior of larger systems.
2. Published the book: "The Quantum Theory of Radiation" which is considered one of the most important books in the field of quantum mechanics.
3. Developed an effective field theory to describe the behavior of nuclei by using the Quantum Boltzmann equation, which is used in nuclear physics today.
4. Developed a new mathematical approach to statistical mechanics, known as Kramers-Kr\"{o}nig relations, which allowed physicists to calculate thermodynamic properties of gases, solids and liquids.
5. Pioneered the use of transfer matrix methods to solve dynamical problems in quantum chemistry.
6. Made significant advances to the understanding of wave propagation in materials with inhomogeneous properties.
7. Demonstrated how transformation theory can be used to understand collective oscillations in a crystal lattice.
8. Developed further mathematical theory of electro-acoustic phenomena in materials, leading to a better understanding of optical phenomena and laser light propagation.

Born 17 December 1894, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Died 24 April 1952, Oegstgeest, The Netherlands.
