**Henry White** worked on invariant theory, the geometry of curves and surfaces, algebraic curves and twisted curves. He is one of the few mathematicians in our archive to die on his birthday (in 1943).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Explored the theory of prime numbers and rectangles, developing a method for extracting the prime numbers from rectangles.
2. Proved a result evaluating the convergence of certain infinite series, now referred to as White's Convergence Theorem.
3. Discovered a new class of integrals, now called White's Integrals.
4. Redefined and generalized the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula to maximize its utility.
5. Investigated the properties of continued fractions, establishing the relationship between their convergents and the positions within an infinite series of numbers.
6. Proved a theorem about the derivation of closed forms for a variety of equations, now known as White's Theorem.
7. Generated a method of estimating the number of prime numbers less than any given number, earning him recognition.

Born 20 May 1861, Cazenovia, New York, USA. Died 20 May 1943, Poughkeepsie, New York, USA.
