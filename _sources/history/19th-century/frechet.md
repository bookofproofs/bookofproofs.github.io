**Maurice Fréchet** was a French mathematician who made major contributions to the topology of point sets and defined and founded the theory of abstract spaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the concept of metric spaces in 1906.
2. Developed the theory of abstract topological spaces in 1906-1910. 
3. Established the notion of the abstract linear space (alternatively known as the Fréchet space) in 1906.
4. Coined the word “matroid” in 1935.
5. Discovered connections between measure theory and topology in the 1920s.
6. Demonstrated the existence of a “normal family” of analytic functions in 1909. 
7. Achieved notable breakthroughs in probability theory in 1903.
8. Was the first to define “differentiables” in 1906.
9. Implemented the first use of integrals depending on parameters in 1918.
10. Published the first work on mathematical cartography in 1915.

Born 2 September 1878, Maligny, Yonne, Bourgogne, France. Died 4 June 1973, Paris, France.
