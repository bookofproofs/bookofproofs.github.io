**Niels Abel** was a Norwegian mathematician who proved the impossibility of solving algebraically the general equation of the fifth degree.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a continued fraction method for solving higher polynomials.
2. Showed that algebraic equations of degree greater than 4 cannot be solved using radicals.
3. Made important contributions to the theory of elliptic functions.
4. Was one of the first to prove the impossibility of a general algebraic solution to the quintic equation.
5. Developed Abel’s theorem, which is used to calculate the number of integral solutions of Diophantine equations.
6. Proved Euler’s second theorem for power series.
7. Developed the Abel-Ruffini Theorem, which states that for equations of fifth or higher degree there is no algebraic solution.
8. Proved the binomial theorem to a much higher power than was previously known.
9. Found a solution to the special case of the general quintic equation.
10. Proved the impossibility of algebraic solutions in a geometric fashion.

Born 5 August 1802, Frindöe (near Stavanger), Norway. Died 6 April 1829, Froland, Norway.
