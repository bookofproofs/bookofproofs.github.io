**Louis Bachelier** was a French mathematician who is credited with being the first person to model the stochastic process now called Brownian motion.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the first mathematical theory of financial speculation, known as the “theory of speculation”.
2. Developed the mathematical framework for evaluating option prices in 1900.
3. Developed the “random walk” theory of stock market behavior, suggesting that stock prices follow a random path.
4. First to present Brownian motion as a mathematical concept, and the first to provide a mathematical interpretation of the phenomenon.
5. Developed the concept of “expectations,” which he used to explain stock market behavior.
6. Formulated the Law of Iterated Logarithms, which is an expression of the normal distribution.

Born 11 March 1870, Le Havre, France. Died 26 April 1946, St-Servan-sur-Mer, France.
