**Robert Fricke** was a German mathematician who worked in complex analysis, especially on elliptic, modular and automorphic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Robert Fricke pioneered the advancement of geometric algebra, specifically non-Euclidean Geometry. 
2. He was the first to unify complex and hypercomplex numbers, allowing them to be represented by numbers and symbols with real components.
3. He also led research into the classification of algebraic and non-Euclidean geometries, leading to the groundbreaking Fricke-Lindemann theorem.
4. Fricke also developed the innovative symbolical structure of relativistic machines, allowing mathematicians to represent the non-Euclidean geometries of the new special relativity.
5. He provided insight into the theory of affine connection, the link between nonsymmetric fields and geometrical space-time.
6. He was instrumental in the development of two-dimensional differential geometry, in particular a study of quadric surfaces.
7. Fricke also made breakthroughs in his research on the concept of a Riemannian manifold. 
8. He is credited with being the first to introduce the idea of a metric tensor as a linear mathematical tool for manipulating two-dimensional spaces.

Born 24 September 1861, Helmstedt, Germany. Died 18 July 1930, Bad Harzburg, Germany.
