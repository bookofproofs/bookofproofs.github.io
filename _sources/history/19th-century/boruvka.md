**Otakar Boruvka** was a Czech mathematician known for his work in graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to prove the existence of MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) in 1926.
2. He developed a method in 1934 for finding the least line segments that could connect all of a given set of points. 
3. In 1945, he introduced the disjoint-set data structure that is used in the Kruskal's algorithm for shortest-path problems. 
4. He contributed the original proof of the Tutte-Berge formula for calculating the number of spanning trees in a graph.
5. He developed a method (the Borůvka's algorithm) in 1926 for quickly solving certain optimization problems involving the joining of subsets. 
6. He was a key figure in the development of abstract theory of graphs.

Born 10 May 1899, Uhersky Ostroh, Austria-Hungary (now Czech Republic). Died 22 July 1995, Brno, Czech Republic.
