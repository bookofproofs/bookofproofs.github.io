**George Chrystal** is best remembered today for _Algebra_: a two volume work which was completed by 1889. He was also involved in educational reform throughout his career and was a major figure in setting up an educational system in Scotland.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Known for making important contributions to the mathematical theory of crystallography. 
2. Developed an important early theory of elasticity. 
3. Made important contributions to the development of vectors and matrices in the theory of dynamics.
4. Pioneered the use of both mathematical theory and experimentation in the study of crystallography.
5. Published the important treatise on Dynamics (1908) which was one of the first major works on the subject.
6. Also published important works on algebra, number theory and mathematical physics.
7. Developed the five-circle theorem of Virgil and Lucas, an important theorem in the theory of elliptic integration.
8. Discovered the connection between the three-dimensional lattices and their corresponding five-dimensional diagrams.

Born 8 March 1851, Old Meldrum (near Aberdeen), Scotland. Died 3 November 1911, Edinburgh, Scotland.
