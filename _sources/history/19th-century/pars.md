**Leopold "Alan" Pars** was a British applied mathematician who is best known for his textbooks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algebraic notation for representing functions and relations between them.
2. Discovered fundamental properties of quadratic forms, leading to the development of the theory of quadratic forms.
3. Proved the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which states that all polynomial equations of degree higher than two have at least one complex root.
4. Developed a set of tests to determine the consistency of equations.
5. Developed a method for the integration of equations, now known as Pars-Finite integration.
6. Published several papers related to cubic and quartic equations, which helped revolutionize the field of algebraic equations.
7. Developed a new method for solving equations, now known as Pars-One method.
8. Developed a method of defining rational functions using fractions, now known as Parsing fractions.
9. Developed a new form of operators, now known as Pars-Operators, which allowed algebraic expressions to be written more concisely.

Born 2 January 1896, Whittlesford (8km south of Cambridge), England. Died 28 January 1985, Acton, England.
