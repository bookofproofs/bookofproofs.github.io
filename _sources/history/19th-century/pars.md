**Leopold "Alan" Pars** was a British applied mathematician who is best known for his textbooks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Although we shall call him "Pars" through most of this biography, nevertheless we shall sometime refer to him as "Leopold" and on the odd occasion as "Alan".
* Leopold was educated at Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith where, in addition to his academic work, he took part in sport, particularly in athletics.
* Despite his ill health, Pars continued to take part in athletic events at University and won the Mile in the inter-University sports.
* Alan, as Pars became known when he was an undergraduate, then took a London University M.Sc. and, in 1921, he was the First Smith's Prizeman at Cambridge.
* Pars's first publications, influenced by Larmor and Eddington, were on relativity and were part of his prize essay.
* We have mention above some of Pars' interests outside mathematics such as mountaineering anf the theatre.

Born 2 January 1896, Whittlesford (8km south of Cambridge), England. Died 28 January 1985, Acton, England.
