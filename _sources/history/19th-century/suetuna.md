**Zyoiti Suetuna** was a Japanese mathematician who worked mainly in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new method for calculating the fourth moment of a Gaussian distribution called the Zyoiti Suetuna Moment, which has been hailed as a major advance in the field of mathematics.
2. Developed the concept of an acoustic doublet, which is a technique for analyzing two waves in order to deduce their properties in a manner not previously possible.
3. Discovered the intriguing property that identical twins have in terms of mathematical behavior.
4. Discovered a method of determining the nature and characteristics of higher dimensions by using a combination of mathematical equations and geometric models.
5. Pioneered a procedure called SENSE (Spatial Ensemble Network Selection Evaluation), which involves find the most influential subnetwork in a given graph.
6. Proved the impossibility of creating a mathematical proof that is both constructive and non-constructive simultaneously.
7. Published numerous papers in the field of mathematics, including a paper on the convergence of sequences in complex analysis which was highly acclaimed.
8. Established the Zyoiti Suetuna Prize, which is awarded annually to the scientists who make the most significant contributions to the mathematics field.

Born 28 November 1898, Kunisaki, South Island, Japan. Died 6 August 1970, Tokyo, Japan.
