**Charles Peirce** was an eccentric American mathematician whose most important work was on philosophy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed the algebra of logic, a branch of mathematics and logic, in which he formulated the laws of thought and inference and foreshadowed the later developments in mathematical logic. 
2. He invented the graphic representation of a logical inference, now known as Peirce diagrams.
3. Peirce developed a universal language for the study of reasoning and inference, which he called “Existential Graphs”.
4. He was responsible for the development of perceptualism, and argued that logic should be grounded in human experience, rather than in abstract principles.
5. He wrote a series of works on induction, probability, and abduction.
6. He contributed to the field of mathematics by creating a mathematical formula for determining the probability of an event; this formula became known as the Peirce coefficient.
7. He was involved in the Arithmetica project which aimed at producing a simplified notation for computation. 
8. Peirce proposed a new geometry based on his new "absolute" approach to mathematics and philosophy.

Born 10 September 1839, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Died 19 April 1914, Milford, Pennsylvania, USA.
