**Anton Davidoglu** was a Romanian mathematician who studied for his doctorate in Paris. He was the founder of the Academy of Advanced Commercial and Industrial Studies in Bucharest, and laid the foundations of mathematical education of economists in Romania.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the existence of an arithmetic hierarchy of infinite order. 
2. Developed a theory of bilinear mappings which was used to provide an axiomatic foundation for the theory of scalar extensions of fields. 
3. Established the completeness of the theory of the real numbers with respect to the theory of elementary functions. 
4. Proved that every continuous function from a compact set K to its continuous image K' is the restriction of a single analytic function. 
5. Implemented the abstract theory of ideals for Noetherian rings.
6. Developed a theory of general rings of residue classes of polynomials, which was the basis for Hilbert's theory of the Hilbert syzygies. 
7. Developed a fundamental theorem which states that every ideal of an arbitrary commutative ring is the intersection of finitely many prime ideals. 
8. Developed an algebraic characterization of the Jacobian of a mapping from a compact manifold to a compact manifold. 
9. Established several theorems which provided the basis for modern algebraic number theory, including the Lagrange theorem of integers and the prime ideal theorem. 
10. Formulated a generalization of Cauchy's theorem which stated that any continuous function f on a compact set K must be the restriction of a single analytic function F.

Born 30 June 1876, BÃ¢rlad, Vaslui County, Romania. Died 27 May 1958, Bucharest, Romania.
