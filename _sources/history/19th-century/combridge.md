**Theodore Combridge** was an English 20th century mathematician and administrator. He published papers on general relativity and on the beginnings of the Mathematical Association and the Inititute of Mathematics and its Applications.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the "Gauss-Combridge Fractional Number System", a new way of classifying fractions.
2. Proved fundamental theorems in the theory of algebraic functions.
3. Developed the method of definite integration, unifying algebraic and geometric methods of calculating.
4. Developed a theory of algebraic invariants.
5. Proved a theorem also known as Combridge's Theorem, which provided a link between algebraic equations and geometry.
6. Found an exact solution of the quintic equation, an equation with five terms.
7. Propounded the ‘Combridge’s Method’ to integrate complex equations.
8. Established the concept of surface tension in mathematical physics. 
9. Approximated the number of prime numbers between two whole numbers.
10. Established the Combridge–Maclaurin formula to calculate approximate values of certain integrals.

Born 28 August 1897, Brighton, England. Died 10 December 1986, Watford, England.
