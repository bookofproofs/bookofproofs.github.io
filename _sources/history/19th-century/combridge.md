**Theodore Combridge** was an English 20th century mathematician and administrator. He published papers on general relativity and on the beginnings of the Mathematical Association and the Inititute of Mathematics and its Applications.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Daniel Thomas Combridge was baptised on 16 March 1828 in Mayfield, Sussex, England.
* In 1912 Combridge entered Brighton College.
* Combridge continued his studies at King's College London in 1922 where his studies were supervised by George Barker Jeffery.
* Combridge worked on the theory of relativity and was awarded the degree of Master of Science in 1924.
* Let us return to giving details of Combridge's career.
* Before the mid thirties only the senior members of the mathematics department had much time for research and junior members like Combridge carried a heavy teaching load.
* However Combridge remained interested in the subject and corresponded extensively with Eddington, an association begun when Combridge was an undergraduate at Cambridge.
* To cite only a few other activities, there was the work of the Schools and Industry Committee of the Association, forward-looking and seminal, and led so effectively by J T Combridge.
* During his time as President of the Mathematical Association, Combridge was much involved in the setting up of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications.
* During his involvement with the Mathematical Association, Combridge wrote a number of papers of teaching mathematics.
* Combridge never wrote this paper because of his move into administration.
* In the event Combridge was disappointed (twice) over the Secretary's post but this was never allowed to affect for a moment his loyalty to the college or his energetic service.
* The year 1986 saw Winifred's and Theodore's deaths, hers on 23 October and his on 10 December.

Born 28 August 1897, Brighton, England. Died 10 December 1986, Watford, England.
