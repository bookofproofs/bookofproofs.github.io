**Theodore Combridge** was an English 20th century mathematician and administrator. He published papers on general relativity and on the beginnings of the Mathematical Association and the Inititute of Mathematics and its Applications.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The first surprise from these dates is that Daniel Combridge was 69 years old when his son was born, so we need a few details to put this into context.
* Daniel Thomas Combridge was baptised on 16 March 1828 in Mayfield, Sussex, England.
* Daniel and Rhoda Combridge had one child, John Theodore Combridge, the subject of this biography, born at 5 Leopold Road, Brighton.
* Theodore, who is three years old and listed as John T Combridge, is there with his father and mother, and 34-year old Samuel Combridge, a bookseller and stationer, who is one of Daniel Combridge's sons from his second marriage.
* In 1912 Combridge entered Brighton College.
* Combridge continued his studies at King's College London in 1922 where his studies were supervised by George Barker Jeffery.
* Combridge worked on the theory of relativity and was awarded the degree of Master of Science in 1924.
* Let us return to giving details of Combridge's career.
* Before the mid thirties only the senior members of the mathematics department had much time for research and junior members like Combridge carried a heavy teaching load.
* However Combridge remained interested in the subject and corresponded extensively with Eddington, an association begun when Combridge was an undergraduate at Cambridge.
* On 30 December 1926, Combridge married Norah Elizabeth Charlwood (1894-1966), the daughter of the dairyman Ernest Percy Charlwood (1868-1946) and Maud Mary Cridland (1866-1939).
* Theodore and Norah Combridge had three children.
* To cite only a few other activities, there was the work of the Schools and Industry Committee of the Association, forward-looking and seminal, and led so effectively by J T Combridge.
* During his time as President of the Mathematical Association, Combridge was much involved in the setting up of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications.
* Mr Combridge would like the book to be read by four classes of people: parents who want to know what this "new mathematics" is doing for their children; teachers, particularly those who may be called upon to teach mathematics on a somewhat slender qualification; managers in commerce and industry who have a vague feeling that modern mathematics may have something to offer them; the ordinary citizen who, as Sir John Newsom says in his foreword, has to live "in a world whose situations and problems cannot even be described (not to say understood and tackled) without both numeracy and literacy".
* During his involvement with the Mathematical Association, Combridge wrote a number of papers of teaching mathematics.
* Exactly why Combridge moved into administration is unclear.
* Combridge never wrote this paper because of his move into administration.
* In the event Combridge was disappointed (twice) over the Secretary's post but this was never allowed to affect for a moment his loyalty to the college or his energetic service.
* Combridge retired from his position at King's College in 1962 and his wife Norah died on 28 December 1966.
* Combridge married Winifred Adelaide Cooke (1905-1986) on 22 April 1972 at Eton, Buckinghamshire.
* Both Combridge and his wife were elected honorary members of the Mathematical Association, Theodore at the 1967 AGM, Winifred at the 1971 AGM.
* The year 1986 saw Winifred's and Theodore's deaths, hers on 23 October and his on 10 December.

Born 28 August 1897, Brighton, England. Died 10 December 1986, Watford, England.
