5. Helped establish the first ever Applied Statistics Field Station at the Australian National University in 1958.
6. Developed a new computational scheme for Monte Carlo integration (1966). 
7. Published a book, titled "Methods of Statistical Analysis" (1968), which became a standard reference in the field.
