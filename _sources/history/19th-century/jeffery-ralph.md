**Ralph Jeffery** was a Canadian mathematician who worked on analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Frank Jeffery was a fisherman.
* We have reached Jeffery's university education without mentioning mathematics.
* This may not seem like a particularly good foundation for research in mathematics, but Jeffery had come to love the subject so much that he went to Cornell University to undertake graduate studies.
* At this point Jeffery had not completed his doctorate so, in 1928, he returned to Cornell University to finish off his work.
* Before he submitted his thesis, Jeffery was publishing papers such as Definite integrals containing a parameter  and The Continuity of a Function Defined by a Definite Integral, the latter being in the American Mathematical Monthly.
* Jeffery remained at Acadia University until 1942, except for one year which he spent as acting as Head of Mathematics at the University of Saskatchewan in 1938.
* The Mathematics Department at Queen's was fairly small with seven faculty members when Jeffery became Head.
* Queen's University honoured Jeffery's outstanding contribution by naming a new building, built between 1967 and 1969 to house the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, as Jeffery Hall.
* An important book which Jeffery published in 1951 was The Theory of Functions of a Real Variable.
* Jeffery was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1937 and latter served as its President.
* Jeffery received many honours for his outstanding work in encouraging mathematical research in Canada.
* The Canadian Mathematical Society honoured him by setting up the Jeffery-Williams Prize to recognize mathematicians who have made outstanding contributions to mathematical research.
* In 1956 Nellie Jeffery died.

Born 3 October 1889, Overton, Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, Canada. Died 1975, Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada.
