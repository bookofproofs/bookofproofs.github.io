**Félix Tisserand** was a French astronomer who updated Laplace's standard work.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In his doctoral thesis, written in 1868, Tisserand extended Delaunay's work on the three-body problem on the orbit of the Moon.
* Tisserand was then appointed as an assistant-astronomer at the Paris Observatory.
* Tisserand showed remarkable abilities in his work at the Observatory and it was clear that he would soon achieve an elevated position in the world of astronomy.
* In 1873 Tisserand was appointed director of the Toulouse Observatory to succeed Daguin, a post which he held for five years.
* At the Toulouse Observatory Tisserand appointed two young astronomers, Joseph Perrotin and Guillaume Bigourdan, to help him in his observational work.
* Neither were experienced in astronomy but Tisserand had made two good choices for he soon trained the young men to become astronomers of outstanding qualities.
* Tisserand did not spend the whole of his five years as director in Toulouse.
* A transit of Venus is when the planet passed in front of the disc of the sun as viewed from the Earth and Tisserand took a year to make the journey to Japan, make his observations, and return to France.
* After Tisserand returned to France and took over again as director of the Observatory in Toulouse he had a new instrument installed.
* Tisserand decided to undertake a programme of measurement of the separation of binary stars, but he discovered that the micrometer used for such measurements did not work.
* Tisserand took over the task of completing this major work and arranged for its publication.
* Tisserand is especially remembered for his four volume textbook which is an update of Laplace's work.

Born 13 January 1845, Nuits-St-Georges, Côte-d'Or, France. Died 20 October 1896, Paris, France.
