**Félix Tisserand** was a French astronomer who updated Laplace's standard work.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
Félix Tisserand was a French mathematician, who worked in the 19th century. He is well-known for his highly influential works, which enhanced the field of mathematical analysis.

1. Developed a theorem showing that the sum of two divergent series may be convergent.
2. Established the concept of continuity for functions of a single real variable.
3. Discovered the condition for a continually differentiable function to be an analytic function.
4. Solved the Dirichlet problem for elliptic equations in three dimensions.
5. Established the Tisserand criterion for determining whether a function is entire or not.
6. Developed the concept of almost periodic functions.
7. Collated and cataloged all the known tables of exponential and logarithmic functions.
8. Proved the Tisserand series expansion of the inverse of a Laplace Transform.
9. Formulated the Tisserand principle under which a differential equation can have a unique solution.
10. Found a way to predict the growth of a polynomial.

Born 13 January 1845, Nuits-St-Georges, Côte-d'Or, France. Died 20 October 1896, Paris, France.
