**Antoine Cournot** was a French mathematician who was a pioneer of mathematical economics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed one of the earliest applications of mathematical analysis in economics, which is now known as the Cournot–Nash equilibrium.
2. Formulated the theory of duopoly which explains how two competing firms might operate in a market.
3. Developed a mathematical approach to marginal cost and presented it in his work “Recherches sur les principes matématiques de la théorie des richesses”.
4. Coined the notion of “opportunity cost”, which is now recognized as a major element of economic theory.
5. Pioneered the concept of suboptimization as an economic tool, which is now widely used by economists.
6. Established key mathematical methods to carry out different economic activities such as cost calculation and pricing.
7. Advanced the idea of maximization of profits and how to calculate them from the viewpoint of a firm.
8. Proposed the mathematically derived identity of demand curves and cost curves, known as the Cournot’s law.

Born 28 August 1801, Gray, Haute-Saône, Franche-Comté, France. Died 31 March 1877, Paris, France.
