**Hilda Geiringer** was an Austrian-born mathematician who worked in Statistics and Mechanics. She was married to Richard von Mises.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was a Jewish family which would later have a significant effect on Hilda's life.
* At Gymnasium Hilda showed great mathematical ability and her parents supported her financially so that she could study mathematics at the University of Vienna.
* After receiving her first degree, Geiringer continued her study of mathematics at Vienna, working under Wirtinger for her doctorate.
* In 1921 Geiringer moved to Berlin where she was employed as an assistant to von Mises in the Institute of Applied Mathematics.
* In this same year she married Félix Pollaczek who, like Geiringer, had been born in Vienna into a Jewish family but had studied in Berlin.
* Hilda and Félix had a child, Magda Pollaczek, in 1922 but their marriage broke up.
* After the divorce Geiringer continued working for von Mises and at the same time brought up her child on her own.
* Although trained as a pure mathematician, Geiringer moved towards applied mathematics to fit in with the work being undertaken at the Institute of Applied Mathematics.
* The debate over Geiringer's theses for Habilitation opens up a chapter of the history of mathematical statistics, namely, expansions of a discrete distribution with an infinite number of values in a series in successive derivatives of the Poisson distribution with respect to the parameter.
* Under this law, Geiringer lost the right to teach at the university in December 1933.
* Geiringer left Germany after she was dismissed from the University of Berlin and, together with her child, she went to Brussels.
* Von Mises, though a convert to Catholicism from Judaism, left Germany at the very end of 1933 to take up a newly founded chair of mathematics in Istanbul and, in 1934, Geiringer followed him to Istanbul.
* Despite the obvious difficulties associated with this exile - for example, she had to learn Turkish in order to give her lectures - Geiringer continued to pursue her mathematical interests, particularly in plasticity.
* Again of course, Geiringer had to learn another language in order to teach.
* In addition to her lecturing duties at Bryn Mawr College, Geiringer undertook classified work for the National Research Council as part of the war effort.
* Neyman, who himself had emigrated to the United States, wrote a report on Geiringer in April 1940, shortly after she arrived from Turkey.
* and Mrs Geiringer does not belong in this category.
* Geiringer married von Mises in 1943 and the following year she left her lecturing post at Bryn Mawr College to be nearer to him.
* There were only two members of the mathematics faculty at Wheaton College and Geiringer longed for a situation where she was among mathematicians who were carrying out research.
* For Geiringer who had been so discriminated against in Germany because of her Jewish background, to now be discriminated against because she was a woman must have been a difficult blow.
* In 1953 von Mises died and the following year Geiringer, although retaining her job at Wheaton College, began to work at Harvard on editing von Mises' works.

Born 28 September 1893, Vienna, Austria. Died 22 March 1973, Santa Barbara, California, USA.
