**Hilda Geiringer** was an Austrian-born mathematician who worked in Statistics and Mechanics. She was married to Richard von Mises.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Served as one of the first ten women to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Vienna in 1923.
2. Appointed to the Institute of Technology in Berlin in 1931, becoming the first female professor in Germany ever.
3. Pioneered the field of applied mathematics with her work at the Institute of Technology, establishing the Erlangen School of Applied Mathematics.
4. Published two algebra textbooks (Elements of Algebra: A Textbook for the Use of High School and Elementary College Students, 1941; and The Theory of Groups and Its Applications, 1942).
5. Developed the Geiringer Method for calculating the probability of a system failure, laying the groundwork for reliability analysis and helping to spawn the entire field of system reliability engineering.
6. Co-authored the book Theory of Schrodinger Operators in 1976.
7. Discovered the element beryllium using X-ray spectroscopy in 1933.

Born 28 September 1893, Vienna, Austria. Died 22 March 1973, Santa Barbara, California, USA.
