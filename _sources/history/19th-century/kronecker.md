**Leopold Kronecker**'s primary contributions were in the theory of equations. He made major contributions in elliptic functions and the theory of algebraic numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new approach to mathematical proof and collaboration with mathematician Richard Dedekind.
2. Introduced algebraic formulations of real numbers and their use to create the concept of order of infinity.
3. Developed a theory of the division of prime numbers into ideal classes.
4. Founded the modern theory of algebraic numbers and laid the foundations for its arithmetic.
5. Proposed Kronecker's theorem, an important theorem in linear algebra.
6. Developed an analytic theory of algebraic functions.
7. Established the foundations of higher algebra and its application to number theory.
8. Discovered the law of permanence of algebraic equations, a basic principle for algebraic equations.
9. Introduced Kronecker's congruence, a theorem which is still used today in algebraic number theory and cryptography.
10. Formulated the Kronecker–Weber theorem which is used in algebraic number theory.

Born 7 December 1823, Liegnitz, Prussia (now Legnica, Poland). Died 29 December 1891, Berlin, Germany.
