**Henri Fehr** was a Swiss mathematician and educationalist who founded two Swiss journals and worked for the improvement of mathematical education.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Several years in the early 1950s, Fehr made tremendous advances in the fields of algebraic number theory and abelian varieties.
2. He was one of the first to apply algebraic techniques to the study of discrete subgroups of Lie Groups.
3. He also introduced an analytic method of studying lattices in the space of homogeneous functions.
4. He introduced a new approach to the arithmetic of congruences, which enabled him to give an exact answer to a question long debated in algebraic number theory.
5. Fehr developed a sophisticated theory of integral solutions of diagonal equations over finite fields.
6. Fehr was also a pioneer in the area of arithmetical geometry.
7. He constructed a huge variety of examples of diophantine equations and conjectured a general form of the solution of such equations.
8. He initiated and developed a large body of research into additive problems in the Galois fields.
9. He was one of the first to apply large sieve methods in number theory.
10. He made key contributions to the theory of quadratic forms and higher degree forms.

Born 2 February 1870, Zurich, Switzerland. Died 2 November 1954, Geneva, Switzerland.
