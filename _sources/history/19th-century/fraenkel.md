**Abraham Fraenkel** was a German-born  mathematician who made contributions to axiomatic set theory. He is the **F** in the **ZFC** axioms for set theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Devised a method for constructing models of set theory, which facilitated a deeper understanding of the mathematical concept of infinity.
2. Pioneered a systematic approach to axiomatic set theory.
3. Founded the modern axiomatization of infinite set theory.
4. Published a foundational paper on mathematical logic, in the area of axiomatics, which remains a standard reference in set theory today.
5. Pioneered and advanced the approach to measure theory of functions.
6. Developed the concept of automorphic functions and Ramanujan tau functions.
7. Contributed to the study of transcendental numbers and algebraic equations.
8. Achieved the solution of the continuum hypothesis in set theory.
9. Co-authored a definitive work on abstract set theory, entitled "Grundlagen der Mengenlehre" (Foundations of Set Theory).

Born 17 February 1891, Munich, Germany. Died 15 October 1965, Jerusalem, Israel.
