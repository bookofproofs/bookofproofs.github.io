**Hausdorff** worked in topology creating a theory of topological and metric spaces. He also worked in set theory and introduced the concept of a partially ordered set.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He made fundamental contributions to topology, set theory, measure theory and descriptive set theory, 
2. He developed the concept of ordered sets, 
3. He was the first to introduce the notion of a topological space, 
4. He developed the Hausdorff metric,
5. He constructed the concept of a measure space,
6. He was one of the first to propose notions related to game theory and motivated the study of transfinite numbers,
7. He created the notion of ordinal and cardinal numbers,
8. He formulated the notion of a paracompact space, 
9. He developed the Hausdorff-Young inequality, 
10. He proposed the concept of local connectedness in topology.

Born 8 November 1868, Breslau, Prussia (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland). Died 26 January 1942, Bonn, Germany.
