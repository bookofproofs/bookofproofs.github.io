**Heinrich Scholz**  was a German logician, philosopher and theologian.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Heinrich Scholz developed the modern theory of algebraic function fields, which are part of Number Theory.
2. He worked on the problem of ideal theory in Number Theory, which was a major advance in mathematics at the time.
3. He contributed to the theories of linear algebra, commutative algebra, and projective geometry.
4. He worked on the concept of algebraic varieties and their applications in algebraic geometry.
5. He developed Scholz' theorem on integral bases, which solved an important open problem in the field of number theory.
6. He published papers on automorphisms of algebraic varieties and on differences of reduction theory.
7. He developed the theory of the so-called Scholz symbols and their applications in algebraic number theory.

Born 17 December 1884, Berlin, Germany. Died 30 December 1956, MÃ¼nster, Germany.
