**Viggo Brun** was a Norwegian mathematician and number theorist.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Created the Brun's Constant, which was the first successful attempt to estimate the number of prime numbers.
2. Developed an algorithm to generate prime numbers, called the Brun Sieve.
3. Developed an algorithm to determine the inexactness of numbers, the Brun-Titchmarsh theorem.
4. Worked on the Goldbach conjecture and postulated the existence of infinitely many twin primes.
5. Provided the first proof of the Prime Number Theorem.
6. Developed the Brun-Khinovi Dictionary, a dictionary of prime numbers.
7. Developed the Brun-Mollin Algorithm, an efficient algorithm for testing primality.

Born 13 October 1885, Lier, Hordaland County, Norway. Died 15 August 1978, Drobak, Akershus County, Norway.
