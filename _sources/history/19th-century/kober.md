**Hermann Kober** was a Polish-born mathematician who spent much of his life as a school teacher in England but published many papers on analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Breslau was the sixth largest city of Germany and, in that thriving industrial city, Kober attended school.
* Kober chose to study at GÃ¶ttingen, famed as a centre for mathematics, where he was one of Landau's first students.
* Kober was forced out of his teaching post in 1934 but he continued with his teaching career, now at a Jewish school in Breslau.
* Suddenly Kober's research career went into overdrive.
* She was herself a mathematician and played a large role in Kober's mathematical research taking off.
* Birmingham awarded Kober an M.Sc. in 1940 and a D.Sc. in 1943.
* By 1943 Kober had published 30 mathematical papers and he continued to undertake mathematical research for the rest of his life.
* Kober was a highly productive mathematician working on special functions, functional analysis (in this area Kober's Theorem which appeared A theorem on Banach spaces (1939) is named after him), approximation theory and the theory of functions of a real variable.
* In the 1970s, although by that time in his 80s, Kober published: New properties of the Weyl extended integral (1970); Some new properties of the Poisson operator (1971); and The infinite strip in the complex plane and Poisson's operator (1972).

Born 1 February 1888, Beuthen (now Bytom), Upper Silesia (now Poland). Died 4 October 1973, Birmingham, England.
