**Hermann Kober** was a Polish-born mathematician who spent much of his life as a school teacher in England but published many papers on analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for “Weierstrass points,” which represented an important advance in solving algebraic equations and number theory.
2. Collaborated with Kurt Hensel in the creation of the first modern algebraic geometry textbook in 1903.
3. Established general theories of analytic surfaces, algebraic curves, and arithmetical functions.
4. Contributed to number theory with his work on unramified extensions of number fields.
5. Authored two important papers on algebraic geometry in 1923 and 1931.
6. Wrote several textbooks on algebraic geometry, number theory, and algebraic equations.
7. Converted methods of elliptic functions into operations on integral domains, which were later called Kober functions.

Born 1 February 1888, Beuthen (now Bytom), Upper Silesia (now Poland). Died 4 October 1973, Birmingham, England.
