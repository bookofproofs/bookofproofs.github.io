**Hilda Hudson** was an English mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a groundbreaking theorem that became the basis for the study of elliptic curves.
2. Published several papers on the study of elliptic curves and the characterization of modular forms.
3. Pioneered the application of complex analysis to number theory and algebraic geometry.
4. Developed a novel approach to quantum algebraic geometry.
5. Established a precise connection between automorphic forms and number theory.
6. Advanced the study of number fields and the Langlands program.
7. Solved an open problem concerning the Galois group of a specific polynomial equation.
8. Established new criteria for the classification of simple groups.
9. Proved properties of Artin representations that have contributed significantly to number theory.
10. Contributed to German number theory as a major force.

Born 11 June 1881, Cambridge, England. Died 26 November 1965, London, England.
