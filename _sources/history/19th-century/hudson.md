**Hilda Hudson** was an English mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Her father was William Henry Hoar Hudson (11 December 1838 - 21 September 1915) who had been educated at King's College London and St John's College, Cambridge.
* He was in his final year of holding the mathematics lectureship at St John's College when his daughter Hilda Phoebe Hudson was born and shortly after the family moved to London.
* William Hudson was appointed Professor of Mathematics at King's College London in 1882 holding the post until 1903.
* Hilda's mother was also a mathematician who had read mathematics at Newnham College, Cambridge, so perhaps it was not entirely surprising that William and his wife should have had children with outstanding mathematical talents who went on to study mathematics at Cambridge.
* Hilda had an older brother, R W H T Hudson, who was Senior Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge in 1898 while her sister was bracketed with the 8th  Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos of 1900.
* The fact that Hilda's sister was bracketed with the 8th Wrangler meaning that she had come 8th equal among the First Class students.
* Hilda entered Newnham College, Cambridge in 1900, the year in which her sister sat the mathematical Tripos.
* In the following year, 1904, there was tragedy for the Hudson family when Hilda's brother died in a mountaineering accident in Wales.
* After leaving Cambridge, Hilda Hudson went to Germany for a year spending the time studying at the University of Berlin with Schwarz, Schottky, Edmund Landau and others.
* In the list of participants Hilda Hudson is listed as accompanying her father Professor W H H Hudson, but in fact she gave a communication to the Congress, being the only woman to do so.
* Hudson was Associate Research Fellow at Newnham College until the end of the academic year 1912-1913, but she spent this last academic year at Bryn Mawr College, a private women's college founded in 1885 in Pennsylvania in the United States.
* Charlotte Angas Scott, who had studied under Cayley and shared Hudson's interests in algebraic geometry, was Head of the Mathematics department there.
* It was a remarkably productive period for Hudson who published her first paper in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society in 1911, followed by three papers in 1912, and six papers on topics such as Cremona transformations, nodal curves, pinch-points, and algebraic surfaces in 1913.
* After spending the academic year 1912-13 at Bryn Mawr, Hudson returned to England.
* In 1919, after the war had ended, Hudson was appointed as a technical assistant at Parnell and Company in Bristol.
* During the years in which she was writing her major treatise Hudson returned to publishing on Cremona transformations and algebraic surfaces.

Born 11 June 1881, Cambridge, England. Died 26 November 1965, London, England.
