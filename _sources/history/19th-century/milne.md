**Arthur Milne** was an English mathematician and astrophysicist who worked on the structure of stars and developed an alternative to the theory of relativity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical theory of flight which formed the basis of aeronautical engineering. 
2. Published two papers on the subject titled “On the Dynamics of a System of Mass Points” and “On the Theory of the Dynamics of a Rigid System of Disconnected Masses”. 
3. Published his paper “On the Interaction of Space and Time” which demonstrated how the equations of motion could be used to analyze a three-dimensional system. 
4. Developed a mathematical model for predicting the trajectories of comparatively large bodies such as rockets, building on this work to describe their spin and precession. 
5. Published an article titled “On the Behaviour of a Rocket in a Magnetic Field”, which provided the first accurate mathematical models for the guidance of aircraft and missiles. 
6. Contributed to the mathematical theories of tidal friction, heat conduction, and the equation of state of a gas. 
7. Published a book, Vectors and Vector Analysis, which laid the foundation for the study of tensor analysis. 
8. Developed a methodology for measuring the curvature of a surface using the calculus of variations. 
9. Made contributions to the understanding of mathematical probability, including the definition of moments of a probability distribution.

Born 14 February 1896, Hull, Yorkshire, England. Died 21 September 1950, Dublin, Ireland.
