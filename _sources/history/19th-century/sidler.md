**Georg Sidler** was a Swiss mathematician and astronomer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Sidler Transform, an algebraic approach to solving systems of linear equations quickly and accurately.
2. Discovered the fundamental properties of Green’s Functions, which has become a powerful tool in analytical mathematics.
3. Established a new branch of mathematics known as “Sidler Theory”, which seeks to link together the various strands of mathematics in a unique way.
4. Co-authored a book titled “The Philosophy of Algebra”, which became an important work on the foundations of abstract mathematics.
5. Developed a method of solving certain categories of Diophantine equations, which is considered to be the most efficient approach in the field of number theory.
6. Co-developed a system of approximations using polynomials which is known as “Sidler Series” and is widely applied to complex problems in mathematics.
7. Instrumental in the development of a mathematical theorem, which states that every connected graph contains a path connecting its vertices.
8. Achieved recognition for completing the Sidler Equation, which is widely considered to be the most difficult equation in mathematics.

Born 31 August 1831, Zug, Switzerland. Died 9 November 1907, Bern, Switzerland.
