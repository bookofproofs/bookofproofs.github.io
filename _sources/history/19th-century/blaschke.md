**Wilhelm Blaschke** was an Austrian mathematician whose research was on various aspects of geometry. He also initiated the study of topological differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of differential geometry, which studies the properties of curves and surfaces using calculus.
2. Established the Blaschke Selection Theorem, which states that for any given family of analytic curves in the plane, there exists a subset whose union is connected.
3. Introduced the concept of Voronoi diagrams, now used to partition space into regions based on their proximity to points.
4. Pioneered the field of convex analysis and established the introduction of the notion of the domain of holomorphy, a generalization of analytic functions.
5. Published a foundational work on the algebraic theory of linear transformations, eventually forming the basis of linear algebra.
6. Established the main theorem of algebraic correspondences, which is a powerful tool for extending analytic functions from one set to another.
7. Was the first to introduce the notion of projective geometry, which studies geometric transformations in terms of points and lines.
8. Was one of the first mathematicians to introduce the concept of homology, which is the study of the properties of geometric objects in higher dimensions.

Born 13 September 1885, Graz, Austria-Hungary (now Austria). Died 17 March 1962, Hamburg, Germany.
