**Harry Vandiver** was an American mathematician, known for work in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Harry developed an antagonism towards public education and left Central High School at an early age to work as a customshouse broker for his father's firm.
* Also in the year 1904, Vandiver published On Some Special Arithmetic Congruences  in the American Mathematical Monthly  and, although still working as an agent for his father's firm, he did attend some graduate lectures at the University of Pennsylvania.
* Vandiver joined the United States Naval Reserve and continued to serve until 1919 when the war had ended.
* After leaving the Naval Reserve, Birkhoff persuaded Vandiver to become a professional mathematician and to accept a post at Cornell University in 1919.
* It is his life-long work on Fermat's Last Theorem for which he is best known, but Vandiver also wrote papers on cyclotomic fields, Bernoulli numbers, the reciprocity laws, finite fields, techniques for factorisation, semigroups, semirings, and algebras.
* A conjecture, now known as 'Vandiver's conjecture', concerning the class group of cyclotomic fields was so named since Vandiver frequently posed it.
* Although the Cole Prize might be considered Vandiver's greatest distinction, we should also mention that he was vice-president of the American Mathematical Society in 1934-35 and was the Colloquium Lecturer at Ann Arbor in 1935 when he lectured on Fermat's Last Theorem.
* Vandiver married Maude Folmsbee in 1923; they had one son, Frank Vandiver, who became president of Texas A&M.
* It is worth noting that Vandiver continued to hold strong views against public education and Frank was privately tutored to first degree level without attending high school or university.
* Vandiver never owned a house and lived with his wife in the Alamo Hotel in Austin where he had a large collection of classical recordings.

Born 21 October 1882, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 9 January 1973, Austin, Texas, USA.
