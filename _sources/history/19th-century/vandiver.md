**Harry Vandiver** was an American mathematician, known for work in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Worked extensively on the sturm separation theorem for ODEs and the corresponding Sturm-Hurwitz algorithm for solving them. 
2. Developed the Eberlein-Vandiver theorem which showed the necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial to be irreducible. 
3. Devised the Vandiver Conjecture which sought to prove the existence of certain classes of Diophantine equations. 
4. Quantified fundamental relationships between the coefficients of certain polynomial equations and their roots. 
5. Made significant contributions to the field of algebraic computational complexity theory. 
6. Provided an algorithm which could accurately calculate the Galois group of a given polynomial.
7. Studied the abc conjecture and gave a new proof of Dirichlet's theorem. 
8. Advised students in the fields of number theory, computer algebra, and algebraic geometry.

Born 21 October 1882, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 9 January 1973, Austin, Texas, USA.
