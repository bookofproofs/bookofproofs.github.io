**Tommaso Boggio** was an Italian mathematician who worked in mathematical physics, differential geometry, analysis, and financial mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proposed a new geometrical approach to optics that clarified a longstanding problem in the field.
2. Developed a new mathematical tool to study diophantine equations, a tool that allowed for the application of algebraic means to the field of number theory.
3. Wrote a treatise on mechanics that anticipated modern theories of the mechanics of fluids.
4. Discovered a partial proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
5. Developed a method of mathematical induction to prove theorems concerning algebraic equations. 
6. Created a new system of notation for mathematical thought. 
7. Published a book on the theory of probability and expectation.
8. Helped to explain the implications of the infinitesimal calculus and how it could be used to solve problems to do with permutations.

Born 22 December 1877, Valperga Canavese, Italy. Died 25 May1963, Turin, Italy.
