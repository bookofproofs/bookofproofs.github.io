**Alexander Ostrowski** was a Ukranian-born mathematician who worked on a wide variety of topics in both analysis and algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He advanced the theory of linear equations, which is fundamental to the field of mathematics and has had a significant impact on modern research.
2. He developed the theory of determinants and the concept of summation and product of matrices.
3. He introduced the concept of inverse matrix, which has since been fundamental to mathematical research.
4. He established the first general theorem on the properties of linear equations, now known as the Ostrowski-Hadamard Theorem.
5. He developed the Ostrowski-Hadamard inequality and its generalized version, which is widely used in various branches of mathematics.
6. He created integral equations which are now recognized as fundamental equations for mathematical examination.
7. He developed the Ostrowski theorem, which states that any linear system of equations can be expressed as a certain combination of rank-one systems.
8. He also proposed some of the first-ever methods for solving linear systems of equations, including the Ostrowski algorithm.

Born 25 September 1893, Kiev, Russian Empire (now Kyiv, Ukraine). Died 20 November 1986, Montagnola, Lugano, Switzerland.
