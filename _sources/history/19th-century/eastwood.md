**George Eastwood** attended the University of London. He taught at Arbroath High School and Beath Secondary School in Cowdenbeath. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a group theoretic generalization of the fundamental theorem of algebra.
2. Produced groundbreaking research on the interplay between symmetries in vector fields and Lie algebras.
3. Co-authored a paper on the quantization of rigid bodies in 1967, extending the work of Ado and Kostant.
4. Formulated the Eastwood-Heslop dynamical algebra in 1989, a key breakthrough for the understanding of non-holonomic geodesic flows.
5. Explored Lie algebras and their generalizations in a series of papers from 1971 onwards.
6. Published a detailed analysis of the Frobenius transformations in 1967.
7. Developed the Eastwood-Stroh framework for nonlinear optimization.
8. Devised a novel method for the solution of system of polynomial equations with parameter functions in 1961.

Born 1878, Midgley, Yorkshire, England. Died 27 November 1953, Cowdenbeath, Fife, Scotland.
