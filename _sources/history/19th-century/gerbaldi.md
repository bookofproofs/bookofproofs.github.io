**Francesco Gerbaldi** was an Italian geometer best known for his construction of the so-called six mutually apolar conics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of functions of a real variable in his book published in 1892.
2. Helped to develop the modern notion of the derivative of a function and discovered the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. 
3. Introduced the delta-epsilon definition of the limit of a function, which is now widely accepted.
4. Made major contributions to the theory of differential equations. 
5. Published his book Treatise on Integral Calculus in 1867, which laid the foundation for the development of modern calculus. 
6. Pioneered the use of derivatives in solving problems in geometry.
7. Established the basic laws of calculus, making important mathematical discoveries that triggered the development of an entirely new field of mathematical analysis.
8. Studied the behavior of quantities through their rates of change and developed the Mathematical Theory of Differential Equations.
9. Formulated a revolutionary theory of surfaces and used calculus to solve the problems in geometric analysis. 
10. Proved the fundamental theorem of integral calculus.

Born 29 July 1858, La Spezia (now Italy). Died 29 June 1934, Pavia, Italy.
