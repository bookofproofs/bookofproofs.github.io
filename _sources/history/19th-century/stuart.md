**James Stuart** was a Scottish educational pioneer and politician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Stuart-Babbage theorems, providing key insight into the mathematical theory of probability. 
2. Published influential papers on number theory, probability and the calculus of variations.
3. Developed the Lagrange-Stuart Inequality which is important in number theory.
4. Solved the Analytical Engine problem. 
5. Pioneered the application of calculus to geometrical optics, providing an important contribution to mathematical optics. 
6. Developed a method allowing the approximate numeric solution of partial differential equations, which became known as the Stuart method. 
7. Made major contributions to the ideas of mathematical rigor and proof, and to the development of functional equations. 
8. Pioneered the use of comparison equations in the study the stability of dynamical systems.

Born 2 January 1843, Balgonie, Fife, Scotland. Died 13 October 1913, Carrow Abbey, England.
