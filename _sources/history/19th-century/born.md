**Max Born** was a Polish-born mathematician who worked in Cambridge and received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1954 for his work on Quantum Mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proposed an interpretation of quantum mechanics known as the Born Rule.
2. Performed foundational research that helped lead to the development of modern statistical physics.
3. Published over 300 scientific papers, focused mainly on theoretical physics and mathematics.
4. Developed the probability interpretation of the wave function, which established the mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics.
5. Developed the Born-Jordan transformation, a continuous analogue of the discrete Fourier transform.
6. Was the first to solve the elastic scattering problem using quantum mechanics.
7. Made advances in the field of classical mechanics by studying the motion of charged particles.
8. Developed the famous Born approximation for calculating transition probabilities.
9. Made foundational contributions to number theory, the theory of functions, and the calculus of variations.

Born 11 December 1882, Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 5 January 1970, Göttingen, Germany.
