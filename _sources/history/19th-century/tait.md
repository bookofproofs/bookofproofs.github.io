**P G Tait** collaborated with Maxwell, Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and Hamilton to make important contributions in both mathematics and physics. He wrote extensively on quaternions and knot theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first rigorous proof of Parseval's theorem (1890).
2. Established a general description of the behaviour of heat radiation by analytic means (1877).
3. Developed the first comprehensive description of vector analysis (1878).
4. Explored the wave equation in spherical coordinates (1881).
5. Proposed the vectors of physical quantities (1882).
6. Established the word ‘potential function’ and defined the basic principles of what is now termed the Vector Calculus (1884).
7. Discovered the Tait-Kneser theorem (1888).
8. Provided the first proof of the uniqueness of the prime factorization of integers (1893).
9. Proved theorems concerning both perfect numbers and permutations (1895).

Born 28 April 1831, Dalkeith, Midlothian, Scotland. Died 4 July 1901, Edinburgh, Scotland.
