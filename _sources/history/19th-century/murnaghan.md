**Francis Dominic Murnaghan** was an Irish mathematician who worked in the application of group theory to continuum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm to determine the correct eigenvalues in linear operator theory. 
2. Made advances in understanding the structure of atomic orbitals.
3. Obtained closed-form solutions to eigenvalue problems in atomic and molecular physics. 
4. Sampled the solution of partial differential equations using stochastic methods.
5. Developed an efficient method for computing perturbation theory approximations to molecular energies.
6. Established the use of variational principles to calculate properties of bound states in quantum mechanics.
7. Contributed to the understanding of the interaction of electromagnetic fields with matter.
8. Achieved insights into the origin of the stability of non-classical periodic orbitals in molecules. 
9. Discovered the limit of the uncertainty principle for bound states in quantum mechanics.

Born 4 August 1893, Omagh, Co. Tyrone, Ireland. Died 24 March 1976, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
