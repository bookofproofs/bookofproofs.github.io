**Francis Dominic Murnaghan** was an Irish mathematician who worked in the application of group theory to continuum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His parents, Angela Mooney and George Murnaghan, were Roman Catholics although George had been educated at a Protestant school.
* George Murnaghan took an active part in political life, serving on Tyrone County Council and becoming a Nationalist Member of Parliament, and left the running of the farm to his large family.
* Harry Bateman had been appointed there in 1912 and his interests in partial differential equations fitted perfectly with Murnaghan's interests at the time.
* Arriving at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Murnaghan began doctoral studies working on differential equations which arose in the study of radio-active decay.
* In 1916 Murnaghan submitted his thesis The Lines of Electric Force Due to a Moving Electron and was awarded his Ph.D. Following this he was appointed as a lecturer at the Rice Institute in Houston, Texas.
* Murnaghan helped supervise the studies of the first Ph.D. produced by the Rice Institute, namely Hubert Evelyn Bray whose thesis A Green's Theorem in Terms of Lebesgue Integrals was submitted in 1918, the year Murnaghan left.
* While he had been at the Rice Institute, Murnaghan had met Ada Mary Kimbell and in 1919, the year following his return to Johns Hopkins, they married.
* They had a son named Francis Dominic after his father, and known as Francis Dominic Jnr, and a daughter Patricia.
* In 1928 Frank Morley retired as Head of Mathematics at Johns Hopkins, and Murnaghan was appointed as Professor and Head of the Mathematics Department.
* Let us now examine the mathematics which interested Murnaghan.
* Over the period up to 1936, in addition to the major texts we have already mentioned, Murnaghan undertook research and published papers on a wide variety of topics such as electrodynamics, relativity, tensor analysis, elasticity, dynamics, aerodynamics, quantum mechanics, and celestial mechanics.
* Although we have mentioned six books by Murnaghan, this is less than half his total of books since he published 16 in all.
* As a teacher, Murnaghan certainly appears to have had great style.

Born 4 August 1893, Omagh, Co. Tyrone, Ireland. Died 24 March 1976, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
