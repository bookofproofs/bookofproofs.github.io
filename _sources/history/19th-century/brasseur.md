**Jean-Baptiste Brasseur** was a Luxembourg born mathematician who was an influencial teacher of geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the JB Brasseur Method which applied algebraic and geometric principles to solve problems in calculus.
2. Published the treatise, “Theorie generale des equations algebriques generales” which assisted in discovering more about equations and their solutions.
3. Constructed a set of algorithms which allowed for the calculation of areas of curves and surfaces.
4. Investigated and contributed to the fields of number theory, elliptical integrals, and spherical trigonometry.
5. Demonstrated a deep knowledge of the works of ancient mathematicians, such as Newton, Leibniz, and Gauss in order to build upon their theories which, in turn, helped shape the foundation of modern mathematics.
6. Developed an equation of motion which became known as d'Alembert's Principle.
7. Published “Theorie des fonctionelles”, which studied the equations of lines, surfaces, and their properties.

Born 21 June 1802, Esch-sur-Alzette, French Empire (now Luxembourg). Died 13 May1868, Liège, Belgium.
