**Poul Heegaard** was a Danish mathematician who (with Max Dehn) was the first to classify compact surfaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first mathematician to explain the concept of the Poincaré Conjecture, which he did in a paper published in 1910.
2. He developed the Heegaard splitting, a concept in topology, in his work published in 1907.
3. In 1904, Heegaard introduced the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem. 
4. Heegaard established the Dehn Invariance Theorem in 1912, which related handle body topology with group theory. 
5. In 1913, Heegaard proposed the Heegaard genus, a topological invariant of a manifold, which he developed as a part of his collaborative work titled ‘Doeblin-Heegaard’s Topology of Closed Riemann Surfaces’. 
6. He published a series of three papers in 1910 introducing the HeegaardFloer homology, a tool for understanding topology and three-dimensional manifolds. 
7. He developed the Heegaard-Lefschetz fixed point theorem in collaboration with Lefschetz in 1945.

Born 2 November 1871, Copenhagen, Denmark. Died 7 February 1948, Oslo, Norway.
