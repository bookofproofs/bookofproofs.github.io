**Évariste Galois** was a French mathematician who produced a method of determining when a general equation could be solved by radicals and is famous for his development of early group theory. He died very young after fighting a duel.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The starting point of the historical events which were to play a major role in Galois' life is surely the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789.
* Galois was by this time at school.
* Galois was not involved and during 1824-25 his school record is good and he received several prizes.
* However in 1826 Galois was asked to repeat the year because his work in rhetoric was not up to the required standard.
* February 1827 was a turning point in Galois' life.
* Galois' school reports began to describe him as singular, bizarre, original and closed.
* In 1828 Galois took the examination of the École Polytechnique but failed.
* It was the leading University of Paris and Galois must have wished to enter it for academic reasons.
* Back at Louis-le-Grand, Galois enrolled in the mathematics class of Louis Richard.
* In April 1829 Galois had his first mathematics paper published on continued fractions in the Annales de mathématiques.
* Cauchy was appointed as referee of Galois' paper.
* The priest of Bourg-la-Reine forged Mayor Galois' name on malicious forged epigrams directed at Galois' own relatives.
* Galois therefore resigned himself to enter the École Normale, which was an annex to Louis-le-Grand, and to do so he had to take his Baccalaureate examinations, something he could have avoided by entering the École Polytechnique.
* Galois sent Cauchy further work on the theory of equations, but then learned from Bulletin de Férussac of a posthumous article by Abel which overlapped with a part of his work.
* Galois then took Cauchy's advice and submitted a new article On the condition that an equation be soluble by radicals in February 1830.
* Fourier died in April 1830 and Galois' paper was never subsequently found and so never considered for the prize.
* Galois, after reading Abel and Jacobi's work, worked on the theory of elliptic functions and abelian integrals.
* Galois tried to scale the wall to join the rioting but failed.
* Guigniault wrote newspaper articles attacking the students and Galois wrote a reply in the Gazette des Écoles, attacking M.
* For this letter Galois was expelled and he joined the Artillery of the National Guard, a Republican branch of the militia.
* In January 1831 Galois attempted to return to mathematics.
* Galois was invited by Poisson to submit a third version of his memoir on equation to the Academy and he did so on 17 January.
* On 18 April Sophie Germain wrote a letter to her friend the mathematician Libri which describes Galois' situation.
* Fourier, have been too much for this student Galois who, in spite of his impertinence, showed signs of a clever disposition.
* During the dinner Galois raised his glass and with an open dagger in his hand appeared to make threats against the King, Louis-Phillipe.
* After the dinner Galois was arrested and held in Sainte-Pélagie prison.
* Galois, rather surprisingly since he essentially repeated the threat from the dock, was acquitted.
* The 14th  of July was Bastille Day and Galois was arrested again.
* Galois was sent back to Sainte-Pélagie prison.
* He did, however, encourage Galois to publish a more complete account of his work.
* While in Sainte-Pélagie prison Galois attempted to commit suicide by stabbing himself with a dagger but the other prisoners prevented him.
* In March 1832 a cholera epidemic swept Paris and prisoners, including Galois, were transferred to the pension Sieur Faultrier.
* After he was released on 29 April Galois exchanged letters with Stephanie, and it is clear that she tried to distance herself from the affair.
* The name Stephanie appears several times as a marginal note in one of Galois' manuscripts.
* Galois fought a duel with Perscheux d'Herbinville on 30 May, the reason for the duel not being clear but certainly linked with Stephanie.
* Galois was wounded in the duel and was abandoned by d'Herbinville and his own seconds and found by a peasant.
* It had been Galois' wish that Jacobi and Gauss should give their opinions on his work.
* Liouville published these papers of Galois in his Journal in 1846.
* The theory that Galois outlined in these papers is now called Galois theory.

Born 25 October 1811, Bourg La Reine (near Paris), France. Died 31 May 1832, Paris, France.
