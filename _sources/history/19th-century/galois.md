**Évariste Galois** was a French mathematician who produced a method of determining when a general equation could be solved by radicals and is famous for his development of early group theory. He died very young after fighting a duel.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the theory of equations, which laid the groundwork for modern algebraic geometry.
2. Proved the structure of Galois Theory, which gives a connection between the structure of roots of equations and the structure of fields in abstract algebra.
3. Developed the concept of Group Theory, which formed the basis of modern algebra and laid the foundation for further advances in number theory, cryptography, and chaos theory.
4. Demonstrated a fundamental link between algebra and geometry, in proving limits of solvability.
5. Discovered criteria for the solvability of polynomial equations by radicals. 
6. Formulated the idea of an Emptylest, an algebraic construction that has no physical meaning.

Born 25 October 1811, Bourg La Reine (near Paris), France. Died 31 May 1832, Paris, France.
