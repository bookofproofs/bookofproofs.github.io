**Percy MacMahon** was a Maltese-born mathematician who worked in number theory and combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father was Brigadier-General P W MacMahon and, it is interesting to note that as a young child he had a fascination with the way that the ammunition was stacked.
* MacMahon was educated at a school in Cheltenham and was always destined for a military career.
* MacMahon was a candidate to fill the vacant Savilian Chair, as was Esson, and after Esson was appointed MacMahon wrote to Sir Joseph Larmor expressing his feelings at losing out to Esson.
* One would have to say that MacMahon was fully justified in feeling aggrieved at losing out to Esson.
* Before he was a candidate for the Savilian Chair of Geometry, MacMahon had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1890.
* It was Alfred George Greenhill who taught MacMahon at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich and Greenhill's interests at that time had a large influence on MacMahon's early work.
* In 1884 MacMahon calculated a table of values based on Greenhill's model.
* MacMahon then worked on invariants of binary quartic forms, following Cayley and Sylvester.
* This study of symmetric functions led MacMahon to study partitions and Latin squares, and for many years he was considered the leading worker in this area.
* MacMahon wrote a two volume treatise Combinatory analysis (volume one in 1915 and the second volume in the following year) which has become a classic.
* This book shows another of the topics which fascinated MacMahon, namely the construction of patterns which can be repeated to fill the plane.
* MacMahon was well respected in his day.
* MacMahon received many honours.

Born 26 September 1854, Sliema, Malta. Died 25 December 1929, Bognor-Regis, England.
