**Alfred Clebsch** was a German mathematician worked on algebraic geometry and was a co-founder of _Mathematische Annalen_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered a new branch of geometry called the theory of affine geometry.
2. Developed and presented a new way of understanding algebraic equations known as the Clebsch theory of algebraic functions.
3. Established the theory of algebraic curves, connecting algebraic geometry and differential geometry.
4. Demonstrated that all cubic algebraic curves are related to conic sections, a breakthrough discovery of the Clebsch School.
5. Formulated the theory of Abelian functions, an extension of elliptic functions.
6. Was one of the first to formulate and analyze the Beltrami differential equation. 
7. Developed a new branch of geometry known as the kinematics of deformable bodies.
8. Introduced the idea of Riemann surfaces, which was later developed by Felix Klein.

Born 19 January 1833, Königsberg, East Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 7 November 1872, Göttingen, Germany.
