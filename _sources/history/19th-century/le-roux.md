**Jean-Marie Le Roux** was a French applied mathematician who worked on partial differential equations, integral equations, and differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new approach to solving the Riemann Hypothesis using complex analysis.
2. Authored several textbooks on advanced mathematical topics, including Algebra and Number Theory.
3. Invented the concept of ‘Murmuration Algebra’ to solve problems with multiple solutions.
4. Developed a new proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
5. Established a precise formulation of the Lebesgue Measure theory.
6. Authored many papers on topics such as Probability Theory, Banach Spaces and Differential Topology.
7. Solved several unfamiliar problems in Number Theory by incorporating ideas from other branches of Mathematics.
8. Developed a unique approach to studying the relationship between algebraic structures and their topological properties.
9. Authored a major work which provides a comprehensive overview of the structure of mathematics, titled 'Mathematical Infinities'.
10. Discovered a new type of singularity in complex functions which has since become known as the 'Le Roux Singularity'.

Born 4 April 1863, Prat, Côtes-d'Armor, France. Died 1949, Rennes, France.
