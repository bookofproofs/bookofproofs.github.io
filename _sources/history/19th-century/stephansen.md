**Elizabeth Stephansen**  was a Norwegian mathematician and educator who was the first Norwegian woman to be awarded a doctoral degree in science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Her parents were Gerche Reimers Jahn and Anton Stephan Stephansen and, if the names 'Mary Ann Elizabeth' sound very English for a Norwegian girl, this is easily explained since she was named after her maternal grandmother who was indeed English and named Mary Ann Elizabeth Lockwood.
* Betzy's father Anton Stephansen first worked in the manufacturing business, then as a salesman before deciding to open his own business.
* Anton Stephansen's shop provided a good income and Betzy grew up in a prosperous Bergen family.
* Stephansen studied science at the Bergen Katedralskole graduating with her diploma in 1891.
* Women could study at universities in Norway at this time; in fact the first women were admitted in 1887 four years before Stephansen graduated from high school.
* We know a little of how this came about through a letter which her mother wrote on 8 February 1892 in support of an application that Stephansen was making for a grant from the Queen Josefine endowment.
* Stephansen's application, perhaps helped by the letter of support from her mother, was successful and she was awarded a grant from the Queen Josefine endowment.
* The family set up home in Espeland and opened the factory which manufactured textiles for her father's firm A S Stephansen A/S.
* Stephansen wanted to become a secondary school teacher of mathematics but although women had earned the right to become secondary school teachers in Norway in precisely the year that Stephansen was awarded her degree, they were not allowed to receive permanent contracts.
* Stephansen was employed from 1896 as a part-time teacher at her old school, Bergen Katedralskole, for two years and then she taught at Bergen Tekniske Skole for a year, teaching four hours a week.
* During the time that she was teaching Stephansen was working on her doctoral dissertation on partial differential equations.
* In her thesis, Stephansen generalised Guldberg's work and succeeded in describing all those fourth order partial differential equations which could be reduced to equations of the third order.
* Stephansen's thesis Über Partielle Differentialgleichungen vierter Ordung die ein intermediäres Integral besitzen Ⓣ(On partial differential equations of the fourth order possess an intermediate integral)  was published in 1902 and in that year she was awarded her doctorate by the University of Zürich.
* With the award of the doctorate in mathematics Stephansen became the first Norwegian woman to be awarded a doctorate in a science subject.
* Stephansen published another paper in 1903 on differential equations, the idea for which came out of Hilbert's course of lectures that she attended.
* Back in Norway, Stephansen worked as a teacher at Olaf Berg's Girls School in Oslo.
* After Stephansen retired in 1937 she went to Espeland to live with her sister Gerda.
* It did not turn out to be quite the peaceful retirement that Stephansen would have expected for on 9 April 1940 Hitler disregarded Norway's neutrality and ordered an invasion.
* By the following day German troops were in Bergen and Stephansen found herself in an occupied land.
* Stephansen, of course, could speak fluent German and she ignored the personal risks involved to give what help she could to the prisoners in the camp.

Born 10 March 1872, Bergen, Norway. Died 23 February 1961, Espeland, Norway.
