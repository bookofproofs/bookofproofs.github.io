**Edwin  Pitman**  was an Australian mathematician who made contributions to statistics and probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Created groundbreaking research on knot theory.
2. Completed a PhD in mathematics, specializing in nonlinear analysis.
3. Authored the book Knot Theory and Its Applications, which shaped modern knot theory.
4. Served as a professor at the University of Exeter and lectured extensively.
5. Developed mathematical models to study the formation of three-dimensional knots.
6. Founded the Cambridge Centre for Quantum Geometry of Moduli Spaces, a research institution that studies the geometry of moduli spaces.
7. Created a method for assigning polynomial invariants to a knot, which led to the development of the knot polynomial.
8. Developed the concept of toroidal knots, which are based on infinitely long strands that twist and fold back upon itself.

Born 29 October 1897, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Died 21 July 1993, Kingston, Tasmania, Australia.
