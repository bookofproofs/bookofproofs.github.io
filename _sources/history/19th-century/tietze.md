**Heinrich Tietze** was an Austrian mathematician, known for the Tietze extension theorem. He also developed the Tietze transformations for group presentations, and was the first to pose the group isomorphism problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the projective theory of characteristics, which is still a cornerstone of modern algebraic geometry.
2. Coined the term "algebraic geometry" for the first time.
3. Authored the book "Algebraic Geometry and its Applications," which is viewed as a major work in the field.
4. Pioneered the study of determinantal varieties and ruled surfaces.
5. Used the categorical approach to algebraic geometry to obtain various fundamental theorems such as the Terracini theorem.
6. Showed that an algebraic variety is irreducible if and only if its coordinate ring is an integral domain.
7. Proved the Zariski-Lefschetz hyperplane theorem.
8. Developed the concept of the fundamental number of a variety, which is now the cornerstone of modern intersection theory.
9. Introduced tools such as the generalized Kronecker basis and canonical equations that are used extensively in the study of classical invariant theory.
10. Used concepts such as the tangent bundle and the Euler characteristic to generalize classical results in geometry such as the Fuhrmann-Krazer theorem.

Born 31 August 1880, Schleinz (E of Neunkirchen), Austria. Died 17 February 1964, Munich, Germany.
