**Thomas Bond Sprague** became the most important actuary of the late 19th Century. He wrote more than 100 papers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored numerous papers on topics ranging from algebra to trigonometry and number theory. 
2. Developed principles of algebraic and invariancy, which form the basis of modern algebraic geometry. 
3. Proposed an early version of the inverse function theorem in 1860. 
4. Introduced the concept of a graph as a representation of mathematical relationships in 1878, now a ubiquitous tool for mathematics. 
5. Discovered the law of quadratic reciprocity, which enables the efficient computation of equation solutions, in 1883.
6. Established the basic principles underlying the use of transformers and induction coils in electrical circuits. 
7. Discovered new classes of number sequences and sequences of polynomials.

Born 29 March 1830, London, England. Died 29 November 1920, Edinburgh, Scotland.
