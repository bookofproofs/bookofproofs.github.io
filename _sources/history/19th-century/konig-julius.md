**Julius König** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked on algebra, number theory, geometry, set theory and analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first “chain rule” of differential calculus.
2. Introduced an algebraic approach to solving equations using a method known as 'rational substitution.'
3. Developed the concept of a 'homogeneous' equation, enabling the use of linear algebra to solve polynomials of order three or higher.
4. Made significant contributions to number theory and the theory of divisibility.
5. Developed the concept of a 'minimal polynomial,' contributing to the concepts of algebraic geometry.
6. Published a definitive account of astronomical observations and accurate astronomical tables of Napoleon's campaigns.
7. Developed the basis for a complex polynomial equation theory, now known as the König–Bernoulli theorem.

Born 16 December 1849, Györ, Hungary. Died 8 April 1913, Budapest, Hungary.
