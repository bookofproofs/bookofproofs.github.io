**Max Planck** initiated the study of quantum mechanics when he announced in 1900 his theoretical research into the radiation and absorption of heat/light by a black body.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the fundamentals of statistical mechanics, which describes the relationships between atomic particles and macroscopic properties such as pressure and temperature.
2. Formulated the Wien–Friedel–Planck law of thermal radiation, which explained the nature of blackbody radiation in terms of quantum theory.
3. Developed the quantum theory of the oscillator, which describes how two systems with similar frequencies can interact.
4. Founded the field of quantum mechanics, which was the first theory of atomic and subatomic physics.
5. Made significant contributions to the unified field theory and quantum gravity.
6. Developed the uncertainty principle, which states that the exact momentum and position of a particle or system cannot be known simultaneously.

Born 23 April 1858, Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein (now Germany). Died 4 October 1947, Göttingen, Germany.
