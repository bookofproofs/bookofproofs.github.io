**Jerzy Neyman** was a Russian born American mathematician who did important work in probability and statistics including applications to meteorology and medicine.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a sound basis for the theory of hypothesis testing in statistics, as outlined in his 1933 paper, “On the Two-Sample Problem.”
2. Developed the Neyman–Pearson Lemma to provide an optimally powerful statistical test of a hypothesis in the context of decisions.
3. Developed the Neyman–Scott problem for an asymptotic evaluation of the power of a test statistic.
4. Developed the calibration curve, a graphical representation of probability of detection of false alarms.
5. Established the Neyman-Fisher distribution theorem, used to calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of a statistical model, and the Neyman–Pearson Lemma a tool used to compare different tests of hypothesis. 
6. Showcased the concept of confidence intervals to determine the true population parameters from the sample data.
7. Advanced Neyman–Pearson hypothesis testing, a tool used to incorporate prior knowledge of the parameters of the population into the data.
8. Developed the Neyman–Pierson Test which examines the behaviour of a statistic under a given null hypothesis. 
9. Created the multiple linear regression model, a tool for predicting responses of multiple variables to changes in independent variables.

Born 16 April 1894, Bendery, Bessarabia, Russian Empire (now Transnistria, Moldova). Died 5 August 1981, Oakland, California, USA.
