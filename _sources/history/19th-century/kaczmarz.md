**Stefan Kaczmarz** was a Polish mathematician whose work provided the basis for modern imaging techniques, including the CAT scan.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Kaczmarz developed an algorithm for solving linear systems of equations that is now known as "Kaczmarz's Algorithm".
2. Kaczmarz was the first to prove that the Roots of an Nth degree equation can be solved to arbitrary accuracy.
3. He introduced the concept of projective closure of a set of points, a fundamental concept in geometry.
4. Kaczmarz formulated the concept of orthogonal projection, a vital tool for linear algebra and convex optimization.
5. Kaczmarz developed the fundamental theorem of finitism, also known as the "Kaczmarz theorem".
6. He was the first to propose a generalized form of the least squares method for solving systems of linear equations.

Born 20 March 1895, Sambor, Lw√≥w, Austria-Hungary (now Sambir, Ukraine). Died after 4 September 1939, Poland.
