**Erich Hecke** was a Polish-born German mathematician whose  best work was in analytic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a proof for the orthogonality relations for the basis of modular forms.
2. Discovered the Müntz–Siegel theorem in the field of analytic L-functions.
3. Solved the Gaussian congruence problem in number theory.
4. Proved the orthogonality of the Hecke eigenbasis.
5. Devised the Hecke deformations of elliptic curves, the Hecke equations.
6. Established the Hecke algebra and Hecke operators, enabling algebraic number theory to deal with p-adic fields.
7. Pioneered the study of ‘Hecke Characters’, a spacial form of Dirichlet L-functions.
8. Wrote the book ‘L-reihen und Modulfunktionen’ (L-Series and Modular Functions), in 1924.
9. Published a book on Abelian functions and theta constants in 1930.

Born 20 September 1887, Buk, Posen, Germany (now Poznań, Poland). Died 13 February 1947, Copenhagen, Denmark.
