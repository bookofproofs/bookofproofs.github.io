**Nikolai Nikolaevich Luzin** was a Russian mathematician who made important contributions to the foundations of mathematics, measure theory and topology. He was head of the "Luzitania" research group at Moscow.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Moscow Mathematical Society in 1924.
2. Published the first volume of his “Monographs and Lectures on New Aspects of Function Theory” in 1930.
3. Developed the concept of analytical sets, which are now known as Luzin sets.
4. Created the so-called Luzin topology, which is now known as the L2-topology.
5. Introduced the concepts of completeness in metric spaces and the second category theorem.
6. Developed the mathematical theory of probability.
7. Demonstrated the luminosity of the law of large numbers. 
8. Formulated the principle of dependence.
9. Approximated the measure of a Lebesgue measurable set with a given accuracy. 
10. Established the axiom of choice as an independent assumption.

Born 9 December 1883, Irkutsk, Russia. Died 25 February 1950, Moscow, USSR.
