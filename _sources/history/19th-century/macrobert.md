**Thomas MacRobert** studied at Glasgow and Cambridge universities. He returned to Glasgow to a series of posts culminating in the professorship. He worked on Complex Analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a geometrical method of solving a large class of equations known as the MacRobert Method.
2. Worked on tabular logarithms and a theory of elliptic functions.
3. Contributed to the development of methods for the numeration of ordered systems of pairs of numbers.
4. Wrote a monograph on the theory of the conic sections.
5. Contributed to solutions of the three-body problem.
6. Developed a method for determining the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies.
7. Pioneered the use of double integrals in the field of calculus of variations.
8. Found a solution to the trisection angle problem.
9. Wrote a treatise on fluid dynamics.
10. The Originator of the MacRobert Series, which is a method used for the numerical solution of differential equations.

Born 4 April 1884, Dreghorn, Ayrshire, Scotland. Died 1 November 1962, Glasgow, Scotland.
