### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Development of one of the first axiomatic approaches to geometry and set theory, known as the Erlangen program.
2. Proving the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain.
3. Introduction to the field of topology and its application in the study of complex analysis.
4. Solving the uniformization theorem for bounded plane domains.
5. Introducing the notion of a metric space.
6. Pioneering the use of group theory to study algebraic equations and structures.
7. Establishing foundations for the study of lattice theory.
8. Conducting the first research into non-euclidean and projective geometry.
9. Introducing the notion of an ordered field.
10. Development of a topological interpretation of analytic functions.

Born 13 June 1871, Laurahütte, Silesia, Germany (now Siemianowice Śląskie, Poland). Died 29 September 1928, Kiel, Germany.
