**Virgil Snyder** was an American mathematician, specializing in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developing the Clifford Algebra-Based Quaternion Formulation for Special Relativity, awarding him the John Jameson Award in Mathematics from The Institute of Aerospace Sciences. 
2. Pioneering the Computational Geometry field with his development of various algorithms including the Snyder Polarization. 
3. Leading the development of the Reed-Muller Expansions and the Gottlieb-Schubert-Snyder Algorithm. 
4. Developing the Geometric and Mathematical principles that form the foundation of the technique of Homotopic Approximation and its applications. 
5. Advising and mentoring numerous mathematicians including Geoffrey Hughes, Herrmann Wolf, Martinus Wubben, and Egbert Brouwer.

Born 9 November 1869, Dixon, Iowa, USA. Died 4 January 1950, Ithaca, New York, USA.
