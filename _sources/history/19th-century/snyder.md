**Virgil Snyder** was an American mathematician, specializing in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Virgil attended Iowa State College from 1886 to 1889 being awarded his Sc.B. in 1889.
* The Club encouraged many students to go to Germany to study for their doctorates and Snyder went to Germany in 1892 having been awarded an Erastus W Brooks fellowship.
* Snyder studied for his doctorate at Göttingen, attending lectures by Klein and participating in his seminar.
* Snyder's doctoral dissertation (Göttingen, 1895) was concerned with linear complexes of spheres.
* After retiring from Cornell, Snyder was a Visiting Professor at Brown University in 1942-43 and then a Visiting Professor at Rollins College, Winter Park, Florida in 1943-44.
* Together with Henry White, in fact, Snyder emerged as a principal heir to Klein's geometric legacy.
* Another significant contribution by Snyder was his textbooks.
* Snyder was honoured by being elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1919.
* His favourite recreation is mountain climbing and going on long hikes with Mrs Snyder as companion.
