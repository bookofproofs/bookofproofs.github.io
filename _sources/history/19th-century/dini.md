**Ulisse Dini** was an Italian mathematician whose most important work was on the theory of functions of a real variable.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proposed a new system of coordinates that revolutionized calculus and opened the doors to what later came to be known as vector calculus.
2. Established the methods of modern integral calculus.
3. Developed the theory of probability.
4. Pioneered the study of analytic geometry and vector algebra. 
5. Studied local and global perturbations on a planetary orbit.
6. He established the Italian School of Mathematics and became its founder.
7. Made important contributions to the field of mathematical analysis.
8. Played a significant role in the foundation of a mathematical journal called the Annali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata.
9. Founded the Unione Matematica Italiana, a notable mathematical society.
10. Formulated the principal of mathematical induction as an axiomatic proof.

Born 14 November 1845, Pisa (now Italy). Died 28 October 1918, Pisa, Italy.
