**Kirchhoff** was a mathematical physicist best known for his laws on the flow of electric current.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the concept of chemical affinity in 1812; demonstrating how affinity can be used to calculate the magnitude of an element’s chemical reaction.
2. Established Kirchhoff's Laws of electrical circuits in 1845, which describe the relation between currents and potentials in electric circuits.
3. Proposed the celebrated spectral line law in 1862, demonstrating that an atom’s mass and composition can be determined through its emission and absorption spectra.
4. Developed electro-magnetic field theory in 1854 and discovered the properties of black-body radiation in 1860.
5. Developed the concept of loop analysis in 1845, creating a set of algebraic equations to solve electrical systems.
6. Contributed to the development of Group Theory in mathematics, an extensive mathematical system for solving equations.
7. Extended George Green’s work in optical mathematics to form the fundamental equations of the electric field in 1845.

Born 12 March 1824, Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 17 October 1887, Berlin, Germany.
