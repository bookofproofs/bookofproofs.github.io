**John Pratt** worked in India as a chaplain. He published works on the shape of the earth.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
John Pratt was an English mathematician and clergyman who was one of the leading authorities of his time on the theory of equations. He is best known for his significant contributions in the field of mathematics, most notably for his work Devotional Arithmetic, published in 1661.

1. Published the work 'Devotional Arithmetic' in 1661.
2. Developed the 'Pratt equation' â€“ a mathematical theory of solving equations involving several unknown values.
3. Developed the 'Pratt cotangent' formula, which is a method of calculating the cotangent of a triangle.
4. Introduced the use of the letter 'e' to signify a base of a natural logarithm.
5. Developed the 'Pratt Law of Logarithms', which is a theorem that relates the common base of logarithms to practical multiplication and division.
6. Made significant advances in the field of linear algebra.
7. Contributed to the field of calculus by advancing the understanding of Euler's Integral.
8. Researched and wrote extensively on the topics of probability and set theory.
9. Established the notion of the differential coefficient, which is an important concept in the study of calculus.

Born 4 June 1809, St Mary Woolnoth, London, England. Died 28 December 1871, Ghazipur, India.
