**Ramanujan** made substantial contributions to the analytical theory of numbers and worked on elliptic functions, continued fractions, and infinite series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed new and highly unconventional methods to solve mathematical problems. 
2. He discovered nearly 3,900 results including infinite series, continued fractions, and analytical theory of numbers.
3. He independently compiled nearly 3900 results.
4. He provided a new approach to the partition numbers.
5. He discovered the Ramanujan prime and the Ramanujan theta function.
6. He formulated the Ramanujan conjectures which are still being studied.
7. He got the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. 
8. He opened up entire new areas of work in mathematics.
9. He had great influence on modern mathematics, particularly in Analysis and Number theory. 
10. He devised the Ramanujan conjecture, which states that any number can be written as a sum of no more than five prime numbers.

Born 22 December 1887, Erode, Tamil Nadu state, India. Died 26 April 1920, Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu state, India.
