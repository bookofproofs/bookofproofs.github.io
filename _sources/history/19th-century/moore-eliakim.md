**Eliakim Moore** was an American mathematician who worked on abstract algebra, algebraic geometry, number theory and integral equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered quaternions, a tool used in digital 3D graphics and animation. 
2. Developed insights into the structure of the space of quartic forms. 
3. Found a way to generalize the law of quadratic reciprocity to higher degree polynomials.
4. Proved a theorem for the number of integral points on certain varieties of polynomials.
5. Researched ideas of the behavior of functions and their integrals, thereby finding a new approach to the understanding of the motion of the moon. 
6. Demonstrated that a new kind of function could be used to predict the motion of celestial bodies. 
7. Pioneered a way to describe the motion of the planets and stars that relied on the action of system of equations. 
8. Demonstrated that the laws of behavior for the planets could be determined by algebraic equations. 
9. Published the first treatise on quaternions. 
10. Provided the foundations of modern algebraic geometry.

Born 26 January 1862, Marietta, Ohio, USA. Died 30 December 1932, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
