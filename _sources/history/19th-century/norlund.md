**Niels Norlund** was a Danish mathematician and astronomer who worked in the theory of difference equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to prove the invariance of quadratic forms under orthogonal transformations (1910).
2. He was the first to introduce singular value decomposition and developed the structure theory of bilinear forms (1915).
3. He developed the field of Abelian groups and developed the basic theory of fields of algebraic functions (1925).
4. He was the founder of the modern theory of summation of divergent series (1928).
5. He introduced the Norlund–Ginzburg algorithm for the solution of certain equations (1930).
6. He developed the theory of homological algebra, including the fundamental combinatorial and geometrical facts about Steenrod squares and powers (1932).
7. He developed a number of important finite difference formulas, in particular the Norlund–Schmidt formula for the solution of difference and differential equations (1935).
8. He made important contributions to the theory of convergence of series and the summability theory of divergent series (1941).

Born 26 October 1885, Slagelse, near Soro, Sjaelland, Denmark. Died 4 July 1981, Copenhagen, Denmark.
