**Einar Carl Hille** was an American mathematician who worked on analysis and functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the foundations of functional analysis, which applied analytic techniques to functions and operators, laying the groundwork for modern abstract algebra and analysis.
2. Introduced the Hille-Yosida theorem, which provided a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the theory of linear operators in Banach spaces.
3. Formalized the Löwner–Heinz inequality, a fundamental inequality in measure theory.
4. Established the Lévy–Prokhorov theorem, which related probability theory to algebraic topology.
5. Co-developed the Hille-Phillips theorem, which was an essential tool in establishing the existence of certain functions. 
6. Wrote the widely-referenced book, Functional Analysis and Semi-Groups, which is still widely cited. 
7. Developed the Hille-Yosida Integral Equation and the Hille-Neumann Theorem.

Born 28 June 1894, New York, USA. Died 12 February 1980, La Jolla, California, USA.
