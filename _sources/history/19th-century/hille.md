**Einar Carl Hille** was an American mathematician who worked on analysis and functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His name was Carl Einar Heuman and he was the son of Carl August Heuman, a civil engineer, and Edla Eckman.
* Hille's parents separated before his birth and he was brought up by his mother.
* The name Hille was simply a mistake for Heuman but Hille's mother adopted the name even although it came from an error and called herself Edla Hille.
* That was the name by which Einar Hille was always known.
* Hille did not meet his father until 1937.
* Although he was born in the United States, Hille's parents were Swedish.
* When Einar Hille was two years old his mother returned to Sweden and lived in Stockholm.
* Hille would spend the next 24 years of his life in Sweden only returning to the United States when he was 26 years old.
* In 1900 Einar entered the Palmsgrenska Samskola, a private school in Stockholm.
* Hille entered the University of Stockholm in 1911 with the intention of reading for a degree in chemistry.
* Hille made an impressive start to his career in chemistry with his first publication in 1913 being jointly with Euler-Chelpin.
* However, Hille decided that he did not have the necessary dexterity to make a career in a subject which involved delicate experiments.
* Hille was fortunate in not only having a world class chemist to work under in Stockholm, but also world class mathematicians.
* Hille was awarded his first degree in mathematics in 1913 and the equivalent of a Master's degree in the following year.
* Then Hille began working with Marcel Riesz on conformal mappings and submitted a thesis on that topic in 1916; for this he was awarded a Lic.
* In 1919 Hille was awarded the Mittag-Leffler prize for his outstanding contributions, and was given the right to teach at the University of Stockholm.
* Hille obtained a fellowship to work with Birkhoff in Harvard and he returned to the land of his birth in 1920, spending the academic year 1920-21 at Harvard where, as well as working with Birkhoff, he also studied with Kellogg.
* In academic year 1921-22 Hille was Benjamin Peirce Instructor at Harvard then, in 1922, he went to Princeton as an instructor.
* In 1923 Hille was promoted to assistant professor at Princeton, and in 1927 to associate professor.
* Kirsti and Einar had two children, both sons.
* Hille was appointed director of graduate studies in 1938 and he held this position, and his chair, at Yale until he retired in 1962.
* Hille's main work was on integral equations, differential equations, special functions, Dirichlet series and Fourier series.
* Among Hille's other texts were Analytic function theory Vol 1 (1959), Vol 2 (1964); Analysis Vol 1 (1964), Vol 2 (1966); Lectures on ordinary differential equations (1969); Methods in classical and functional analysis (1972); and Ordinary differential equations in the complex domain (1976).
* The book also contains a personal account of Hille's mathematical career which he gave at the Yale Colloquium in May 1962.
* Hille served as president of the American Mathematical Society (1937-38) and was the Society's Colloquium lecturer in 1944.

Born 28 June 1894, New York, USA. Died 12 February 1980, La Jolla, California, USA.
