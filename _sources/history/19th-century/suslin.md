**Mikhail Suslin** was a Russian mathematician who worked in general topology and descriptive set theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Devised the Suslin operation, also called the Suslin line, which deals with algebraic K-theory. 
2. Proved the Suslin matrix theorem, which provides a criterion for a matrix to be the identity matrix.
3. Introduced the N-functors, which is a method of associating an algebraic structure to a topological space.
4. Developed the result that the group algebra of a discrete group is projective and introduced the modular group to algebraic K-theory.
5. Developed the result that a natural product of two projective modules over a ring is again projective. 
6. Developed a theory for the H-space structure of topological groups and the algebraic version of this theory.

Born 15 November 1894, Krasavka, Balashov, Saratov Oblast, Russia. Died 21 December 1919, Krasavka, Balashov, Saratov Oblast, Russia.
