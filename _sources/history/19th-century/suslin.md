**Mikhail Suslin** was a Russian mathematician who worked in general topology and descriptive set theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Mikhail Yakovlevich, known to friends and family as Mishanya, was his parents' only child.
* At this school, situated across the road from the Suslins' home, he was taught by Vera Andreevna Teplogorskaya-Smirnova who quickly recognised Suslin's potential.
* She deserves great credit, not only for spotting his talents in the few months he studied there, but also in persuading the better-off people in the village to provide funds to allow Suslin to continue his education.
* This private school only opened in 1905 and, five years later while Suslin was still a pupil, it became a state grammar school.
* While attending the school in Balashov, Suslin lodged at the home of a merchant by the name of Bezborodov.
* In the summer of 1913, Suslin applied to the Department of Mathematics in the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of Moscow University and his application was approved.
* Beginning in session 1914-15, Suslin began to work with Nikolai Nikolaevich Luzin who had just returned to Moscow after studying at Göttingen for several years under Edmund Landau.
* Suslin was not the only student joining Luzin's group, for D E Menshov, A Ya Khinchin and P S Aleksandrov also joined.
* Medicine was to be the final part of this plan, and to this subject Suslin intended to devote his whole future life.
* Although only in his second year as an undergraduate, Suslin began to undertake research.
* Luzin suggested that his students work on Borel sets and asked Suslin to read Henri Lebesgue's 1905 paper Sur les functions representables analytiquement Ⓣ(On functions representable analytically).
* At the same time Suslin was working with P S Aleksandrov on a problem suggested by Luzin, namely investigating whether the converse of a result found by Aleksandrov was true.
* Aleksandrov had proved that every Borel set can be obtained by applying an operation (named an A-operation by Suslin) to a closed set.
* While reading Lebesgue's paper Suslin discovered that one of the lemmas (stated by Lebesgue without proof) was false.
* My extremely persistent speculations only ceased when it became known early in the autumn of 1916 that Suslin had constructed during that summer an example of an A-set that is not a B-set and so had inaugurated a new stage in the development of the whole descriptive theory of sets.
* In 1924 (five years after Suslin's death), AAA-sets were renamed Suslin sets by Felix Hausdorff in his new edition of Grundzüge der Mengenlehre Ⓣ(General set theory).
* Suslin graduated from Moscow University in 1917 with the top grade in every examination he took.
* In March 1917 Luzin requested that Suslin carry on his studies so that he might gain a professorship.
* During his studies at the university Suslin was mainly interested in the theory of functions of a real variable.
* Their existence until then had been denied by the French mathematical school following the errors in the classical memoir of Lebesgue which were also revealed by Suslin.
* Suslin knows the French and German languages.
* The request was granted but Suslin became worried about his future, with no financial assistance for his studies.
* It seems that Suslin's health was also causing him concern.
* Acting on his advice, A Ya Khinchin, D E Menshov and M Ya Suslin also moved there and, like Luzin, taught at the Ivanovo Polytechnic Institute.
* Suslin, however, did not get on well at Ivanovo and soon lost his job there.
* We need to look more deeply at why Suslin "did not get on well at Ivanovo".
* Even before going to Ivanovo, Suslin explained that he was ill but was still persuaded to take up a teaching position there.
* The severe cold and lack of food exacerbated Suslin's health problems.
* Therefore we all wish to have M Ya Suslin among our lecturers in the future, and we ask for the cooperation of the Council of Professors.
* Of course Suslin could not resign immediately so had to teach until 1 September.
* But he did not give it and did not support Suslin for a teaching post at Saratov.
* When Suslin did not get the post, he went away to his home in the country (in the Province of Saratov).
* Two further short papers by Suslin appeared after his death.

Born 15 November 1894, Krasavka, Balashov, Saratov Oblast, Russia. Died 21 December 1919, Krasavka, Balashov, Saratov Oblast, Russia.
