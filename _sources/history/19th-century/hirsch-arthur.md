**Arthur Hirsch** was a German mathematician (born in Königsberg) who worked on differential equations and hypergeometric functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Hirsch studied mathematics, physics and philosophy in his hometown and in Berlin.
* Hirsch acted as co-advisor and second examiner for a number of PhD theses between 1916 and 1926, but none of the PhD candidates became influential in mathematics.
* In 1909 Hirsch was listed as Deputy Head in the School Board minutes for the first time; he was re-elected every other year until 1921.
* Hirsch published a few papers in Mathematische Annalen, primarily on differential equations and integrals.
* Hirsch was a member of the Swiss Mathematical Society; he also attended some of the German Mathematical Society's annual meetings.
* Hirsch joined the organising committee of the first International Congress of Mathematicians in December 1896.
* At the meeting on 21 January 1897 Hurwitz and Rudio suggested that Hirsch join the reception committee (alongside Burkhardt and Gubler), partly in order to help deal with the congress publications.
* Like his colleagues Dumas and Franel, Hirsch was on the organising committee for the 1932 ICM in Zürich, but did not give a talk during the congress.
* Arthur Hirsch retired in 1936.

Born 19 July 1866, Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 18 November 1948, Zürich, Switzerland.
