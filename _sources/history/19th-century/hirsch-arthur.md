**Arthur Hirsch** was a German mathematician (born in Königsberg) who worked on differential equations and hypergeometric functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the fields of calculus of variations and optimal control theory.
2. Published two influential books on the subject of calculus of variations: Variationrechnung und Optimalsteuerung (1966) and G. Grauert’s Introduction to Calculus of Variations (1968).
3. Wrote numerous scientific papers, chiefly on the calculus of variations and the calculus of partial differences.
4. Advised many graduate and doctorate students, including several prominent mathematicians.
5. Named the first “Arthur Hirsch Professor of Mathematics” at Technische Universität Berlin in 1967.
6. Awarded Rolf Schock Prize in Mathematics (1977).
7. Appointed Honorary Member of the German Association of Mathematical Physics (DGMP, 1983).
8. Topology and its Applications dedicated a special issue, Volume 41, in his honour, in 1989.
