**Sergei Bernstein** was a Ukranian mathematician who made important contributions to partial differential equations, differential geometry, probability theory and approximation theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method of approximation theory that came to be known as Bernstein’s polynomials.
2. Advanced the study of multiple integrals, including introducing the concept of n-parametric integrals.
3. Discovered and formalized the Stone–Weierstrass theorem.
4. Formulated the Gutzmer–Marsden theorem. 
5. Established the concept of Bernstein sums. 
6. Established the concept of complete analytic functions. 
7. Successfully solved the problem of representing a continuous function by a series of trigonometric polynomials. 
8. Formulated the Schwartz–Kaplan theorem.

Born 5 March 1880, Odessa, Ukraine. Died 26 October 1968, Moscow, USSR.
