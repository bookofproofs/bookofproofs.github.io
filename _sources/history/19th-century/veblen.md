**Veblen** made important contributions to projective and differential geometry, and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Revolutionized the theory of non-euclidean geometry by developing the concept of involutes of a non-euclidean line.
2. Developed the notion of affine connection in Riemannian geometry and provided the first consistent treatment of the parallelity postulate.
3. Established important properties of continuous functions of two or more variables by inventing the Veblen axioms.
4. Introduced the concept of ordered fields including the notion of convex sets.
5. Led to the first measurable approach to a complete system of logical inference in the form of Veblen-Young's axiom of addition.
6. Developed the fundamental concept of integration on manifolds.
7. Pioneered the notion of abstract topology and founded modern axiomatic projective geometry.
8. Reinforced the work of earlier mathematicians by successfully providing the logical and axiomatic foundations of modern probability. 
9. Further advanced the understanding of group theory by introducing the fixed point theorem and proposing the first consistent definition of an abstract group. 
10. Developed the notion of game theory, the mathematical analysis of strategies in social interaction.

Born 24 June 1880, Decorah, Iowa, USA. Died 10 August 1960, Brooklyn, Maine, USA.
