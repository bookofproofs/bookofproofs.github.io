**Theodor Kaluza** was a German mathematician and physicist known for his work in five-dimensional space-time.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical foundation of a unified field theory, which combines the theories of general relativity and electromagnetism.
2. Proposed the fifth dimension of space-time.
3. Developed the concept of a metric space and the notions of scalar and vector density in curved space-time.
4. Founded mathematical theories regarding the relation between modern geometry and electricity.
5. Developed a mathematical model to relate gravitation and electromagnetism.
6. Pioneered the use of non-Euclidean geometry in physics.
7. Developed mathematical tools to measure space-time curvature.
8. Established mathematical concepts of scalar and vector forces in relation to gravitation and electromagnetism.

Born 9 November 1885, Opeln, Germany (now Opole, Poland). Died 19 January 1954, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany.
