**Philipp  von Seidel** was a German mathematician who worked on dioptics and mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed exact solutions to fluid dynamics problems, including the heat equation in an infinite system and the Navier-Stokes equation.
2. Instituted a system of secondary school mathematics instruction and examination based on his Reelle und ganze Arithmetik.
3. Used algebraic methods to generalize and extend numerical calculations of convergence series.
4. Provided handbooks for teachers of elementary mathematics and advanced calculus courses.
5. Developed fundamental concepts for the modern theory of differential equations.
6. Laid the foundations of the theory of power series, providing the first comprehensive theory of formal functions.
7. Pioneered the use of elliptic functions to study dynamical systems, leading him to formulate the equations of motion of a free rigid body, and provided the first modern treatment of Joukowski transformation theory.
8. Gave the first proof of the Prime Number Theorem.
9. Developed arithmetic-geometric mean iteration and applied it to the solution of second order differentials.
10. Systematically developed the concept of the limit of a sequence and founded the modern theory of limits.

Born 24 October 1821, Zweibr√ºcken, Germany. Died 13 August 1896, Munich, Germany.
