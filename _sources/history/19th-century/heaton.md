**Henry Heaton** was an American amateur mathematician who published a large number of elegant problems and puzzles.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Weaver Heaton, the son of Jacob Bowen Heaton (1786-1839) and Rachel Weaver (1787-1858), married Rebecca, the daughter of Isaac Sharp and Eliza Ann Naylor, on 26 October 1834 in Pennsylvania.
* Weaver and Rebecca Heaton had eight children: Emaline Heaton (born 1835); James Heaton (born 1838); Rachel Heaton (born 1840); Eliza Heaton (born 1842); Henry C Heaton (born 1846, the subject of this biography); William Naylor Heaton (born 1847); George Heaton (born 1851); and Ella M Heaton (born 1851).
* We note that George Heaton and Ella M Heaton were twins.
* Although we are unsure how he was related to the family, it is highly probable (given his surname Sharp) that he was a relation of Henry's mother.
* The 1860 census was taken on 17 July of that year and at that time Weaver and Rebecca Heaton together with seven of their eight children were still living at their home in Greenfield.
* Rachel was 18, Eliza 17, Henry 14, William 11, and twins George and Ella were 8 years of age.
* Henry Heaton began his two parallel careers at the age of eighteen.
* At the time of the 1870 census, taken on 29 July of that year, Heaton was living with the Sharps and their eight children aged between 8 and 26 years, who were all living in the family home.
* Heaton's occupation, as shown on the census form, was that of carpenter.
* By this time Heaton's parents had left Greenfield and were living in New Haven, Fayette County, Pennsylvania.
* Heaton moved to Des Moines to take up a position as a teacher and there he made the acquaintance of Hendricks who encouraged Heaton's interest in mathematics.
* Hendricks suggested that Heaton subscribe to the Yates County Chronicle and it was to this journal that he began to send solutions of mathematical problems posed in the Chronicle.
* It was Hendricks who taught Heaton the basic concepts of probability theory which he quickly mastered.
* In Volume 3, Part 3, Hendricks published a solution to the "Four Bricks Problem" and notes that Heaton has solved this problem.
* Heaton continued his contributions to the Annals.
* Between 1878 and 1894 Heaton posed, or published solutions to, several problems in The Mathematical Visitor.
* We noted that Heaton met Joel Hendricks when he (Heaton) was teaching at Des Moines in the early 1870s.
* Henry and Mary Ann Heaton had two children; Roy Henry Heaton (born 26 June 1876) and Emma Margaret Heaton (born 27 March 1884).
* The Heatons did not stay in Des Moines for long for in 1877-78 they were living in Sabula, Jackson County, Iowa, a town on the Iowa/Illinois border almost surrounded by the Mississippi River, where Heaton was Superintendent of Schools.
* By 1879 Heaton was living in Atlantic, Cass county, Iowa, a town between Omaha and Des Moines, and in 1881 in Perry, Iowa, about 40 km north west of Des Moines.
* In 1906 Heaton moved from Atlantic to Belfield, North Dakota.

Born 19 April 1846, Millsboro, Washington County, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 27 January 1927, Biddle, Power River County, Montana, USA.
