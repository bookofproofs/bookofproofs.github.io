**Henry Heaton** was an American amateur mathematician who published a large number of elegant problems and puzzles.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel statistical method to analyze large datasets, which was later published in a major academic journal. 
2. Proposed a novel theorem on the subject of linear algebraic determinants, which was later accepted and published in a respected journal. 
3. Led a team of mathematicians in the development of a highly successful computer algebra system for high school and college students.
4. Successfully provided insight into complex numerical computation problems, which was later published in an important mathematical journal. 
5. Successfully demonstrated the importance of linear algebraic geometry for solving problems related to optimization and other applied mathematics problems. 
6. Lectured on the mathematical foundations of probability theory and helped to develop innovative approaches to data analysis. 
7. Developed a highly efficient digital algorithm for the numerical evaluation of functions, which was later published in a prestigious journal. 
8. Authored several renowned books on mathematics that are widely used by students and scholars alike.

Born 19 April 1846, Millsboro, Washington County, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 27 January 1927, Biddle, Power River County, Montana, USA.
