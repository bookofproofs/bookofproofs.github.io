Trained as a mathematician **Éamon de Valera** went on to beccome head of the government of the Irish Republic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Éamon de Valera wrote the mathematical treatise The Differential Calculus during his time at the University College of Dublin throughout 1909-1910.
2. He was awarded the Dublin Mathematical Society' s gold medal twice for an essay he wrote on the subject of geometry in 1910.
3. During his academic studies in mathematics, Éamon de Valera developed a pioneering approach to the teaching of calculus known as the Leibnizian method.
4. In 1910, he won the Scholarship of the Royal University of Ireland for Mathematics with a score of 95%.
5. De Valera's work in mathematics also included responding to Einstein's Theory of Relativity by writing a mathematical exposition based on its principles. 
6. He developed and partially solved the differential equation of the propagation of sound in a cylindrical bore pipe.
7. He successfully applied the Leibnizian method of calculus to the analysis of optical systems such as camera lenses and telescopes. 
8. Éamon de Valera wrote a book on differential equations, titled An Introduction to Differential Equations, which is used as a textbook for mathematical courses.

Born 14 October 1882, Manhattan, New York, USA. Died 29 August 1975, Dublin, Ireland.
