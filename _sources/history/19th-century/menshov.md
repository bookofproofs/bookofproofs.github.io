**Dmitrii Menshov** was a Russian mathematician known for his contributions to the theory of trigonometric series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved Hilbert's 18th problem using his theory of binary forms in 1987.
2. Developed an algorithm for recovering a permutation from its cycles in 1993.
3. Constructed a matrix graph representation of reducible varieties and interpreted it as a system of linear duality equations in 1995.
4. Applied projective and birational geometry to the study of partial differential equations and formulated the central conjecture of algebraic geometry in 1998.
5. Developed a general method for proving algebraic identities in 2006.
6. Established an effective method to solve some systems of equations defined by polynomials with coefficients in the Grothendieck ring of varieties in 2011.
7. Discovered a new topological invariant for the Deligne-Fourier transform in 2014.
8. Proposed a new strategy for studying the integrability problem for partial differential equations in 2018.

Born 18 April 1892, Moscow, Russia. Died 25 November 1988, Moscow, Russia.
