**John Hopkinson** was an English mathematician and engineer who applied mathematics to electricity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an applied mathematics approach to forecasting ship-building costs. 
2. Refined the estimation of shipyardsâ€™ performance by combining several expressions of velocity and form. 
3. Conceived the entropy-maximizing perpetual motion machine, which revolutionized marine engineering. 
4. Co-discovered the Joule-Thomson Effect, a liquid gas-flow process in thermodynamics. 
5. Put forth the idea of equivalent resistance in electricity, heralding the field of electrical networks. 
6. Expounded on previously established theories of electrical resonance to explain the phenomenon of self-induction. 
7. Developed an analytical method for determining the shape of a cable under uniform tension, which became known as Hopkinson's Law. 
8. Played a vital role in the formation and adoption of the International System of Electrical Units of measurement.

Born 27 July 1849, Manchester, England. Died 27 August 1898, Evalona, Val d'Herens, Switzerland.
