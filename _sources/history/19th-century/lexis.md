**Wilhelm Lexis** studied data presented as a series over time thus initiating the study of time series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Despite the fact that his training up to this point had been a broad one, in 1861 Lexis went to Paris to study social sciences.
* In 1872 Lexis was appointed as professor of economics at the University of Strassburg.
* It was in Freiburg that Lexis made his major contributions to statistics.
* From 1876-79 Lexis studied data presented as a series over time.
* Lexis required a binomial dispersion for his series to be stable and this ruled out most interesting series.
* Rather than concentrate on any one of his diverse interests as his career progressed, Lexis studied and wrote on a wider and wider collection of topics.

Born 17 July 1837, Eschweiler (near Aachen), Germany. Died 25 October 1914, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany.
