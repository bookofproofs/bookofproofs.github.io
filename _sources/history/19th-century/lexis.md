**Wilhelm Lexis** studied data presented as a series over time thus initiating the study of time series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Lexis Paradox, a mathematical theorem showing that a population's constantly increasing growth rate may lead to a decrease in its average lifespan.
2. Introduced "statistical mechanics," which was a revolutionary approach to understanding population growth on the basis of average lifespans.
3. Constructed a mathematical "migratory equation" which could describe a population's overall migratory movements and population growth.
4. Demonstrated that the total sum of a population's lifespans is a measure of its population size.
5. Coined the term “Markov chain” to characterize a stochastic process modeled by a sequence of random variables.
6. Developed a deterministic model of population dynamics, which was known as the "Lexis Triangle".
7. Established the modern field of statistical demography, which seeks to understand social phenomena through mathematical and statistical models.

Born 17 July 1837, Eschweiler (near Aachen), Germany. Died 25 October 1914, Göttingen, Germany.
