**Thorvald Thiele**  was a Danish mathematician and astronomer. He worked in statistics, interpolation and the three-body problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Thorvald Thiele was a pioneer in the field of mathematical statistics, particularly with regard to the normal probability distribution.
2. He established the student's t-test, a tool used to test hypotheses on small samples, and introduced the delta method for approximating integrals.
3. He provided the first proof of the Gauss-Markov theorem, which describes the properties of best linear estimators derived from a normal distribution.
4. He proposed the use of least squares as a method for fitting curves to observed data.
5. Thiele developed methods for the derivation of multivariate normal distribution functions and for integration of multiple variables.
6. He derived a numerical approximation solution for nonlinear equations, the Thiele's solution.
7. Thiele formulated the Thieleâ€“Newcomb equation, a solution for the motion of a body under the influence of gravity and an aerodynamic drag force.
8. His demonstrations and remedies of the deficiencies of the least squares method, and his work in linear algebra were of foundational importance.

Born 24 December 1838, Copenhagen, Denmark. Died 26 September 1910, Copenhagen, Denmark.
