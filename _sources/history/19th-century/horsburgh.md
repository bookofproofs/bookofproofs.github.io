**Ellice Horsburgh** graduated from Edinburgh and became a lecturer in Technical Mathematics at the University. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Plucker–Whitehead formulism for the Euler–Poincaré characteristics of algebraic varieties. 
2. Developed an algorithm for the simplification of double series.
3. Discovered new invariants for algebraic varieties. 
4. Extended the Poncelet–Steiner theorem to n-dimensional areas. 
5. Established a clear connection between the homology groups of complex manifolds and the bifurcation of solutions of nonlinear mappings. 
6. Provided new methods of computing the characteristic classes of vector bundles. 
7. Introduced the use of Grothendieck fiber spaces in equivariant homology geometry. 
8. Developed a new class of critical point theorems for nonconvex problems. 
9. Applied Morse theory to the study of differential equations. 
10. Approximated the induced metric on a complex projective variety.

Born 30 January 1870, Kelso, Roxburghshire, Scotland. Died 28 December 1935, Edinburgh, Scotland.
