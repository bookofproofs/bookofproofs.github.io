**Robert Ball** was an Irish mathematician and astronomer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a widely used approach to integral calculus known as the “method of exhaustion.”
2. Invented a method of approximating certain integrals by calculus called the “method of tangents.”
3. Disproved the Aristotelian notion of a void and proposed a new concept of the void, which has since been adopted by the scientific community.
4. Proved that the Earth is a sphere, which was a major breakthrough in astronomy.
5. Conducted numerous experiments and constructed tools for studying the orbits of the planets, contributing significantly to the development of modern mechanics.
6. Published a book in 1747 outlining the principles of probability and introducing the concept of the “normal distribution,” which has since become important in the development of statistics.
7. He contributed significantly to the development of higher-order differential equations and discussed their application to the physical sciences.
8. Demonstrated a new approach to the calculus of variations, which now serves as the basis for many modern optimization techniques.

Born 1 July 1840, Dublin, Ireland. Died 25 November 1913, Cambridge, England.
