**Ion Ionescu** was a Romanian mathematician and engineer. He was one of the founders of the _Gazeta Matematica_ and contributed a remarkable number of articles and problems to the journal. One of these problems is now known as the Ionescu-Weitzenböck inequality. He is also famed as an engineer for building bridges.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Institute of Mathematics at the University of Bucharest in 1934.
2. Developed a system of absolute differential calculus that referenced number theory, geometry, and linear algebra.
3. Developed a method of determining an asymptotic evaluation of an integral by means of the theory of Fourier series.
4. Developed a method of approximating higher order linear differential equations with partial derivatives.
5. Developed an original method of selecting and studying constants that serve as coefficients that linked several mathematical branches such as analysis, algebra, and geometry.
6. Published mathematical works including important contributions on the theory of analytical functions, integral equations, hypergeometric functions, and other areas.
7. Authored several mathematical textbooks on different topics, such as mathematics and analytical mechanics.
8. Represented Romania at many international scientific conferences and served as president of the International Mathematical Union in 1949-1952.

Born 4 December 1870, Stoienoaia, Creata, Ilfov, Romania. Died 17 September 1946, Bucharest, Romania.
