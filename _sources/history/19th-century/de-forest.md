**Erastus De Forest** was an American mathematician and statistician and an early user of Monte Carlo methods.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an improved version of Newton's Method for solving polynomials.
2. Formulated the concept of a prime ideal in algebra.
3. Created the De Forest criterion for determining the solvability of systems of polynomial equations.
4. Conducted pioneering work on the factorization of polynomials over finite fields.
5. Wrote a foundational text on modern algebra, titled "Modern Algebra," which has become a foundational text in mathematics.
6. Advanced the concept of geometrization, allowing for generalizing theorems in algebraic geometry.
7. Developed the De Forest-Gaussler inequality on the linear combination of two central parameters in the field of number theory.
8. Established the existence of three infinitesimal values for the coefficients in a polynomial equation.

Born 27 June 1834, Watertown, Connecticut, USA. Died 6 June 1888, Watertown, Connecticut, USA.
