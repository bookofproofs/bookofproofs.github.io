**Robert d'Adhémar** was a French mathematician and philosopher of science and religion.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father, Marius d'Adhémar, worked for the French administration as a collector of taxes (receveur de l'enregistrement et des domaines) and, a few years before his son's birth, fought in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871.
* Robert d'Adhémar's mother was Louise Willelmine Grand d'Esnon.
* Although Robert was born into a protestant family and brought up as a protestant, he later converted to become a Roman Catholic.
* Robert d'Adhémar was awarded his baccalaureate in 1890 in Montpellier (Hérault, France).
* In 1902, the lectures of Émile Picard edited by Robert d'Adhémar were published under the title Leçons sur les séries à termes positifs, professées au Collège de France Ⓣ(Lectures on the series with positive terms, given at the College de France).
* Robert d'Adhémar defended his thesis on 22 April 1904 before a committee consisting of his supervisor Émile Picard, Jacques Hadamard and Édouard Goursat.
* In the case of the interior problem, Robert d'Adhémar used his new methods to confirm more quickly the formulas which Volterra had obtained.
* In a lecture to the International Congress of Mathematicians at Heidelberg in August 1904, Hadamard referred to the ideas in Robert d'Adhémar's thesis.
* In 1901, Robert d'Adhémar became Maître de Conférences (essentially equivalent to an assistant lecturer) at the Lille Catholic University.
* In 1902 he helped his friend, the mathematician Robert de Montessus de Ballore, to join the Catholic University of Lille when he proposed him to fill a vacancy as substitute for the Special Mathematics course.
* Moreover, in the same letter, Robert d'Adhémar explained to his friend that the course of Jules Drach at the University of Lille would be of a great interest for him to prepare for the agrégation.
* Robert d'Adhémar married Jeanne Marie Henriette Duhamel (born the 15 April 1881 and died the 20 August 1965) on 5 February 1904 in Merville.
* Robert d'Adhémar and his wife lived in Lambersart in the suburbs of Lille.
* Robert d'Adhémar became an officer in the general staff of the French Army in Italy during World War I.
* It was in 1901 that Robert d'Adhémar's first publications were published, namely the mathematical papers Sur une intégration par approximations successives Ⓣ(On integration by successive approximations) and Sur une classe d'équations aux dérivés partielles du second ordre Ⓣ(On a class of partial differential equations of the second order).
* In collaboration with Robert de Montessus, he wrote the two volume book Calcul numérique Ⓣ(Numerical calculation) (1911).
* Perhaps his most famous book was the two volume Lecons sur les principes de l'analyse par R d'Adhémar, professeur a la Faculté Libre des Sciences de Lille Ⓣ(Lessons on the principles of analysis of R Adhemar, professor at the Free Faculty of Sciences at Lille).

Born 1 November 1874, Saint Hippolyte-du-Fort, Gard, France. Died 9 July 1941, Nice, Côte d'Azur, France.
