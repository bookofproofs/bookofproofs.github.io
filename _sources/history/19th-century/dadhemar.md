2. Established the basic theory of the symmetric function.
3. Discovered the summation formulas for certain hypergeometric series.
4. Showed that linear recurrence relations could be solved in terms of series.
5. Proved an approach to the evaluations of multiple integrals.
6. Found an equation satisfied by the variance of a summation process.
7. Defined the notion of a power series functional equation.
8. Developed a procedure for proving exact solutions of a large number of differential equations.
9. Derived a general theorem for the sum of all the roots of a polynomial equation.
10. Applied his knowledge of recurrence to the solutions of ODEs.
