**Robert d'Adhémar** was a French mathematician and philosopher of science and religion.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Robert d'Adhémar was awarded his baccalaureate in 1890 in Montpellier (Hérault, France).
* In 1902, the lectures of Émile Picard edited by Robert d'Adhémar were published under the title Leçons sur les séries à termes positifs, professées au Collège de France Ⓣ(Lectures on the series with positive terms, given at the College de France).
* Robert d'Adhémar defended his thesis on 22 April 1904 before a committee consisting of his supervisor Émile Picard, Jacques Hadamard and Édouard Goursat.
* In the case of the interior problem, Robert d'Adhémar used his new methods to confirm more quickly the formulas which Volterra had obtained.
* In a lecture to the International Congress of Mathematicians at Heidelberg in August 1904, Hadamard referred to the ideas in Robert d'Adhémar's thesis.
* In 1901, Robert d'Adhémar became Maître de Conférences (essentially equivalent to an assistant lecturer) at the Lille Catholic University.
* In 1902 he helped his friend, the mathematician Robert de Montessus de Ballore, to join the Catholic University of Lille when he proposed him to fill a vacancy as substitute for the Special Mathematics course.
* Moreover, in the same letter, Robert d'Adhémar explained to his friend that the course of Jules Drach at the University of Lille would be of a great interest for him to prepare for the agrégation.
* Robert d'Adhémar became an officer in the general staff of the French Army in Italy during World War I.
* It was in 1901 that Robert d'Adhémar's first publications were published, namely the mathematical papers Sur une intégration par approximations successives Ⓣ(On integration by successive approximations) and Sur une classe d'équations aux dérivés partielles du second ordre Ⓣ(On a class of partial differential equations of the second order).
* In collaboration with Robert de Montessus, he wrote the two volume book Calcul numérique Ⓣ(Numerical calculation) (1911).
* Perhaps his most famous book was the two volume Lecons sur les principes de l'analyse par R d'Adhémar, professeur a la Faculté Libre des Sciences de Lille Ⓣ(Lessons on the principles of analysis of R Adhemar, professor at the Free Faculty of Sciences at Lille).

Born 1 November 1874, Saint Hippolyte-du-Fort, Gard, France. Died 9 July 1941, Nice, Côte d'Azur, France.
