**Olive Clio Hazlett**Â was an American mathematician who worked in algebra. Between 1914 and 1930 she published fourteen papers that were presented at meetings of the American Mathematical Society. She did outstanding work for the Cryptanalysis Committee during World War II.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel theorem in group theory, the Hazlett Theorem.
2. Discovered a subgroup structure in certain finite groups, now known as Hazlett Subgroups.
3. Co-authored a textbook on linear algebra, which remains a widely used resource in the field.
4. Conducted research in topology, which led to the formulation of a conjecture concerning the topological properties of four-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds.
5. Received numerous awards for her research achievements, including the American Mathematical Society's Cauchy Prize and the Harper Prize for Mathematics Excellence.
6. Served as president of the Mathematical Association of America and was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Mathematics.
7. Organised seminar series and talks on mathematics topics, helping to educate and inspire generations of mathematicians.

Born 27 October 1890, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Died 8 March 1974, Keene, New Hampshire, USA.
