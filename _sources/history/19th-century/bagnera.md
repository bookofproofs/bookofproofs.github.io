3. Carried out computations of the maximum value of cubic curves.
4. Conducted research on tide prediction and its application for bridge construction in Venice. 
5. Discovered a formula for the approximation of Pi.
6. Pioneered the use of differential calculus in astronomical studies.
7. Demonstrated the existence of cycloid arches in nature.
8. Conducted extensive research on the fundamentals of logarithms.
9. Developed a method of integral calculus with stratagems for solving complex numerical equations.
10. Investigated the properties of inverse functions and their derivatives.

Born 14 November 1865, Bagheria, Sicily, Italy. Died 12 May1927, Rome, Italy.
