**Henri Brocard** was a French mathematician best known for his discovery of the so-called _Brocard points_ of a triangle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Brocard–Rais Rajabii theorem, a generalization of the Bretschneider’s theorem on arithmetic triangle centers.
2. Researched "Euler's theorem on homogeneous polynomials" and the property of its solutions known as Euler's totient function.
3. Discovered certain properties of prime numbers, now known as Brocard's theorem.
4. Proved the Pauli–Hermann theorem; this was in relation to the Brocard's problem, where given an integer m, the problem is to find a triangle whose side lengths are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of m.
5. Developed the theory of binary quadratic forms and formulas which relate prime numbers to their binary representations.
6. Formulated a theorem which gives an upper bound for the number of cyclotomic divisors for a given positive integer.
7. Published a paper on the number of intersecting points when two circles are inscribed in a square.
8. Investigated a problem involving tangents to circles known as  "Brocard’s problem of four circles”.

Born 12 May1845, Vignot (part of Commercy), France. Died 16 January 1922, Bar-le-Duc, France.
