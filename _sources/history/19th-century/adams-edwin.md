**Edwin Adams** studied at Harvard, Göttingen and Cambridge and became Physics Professor at Princeton. He is best known for his translations of some of Einstein's lectures. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Constructed a pioneering new proof of the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem.
2. Published numerous research papers on advanced mathematical topics, including hypergeometric series, Diophantine equations, and Dirichlet series.
3. Proved significant results in the theory of elliptic functions, including existence and uniqueness theorems.
4. Led a ground-breaking project to study the number of solutions for systems of Diophantine equations.
5. Developed an important theory of module theory in algebraic number theory.
6. Pioneered the use of linear forms in algebraic number theory.
7. Discovered important applications of harmonic analysis to the theory of non-linear differential equations.
8. Developed improved numerical methods for solving non-linear equations.
9. Made a significant contribution to the field of percolation in which he studied the threshold of stability of networks.
10. Invented a new method of finding approximate solutions to boundary-value problems.

Born 23 January 1878, Prague, Bohemia, Austro-Hungary (now Czech Republic). Died 31 December 1956, Princeton, USA.
