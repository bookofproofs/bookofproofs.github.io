**John Henry Michell** was an Australian mathematician, who made important contributions to the fields of hydrodynamics and elasticity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of elliptic integrals, and was the first to properly express the solution in terms of logarithms.
2. His work on elliptic integrals earned him a diploma from the Paris Academy in 1829.
3. He solved some of the most difficult mathematical problems of his day, including the wave equation, Fourier's theorem, the Fermat equation, the Riemann Hypothesis, and the Pólya-Szegő conjecture.
4. Founded the wave theory of light, which explained the wave-like nature of light.
5. Invented a new method of electrostatic computation in 1820, which greatly enhanced the accuracy of calculations of electric fields. 
6. Published papers on analysis, differential equations, probability, geodesics and the geometry of curved surfaces. 
7. Made significant contributions to number theory, including the earliest explicit calculations of Bernoulli numbers. 
8. First to hypothesize on the binomial theorem, exploring mathematical induction and the principle of least squares. 
9. Achieved math breakthroughs, taking the then-unknown equation for an ellipse and transforming it into a form that could be more easily understood.

Born 26 October 1863, Maldon, Victoria, Australia. Died 3 February 1940, Camberwell, Victoria, Australia.
