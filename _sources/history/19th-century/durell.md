**Clement V Durell** was an English schoolmaster famous for his mathematical textbooks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Clement was born in the rectory at Fulbourn, the fifth of his parents sons.
* Durell was educated at Felsted School and, while still at school, he published his first note in the Mathematical Gazette, the journal of the Mathematical Association.
* Durell joined the Mathematical Association in 1900, the year in which he entered Clare College, Cambridge, to study mathematics.
* Soon after taking up this post Durell's first textbook Elementary Problem Papers (1906) was published.
* Rather than list all the many works that Durell produced, we prefer to take a closer look at two of them.
* A Book For Non-Specialists which Durell first published with G Bell & Sons in 1926.
* It is worth noting that the first text in English on relativity was by Eddington in 1923 so Durell's text came very early.
* This edition of the book contains a Preface written by Freeman J Dyson who was a former pupil of Durell.
* For the second of our more detailed looks at one of Durell's texts let us consider Advanced Trigonometry which was also originally published by G Bell & Sons.
* This work was a collaboration of Durell and Alan Robson who taught at Marlborough College and was a major figure in the Mathematical Association.
* In contrast to his great success as a teacher and as a textbook writer, Durell did not excel in the role of housemaster.
* Not only did Durell resume writing articles for the journal of the Mathematical Association but he also began to take an active part its work.

Born 6 June 1882, Fulbourn, near Cambridge, England. Died 10 December 1968, South Africa.
