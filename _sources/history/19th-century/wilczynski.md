**Ernest  Wilczynski** was an American mathematician who may be considered the founder of projective differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Wilczynski attended schools in Chicago, but rather than take his university education in the United States he returned to Germany to study at the university of Berlin.
* Wilczynski was taught at Berlin by some outstanding mathematicians including Fuchs, Hensel, Planck, Pringsheim, Schlesinger and Schwarz.
* In 1902 Wilczynski was promoted to assistant professor at Berkeley, then in 1906 to associate professor.
* During the years from 1903 to 1905 Wilczynski worked in Europe as associate of the Carnegie Institution.
* Wilczynski moved to the University of Illinois in 1907, then in 1910 he was appointed to Chicago filling a vacancy caused by the death of Maschke in 1908.
* Wilczynski began his research career as a mathematical astronomer.
* However, Wilczynski's main work was in projective differential geometry and ruler surfaces.
* But Wilczynski was the first ever to appreciate, demonstrate and exploit the utility of completely integrable systems of linear homogeneous differential equations for projective differential geometry.
* Wilczynski received many honours for his outstanding research contributions.
* It is not only as a research mathematician that Wilczynski excelled.

Born 13 November 1876, Hamburg, Germany. Died 14 September 1932, Denver, Colorado, USA.
