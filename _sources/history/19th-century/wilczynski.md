**Ernest  Wilczynski** was an American mathematician who may be considered the founder of projective differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the fundamental theory of differential equations of higher order.
2. His study of integral equations pioneered the theory of linear integral equations.
3. Identified the concepts of power series, asymptotic expansions, and analytic functions.
4. Provided the fundamental basis for the systematic analysis of nonlinear differential equations.
5. Established the basic theory for obtaining approximate equations for the numerical calculation of dynamical systems.
6. Developed the foundations of infinite series, contour integration, and bounding theorems for analytical functions.
7. Advanced the logic of the calculus of variations and formulated the calculus of extremal and boundary value problems.
8. Introduced new analytical techniques for dealing with nonlinear partial differential equations.
9. Developed improved techniques in incremental techniques using finite differences, interpolation, and numerical integration.
10. Pioneered the unified treatment of integrals, derivatives and equations.

Born 13 November 1876, Hamburg, Germany. Died 14 September 1932, Denver, Colorado, USA.
