**Philip Stein** was a Lithuanian-born mathematician who became a professor of mathematics in South Africa. He worked on the theory of functions of real and complex variables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Philip Stein solved two of the most famous unsolved mathematical problems of the 20th century: Hilbert's 10th problem and the Nullstellensatz Conjecture.
2. He is credited with foundational contributions to the field of algorithmic algebraic complexity theory.
3. Stein developed new methods for solving number-theoretic problems, particularly those involving Diophantine equations.
4. He published several influential papers on algebraic geometry and arithmetic algebraic geometry.
5. Stein made pioneering contributions to computational algebraic geometry, devising effective algorithms for the computation of Gröbner bases.
6. He also invented a number of algorithms for the fast multiplication of polynomials.
7. Stein worked on the development of improved methods for computing Grothendieck groups.

Born 25 January 1890, Germeneitz (near Švėkšna), Šilutė District Municipality, Klaipeda County, Lithuania. Died 7 January 1974, London, England.
