**Ludwig Sylow** was a high school teacher who proved what is perhaps the most profound result in the theory of finite groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved what is now known as Sylow’s Theorems, which provide a way of classifying finite groups of a particular order.
2. Developed Sylow’s Second Theorem, which states that any group of a prime order is necessarily a prime group.
3. Proved a theorem of the conjugacy of subgroups and showed that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the overall group.
4. Demonstrated that a group of order p^2 can always be decomposed into two cyclic groups of order p.
5. Developed Sylow’s Third Theorem, which states any group of prime-power order contains a subgroup of the same order.
6. Showed that any group of order n, wheren is a prime, must have a subgroup of order n -1.
7. Discovered that any group of order p^2, where P is a prime, must have a normal subgroup of order p.
8. Proved that any group of order p^3, where p is a prime, must have a normal subgroup of order p^2.
9. Proved that any group of order p^n (where p is a prime) necessarily has a normal subgroup of order p^k, for some k satisfying 1 ≤ k < n.

Born 12 December 1832, Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. Died 7 September 1918, Christiania (now Oslo), Norway.
