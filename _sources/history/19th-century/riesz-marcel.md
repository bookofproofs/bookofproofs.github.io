**Marcel Riesz** was a Hungarian-born mathematician who worked on summation methods, potential theory and other parts of analysis, as well as number theory and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the 1927 book "Foundations of Functional Analysis", a foundational work in modern mathematics.
2. Developed the scientific field of "functional analysis," which centers on the concept of vector spaces and linear transformations within them.
3. Established the concept of vector spaces of continuous functions and their basis, integral equations of the first kind, and generalized theorem of mean-value.
4. Discovered distinctive associated with what is now called the "Riesz transform," which is the foundation of the theory of Lipschitz and Sobolev spaces.
5. Co-authored the "Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences" with Joe Székely, providing a deep insight into the modern mathematical ideas and methods. 
6. Developed the principle of duality in vector spaces, and is best known for the theorem describing duality between Hilbert space and its dual space. 
7. Proposed the Riesz-Frechet theorem to prove the equivalence between the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the uniform convergence of a Fourier series.
8. Published the 1967 book "Principles of Functional Analysis," a classic in modern mathematics.

Born 16 November 1886, Györ, Hungary. Died 4 September 1969, Lund, Sweden.
