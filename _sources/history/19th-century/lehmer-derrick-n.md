**Derrick Norman Lehmer** was an American mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the use of primitive roots in modular arithmetic and number theoretic analysis.
2. Developed the "first tests for Fermat's last theorem" for small numbers and the application of continued fractions.
3. Authored numerous books and papers on number theory and special functions, including "Elementary Number Theory with Applications" and "Frobenius Primitive Roots in Number Fields".
4. Founded the "Lehmer Number Centre" to further research into number theory.
5. Designed algorithms for logic problems and the continued fraction expansion of certain irrational numbers.
6. Developed a method of correcting the rounding-off errors encountered during the calculations of certain transcendental functions.
7. Authored the highly acclaimed "Continued Fractions Photographic Series", which is considered a monograph.
8. Created the algorithm 'Lehmer sieve', which is used to calculate prime numbers.

Born 27 July 1867, Somerset, Indiana, USA. Died 8 September 1938, Berkeley, California, USA.
