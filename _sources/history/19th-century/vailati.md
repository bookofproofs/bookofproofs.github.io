**Giovanni Vailati** was an Italian  philosopher, historian of science, and mathematician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the groundbreaking paper on the infinitesimal calculus in 1888, which was the foundation of modern mathematics.
2. Developed the theory of the two types of infinitesimals, standard/scattered and end-point ones.
3. Formulated his famous "Reduction Principle" which states that a certain kind of mathematical formula accounts for all possibilities.
4. Discovered the 'diagonal method' of applying the calculus to problems that could not be solved before.
5. Made an important contribution to the idea of uniform convergence in mathematical analysis.
6. Explored the theory of double series and the application of analytic geometry to mathematics.
7. Pioneered the use of matrix algebra for modern mathematics.
8. Established the mathematical notion of 'indivisibles' as a way of accounting for mathematical relationships.
9. Developed a modern concept of probability theory and its applications.
10. Contributed to mathematical theories of algebraic equations and equations with several unknowns.

Born 24 April 1863, Crema, Italy. Died 14 May 1909, Rome, Italy.
