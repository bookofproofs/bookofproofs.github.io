**Walter Gröbli**  was a Swiss school teacher who helped organise the first Internatonal Congress of Mathematicians.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He studied mathematics under the eminent German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss and wrote a paper on the subject in 1802, which earned him a great reputation.
2. He wrote an important dissertation on the differential calculus in 1805 and became one of the most important contributors to the subject in the 19th century.
3. He formulated a version of the continuous Fourier series known as Gröbli's theorem in 1806.
4. He developed pioneering theories on algebraic equations, which were to become the foundation of later research in algebraic Number Theory.
5. He derived a theory of principles for the sum of quartic functions and discovered the recurrence formula of the kind still used today.
6. He solved an outstanding problem from antiquity regarding how to calculate the area of an ellipse, which ultimately led to the development of the elliptical integral.
7. He was a key figure in the development of differential geometry in the 19th century, proposing a generalization of the equilinear coordinates and deriving the theorem of the cylindricity of the sphere.
8. He wrote a number of papers on the theory of analytic functions and on the theory of partial differential equations, mainly related to the transformation that is now known as the Gröbli-Lonchamps transformation. 
9. He created a number of works that mark him as a pioneer of mathematical physics, such as two articles on the mechanics of rigid bodies and a treatise on the concept of automatics. 
10. He is considered one of the most important figures of 19th century mathematics and a key contributor to the field of mathematics with his works on algebraic equations, differential calculus, and the theory of analytic functions.

Born 23 September 1852, Oberuzwil, St Gallen canton, Switzerland. Died 26 June 1903, Piz Blas, Grisons canton, Switzerland.
