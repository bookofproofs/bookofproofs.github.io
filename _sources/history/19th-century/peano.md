**Giuseppe Peano** was the founder of symbolic logic and his interests centred on the foundations of mathematics and on the development of a formal logical language.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the foundational terms and concepts of modern mathematical logic, such as quantifiers and the logical formula. 
2. Contributed to the axiomatization of mathematics.
3. Introduced the modern notation for the logical expression of propositions, including the symbol for the exclusive or (the Sheffer stroke).
4. Was a key figure in introducing modern (axiomatic) set theory, especially with his 1888 theory on the one-to-one correspondence between sets.
5. Formulated the Peano axioms which laid the groundwork for modern definitions of natural numbers.
6. Proved the existence of an infinite set of prime numbers.

Born 27 August 1858, Cuneo, Piemonte, Kingdom of Sardinia (now Italy). Died 20 April 1932, Turin, Italy.
