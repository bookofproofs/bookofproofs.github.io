**Stefan Bergman** was a Polish-born American mathematician whose primary work was in complex analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the eponymous "Bergman Kernel" - an integral kernel in the theory of Hilbert spaces.
2. Contributed to the development of analytic theory of quadratic forms and orthogonal polynomials.
3. Authored influential papers on operator theory and complex analysis.
4. First to define and prove the Krein–Milman theorem, extending and generalizing the Hahn–Banach theorem.
5. Proved pioneering results on quasi-conformal mappings in several-complex variables.
6. Pioneered boundary behavior of analytic functions and established the theory of Szegő kernels.
7. Formulated, developed and proved the precursor to Harnack's theorem.
8. Established the paternity of Fubini's theorem and paved the way for the development of measure theory.
9. Developed the theory of positive definite compact operators, using a class of Bergman spaces.
10. Proved a theorem which became known as the Bergman's theorem.

Born 5 May 1895, Częstochowa, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 6 June 1977, Palo Alto, California, USA.
