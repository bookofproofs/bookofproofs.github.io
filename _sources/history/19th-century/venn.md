**John Venn** was an English mathematician and logician best known for the Venn diagrams which can be used to visualise the unions and intersections of sets.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
John Venn is a famous English logician and philosopher who made huge contributions to the field of mathematics. His most notable achievements include: 
1. Developed the Venn diagram, a visual representation of relationships between sets of data. 
2. Contributed to the development of Boolean logic and Boolean algebra. 
3. Published the 1866 book ‘Symbolic Logic’, which is still used in modern day mathematics.
4. Devised the Gregorian Calendar, a reform of the Julian calendar in 1582.
5. Published ‘On the Logic of Chance’ in 1888, which contains fundamental insights into the mathematical field.
6. Discovered the causes of the Permian-Triassic extinction event and described the extinction of species in ‘On the Law of Nature’.
