**Beppo Levi** was an Italian mathematician who wrote articles on logic, differential equations, complex variable, as well as on the border between analysis and physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Italian school of algebraic geometry, the first in Europe.
2. Developed the algebraic-geometric method, which was a precursor to modern algebraic geometry.
3. Showed how mathematical analysis could be applied to problems of algebraic geometry.
4. Established a method for solving partial differential equations.
5. Defined the modern theory of distributions and generalized the notion of a function.
6. Proved the fundamental theorem of invariant theory.
7. Developed the concept of the dual space and its use in the calculus of variations.
8. Established the theory of implicit functions and their applications to geometry.
9. Pioneered the use of the Hopf-Riemann theorem in complex analysis.
10. Demonstrated how to determine the solutions of unsteady partial differential equations using contributions from harmonic analysis and parabolic equations.

Born 14 May 1875, Turin, Italy. Died 18 August 1961, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina.
