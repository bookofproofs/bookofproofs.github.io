**Hans Reichenbach** was a German philosopher of science and proponent of logical empiricism.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Reichenbach–Keisler theorem, the first result to legitimize the use of non-standard models in mathematics.
2. Formulated a theory of probability based on the belief that probability is dependent on expectations and that it is subjective.
3. Reconstructed, edited and published important works of the 19th century mathematician Richard Dedekind.
4. Proposed an axiomatic basis for constructive mathematics, which established a foundation of mathematics based on intuitionistic logic.
5. Developed a mathematical philosophy informing future generations of mathematicians.
6. Authored groundbreaking books such as The Theory of Probability (1921, 1958), Experience and Prediction (1937) and The Philosophy of Space and Time (1958).

Born 26 September 1891, Hamburg, Germany. Died 9 April 1953, Los Angeles, California, USA.
