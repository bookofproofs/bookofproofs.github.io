**Woolsey Johnson** was an American text-book writer and one of the founders of the New York Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an innovative approach to studying the interrelationship between linear algebra and analytic geometry. 
2. Pioneered the development of the concept of matrices for representing a system of linear equations. 
3. Pioneered the development of numerical methods for solving linear equations in many variables. 
4. Developed the inverse matrix theorem, proving the rectangular matrix associated with the inverse of a square matrix has the same reduced row echelon form as the original matrix.
5. Developed the Gaussian-Jordan elimination method which is still used to solve systems of equations. 
6. Created the field of statistical matrix analysis and proved the existence of rank-one solutions. 
7. Authored influential textbooks related to linear algebra, analytic geometry, and related mathematical topics.

Born 23 June 1841, Owego, Tioga County, New York,USA. Died 14 May 1927, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
