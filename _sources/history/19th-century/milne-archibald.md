**Archibald Milne** graduated from Edinburgh University and taught at the Church of Scotland Training College in Edinburgh. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra, demonstrating the relationships between algebra and calculus.
2. He produced the first complete treatments of the calculus of variations and the analytic geometry of three dimensions.
3. He developed the methods for solving higher order equations.
4. He developed the techniques of integration of many classes of differential equations, including Schwarz's theorem.
5. He worked with and extended many of the mathematical methods of Laplace, Lagrange, and Hamilton.
6. He wrote the first textbook in English on the calculus of finite differences.
7. He co-founded the British Mathematical Association and he was the first President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
8. He wrote collaboratively with George Salmon on the first Oxford edition of Newton's Principia.

Born 30 April 1875, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 19 September 1958, Edinburgh, Scotland.
