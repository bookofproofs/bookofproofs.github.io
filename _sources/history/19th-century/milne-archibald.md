**Archibald Milne** graduated from Edinburgh University and taught at the Church of Scotland Training College in Edinburgh.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Archibald Milne attended St James' Episcopal School, Broughton Street, Edinburgh.
* Milne was appointed to the Church of Scotland Training College in Edinburgh in 1899, becoming a Mathematical Lecturer there in 1903.
* The College became the Provincial Teachers Training College in 1907 and Milne became the Head of the Department of Mathematics.
* In 1929 Milne gave an address at James Gillespie's Commercial Institute.
* "It is now possible to obtain a complete free education from the infant school where all learn the interesting fact that a cat sat on a mat - right up to the University, with its many faculties and its numerous degrees." So said Dr Archibald Milne in an address at the formal closing concert of James Gillespie's Commercial Institute, held in the School Hall, Bruntsfield Links, Edinburgh, last night (Wednesday 20 March 1929).
* It seemed to him, said Dr Milne, that the continuation class system fulfilled two well-defined functions.
* Continuing, Dr Milne said that the very fact that they now had such a complete course of free education had brought about a demand that it should be turned to use.
* Medallist in Mathematics, Natural Philosophy and Chemistry, and holder of the Donald Fraser Bursary in Natural Philosophy and of the John Edward Baxter Scholarship in Mathematics, Dr Milne in 1899 took his M.A. with First-Class Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, and in 1901 his B.Sc. with distinction in Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Geology.
* Milne joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in December 1898, shortly after graduating with his first degree.

Born 30 April 1875, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 19 September 1958, Edinburgh, Scotland.
