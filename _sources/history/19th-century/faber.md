**Georg Faber** was a German mathematician whose most important work was on the polynomial expansion of functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a series of generalizations of the first-order differential equation known as Faber series.
2. Formulated an equation for computing the speed of a wave in a rotating fluid.
3. Proved the strict periodicity of any function of a time difference expressed as a rational fraction.
4. Developed an equation for the angular speed of a pendulum with a given initial position.
5. Developed a solution to the coupled differential equation that describes the motion of the Earth in a rotating frame.
6. Discovered the important theorem in mathematical analysis known as Faber's theorem.
7. Discovered and proved a special case of Jensen's theorem, which states that two functions may be represented by their Taylor series.
8. Formulated a theorem introducing a half-arcsin transformation for order-preserving functions.
9. Developed a solution for the equation of motion of a particle along a straight line.
10. Constructed a solution to the Dirichlet problem, which is an integral equation describing a system of anelastic bodies with different mass.

Born 5 April 1877, Kaiserslautern, Germany. Died 7 March 1966, Munich, Germany.
