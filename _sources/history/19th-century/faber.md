**Georg Faber** was a German mathematician whose most important work was on the polynomial expansion of functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Faber's most important work was on the polynomial expansion of functions.
* These polynomials are now known as 'Faber polynomials' and first appear in Faber's 1903 paper Über polynomische Entwickelungen Ⓣ(On polynomial developments)  published in Mathematische Annalen.
* In fact Faber was building on the idea of Archimedes who computed approximately using a hierarchy of polygonal approximations of a circle.
* Only in the 1980s was Faber's idea seen to be an important ingredient for the efficient solution of partial differential equations.
* Most of Faber's publications are in function theory.
* One further achievement of Faber is worthy of mention.
* Two mathematicians independently verified Rayleigh's conjecture, Faber and Edgar Krahn.
* Faber was also interested in mathematical education and he worked with his colleague von Dyck at Munich on the mathematical education of engineers, physicists and mathematicians.
* In addition to his research areas, Faber lectured on complex analysis, probability theory, the theory of relativity and analytical mechanics.
* Faber had many interests outside mathematics.

Born 5 April 1877, Kaiserslautern, Germany. Died 7 March 1966, Munich, Germany.
