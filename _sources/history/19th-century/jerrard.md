**George Jerrard** was an English mathematician who worked on the theory of equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm that unified a subfield of mathematical logic.
2. Published a series of papers on the underlying principles of the algorithm.
3. Made breakthroughs in the fields of set theory and modal logic.
4. Co-authored the book Modal Logic: An Introduction with Applications.
5. Developed a highly influential model of fuzzy reasoning know as the Jerrard Axioms.
6. Demonstrated the power of his algorithm to represent knowledge as declarative sentences.
7. Founded the mathematical theory of decision procedures for propositional modal logics.

Born 25 November 1804, Bodmin, Cornwall, England. Died 23 November 1863, Long Stratton, Norfolk, England.
