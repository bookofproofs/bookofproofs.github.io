**Richard Dedekind**'s major contribution was a redefinition of irrational numbers in terms of Dedekind cuts. He introduced the notion of an ideal in Ring Theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the groundbreaking work, "Continuity and Irrational Numbers" (1872), which established the modern foundations of the theory of real numbers and the concept of continuity.
2. Developed the idea of the “Dedekind cut”, which uses cuts to divide the real numbers into two subsets. 
3. Discovered the idea that every infinite set can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with a proper subset of itself. 
4. Developed the concept of infinity as an actual mathematical number, rather than a theoretical concept.
5. Published the book, What Are and What Should Be the Numbers (1887), which outlines his theories of the theory of real numbers and algebraic numbers, as well as other topics such as the nature of irrational numbers. 
6. Provided insights into the notions of set theory, which would eventually lead to the development of the axiomatic approach to mathematics.
7. Contributed to the modern definition of a function and is credited with laying the foundations for mathematical analysis. 
8. Published the paper, Essays on the Theory of Numbers (1896), which laid out many of his now accepted theories, such as the irrationality of the square root of two.

Born 6 October 1831, Braunschweig, duchy of Braunschweig (now Germany). Died 12 February 1916, Braunschweig, duchy of Braunschweig (now Germany).
