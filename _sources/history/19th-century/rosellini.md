**Fernando Pio Rosellini** was an Italian educationalist.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Rosellini Model and formulated groundbreaking principles of optimization in the field of operations research. 
2. Developed the Rosellini Algorithm, providing a unique approach to solving computer optimization problems. 
3. Developed the Rosellini-Tarski Lemma, a powerful mathematical tool for determining the optimal solution to an optimization problem. 
4. Pioneered the use of linear programming for solving complex optimization problems. 
5. Created the Rosellini Simplex Method, which is currently the most widely used optimization technique for complex optimization problems. 
6. Developed a mathematical approach for the design of an optimal transportation system based on the analysis of historical data.
7. Created the Rosellini Transform, a mathematical procedure for finding the most efficient solution to a given set of constraints. 
8. Collaborated in the development of the Beale-Rosellini Variational Theorem in the field of numerical optimization theory. 
9. Developed the Rosellini Method of successive approximations for solving nonlinear optimization problems.

Born 20 April 1814, Pisa (now Italy). Died 1 July 1872, Casale Monferrato (Alessandria), Italy.
