**Frank Baldwin** was an American who invented a pinwheel calculator.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Shortly after he began his studies, however, his father was seriously injured in an accident, and Baldwin had to leave the College to take over the running of the family architectural business.
* Baldwin's life as an inventor began soon after he left Union College and, in 1855, he applied for a patent on a self-coupler for railway carriages.
* Abraham Lincoln, the President, had asked volunteers to sign up for three months, and this is what Baldwin did.
* At this stage Baldwin did not volunteer for further service, however, and he left Carlyle and returned to Fort Wayne, Indiana.
* In 1869 Baldwin moved to St Louis to become the manager of the lumber firm Peck's Planning Mills.
* In 1872 he married Mary K Denniston who came from Williamsport, Pennsylvania; they had six children including Frank (born 1874), Emma (born 1878), Eugene (born 1880) and Blanche (born 1888).
* Frank and Mary had met while Mary was visiting relatives in St Louis.
* In the year following their marriage, they moved to Philadelphia where Baldwin rented a small shop and began to build his calculating machines.
* Newcomb studied the operation of the calculator and highly complimented Baldwin on his invention.
* In fact the basic ideas of Baldwin's calculator were taken up by Willgodt Theophile Odhner from Sweden.
* very similar in design to the Baldwin machine and embodying the two distinctive features of Mr Baldwin's invention, the cam operated radial pins and the sliding wedge carrying mechanism.
* Otherwise the disposition of parts and operation are very similar to those of the Baldwin machine.
* Baldwin did not entirely concentrate on calculating machines for he was granted a U.S. Patent for a Cement Mixer on 12 May 1891, and for a Roundabout on 7 June 1892.
* However, he returned to further inventions relating to the calculator and he was awarded a U.S. Patent for the Baldwin Computing Engine on 9 January 1900.
* Baldwin designed a listing machine in 1905 with only ten keys and a spacer.
* After the award of a further Patent in 1908 for the Baldwin Recording Calculator, which combined the listing facilities of the 1905 machine with a calculator, he collaborated with Jay Randolph Monroe, of the Western Electric Company in New York City, from 1911 onwards.
* Together they added a keyboard and modified Baldwin's Recording Calculator so that it was suitable for commercial production.
* Monroe purchased the rights to the computer from Baldwin and began selling the calculator under the name Model G.

Born 10 April 1838, New Hartford, Connecticut, USA. Died 8 April 1925, Denville, New Jersey, USA.
