**William Rowan Hamilton** was an Irish astronomer and mathematician who discovered the quaternions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Hamilton developed the theory of quaternions, which extend vectors from three-dimensional to four-dimensional spaces.
2. Hamilton provided the first rigorous mathematical treatment of classical mechanics. 
3. Hamilton created the general theory of linear transformations. 
4. Hamilton developed a calculus of three-dimensional systems, now referred to as vector calculus.
5. Hamilton showed the equivalence of several quaternion formulas to trigonometric functions. 
6. Hamilton invented Hamilton's principle, a method for solving certain types of dynamic problems.
7. Hamilton solved various problems in optics, such as finding solutions to the paraxial optical equation. 
8. Hamilton produced several publications related to mathematics, such as a collection of lectures (Lectures on Quaternions) and a textbook on the calculus of variations (Elements of Quaternions).

Born 4 August 1805, Dublin, Ireland. Died 2 September 1865, Dublin, Ireland.
