**Hjalmar Mellin**  was a Finnish mathematician and functional theorist.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published his famous paper in 1895 on the Dirichlet series and its application to the Riemann zeta function.
2. Developed a special class of Abelian integrals, now known as Mellin integrals. 
3. Established relationships between the theory of elliptic functions, Gamma functions and elliptic integrals.
4. Discovered a generalization of the Fractional Calculus.
5. Developed the formulas for the partial realization of entire transcendental functions.
6. Was the first to prove the existence of an inverse for some integrals of Gauss hypergeometric types.
7. Was one of the first to demonstrate the helicity patterns of monochromatic light in a polarizing microscope.
8. Provided the first complete proof of Titchmarsh’s theorem on the zeros of Dirichlet series.
9. Proposed the Condensate Method in analytical mechanics which simplified the theorems of Cauchy and Poisson. 
10. Developed the theory of the "Mellin transform" leading to the generalization of the Laplace transform.

Born 19 June 1854, Liminka, Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland. Died 5 April 1933, Helsinki, Finland.
