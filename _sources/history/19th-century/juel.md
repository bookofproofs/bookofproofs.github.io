**Christian Juel** was a Danish mathematician, specializing in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the notion of ab initio mathematics, an approach that eschewed reliance on Euclid's axioms and focused instead on independently justifying all theorems from a few simple principles of arithmetic.
2. First proposed the inclusion of complex numbers in a higher dimensional algebraical structure.
3. Developed his own geometric calculus, which established the foundations for Euclidean space.
4. Constructed an algebra of continuous functions, which was the forerunner of the modern theory of functional analysis.
5. Founded a school of mathematics in Copenhagen, where he taught a generation of students the fundamentals of mathematics.
6. Published influential mathematical texts, such as Analytical Extracts, a comprehensive survey of algebraic analysis.
7. Pioneered the fields of complex analysis and probability theory, laying the foundations for modern mathematics.  
8. Worked with the Bernoulli's to develop the Calculus of Variations, which studied the optimization of certain kinds of problems.
9. Established the first calculus of probability, which served as a foundation for modern mathematics of probability.
10. Contributed to the unified field of mathematics by blending algebraic, algebraic-geometric, and geometric approaches.

Born 25 January 1855, Randers, Denmark. Died 24 January 1935, Copenhagen, Denmark.
