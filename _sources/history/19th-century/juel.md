**Christian Juel** was a Danish mathematician, specializing in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Andreas Juel was born on 15 July 1822 in Copenhagen, Denmark, and married Augusta Sofie Hanne Caroline Emilie J端rgensen in 1853.
* Christian was the eldest of his parents' two children having the younger sister Theodora Sophie Juel who was born in 1856.
* When Christian was five years old his mother remarried Jakob Georg Christian Wulff (1827-1908).
* Jakob and Augusta had five children: Joachimine Frederikke Stredtmann Wulff (born 1861); Christian August J端rgensen Wulff (born 1862); Johanne A Wulff (born 1865); Hans Christian Carl Wulff (born 1866); and Wilhelmine Amalie Wulff (born 1870).
* The family lived in Svendborg, a coastal town in southern Funen Island, Denmark, and it was in this town that Christian was brought up.
* In January 1876 Juel took the entrance examinations for the University of Copenhagen.
* Juel completed his Master's Degree at the University of Copenhagen in 1879.
* Juel had spent sixteen years completing his university education and so, despite starting young, was 30 years old before he received his doctorate.
* Juel worked for several years as a mathematics teacher and private tutor of mathematics before being appointed to the Polytechnic Institute in Copenhagen in 1894.
* However, at first it was a journal aimed at school teachers of mathematics but in 1890, when Juel was editor, it was split into Series A containing school level mathematics, and Series B which was a scientific journal containing articles on advanced topics.
* On 23 July 1902, Juel married Laura Thiele (born 26 May 1873 in Copenhagen, died 21 March 1925) a daughter of the professor of astronomy in Copenhagen, Thorvald N Thiele, and his wife Marie M Trolle (1841-89).
* Christian and Laura Juel had four children: Aase (born 28 April 1903, married Vagn Vanggaard), Sven (born 17 July 1904), Ole (born 16 May 1906, died 21 February 1914), and Inger (born 17 September 1909).
* In 1907 Juel was appointed to a newly created chair of rational mechanics at the Polytechnic institute.
* Juel's programme of research extended certain theorems on real manifolds of algebraic geometry to non-algebraic manifolds, even to non-analytic manifolds provided the concepts are generalised in a suitable way.
* Although he was not alone in making these improvements, since Corrado Segre also proved similar results, but there is no doubt that Juel's results were obtained independently of Corrado Segre.
* This reproach Professor Juel has set himself (with no less industry than ingenuity) to remove.
* Juel also worked on the theory of finite equal polyhedra and on oval surfaces.
* Although these ideas are clever, Juel did not treat them with care and his writings on this topic, although interesting, are less than precise and leave something to be desired.
* Juel served mathematics in other important ways.
* Juel attended the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Bologna in September 1928.
* In his final years Juel's eyesight deteriorated and he was only able to write his classic text Vorlesungen 端ber projektive Geometrie mit besonderer Ber端cksichtigung der v.

Born 25 January 1855, Randers, Denmark. Died 24 January 1935, Copenhagen, Denmark.
