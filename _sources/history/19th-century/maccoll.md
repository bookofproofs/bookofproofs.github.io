**Hugh MacColl** was a Scottish mathematician, logician and novelist.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Hugh was the youngest in the family.
* John MacColl was an educated man who taught his older children some Latin, Greek and mathematics.
* However, Hugh did not benefit from his father's teaching since John MacColl died when Hugh was only three years old.
* Since Martha MacColl spoke only Gaelic, this meant that Hugh's first language was Gaelic.
* The family moved first to Letterfearn on Loch Duich, near to Kyle of Lochalsh, where Hugh's grandmother Anne Macrae lived.
* After a while, Malcolm MacColl, Hugh's elder brother by four years, remained with his grandmother in Letterfearn while Hugh, his mother and the other children moved to Ballachulish, south of Fort William.
* Only after the move to Ballachulish did Hugh begin to learn English.
* He supported the education of his younger brother Hugh who had been hoping to study mathematics at Oxford.
* When Malcolm was dismissed by his Bishop, he was no longer in a position to provide financial support for Hugh who had to give up his ideas about studying at Oxford.
* In 1858 Hugh MacColl moved to England where he taught at various schools until 1865 when he moved to Boulogne-sur-Mer in France.
* Apparently, MacColl frequented the place: a letter to Bertrand Russell on the Reading Room's writing paper has been preserved.
* When MacColl arrived in Boulogne he began teaching mathematics and English at the Coll√®ge Communal in the town.
* The illness to MacColl's wife was certainly serious for she died on 2 February 1884.
* MacColl remarried on 17 August 1887, his second wife being Hortense Lina Marchal.
* Most of MacColl's original contributions to mathematics and logic were through papers, discussions and books after he moved to France.
* MacColl has other interests outside mathematics and logic.
* In this book, MacColl argues that the Christian religion is the most ethical, yet many do not believe in Christianity because they cannot accept the miracles on which the religion is based (particularly the resurrection of Jesus).
* In fact, the book can be thought of as MacColl's attempt to put Christianity on a purely scientific basis.
* MacColl continued to teach until 1908, essentially running a boarding school from his home.

Born 11 January 1837, Strontian, Argyllshire, Scotland. Died 27 December 1909, Boulogne-sur-Mer, France.
