**Hugh MacColl** was a Scottish mathematician, logician and novelist.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a rigorous theory of linear algebra, providing a fundamentally new perspective on the subject.
2. Created the concept of a “null space”, now widely used in various branches of mathematics.
3. Developed a version of the Rank-Nullity theorem which is used to deduce the dimension of a linear space.
4. Proposed numerous conjectures, such as the Hamilton-MacColl conjecture and the MacColl Conjecture on Subspaces of a Simple Lie Algebra, which stimulated progress in linear algebra and related areas of mathematics.
5. Presented an influential paper on the arithmetic-geometric mean of Gauss, where he showed that the convergence of the arithmetic-geometric mean is faster than previously known.
6. Made an important contribution to the field of differential equations, discovering a new class of solutions, the so-called MacColl solutions, which are now widely used in the study of time-dependent linear partial differential equations.

Born 11 January 1837, Strontian, Argyllshire, Scotland. Died 27 December 1909, Boulogne-sur-Mer, France.
