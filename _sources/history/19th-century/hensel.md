**Hensel** invented the _p_-adic numbers, an algebraic theory which has proved important in later applications.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Riemann–Roch theorem which is a powerful tool in the field of algebraic geometry.
2. Established the Henselian rings, a type of local rings which are useful for studying algebraic equations.
3. Developed a version of Kronecker's Jugendtraum theorem which a cornerstone of algebraic number theory.
4.Introduced the Jacobi–Perron algorithm for the numerical solution of Hermite's interpolation formula.
5. Developed theories related to abstract algebra and theoretical calculus.
6. Laid the foundations of constructivism, a mathematical philosophy stressing the importance of proof.
7. Extended the notion of a continuous function by incorporating notion of limit analysis.
8. Halved the length of a proof of a mathematical theorem while working on the theory of higher algebra.

Born 29 December 1861, Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 1 June 1941, Marburg, Germany.
