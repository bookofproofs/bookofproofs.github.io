**Salomon Bochner** was a pure mathematician who was born in what is now Poland and moved to America to escape the Nazis. He worked on integral transforms and distribution theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Resolution of Blumenthal’s conjecture in the mid-1930s, which states that linear combinations of exponentials represent the same functions as Fourier series.
2. Creation of a new branch of analysis, harmonic analysis, and formulation of Bochner’s theorem in harmonic analysis which relates the continuity of a function to its Fourier transform.
3. Contribution to developing abstract ways of constructing Fourier series and solving invariant linear equations.
4. Developed modern understanding of the integral representation which is nowadays known as Bochner’s integral.
5. Developed an algebra of what is now known as Bochner-Lebesgue spaces which allows generalization of concept of measure.
6. Discovered what is known as the Bochner-Godement criterion for establishing positive-definite functions on a vector space.
7. Applied Bochner’s theorem to problems in hyperbolic geometry.
8. Bestowed with a Bôcher Memorial Prize in 1935 for his work on integral representation and harmonic analysis.

Born 20 August 1899, Podgorze, near Kraków, Austria-Hungary (now Poland). Died 2 May1982, Houston, Texas, USA.
