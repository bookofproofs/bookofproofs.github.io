**Edwin Wilson**  was an American mathematician and statistician who worked in many different areas.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm that could be used to accurately calculate the movement of the Moon, leading to more precise predictions of the Moon's orbit.
2. Found a mathematical function that shows a close resemblance to the Stock Market, allowing traders to better predict future market behavior.
3. Wrote a book outlining mathematical processes in the field of economics and finance.
4. Devised formulae for calculating the financial impact of changes in interest rates and other variables.
5. Pioneered methods for portfolio and investment analysis, which form the basis for much of modern portfolio management.
6. Developed methodologies for analyzing and predicting stock prices and stock market movements.
7. Conducted numerous studies on the mathematics of options pricing, helping to establish the field of modern quantitative finance.

Born 25 April 1879, Hartford, Connecticut, USA. Died 28 December 1964, Brookline, Massachusetts, USA.
