**Griffith Evans** was an American mathematician whose work dealt with potential theory, functional analysis, integral equations and minimal surfaces. He was head of mathematics at Berkeley for many years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from University College London.
2. Published extensively on topics including differential equations, harmonic analysis and Lie groups.
3. Was a pioneer in the study of Fourier analysis, publishing two important books in the field.
4. Discovered a new form of differential equation, the Evans equation.
5. Established the principles of projective transformations in Euclidean geometry.
6. Formulated a theorem known as Evans' theorem, which provided an important result in the study of differential equations.
7. Developed a method of solving a class of infinite systems of linear equations.
8. Was instrumental in developing methods for solving boundary value problems in mathematical physics.
9. His research in partial differential equations and Lie groups was important for the development of modern differential geometry.
10. Named Fellow of the Royal Society in 1957 for his contributions to mathematics.

Born 11 May 1887, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Died 8 December 1973, Berkeley, California, USA.
