**Griffith Evans** was an American mathematician whose work dealt with potential theory, functional analysis, integral equations and minimal surfaces. He was head of mathematics at Berkeley for many years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was a family in which mathematics played a major role for George Evans was a mathematics teacher at the English and Latin High School in Boston.
* In fact George Evans had published a number of school level mathematics texts including Algebra for schools which had given him a good reputation as a teacher of mathematics.
* Griffith attended the school at which his father taught and completed his studies there in 1903 at the age of sixteen.
* It was under BÃ´cher's supervision that Evans began research at Harvard, being awarded his Master's degree in 1908 and his doctorate in 1910.
* Already before completing his Ph.D., Evans had been employed as an instructor at Harvard in session 1909-10.
* Most of this time Evans spent in Rome studying with Volterra but he also had an interest in applied mathematics and so he spent a summer in Berlin studying with Planck.
* Evans returned to the United States in 1912.
* The decision was not made lightly by Evans from which of these institutions to accept a post but he felt that Rice offered him the greatest opportunities.
* Appointed as assistant professor in 1912, Evans was promoted to full professor at Rice in 1916.
* With the help of Volterra, Evans facilitated the enrolment of U.S. military personnel in special wartime courses in Italian universities.
* Evans did a fine job of attracting visiting professors to Rice during his time there, including Menger and Rado.
* The University of California at Berkeley continued to try to attract Evans, and he taught there during the summer terms of 1921 and 1928.
* In the summer of 1934 Evans left Rice and began his task at Berkeley as chairman of the mathematics department.
* Evans was chairmen of the mathematics department at Berkeley for fifteen years, ending his term in 1949.
* He retired in 1955 but lived to see the new mathematics building at Berkeley named Evans Hall in 1971.
* Evans also wrote on mathematical economics, in particular on monopolies, competition and cooperation, taxation, profit, prices, etc.
* Evans received many honours for his mathematical contribution.

Born 11 May 1887, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Died 8 December 1973, Berkeley, California, USA.
