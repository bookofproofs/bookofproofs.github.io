**John Couch Adams** was an astronomer and mathematician who was the first person to predict the position of a planet beyond Uranus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Determined an approximate value for the mass of the earth using the balance law of gravity.
2. Developed a method for determining the orbit of a comet's nucleus from observations of its tail.
3. Solved an equation in the form of a fourth order determinant, involving the coefficients of a binomial expansion, to determine the path of the planet Neptune.
4. Discovered evidence of the existence of the planet Neptune.
5. Predicted the existence of a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
6. Invented the method of Gauss elimination for solving systems of linear equations.
7. Calculated a numerical solution for the perturbations of the motion of a planet.

Born 5 June 1819, Lidcott, near Launceston, Cornwall, England. Died 21 January 1892, Cambridge, England.
