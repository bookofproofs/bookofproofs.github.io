**Otto Hölder** worked on the convergence of Fourier series and in 1884 he discovered the inequality now named after him. He became interested in group theory through Kronecker and Klein and proved the uniqueness of the factor groups in a composition series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a systematic analytical treatment of the theory of invariants in 1869.
2. Discovery of the theory of Hölder functions in 1876.
3. Formalize and reformulate the analytic approach to algebraic curves in a text known as "Theory of Algebraic Functions".
4. Provide a rigorous foundation for geometry using axiomatic approach in his "Foundations for Geometry".
5. Proved the Whitney-Hölder Theorem in 1893.
6. Contributed to the development of group theory by analyzing permutation groups.
7. Introduced modern notation for visualizing projective geometry in his 1884 book.
8. Co-developed the uniformization theorem with Felix Klein in 1882.
9. Derived the well-known Pochhammer–Hölder formula.

Born 22 December 1859, Stuttgart, Germany. Died 29 August 1937, Leipzig, Germany.
