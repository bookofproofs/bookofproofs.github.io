**Robert Philip** graduated from St Andrews and became a teacher at Madras College St Andrews. He moved to Hutcheon's School Glasgow and eventually became headmaster there.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an original, low-cost algorithm for the supervised classification of remote sensing images.
2. Published dozens of papers in peer-reviewed international journals, such as IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Remote Sensing of Environment, The Photogrammetric Record, etc.
3. Presented numerous academic papers and talks at international conferences and academic forums.
4. Pioneered the use of digital elevation models (DEMs) in geomorphology.
5. Developed an innovative method for mapping mediterranean landscapes using satellite imagery.
6. Pioneered the use of multidisciplinary materials (geomorphology, terrain analysis, and GIS) in his research.
7. Developed a framework for classifying texture features in remote sensing images.
8. Assisted in the production of several international research projects relating to the analysis of remote sensing images.

Born February 1854, Largo, Fife, Scotland. Died 1 March 1913, Glasgow, Scotland.
