**Marcel Grossmann**  was a Swiss mathematician and a friend and collaborator  of Einstein.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He worked with his colleague, Hermann Minkowski, on the mathematics of Albert Einstein’s theories of relativity.
2. He discovered the Ricci identities, which are fundamental to the mathematics of tensor calculus and differential geometry.
3. He co-authored, with Einstein, two papers regarding the general theory of relativity.
4. He presented a method of analyzing parametric surfaces, now called Grossmann–Minkowski Formulae.
5. He worked on the mathematics of the vertical-axis theorem and Stefan's theorem.
6. He developed a new method of surveying called the Absolute Multilateral Method.
7. He helped formulate the Final Act of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900.

Born 9 April 1878, Budapest, Hungary. Died 7 September 1936, Zürich, Switzerland.
