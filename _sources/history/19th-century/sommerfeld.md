**Arnold Sommerfeld** was a theoretical physicist who worked in electromagnetic theory, relativity and quantum theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the mathematical concept of periodic motion with his famous ‘t' equation in 1908.
2. Developed the Sommerfeld fine structure model of the atom in 1915.
3. Established the mathematical foundation of the quantum theory in 1906 with his development of the theories of stopbands.
4. Developed the theory of Fermi-Dirac statistics and quantum electron theory.
5. Solved the two-body scattering problem for large energies with the on-shell scattering matrix in 1936.
6. Established the Sommerfeld-Weiss perturbation theory, which advanced the study of partial differential equations.
7. Worked on a reformulation of thermodynamics laws in terms of entropy in 1932.

Born 5 December 1868, Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 26 April 1951, Munich, Germany.
