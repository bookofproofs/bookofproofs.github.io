** Cornelius  Lanczos** worked on relativity and mathematical physics and invented what is now called the Fast Fourier Transform.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Lanczos attended a Jewish elementary school where he learn several foreign languages, then he entered the local Gymnasium which was a Catholic school run by the Cistercians.
* There he had several inspiring teachers who were to make a great impression on Lanczos.
* His physics teacher was Eötvös who first interested Lanczos in relativity.
* After graduating in 1915, Lanczos was appointed an assistant at the Technical University of Budapest.
* Lanczos received his doctorate in 1921 and, because of laws in Hungary against Jews, he went to Germany taking up a post at the University of Freiburg.
* During the year 1928-29 Lanczos was Einstein's assistant in Berlin, returning to Frankfurt in 1929.
* In 1931 Lanczos spent a year as a visiting professor at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.
* During his time at Purdue, Lanczos published mathematical physics papers at first but in 1938 he published his first work in numerical analysis.
* Lanczos continued to work on his first love of relativity and corresponded with Einstein both on a scientific level and as a friend.
* A new young man was appointed as Head of Physics at Purdue and Lanczos felt his work there was no longer appreciated.
* Lanczos spent the year of 1944 working for the Boeing Aircraft Company and, in 1946, he resigned his post in Purdue to take up a permanent appointment with Boeing.
* Lanczos was therefore delighted to receive an offer from Schrödinger to head the Theoretical Physics Department at the Dublin Institute for Advance Study in Ireland.
* Lanczos published over 120 papers and books in a career spanning over 40 years.

Born 2 February 1893, Székesfehérvár, Hungary. Died 25 June 1974, Budapest, Hungary.
