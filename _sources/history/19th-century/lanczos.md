** Cornelius  Lanczos** worked on relativity and mathematical physics and invented what is now called the Fast Fourier Transform.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of the conjugate gradient method for solving large-scale problems in linear algebra.
2. Discovered the electrostatic interpretation of the Lamb shift for the hydrogen atom excitation.
3. Developed the spectrum analysis method for cyclic quadratic forms.
4. Created Lanczos algorithms for numerically solving integral equations.
5. Developed Fourier-Lanczos expansion for the trilinear Darboux equations.
6. Developed the Lanczos windowing technique for signal analysis.
7. Created the Lanzcos iterative method in quantum mechanics.
8. Co-developed the Lanczos-Fox algorithm for solving symmetric eigenvalue problems.
9. Formulated the Lanczos vector technique for solving finite element analysis problems.
10. Developed the Lanczos tri-diagonalization algorithm for large sparse matrices.

Born 2 February 1893, Székesfehérvár, Hungary. Died 25 June 1974, Budapest, Hungary.
