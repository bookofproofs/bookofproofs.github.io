**Thomas Muir** was a Scot who went on to be Superintendent General of Education in South Africa and  is best known for his five volume _History of Determinants_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* George was a shoemaker in Biggar and it was in that town, about 15km from the town of Thomas's birth, that Thomas was brought up.
* Thomas entered the University of Glasgow intending to study his favourite subject of Greek.
* Muir spent three years lecturing on mathematics at Glasgow University and quickly gained a reputation as a fine teacher.
* The Edinburgh Mathematical Society was founded in 1883 and in the following year Muir was elected as president.
* Also in 1890 Muir was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, then two years later he went to the Cape, South Africa, as Superintendent General of Education.
* Muir was appointed to this position by Cecil Rhodes, then prime minister of Cape Colony, while Rhodes was visiting England.
* In fact Muir was at the time deciding whether to accept an offer of the Chair of Mathematics from Stanford University in California.
* There was another reason why accepting a post in South Africa was attractive to Muir.
* In 1897 Muir was appointed vice-chancellor of the University of the Cape; he held this post for four years.
* Muir received several awards from the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
* Muir was knighted in 1910, four years after he had reworked his 1890 publication to become Volume 1 of History of determinants which covered the origins to Leibniz in 1840.
* Muir was working on Volume 6 1920-1940 at the time of his death.
* In 1930, at the age of 86, Muir published Contributions to the history of determinants.
* It is worth thinking exactly what Muir was attempting here.

Born 25 August 1844, Stonebyres, Falls of Clyde, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Died 21 March 1934, Rondebosch, South Africa.
