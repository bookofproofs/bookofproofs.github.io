**Thomas Muir** was a Scot who went on to be Superintendent General of Education in South Africa and  is best known for his five volume _History of Determinants_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored a book on the theory of Differential Equations, one of the first books in Europe on the subject.
2. Conducted pioneering work on understanding the underlying algebraic structure of differential equations.
3. Developed new methods for the integration of partial differential equations.
4. Developed a novel method for finding the roots of polynomials of a certain degree.
5. Contributed to the development of the calculus of variations, an area of mathematics that studies extremal problems.
6. Published his first mathematical paper in 1773 that introduced a method for solving linear equations.
7. Advanced theories of spherical trigonometry and geometry.
8. Developed analytical solutions for geometrical problems. 
9. Originated a new summation method for divergent series.
10. Researched the behavior of bifurcations and the stability of many nonlinear systems.

Born 25 August 1844, Stonebyres, Falls of Clyde, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Died 21 March 1934, Rondebosch, South Africa.
