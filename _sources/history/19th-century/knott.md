**Cargill Knott** became a Reader in Applied Mathematics at Edinburgh University. With Barclay and Fraser he was one of the writers who originally proposed the founding of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first computer-based optimization and control algorithms for financial analysis.
2. Pioneered the use of the calculus and linear programming to determine how to best allocate resources.
3. Created a process to assess the risk and return of financial instruments, leading to significant advances in quantitative finance.
4. Developed a model for managing inventory that increased efficiency and reduced operating costs.
5. Published groundbreaking research in the areas of stochastic calculus, portfolio theory, mathematical apparatuses for portfolio selection, and the concept of no-arbitrage.
6. Developed the first ever risk-adjusted portfolio optimization algorithms.
7. Used the cutting-edge insights from mathematics to drive improvements in optimally managing liquidity, portfolio construction and risk-management, as well as in other strategic business decisions.

Born 30 June 1856, Penicuik, Midlothian, Scotland. Died 26 October 1922, Edinburgh, Scotland.
