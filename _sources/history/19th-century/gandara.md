**Alfonso Nápoles Gándara** was a Mexican mathematician who was one of the founders of the Mexican Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of numerical methods for solving complex problems in differential equations 
2. Dedicated over 20 years of research to developing algorithms for the numerical solution of three-dimensional boundary value problems
3. Created the perturbation method for the solution of boundary value problems that required automatic differentiation
4. Developed a numerical method for solving two-dimensional equations and building two-dimensional images
5. Worked on the development and implementation of numerical linear algebra techniques
6. Proposed an integral transformation method for solving certain problems in ordinary differential equations that reduced the computational costs of solving these problems
7. Co-authored several books on numerical analysis and technique of finite element methods
8. Developed innovative computational tools including software packages to develop these numerical methods

Born 14 October 1897, Cuernavaca, Mexico. Died 11 November 1992.
