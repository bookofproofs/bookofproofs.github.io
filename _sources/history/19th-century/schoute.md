**Pieter Hendrik Schoute** was a Dutch mathematician known for his work on regular polytopes and Euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the general theory of three-dimensional polytopes.
2. Established a new system of orthogonal coordinates based on axial distances and polar coordinates.
3. Established the Schoute conjecture which provided a solution to a difficult problem in algebraic geometry.
4. Demonstrated theorems relating minimal surfaces to the nature of polyhedrons.
5. Constructed four new examples of semi-regular polyhedrons.
6. Found four new symmetric configurations composed only of regular polyhedrons.
7. Researched the properties of scalar curvature in Euclidean spaces with arbitrary numbers of dimensions.
8. Authored the book 'Elementary Geometry' as a basic foundation work for three-dimensional geometry.

Born 21 January 1846, Wormerveer, Netherlands. Died 18 April 1913, Groningen, Netherlands.
