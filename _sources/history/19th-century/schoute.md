**Pieter Hendrik Schoute** was a Dutch mathematician known for his work on regular polytopes and Euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Dirk Schoute's parents were Cornelis Schoute and Grietje Baars, while Cornelia Oosterhuijs's parents were Hendrik Oosterhuijs and Aagje Langewis.
* Pieter Hendrik was the youngest of his parents' three sons, the older two being Cornelis (1835-1911) and Dirk (1838-1899).
* After graduating, Schoute went to Leiden to undertake research in mathematics.
* After being awarded his doctorate, Schoute taught mathematics in a secondary school in Nijmegen from 1871 until 1874.
* The situation changed markedly for the better with the appointment of Schoute in 1881 and from that time the fortunes of mathematics at Groningen improved greatly.
* In particular there was the second excellent appointment of Floris de Boer as professor of mathematics to Groningen to join Schoute three years after he was appointed.
* Schoute studied various topics in geometry such as quadrics and algebraic curves.
* It was his research on regular polytopes, which generalise the concept of regular polyhedra, that led to the collaboration between Schoute and Stott.
* Schoute was an editor of this journal from 1898 until his death in 1913.
* Finally we should note another publication by Schoute on a totally different topic, namely the reclamation of the Zuiderzee.
* Work began in 1927, fourteen years after Schoute's death.
* Schoute was elected to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences in 1886.

Born 21 January 1846, Wormerveer, Netherlands. Died 18 April 1913, Groningen, Netherlands.
