**Pieter Hendrik Schoute** was a Dutch mathematician known for his work on regular polytopes and Euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The Schoute family were industrialists who had a business near Amsterdam.
* Dirk Schoute's parents were Cornelis Schoute and Grietje Baars, while Cornelia Oosterhuijs's parents were Hendrik Oosterhuijs and Aagje Langewis.
* At the time of Dirk and Cornelia's marriage, Dirk was described as a clerk, but the family fortunes changed in 1843 when Dirk Schoute began processing cocoa.
* Pieter Hendrik was the youngest of his parents' three sons, the older two being Cornelis (1835-1911) and Dirk (1838-1899).
* After graduating, Schoute went to Leiden to undertake research in mathematics.
* After being awarded his doctorate, Schoute taught mathematics in a secondary school in Nijmegen from 1871 until 1874.
* While teaching in Nijmegen he married Mathilde Pekelharing (1846-1930); they had six children, Dirk (1873-1953), Cornelis (1874-1960), Anna Cornelia (1875-1976), Johannes Cornelis (1877-1942), Agatha Cornelia (1879-1968), and Baltus Hendrik who was born in 1884 but did not reach adulthood dying at the age of five.
* The family moved to The Hague in 1874 where again Schoute taught mathematics in a secondary school.
* The situation changed markedly for the better with the appointment of Schoute in 1881 and from that time the fortunes of mathematics at Groningen improved greatly.
* In particular there was the second excellent appointment of Floris de Boer as professor of mathematics to Groningen to join Schoute three years after he was appointed.
* Schoute studied various topics in geometry such as quadrics and algebraic curves.
* From 1891 Schoute studied Euclidean geometry of more than 3 dimensions, writing 28 papers, some jointly with Alica Boole Stott, the daughter of George Boole, such as On the sections of a block of eightcells by a space rotating about a plane.
* It was his research on regular polytopes, which generalise the concept of regular polyhedra, that led to the collaboration between Schoute and Stott.
* studied sections of four- and higher-dimensional polytopes after her husband showed her Schoute's 1893 paper, and Schoute later (in his last papers) gave an analytic treatment of her constructions.
* Schoute was an editor of this journal from 1898 until his death in 1913.
* Finally we should note another publication by Schoute on a totally different topic, namely the reclamation of the Zuiderzee.
* Work began in 1927, fourteen years after Schoute's death.
* Schoute was elected to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences in 1886.

Born 21 January 1846, Wormerveer, Netherlands. Died 18 April 1913, Groningen, Netherlands.
