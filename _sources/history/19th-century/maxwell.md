**James Clerk Maxwell** was a Scottish mathematician who did revolutionary work on electricity, magnetism, optics and on the kinetic theory of gases.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of partial differential equations of the first order and solved the wave equation (1860).
2. Synthesized electromagnetic theory in the form of a set of equations, which is now known as Maxwell's equations (1864).
3. Demonstrated the three-dimensional nature of light (1869).
4. Predicted the existence of electromagnetic radiation including radio waves (1873).
5. Formulated the kinetic theory of gases (1874-1876).
6. Proposed the statistical concept of dynamical equivalence and probability (1860).
7. Used the notion of vectors to describe physical phenomena, allowing the creation of a single generalized theory of classical electromagnetism (1870).
8. Proposed the concept of the electromagnetic field as a medium outside electromagnetic sources and as a means of transferring energy. (1872).
9. Created the first color photograph in the world (1861).
10. Established the notion of the equation of continuity (1863).

Born 13 June 1831, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 5 November 1879, Cambridge, England.
