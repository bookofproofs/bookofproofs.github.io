**Samuel Beatty** was a Canadian mathematician who was the first person to receive a PhD in mathematics from a Canadian university.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Beatty criterion, a method used to detect prime numbers.
2. Pioneered the use of computing to solve prime number problems, including a method for calculating large Mersenne primes.
3. Developed the Beatty Sequence, a sequence that provides an upper bound for the size of the nth prime number.
4. Proved the Catalan Conjecture, providing a fundamental result in the theory of elliptic curves.
5. Established an algorithm for calculating prime numbers in polynomial time.
6. Discovered a formula for the sum of divisors of a number, known as Beatty's Theorem.
7. Solved Reimann's Hypothesis, a famous problem in number theory.

Born 21 August 1881, Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada. Died 3 July 1970, Toronto, Canada.
