**Mildred Sanderson** was L E Dickson's first female Ph.D. student and was described by him as "my most gifted pupil." Tragically, she died in the year following the award of her doctorate.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Horace Sanderson, the son of the farmer Nathan Sanderson and his wife Adeline Wellington, was born in Waltham, Middlesex, Massachusetts.
* Many generations of the Sanderson family had lived and farmed in Waltham for over 200 years.
* Horace and Edna Sanderson had five children: May Evelyn Sanderson (1884-1941); Alice Gertrude Sanderson (1886-1956), known as Gertrude; Mildred Leonora Sanderson (1889-1914), the subject of this biography; Amelia Hemenway Sanderson (1894-1897); and Ralph Hemenway Sanderson (1898-1979).
* At the time of the 1900 US census, Horace Sanderson's occupation is given as florist and market gardener, the three oldest children are at school, while the youngest Ralph is only one year old.
* At the time of the 1910 US census, Horace Sanderson's occupation is given as market gardener and florist.
* All four children are still living at home, May and Gertrude are both teachers in a public school while Mildred's occupation is recorded as 'none'.
* Also living with them is Horace's brother Edmund L Sanderson, a proprietor and Waltham machine worker, and Horace's sister Ella O Sanderson.
* Mildred Sanderson attended the North Grammar School and Waltham High School, two public schools in Waltham which were closely linked.
* Sanderson graduated from the North Grammar School in 1902 before being a highly successful pupil at Waltham High School from which she graduated in 1906 as valedictorian.
* It had an excellent reputation for teaching academic subjects and provided Sanderson with a high quality education.
* Sanderson was awarded a Bardwell Memorial Fellowship for 1910 and 1911.
* The recipient was not restricted in the subject of study, nor in the place of study, and Sanderson chose to take graduate studies in mathematics at the University of Chicago.
* At the University of Chicago, Sanderson was advised by L E Dickson and began studying for her Master's Degree.
* Not many people have written a Master's dissertation in one year which is of such a standard that it leads to a publication in the Annals of Mathematics, but this is exactly what Sanderson achieved.
* We note that Forest Ray Moulton and Ernest Julius Wilczynski had taught astronomy courses which Sanderson had studied as part of her minor subject.
* After the award of her doctorate, Sanderson was appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin.
* We note that Mount Holyoke College established the Mildred L Sanderson Prize for Mathematics in 1939.

Born 12 May 1889, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA. Died 15 October 1914, East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, USA.
