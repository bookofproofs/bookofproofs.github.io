**Mildred Sanderson** was L E Dickson's first female Ph.D. student and was described by him as "my most gifted pupil." Tragically, she died in the year following the award of her doctorate.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* At the time of the 1910 US census, Horace Sanderson's occupation is given as market gardener and florist.
* Mildred Sanderson attended the North Grammar School and Waltham High School, two public schools in Waltham which were closely linked.
* Sanderson graduated from the North Grammar School in 1902 before being a highly successful pupil at Waltham High School from which she graduated in 1906 as valedictorian.
* It had an excellent reputation for teaching academic subjects and provided Sanderson with a high quality education.
* Sanderson was awarded a Bardwell Memorial Fellowship for 1910 and 1911.
* The recipient was not restricted in the subject of study, nor in the place of study, and Sanderson chose to take graduate studies in mathematics at the University of Chicago.
* At the University of Chicago, Sanderson was advised by L E Dickson and began studying for her Master's Degree.
* Not many people have written a Master's dissertation in one year which is of such a standard that it leads to a publication in the Annals of Mathematics, but this is exactly what Sanderson achieved.
* We note that Forest Ray Moulton and Ernest Julius Wilczynski had taught astronomy courses which Sanderson had studied as part of her minor subject.
* After the award of her doctorate, Sanderson was appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin.
* We note that Mount Holyoke College established the Mildred L Sanderson Prize for Mathematics in 1939.

Born 12 May 1889, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA. Died 15 October 1914, East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, USA.
