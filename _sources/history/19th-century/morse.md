**Morse** developed variational theory in the large with applications to equilibrium problems in mathematical physics, a theory which is now called Morse theory and forms a vital role in global analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical theory of cohomology, which led to revolutionary advances in algebraic topology. 
2. Proved the Poincaré Conjecture in the 1920s. 
3. Received the Bôcher Memorial Prize from the American Mathematical Society in 1934 for his work on differential equations. 
4. Developed the concept of Morse theory, which helps researchers study the characteristics of a set of functions on a set. 
5. Co-developed game theory, laying the foundation for modern economic, political and military strategy. 
6. Discovered and named critical points in functions, also called local extremums.

Born 24 March 1892, Waterville, Maine, USA. Died 22 June 1977, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
