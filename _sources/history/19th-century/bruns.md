**Heinrich Bruns** was a German scientist who was interested in astronomy, mathematics and geodesy and worked on the three body problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for constructing a class of special surfaces now known as Brunsâ€™ surfaces.
2. Proved the fact that the angular momentum of a closed cyclic polygon cannot be strictly preserved in its movement.
3. Discovered formulas for the second and third curves of the system of lines related to a quadric surface.
4. Established a system of coordinates for studying the theory of curves of the second order.
5. Presented a method for computing maxima and minima of certain expressions related to algebraic equations of any degree.
6. Developed an approach to the general theory of surfaces that was widely adopted by many mathematicians.
7. Devised a method for transforming arbitrary quartic equations into those possessing only certain real and imaginary roots.
8. Showed that the algebraic curves of the fourth degree satisfy certain points and conditions.
9. Provided applications of his studies in the areas of astronomy, physics, and philosophy.
10. Completed his dissertation on the theory of curves and surfaces which established him as a professor of mathematics.

Born 4 September 1848, Berlin, Germany. Died 23 September 1919, Leipzig, Germany.
