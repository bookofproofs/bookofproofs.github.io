**Heinrich Bruns** was a German scientist who was interested in astronomy, mathematics and geodesy and worked on the three body problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Bruns studied in Berlin from 1866 to 1871, obtaining a doctorate under Weierstrass and Kummer in 1871 for his thesis De proprietate quadam functionis potentialis corporum homogeneorum Ⓣ(The property of a potential function of a homogeneous body).
* In 1873 Bruns left Pulkovo to take up the position of observer at the Dorpat Observatory (now Tartu, Estonia).
* Peter Carl Ludwig Schwarz had taken over from Thomas Clausen when he retired as director in the year before Bruns arrived at the Observatory.
* After three years at Dorpat, Bruns was appointed as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Berlin where he remained until 1882.
* Bruns was the second director, the first being Carl Christian Bruhns who held the position from 1861 until his death in 1881.
* Bruns held these positions until his death in 1919.
* Bruns was interested in astronomy, mathematics and geodesy.
* Bruns showed in 1887 that there could be no conserved quantities which could be expressible as algebraic functions of the positions and velocities of the three bodies.
* A few years later Poincaré extended Bruns' work to show that no solution to the three-body problem was possible given by algebraic expressions and integrals.
* In addition to this major contribution to the three-body problem, Bruns also published major contributions to potential theory.

Born 4 September 1848, Berlin, Germany. Died 23 September 1919, Leipzig, Germany.
