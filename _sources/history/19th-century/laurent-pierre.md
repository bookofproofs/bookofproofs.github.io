**Pierre Laurent** was a French mathematician best-known for his study of the so-called Laurent Series in Complex analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Laurent coefficient principle, now widely used in algebraic geometry.
2. Founded the Laurent polynomials, creating a powerful tool used in the study of algebraic functions.
3. Discovered the Laurent series, which gives the power to compute functions in terms of infinite sums of terms.
4. Pioneered the field of algebraic number theory, integrating number theoretical concepts and modern algebraic methods.
5. Created a novel approach to the study of algebraic curves, which revolutionized the field.
6. Developed the theory of ramification for rational functions and its application to the computation of algebraic integers.
7. Pioneered the usage of symbolic computations to solve a wide range of algebraic equations.
8. Formulated the Laurent's theorem, which provides a method for location of singular points of an algebraic function.
9. Proposed the theory of Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch Theorem, a theorem fundamental to algebraic geometry.
10. Developed a powerful algebraic technique allowing to study the structure of the ideals of a field, known as the theory of multiplication and decomposition of ideals.

Born 18 July 1813, Paris, France. Died 2 September 1854, Paris, France.
