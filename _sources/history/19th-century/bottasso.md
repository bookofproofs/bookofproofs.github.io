**Matteo Bottasso** was an Italian mathematician who used the vector calculus in studying problems in geometry, mechanics and physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Vincenzo was a merchant living with his wife Caterina in Chiusa di Pesio, at No. 1 piazza Nuova, when their son Matteo was born.
* As a child Matteo showed a great love for learning and, although this required many sacrifices by the family, his parents decided that they had to give him a good education.
* Arriving back in Italy Bottasso was appointed as an assistant professor of projective geometry at the University of Bologna.
* Bottasso studied differential geometry and mechanics but also made contributions to actuarial and financial mathematics.
* Torino, 1912) Bottasso underlined the analogy between vector homography and integral equations, and used vector homography to solve integral equations.
* Bottasso gave lectures to the high school teachers on numerical calculus in March 1915.
* An interesting episode regarding Bottasso reported in the paper La Valle Pesio relating to the time when he was teaching at the Turin Military Academy.

Born 17 April 1878, Chiusa di Pesio (Cuneo), Italy. Died 4 October 1918, Messina, ItalyMessina, Italy.
