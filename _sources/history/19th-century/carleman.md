**Torsten Carleman** was a Swedish mathematician who worked in classical analysis and its applications.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Carleman's 1927 dissertation on Pseudo-Differential Operators established his reputation as a major figure in mathematical analysis.
2. He established a vector-valued version of the inverse images of integration that provided a significant contribution to harmonic analysis.
3. His research into the calculus of variations contributed to the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and boundary value problems.
4. He developed an important method for solving linear partial differential equations known as the Carleman Inequality.
5. Carleman also contributed to the field of dynamic programming, a branch of mathematics that helps to optimize decision-making in complex or large systems.
6. His 1927 textbook "The Theory of Functions of a Real Variable and Its Applications" made a great contribution in the field of mathematics by introducing a new technique of studying the behavior of the analytic functions of a single complex variable.
7. He developed a method to estimate the approximation of integrals by interpolation, which became known as the Carleman's Quasi-Uniform Approximation Formula.
8. He also derived a spectral theory for a class of non-divergence form operators, now known as Carleman Operators.

Born 8 July 1892, Visseltofta, Sweden. Died 11 January 1949, Stockholm, Sweden.
