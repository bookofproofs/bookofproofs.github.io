**Edward Sang** was a Scottish mathematician who wrote extensively on mathematical, mechanical, optical and actuarial topics as well as publishing astronomical and logarithmic tables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Edward Sang Sr had been born in Montrose and was a more learned man than the occupation of nurseryman would suggest for he had written scholarly articles, for example On Destroying the Caterpillars Infesting Fruit Trees (1814) in which he describes a scientific approach to treating his fruit trees on Loanwell's garden walls.
* They had eleven children: Margaret Sang (1793-?); Jean Sang (1795-1861); Mary Sang (1797-1880); David Sang (1800-1842); Ann Sang (1802-1889); Edward Sang (1805-1890), the subject of this biography; Helen Sang (1807-1808); John Sang (1809-1887); Walter Sang (1812-1868); William Sang (1817-1896); and Florinda Chalmers Sang (1823-1886).
* We note that Jean Sang, the mother of our mathematician, was a sister of the geologist William Nicol (1766-1851) who invented the Nicol prism in 1828.
* Edward Sang Sr was a member of the Berean church, a small sect founded by John Barclay in 1773.
* The Bereans did not believe in infant baptism, so none of Sang's eleven children were baptised.
* Edward Sang, the subject of this biography, attended a subscription school, founded by his father and others, under a gifted but unconventional headmaster Edward Irving (1792-1834).
* At this school, Edward showed great abilities and completed his education there at the age of twelve.
* Nevertheless, Sang was a small lad for his age and must of looked a little out of place.
* Sang enrolled in John Leslie's second mathematics class and studied this during the academic year 1818-19.
* Sang's time at university was not straightforward since he had periods of illness, but he greatly impressed both Leslie and Wallace and they both wrote very strong reports on their outstanding pupil when he completed his university studies in 1824.
* Let us say a little about John Sang, Edward's younger brother, at this point.
* John, born in Kirkcaldy on 13 August 1809, also attended Edward Irving's subscription school and, like his brother, he showed great abilities.
* We should also comment on Edward's uncle, the geologist William Nicol, who lectured in physics at the University of Edinburgh before retiring to do research in Edinburgh.
* He was a major influence on the education of both Edward and John Sang.
* Edward Sang first worked in Edinburgh as a surveyor, civil engineer and mathematics teacher and lectured on natural philosophy, as an assistant to John Leslie.
* Edward and Isabel Sang had five children: Anna Wilkie Sang (1832-1917), Jane Nicol Sang (1834-1878), Edward Elmslie Sang (1835-1882), Flora Chalmers Sang (1838-1925), and Isabella Miller Sang (1841-1884).
* His only son, Elmslie Sang, trained as a civil engineer but sadly died in the Royal Lunatic Asylum in 1882, eight years before his father died.
* Sang was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 2 May 1836 having been proposed by Thomas Dick Lauder (1784-1848).
* Sang applied for the chair, as did another local man John Scott Russell.
* Neither Sang nor John Russell were seriously considered for the chair, the two top contenders being Philip Kelland and Duncan Farquharson Gregory; Kelland was successful.
* Sang cancelled his fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 3 April 1840 (he was re-elected in 1849).
* During 1841-43 Sang was Professor of Mechanical Sciences at the nonconformist Manchester New College.
* It returned to Manchester in 1840, just before Sang was appointed, but moved to London in 1853 and has now become Marris Manchester College, Oxford.
* After two years in Manchester, Sang went to Constantinople to establish engineering schools, plan railways and an ironworks.
* Sang received an invitation from the Astronomer Royal to go to Russia to observe the solar eclipse of 28 July 1851.
* Edward Sang was appointed  'lecturer to the Faculty', and delivered four lectures the following year, the second of which was entitled 'The Commercial, Moral and Social Influences of Assurances - the Applicability of the Principle in Difference Circumstances'.
* There is no doubt that Sang's most remarkable achievement is his massive unpublished compilation of 26- and 15-place logarithmic, trigonometric and astronomical tables, filling 47 manuscript volumes.
* We note that these two daughters were the only ones of Sang's five children to survive him.
* On 5 November 1868 Sang, as President, addressed the Actuarial Society of Edinburgh.
* In 1851, John Sang, Edward's brother, invented the planimeter, used for measuring irregular figures drawn on paper.
* Edward Sang gave the lecture On Mechanical Aids to Calculation to the Actuarial Society of Edinburgh in which he described his brother's planimeter (called a platometer at this time).
* There are a number of concepts that Sang anticipated.
* Tait made instant search among our files for the paper, had it read and printed - but poor Sang was dead.
* Sang died at his home, 31 Mayfield Road, Edinburgh and was buried in Newington Cemetery, Edinburgh.
* Sang, his wife and all five children are on the tombstone making the grave.

Born 30 January 1805, Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland. Died 23 December 1890.
