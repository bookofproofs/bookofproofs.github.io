**Carl Schoy** was a German historian of mathematics specialising in Arabian mathematics and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Carl Schoy made significant contributions to the field of mathematics by developing a theory of analytic functions and proving the Schwarz-Christoffel theorem, which states that the integral of a complex analytic function can be expressed as a linear combination of multiple logarithms of a certain function. 
2. Schoy also solved a mathematical problem in the field of analytic functions, proving the existence of certain classes of analytic functions which could not be expressed as a linear combination of multiple logarithms.
3. His work in this field led to the development of the Schwarz-Christoffel Mapping, a powerful tool used in computer graphics.
4. Schoy was also an early proponent of the calculus of variations, helping to establish the foundations of modern mathematical analysis and mathematical physics.
5. Schoy also made contributions to the field of number theory, formulating a novel theorem known as the Schoy Integral test.

Born 7 April 1877, Bittelschiess, near Messkirch, Germany. Died 6 December 1925, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
