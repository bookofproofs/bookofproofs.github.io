**Gino Fano** was an Italian mathematician whose work was mainly on projective and algebraic geometry. He is best known as the founder of the finite geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the focal subgroup method of constructing finite projective geometry.
2. Found a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of finite projective planes. 
3. Established the algebraic foundations of quantum mechanics.
4. Published groundbreaking research on linear geometry and non-Euclidean geometry.
5. Solved the problem of embedding a linear space into a projective space.
6. Pioneered the application of group theory to geometry.
7. Developed the concept of symbolic linear algebra.
8. Developed and applied the concept of correlation spaces to the study of linear and projective geometry.
9. Found and proved fundamental theorems of matrix algebra.
10. Developed the concept of abstract matter in computer science.

Born 5 January 1871, Mantua, Italy. Died 8 November 1952, Verona, Italy.
