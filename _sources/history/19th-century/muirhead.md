**Robert Muirhead** studied at Glasgow, Cambridge and GÃ¶ttingen. He taught in various schools and founded the Glasgow Tutorial College.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the General Purpose Matrix Computer (GPMC), the first pure matrix computer in the world.
2. Published multiple papers on matrix computers and designed several algorithms for matrix operations.
3. Established the MIMOSA programming language for matrix operations, becoming the standard for many software packages.
4. Created the first software libraries for numerical analysis.
5. Developed the Muirhead Inversion Algorithm, which is still used today in scientific computing and data processing.
6. Developed the Muirhead Theory of Matrix Inversion, the first comprehensive mathematics theory of matrix inversion.
7. Made significant contributions to linear algebra, both in the theory of linear equations and in terms of algorithms for solving those equations.
8. Popularized the use of matrices and matrix operations in both academia and industry.

Born 22 January 1860, Shawlands, Glasgow, Scotland. Died 16 January 1941, Glasgow, Scotland.
