**Wolfgang Krull** proved the Krull-Schmidt theorem for decomposing abelian groups of operators and defined the Krull dimension of a ring.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of Krull dimension, a generalization of the dimension of a vector space.  
2. Introduced the notion of primary divisors. 
3. Proved the Hauptidealsatz, the Krull Intersection Theorem, and the Krull's Principal Ideal Theorem. 
4. Made significant contributions to the theory of algebraic number fields, especially related to algebraic ideals. 
5. Discovered key properties of discrete valuation rings, potentially leading to the eventual development of algebraic number theory. 
6. Established the so-called ‘Krull-Akizuki Theorem’ (also known as the Krull Convergence Theorem) which has many applications in algebraic geometry. 
7. Proposed the Krull Dimension, a general measure of the size of a mathematical structure. 
8. Solved the Galois problem of solvability, along with Ernst Steinitz, by showing that any finite group can be realized as a Galois group over the rationals.

Born 26 August 1899, Baden-Baden, Germany. Died 12 April 1971, Bonn, Germany.
