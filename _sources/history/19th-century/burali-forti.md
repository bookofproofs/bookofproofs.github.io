**Cesare Burali-Forti** was an Italian mathematician best known for the [Burali-Forti paradox][bookofproofs$779] of Cantorian set theory. He had about 200 publications.
The paradox resulted from the assumption that a set of all [ordinals][bookofproofs$723] could exist.

Born 13 August 1861 Arezzo, Italy. Died 21 January 1931 Turin, Italy.
