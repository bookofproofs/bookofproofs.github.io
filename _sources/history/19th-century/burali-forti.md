**Cesare Burali-Forti** was an Italian mathematician best known for the [Burali-Forti paradox][bookofproofs$779] of Cantorian set theory. He had about 200 publications.
The paradox resulted from the assumption that a set of all [ordinals][bookofproofs$723] could exist.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He published a paper on the theory of cardinal numbers, which Ernst Zermelo later extended on. 
2. He independently discovered the ordinal numbers and the axiom of choice. 
3. He introduced a framework for transfinite numbers and proposed the predecessor to Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.
4. He published researches on cantorian set theory and discovered the paradox of the highest infinite cardinal. 
5. He introduced the concept of equinumerosity which was later developed by Cantor and Richard Dedekind.
6. He developed ways of calculating with irrational numbers and introduced the concept of space-filling curves. 
7. He introduced the concept of non-denumerable sets, the integral operator and parameters of fractional order. 
8. He solved various problems in algebra, mechanics, and mathematical logic.

Born 13 August 1861, Arezzo, Italy. Died 21 January 1931, Turin, Italy.
