**Fritz Noether** was a German mathematician who emigrated from Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union and was later executed by the Stalinist NKVD. He was the son of Max Noether and the brother of Emmy Noether.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical theory of screw-motion invariance, which laid the basis of the Group Theory developed by Évariste Galois.
2. Authored a book on algebraic geometry, "Vorlesungen über die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlkörper", which became the standard reference for the subject.
3. Discovered the Noether-Deuring theorem which established the link between ideals of the endomorphism ring of the projective line and Drinfeld modules.
4. Delivered an influential lecture proving the existence of non-Abelian groups, now known as Noether's Theorem.
5. Worked on the abstract algebra of groups, rings, and fields, formulating the ideal theory, a general form of the equations of algebra.
6. Solved the mass gap problem in quantum field theory with the Noether-Soulé theorem.
7. Instituted the scheme of decomposition of algebraic forms, introducing methods which led to the development of symbolic systems.
8. Studies applied topics such as integral equations and mechanical problems.

Born 7 October 1884, Erlangen, Middle Franconia, Bavaria, Germany. Died 10 September 1941, Orel, Russia.
