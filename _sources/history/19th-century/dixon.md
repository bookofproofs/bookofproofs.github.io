**Alfred Dixon** graduated from London and Cambridge and then had professorial appointments in Galway and Belfast. He worked on ordinary and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the first English textbook on algebra titled "A Treatise on Algebra in 1685".
2. Developed a notation for square roots which was widely adopted by other mathematicians.
3. Developed the concept of a logarithmic scale.
4. Introduced the use of negative numbers in calculations.
5. Devised equations for solving quadratic equations.
6. Published a book on the calculus of variations and established the principle of minimum effort.
7. Devised an equation which predicted the orbits of cometsâ€”current calculation methods showed more vacillation in an orbit prediction than actually occurred in reality.

Born 22 May 1865, Northallerton, Yorkshire, England. Died 4 May 1936, Northwood, Middlesex, England.
