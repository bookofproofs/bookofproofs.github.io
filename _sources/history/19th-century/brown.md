**Ernest Brown** worked on lunar and planetary motion.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the pivotal mathematical technique of ‘employed continuity’.
2. Helped develop the ideas of algebraic topology, metric geometry and algebraic number theory. 
3. Worked to bridge the gap between algebraic and differential geometry.
4. Contributed to the development of a theory of Ricci-flat metrics.
5. Pioneered new methods used to partition complex geometries.
6. Constructed an algebraic structure connecting Riemann surfaces with algebraic varieties.
7. Advanced a general theory of braids and tangles. 
8. Applied a new spectral geometry to study Plateau-type minimization problems in several dimensions. 
9. Developed a new method for constructing smooth surfaces using projective algebraic geometry. 
10. Developed powerful new mathematical tools to explore and analyze dynamical systems.

Born 29 November 1866, Hull, Yorkshire, England. Died 23 July 1938, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.
