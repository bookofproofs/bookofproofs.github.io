description: Kummer was a pioneer in the field of algebra, developing integral domains and ideal numbers which led him to establish the Kummer Rings and investigate the properties of number fields, developing congruence, criteria, and Abelian extensions to enable the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

**Eduard Kummer**'s main achievement was the extension of results about the integers to other integral domains by introducing the concept of an ideal.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Kummer developed and applied the concept of ideal numbers, developing a connection between number theory and abstract algebra. 
2. He discovered Fermat's Last Theorem for the special case n = 14, whereupon Andrew Wiles used it to prove the general case.  
3. Kummer was a pioneer of ideal theory, which studies the algebraic properties of a certain generalization of the integers. 
4. He introduced Kummer rings, which generalize Fermat's ideals.
5. He investigated which number fields possess certain arithmetic properties and introduced the concept of a discriminant to measure them.
6. He introduced what is now called Kummer's conjecture, that properties of abelian extensions of the rationals could be used to derive periodic laws in algebraic number theory.
7. He demonstrated how to rigorously prove irrationality of certain numbers.
8. He developed Kummer's congruence and Kummer's criterion to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for a variety of exponents.

Born 29 January 1810, Sorau, Brandenburg, Prussia (now Å»ary, Poland). Died 14 May 1893, Berlin, Germany.
