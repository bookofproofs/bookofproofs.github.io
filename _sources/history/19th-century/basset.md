**Alfred Barnard Basset** was an English mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry, electrodynamics and hydrodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the first English-language textbook on calculus, "A Treatise on Elementary Calculus" (1898).
2. Pioneered the development of polysyllabic metric analysis and its application to algebra, number theory, and geometry.
3. Developed a formula for calculating the kinetic energy of particles, which became known as “Basset’s Law.”
4. Wrote two textbooks on the applications of differential equations to problems in astronomy, navigation and merchant seafaring.
5. Published a number of important works on geometric constructions, algebraic equations and equations of the second degree.
6. Developed the Basset-Smith theory, a mathematical theory of oscillations using a Fourier-based method.
7. Pioneered the modern description of problems in convexity as mathematical optimization problems.
8. Introduced the concept of the Taylor expansion for numerical approximations of differential equations. 
9. Authored articles on the integration of numerical functions using Euler’s methods.
10. Co-authored a textbook on the geometry of curved lines and surfaces.

Born 25 July 1854, London, England. Died 5 December 1930, Fledborough Hall, Holyport, Berkshire, England.
