**Alfred Barnard Basset** was an English mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry, electrodynamics and hydrodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Alfred Basset Sr., the son of a warehouseman, was born in Croydon, Surrey, on 19 October 1828.
* He became a wealthy man as a partner in the firm Basset and Harris who were corn factors undertaking international trade in grain.
* She married Alfred Basset in 1853 and they had three children, Alfred Barnard Basset, the subject of this biography, born 25 July 1854 and one younger daughter, Ann Gertrude Basset, born in 1856 but died at the age of two years on 12 December 1858.
* Alfred Basset Sr. died on 28 July 1867 and Anne Basset died in 1873 the year that her son Alfred Barnard Basset had matriculated at Trinity College, University of Cambridge on 18 February 1873.
* Basset was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1879 and he became a Equity Draftsman and Conveyancer.
* On 11 April 1882 Basset married Edith Sarah Irwin Dechaundre who had been born in Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, in 1865.
* Alfred and Edith Basset had two daughters, Almina Caroline Georgina Basset, born 9 November 1901, and Effie Alfreda Ilma Basset, born on 26 June 1903.
* Fledborough Hall, the seat of Alfred Barnard Basset, esq.
* We get a brief indication of the life that Basset and his family experienced from the census of 1901 and the census of 1911.
* At the time of the 1901 census Basset and his wife had no children and they were living in Fledborough Hall with seven servants.
* The 'classical' hydrodynamics had at that time a great fascination for a number of rising mathematicians, and Basset's own contributions in this kind to the Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, the London Mathematical Society, and the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London were of distinct merit.
* In fact in 1893 Basset wrote Publication of scientific papers where he gave his ideas about publishing.
* In 1888 Basset gave an historical introduction to hydrodynamics in his book A treatise on hydrodynamics, with numerous examples (1888).
* This 2-volume 1888 text by Basset was the first of five books which he wrote.
* It is very much to Basset's credit that this work was of such quality that the 2-volume monograph was reprinted in 1961, 73 years after it was first published, by Dover Publications, New York.
* Basset wrote a second work on hydrodynamics, An elementary treatise on hydrodynamics and sound (1890), which was not intended, as the 1888 monograph had been, as a record of the current state of progress in the topic but this second work was intended for students of the mathematical tripos at Cambridge.
* Later in his life Basset became interested in pure mathematical topics and published papers on geometry as well as two textbooks.
* Basset's fifth and final book was A treatise on the geometry of surfaces (1910).
* In 1889 Basset was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London.
* His wife Edith died in 1929 and Basset lived out the final years of his life in his residence at Fledborough Hall.
* When he died in December 1930 he left Â£65794 to his surviving daughter Effie Alfreda Ilma Basset.
* Effie Basset married Clarence Aylmer Underwood John French on 20 July 1936 in Monaco.

Born 25 July 1854, London, England. Died 5 December 1930, Fledborough Hall, Holyport, Berkshire, England.
