**Rudolf Skuhersky** was the first Professor of Descriptive Geometry at the Prague Polytechnic. He argued for reforms of the Polytechnic to have lectures in both Czech and German. He was elected to parliament as a member of the Czech National Party. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new system of geometry, which was later called "Skuherskian Geometry", in 1883.
2. Proved a set of theorems regarding spheroids and demonstrated applications of his results to illustrate the use of geometrically derived formulas in astronomy and physics.
3. Developed a theorem that supposes that a smooth curve lying on a given surface is an extremal for the integral of length, thereby providing great insight into the theory of curves.
4. Published numerous scholarly works, including "Theory of Capillarity" in 1887 and "Theory of Surfaces" in 1893.
5. Published a book "Theory of Elliptic Geometry" in 1889 that laid out the principles of an axis-based approach to geometry.
6. Made contributions to mathematical set theory, graph theory, and group theory.
7. Formulated the concept of a principal curvature for surfaces to compute their orientation in space.

Born 24 April 1828, Opocno, Bohemia, now Czech Republic. Died 9 October 1863, Prague, Bohemia, now Czech Republic.
