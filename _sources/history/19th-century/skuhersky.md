**Rudolf Skuhersky** was the first Professor of Descriptive Geometry at the Prague Polytechnic. He argued for reforms of the Polytechnic to have lectures in both Czech and German. He was elected to parliament as a member of the Czech National Party.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* František Skuherský, the son of a tanner, had been born at Zamecka no.
* František Skuherský founded a hospital in Opocno, supported by donations from 30,000 people.
* František and Karolina Skuherský had a son Rudolf, the subject of this biography, born in Opocno in 1828.
* They had a second son, František Zdenek Xavier Alois Skuherský (1830-1892), who was born in Opocno on 31 July 1830.
* Let us note here that František Zdenek Skuherský studied philosophy and medicine at the Charles University in Prague, then studied music at an organ school in Prague.
* The Skuherský family was, as we have seen, closely connected with the town of Opocno so we shall give a little information about it.
* The 2nd Prince was Rudolf Colloredo-Mansfeld (1772-1843) who had become Prince in 1807.
* František Alois Skuherský was financially supported by the Prince for his undergraduate studies at the University of Prague, and he became the Prince's doctor when he returned to Opocno in 1823.
* Rudolf Skuherský studied at the Gymnasium in the town of Hradec Kralové for three years, then for one year in Broumov, which is in the Hradec Kralové region.
* It would have been natural for Rudolf to follow his father into the medical profession, particularly since his father was making such a success of his career.
* When Skuherský studied there it had four Departments: Civil and Water Engineering, Architecture, Chemistry, and Mechanical Engineering.
* Christian Doppler taught Skuherský mathematics at the Polytechnic, in particular with a course on theoretical geometry.
* Skuherský also studied courses on physics and botany during the year he spent at the Polytechnic.
* Despite performing well at the Prague Polytechnic, Skuherský was not happy with the teaching there.
* After a year at the Prague Polytechnic, Skuherský returned to his home town of Opocno in 1845 where he was employed as an economics official on the estate of Prince Rudolf Colloredo-Mansfeld.
* By the autumn things were somewhat quieter and Skuherský returned to Prague hoping to continue his technical studies in improved circumstances.
* Teaching began again in October 1849, and it was at this time that Skuherský began his studies there.
* Skuherský studied under Hönig who supervised his research.
* Skuherský graduated from the Construction Department of the Prague Polytechnic in 1851.
* On 7 November 1852, a decree appointed Skuherský as temporary Professor of Descriptive Geometry.
* Skuherský taught mathematics in this preparatory year as well as teaching courses on descriptive geometry.
* After the full permanent professorship of Descriptive Geometry was authorised on 19 July 1854, Skuherský was appointed to that post on 16 August 1854.
* In 1855 Skuherský published the book Die orthographische Parallel-Perspective Ⓣ(The Orthographic Parallel Perspective).
* During this period, Skuherský concentrated on his academic work and kept out of political affairs.
* On his travels in Western Europe and England, Professor Skuherský met prominent workers in descriptive geometry, learnt French and English, and continued to emphasise the need to know foreign languages.
* After Bach's absolutism fell out of favour, Skuherský entered Czech political and national life.
* Teaching in the Prague Polytechnic had been in German and hence Skuherský published his book in the German language.
* Skuherský died suddenly at the age of 35.
* It was attended by all organisations and associations in which Professor Skuherský had been active, and also those he had supported.
* The 30 haler stamp had a portrait of Josef Bozek (1782-1835), the 60 haler stamp had a portrait of F J Gerstner, the  1 koruna stamp had a portrait of R Skuherský, and the 1.40 koruna stamp had a picture of the School of Engineering building.

Born 24 April 1828, Opocno, Bohemia, now Czech Republic. Died 9 October 1863, Prague, Bohemia, now Czech Republic.
