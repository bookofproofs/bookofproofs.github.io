**George Yule** was an English mathematician who is best known for his book: _Introduction to the Theory of Statistics_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the application of statistical methods to the study of linguistics and anthropology. 
2. Developed a matrix theory of association which includes the Rao-Silvey distance and Yuleâ€™s Q (for measuring the strength of association between two binary variables). 
3. Developed a statistical test for randomness (the Yule-Simon statistic), which is valuable in quality control.
4. Established the foundations for the structure of the analysis of variance and Advanced the theory of cause and effect.
5. Developed extensions to Pearson's chi-square test for goodness-of-fit.
6. Developed extensions to Spearman's rank correlation. 
7. Developed an innovative nonparametric test for detecting associations between two variables and their effects on each other. 
8. Developed a method of estimating an unknown probability distribution based on the moment of its estimate of central and dispersion parameters. 
9. Improved the prediction of annual maximum winds. 
10. Developed Yule's coefficient of congruence to measure the fit of empirical data to a specified distribution.

Born 18 February 1871, Morham (near Haddington), Scotland. Died 26 June 1951, Cambridge, England.
