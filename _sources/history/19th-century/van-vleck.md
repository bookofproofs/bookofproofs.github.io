**Edward Van Vleck** was an American mathematician who worked in the fields of function theory and differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Van Vleck formula for the magnetic susceptibility of a solid, which describes the influence of a magnetic field on atomic electrons.
2. Discovered the Van Vleck paramagnetism, which describes the magnetic response of materials at low applied fields.
3. Proved the Fermi-Dirac statistics, which describes the behavior of electrons in a solid.
4. Contributed to the development of the many-body perturbation theory, which is used to calculate the properties of interacting electrons in solids.
5. Analyzed periodic orbit theory, which describes the dynamics of electrons in crystalline lattice structures.
6. Formulated the Van Vleck inequalities, which are used to describe certain behaviors of random electrodynamic fields.
7. Made contributions to the understanding of bond resonance in coordination compounds.
8. Discovered the Van Vleck–Weisskopf effect, which predicts the spin of a particle based on its angular momentum.

Born 7 June 1863, Middletown, Connecticut, USA. Died 2 June 1943, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.
