**Eddington** made important contributions to the theory of general relativity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Eddington developed a new algebraic concept called the Eddington number, which is used in the representation of number systems. 
2. He proposed a novel and elegant solution to what was known as the three-body problem in mathematics. 
3. He introduced the concept of tensor fields into mathematical physics, which provided a framework for physicists to view the nature of gravity and curved spacetime. 
4. He predicted the existence of neutron stars, a form of extremely dense stellar objects contained within an extremely small volume. 
5. He developed a mathematical description of general relativity, known as ‘Eddington’s equations’. 
6. He proposed a new cosmological structure to account for the structure of the universe, known as the ‘Eddington-Milne universe’. 
7. He made a significant contribution to the development of the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. 
8. He devised a set of equations that could be used to predict the relative movement of stars and galaxies.

Born 28 December 1882, Kendal, Westmorland, England. Died 22 November 1944, Cambridge, England.
