**Gaston Floquet** was a French mathematician who worked on mathematical analysis, especially in the theory of differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Floquet joined the army of the Loire as a second lieutenant and fought in war until the signing of the peace treaty when he returned to his studies at the École Normale Supérieure.
* In this difficult atmosphere Floquet completed his studies in 1873 and on the 19 September of that year he was appointed to the Lycée de Belfort where he took charge of the mathematics course.
* Floquet obtained his mathematics agrégation on 15 September 1875 and a week later he was named as professor of elementary mathematics at the Lycée d'Angers.
* On 8 November of the following year Floquet was appointed to the position of professor of special mathematics at the Lycée de Clermont-Ferrand.
* It was situated near the border, and when Floquet arrived there it was a city full of barracks.
* Floquet submitted his doctoral thesis Sur la théorie des équations différentielles linéaires Ⓣ(On the theory of linear differential equations)   to the Faculty of Science in Paris on 8 April 1879.
* In November 1879 Floquet was given a temporary appointment as a professor at Nancy and in the following year he was put in charge of the mathematics course there.
* Floquet remained in Nancy during the war, never once leaving the city during the four years to 1918.
