**Gaston Floquet** was a French mathematician who worked on mathematical analysis, especially in the theory of differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the concept of Floquet theory, a subset of linear differential equation theory that explains the solutions of periodic or quasi-periodic equations.
2. Improved the solutions of nonlinear differential equations by constructing special functions, called Floquet functions, to substitute for the solutions of nonlinear equations.
3. Developed a general theorem of Floquet theory to simplify the solutions of trigonometric linear differential equation systems.
4. Proved the convergence of the solutions of periodic linear differential equations with fixed solutions using Floquet theory.
5. Discovered the covariance relationship of Floquet theory that states any two solutions of the same linear differential equation can be related by a fixed-value covariance relationship.
6. Proposed the substitution of Floquet theory for abelian equations to simplify solutions of more complicated systems of equations.
7. Derived solutions for systems with many periodic solutions using Floquet theory.

Born 15 December 1847, Ã‰pinal, France. Died 7 October 1920, Nancy, France.
