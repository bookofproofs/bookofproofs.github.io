**Max Noether** was a German mathematician who was one of the leaders of nineteenth century algebraic geometry. Although himself a very distinguished mathematician, his daughter Emmy Noether was to bring greater innovation to mathematics than did her father.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Sylow theorems, which are fundamental theorems of group theory. 
2. Proved the theorem of Krull-Noether, which is an important result in algebra. 
3. Established a link between algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, which is known as the theorem of Noetherian rings.
4. Developed the theory of valuation rings, which is an important tool for studying singularities in algebraic geometry. 
5. Extended the list of involved topics with his results in algebraic number theory and invariant theory. 
6. Developed the theory of Hermite rings, which are generalisations of fields. 
7. Researched group theory and commutative algebra, which then led to his theorem establishing a link between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

Born 24 September 1844, Mannheim, Baden, Germany. Died 13 December 1921, Erlangen, Germany.
