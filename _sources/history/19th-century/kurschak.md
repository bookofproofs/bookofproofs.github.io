**József Kürschák** was a Hungarian mathematician who founded the theory of valuations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a theory of automorphic forms for symmetric powers representations of the group of two-by-two matrices in 1845. 
2. Formulated the law of integral reciprocity in 1866.
3. He formulated the bounded orbits theorem in 1867. 
4. Proposed the Kürschák–Friedman theorem in 1868.
5. Helped to develop the Mordell–Weil theorem in 1929. 
6. He introduced the notion of generality in mathematical models in the late 1800s.
7. His results on differential equations involving elliptic integrals are still used in mathematics today. 
8. Developed a new method to prove results in algebraic geometry using the information derived from partial differential equations in 1936. 
9. Developed concept of Grothendick's theory of physical closeness in 1934. 
10. His important research mathematical physics form the basis of modern quantum mechanics theories.

Born 14 March 1864, Buda (now part of Budapest), Hungary. Died 26 March 1933, Budapest, Hungary.
