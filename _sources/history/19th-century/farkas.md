**Gyula Farkas** was a Hungarian mathematician and physicist who worked on linear programming and linear inequalities.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After completing his schooling by the Benedictines, Farkas went to Pest with the intention of studying law and music.
* However, the Compromise led to raising standards of education in mathematics and the sciences and Farkas would play his part in bringing the country up to international levels.
* Farkas worked as a private tutor for a while before returning to university to study physics and chemistry.
* Farkas was also given the opportunity to make visits abroad to broaden his background in mathematics and physics.
* By 1880 Farkas had an impressive publication record in Comptes Rendus and was appointed as a dozent in function theory at the university in Pest.
* Readers may have noted that we have given 27 December as the day of Farkas's death, rather than 26 December given by Filep in the quotation above.
* In fact he is remembered for Farkas theorem which is used in linear programming and also for his work on linear inequalities.
* In 1881 Gyula Farkas published a paper on Farkas Bolyai's iterative solution to the trinomial equation, making a careful study of the convergence of the algorithm.
* In a paper published three years later, Farkas examined the convergence of more general iterative methods.
* Not only did Farkas serve the University of Kolozsvár as a professor, but he also served as Dean and as Rector of the University.

Born 28 March 1847, Sárosd, Fejér County, Hungary. Died 27 December 1930, Pestszentlorinc, Hungary.
