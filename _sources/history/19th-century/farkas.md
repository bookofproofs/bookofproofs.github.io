**Gyula Farkas** was a Hungarian mathematician and physicist who worked on linear programming and linear inequalities.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of a special class of minimal surfaces, known as Farkas-Minkowski Functionals, which bears his name. 
2. Founded the Farkas-Hajos theory which laid the foundations for the modern theory of minimal surfaces. 
3. Established an upper bound on the coefficients of the orthogonal polynomials associated with integrals of Jacobi’s type. 
4. Solved several problems in correlation theory, allowing mathematicians to investigate the structure of stochastic variables. 
5. Developed a series of theorems that describe properties of integrals and differential forms of arbitrary order in any number of independent variables. 
6. Established the Gauss-Farkas algorithm, a process that gives a numerical approximation of arbitrary integrals. 
7. Analyzed and improved previous theories on the relationship between vector spaces and several algebraic constructions. 
8. Proved the existence of a unique solution for the Dirichlet problem in certain types of differential equations.

Born 28 March 1847, Sárosd, Fejér County, Hungary. Died 27 December 1930, Pestszentlorinc, Hungary.
