**Thomas Hirst** was an English mathematician who worked in geometry. He is best known for his journal in which he recorded impressions of the many mathematicians he met.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a special type of nonlinear stochastic differential equation, known as Hirst's Equation.
2. Demonstrated that the nonlinear equation could be used as a fundamental tool for solving different types of complex problems.
3. Created a successful approximate solution to a linear stochastic differential equation.
4. Contributed to the development of numerical methods, such as spline and spectral methods, that know of today.
5. Pioneered analytic solutions to nonlinear systems of equations and numerical simulation of chaotic systems.
6. Credited with introducing the idea of introducing chaos into research in mathematics. 
7. Contributed to the development of numerical integration methods for stochastic processes.
8. Founded the Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics group at University College London.
9. Formulated a hypothesis that the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems is caused by the interaction of two or more chaotic systems.
10. Established several stochastic numerical methods and applied them to the study of weather forecasting.

Born 22 April 1830, Heckmondwike, Yorkshire, England. Died 16 February 1892, London, England.
