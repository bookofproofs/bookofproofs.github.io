**Thomas Hirst** was an English mathematician who worked in geometry. He is best known for his journal in which he recorded impressions of the many mathematicians he met.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was a prosperous family, so much so that Hirst's father retired when only thirty-one years old since at that age he inherited his own father's money.
* Thomas Hirst had three elder siblings: John Henry (born 1826), Edward Oates (born 1827), and William Aked (born 1829).
* The family were certainly education minded and Thomas's father moved from Heckmondwike to be close to Wakefield when Thomas was five years old so that the boys could attend better schools.
* Thomas attended Wakefield primary school, then in 1841 he entered West Riding Proprietary School where he spent four years.
* In 1844 Thomas's father died in an accident.
* Thomas's mother was keen to find careers for here sons and for this reason Thomas was taken away from school when fifteen years of age and began to work as an apprentice engineer.
* He was ten years older than Hirst and he was to have a major influence on the direction which Hirst's life took.
* The first important influence which Tyndall had on Hirst was to encourage him, in addition to carrying out the many tasks relating to his job as a surveyor with the engineering firm, to continue with his education by reading on his own.
* Hirst read many works of literature, scientific texts and mathematics books such as Euclid's Elements, Hutton's Mathematics and Brewster's Life of Sir Isaac Newton.
* In February 1848 Hirst enrolled at the Halifax Mechanics Institute where he seemed for a while to be casting about seeking the subjects which interested him most.
* Hirst visited Tyndall in Germany in August 1849 but he had to return home earlier than planned on the news that his mother had died.
* On 2 November 1850 Hirst enrolled at the University of Marburg to study mathematics, physics and chemistry.
* However Bunsen left Marburg in the spring of 1851 and after this Hirst's interests turned increasingly towards mathematics, sometimes to such an extent that he would ignore his other subjects.
* Leaving Marburg, Hirst travelled to Göttingen where he spent two weeks attending lectures.
* Eisenstein, whom he had hoped to visit, died the day before Hirst arrived.
* From Berlin Hirst made the journey to Paris where he spent two months attending lectures by Liouville and Lamé.
* In 1856 Hirst resigned his teaching post at Queenwood so that he could take care of his wife and they travelled to the south of France hoping that the warmer weather would cure Anna.
* Leaving the south of France they settled in Paris where Hirst continued with his mathematical researches, publishing two papers on which he had begun to work while at Göttingen.
* Hirst began to attend lectures again in Paris and his own researches into geometry progressed well.
* Hirst was appointed to the University College School in 1860.
* It was not the only event of importance for Hirst in 1864 for that year saw him elected to the Council of the Royal Society.
* The chair at this preliminary meeting was taken by Hirst and the date for the first meeting proper was set for 16 January 1865.
* Hirst was elected the first Vice-President of the Society and he served it for the next twenty years as a member of Council, the Treasurer of the Society and then as its President in 1872-74.
* Hirst was appointed as professor of physics at University College London in 1865 and he began lecturing in October of that year.
* As well as promoting science in general, Hirst worked in particular for the education of women.
* Hirst throughout his life always became unhappy when commitments prevented him from undertaking mathematical research.
* In January 1871 the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching was founded and Hirst became its first president.
* In 1873 Hirst was appointed as Director of Studies at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich.
* Kidney stones and a stomach tumour were diagnosed and, somewhat depressed by the death of his brother John, Hirst resigned from Greenwich in 1883 at the age of 53.

Born 22 April 1830, Heckmondwike, Yorkshire, England. Died 16 February 1892, London, England.
