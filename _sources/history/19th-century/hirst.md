**Thomas Hirst** was an English mathematician who worked in geometry. He is best known for his journal in which he recorded impressions of the many mathematicians he met.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Thomas Hirst had three elder siblings: John Henry (born 1826), Edward Oates (born 1827), and William Aked (born 1829).
* Thomas attended Wakefield primary school, then in 1841 he entered West Riding Proprietary School where he spent four years.
* He was ten years older than Hirst and he was to have a major influence on the direction which Hirst's life took.
* The first important influence which Tyndall had on Hirst was to encourage him, in addition to carrying out the many tasks relating to his job as a surveyor with the engineering firm, to continue with his education by reading on his own.
* Hirst read many works of literature, scientific texts and mathematics books such as Euclid's Elements, Hutton's Mathematics and Brewster's Life of Sir Isaac Newton.
* In February 1848 Hirst enrolled at the Halifax Mechanics Institute where he seemed for a while to be casting about seeking the subjects which interested him most.
* On 2 November 1850 Hirst enrolled at the University of Marburg to study mathematics, physics and chemistry.
* However Bunsen left Marburg in the spring of 1851 and after this Hirst's interests turned increasingly towards mathematics, sometimes to such an extent that he would ignore his other subjects.
* Leaving Marburg, Hirst travelled to Göttingen where he spent two weeks attending lectures.
* Eisenstein, whom he had hoped to visit, died the day before Hirst arrived.
* From Berlin Hirst made the journey to Paris where he spent two months attending lectures by Liouville and Lamé.
* Leaving the south of France they settled in Paris where Hirst continued with his mathematical researches, publishing two papers on which he had begun to work while at Göttingen.
* Hirst began to attend lectures again in Paris and his own researches into geometry progressed well.
* Hirst was appointed to the University College School in 1860.
* It was not the only event of importance for Hirst in 1864 for that year saw him elected to the Council of the Royal Society.
* The chair at this preliminary meeting was taken by Hirst and the date for the first meeting proper was set for 16 January 1865.
* Hirst was elected the first Vice-President of the Society and he served it for the next twenty years as a member of Council, the Treasurer of the Society and then as its President in 1872-74.
* Hirst was appointed as professor of physics at University College London in 1865 and he began lecturing in October of that year.
* As well as promoting science in general, Hirst worked in particular for the education of women.
* Hirst throughout his life always became unhappy when commitments prevented him from undertaking mathematical research.
* In January 1871 the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching was founded and Hirst became its first president.
* In 1873 Hirst was appointed as Director of Studies at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich.

Born 22 April 1830, Heckmondwike, Yorkshire, England. Died 16 February 1892, London, England.
