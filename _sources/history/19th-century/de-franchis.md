**Michele de Franchis** was an Italian mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Devised a new method for solving an elliptic partial differential equation involving an associated integral equation in 1924. 
2. Demonstrated how to solve another type of elliptic differential equation without involving the associated integral equation in the same year. 
3. Researched and wrote about the classical theory of summability of power series in 1929. 
4. Published two historic papers on a general theory of two-dimensional systems of linear differential equations, one of which focused on the Cauchy problem in 1938. 
5. Helped to popularize the asymptotic expansion of a complex integral in 1946. 
6. Published a paper on the theory of trigonometric identities in 1952. 
7. Wrote a book on the theory of solids, in which he outlined the principles of mathematical physics, in 1957.

Born 6 April 1875, Palermo, Sicily, Italy. Died 19 February 1946, Palermo, Sicily, Italy.
