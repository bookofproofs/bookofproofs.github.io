**Bevan Braithwaite Baker** graduated from University College London. After service in World War I he became a lecturer at Edinburgh University. He left to become Professor at Royal Holloway College London.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* George was educated at the Collegiate Institute, Kingston, Ontario, Canada until 1878 when he went to London and became an apprentice in the works of Joseph Baker and Sons at 58 City Road, London.
* Bevan Baker had two older siblings: Sarah Martha Baker (born July 1887, died 1817), who became a well-known botanist and ecologist, and George Ralph Baker (born 9 August 1888, died December 1963) who went on to be awarded a B.Sc. and a B.Sc. Engineering, becoming a draughtsman.
* Baker attended Sidcot School in Somerset before entering University College, London, to study physics.
* After graduating with a Second Class Honours degree in physics in 1909, Baker went to Munich to undertake research but quickly decided that his love was mathematics rather than physics so he returned to University College, London to take an Honours Mathematics degree.
* John Stuart Bevan-Baker became an acclaimed composer and we give a short biography at the end of this article.
* Baker was a member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, joining in December 1920.
* Baker served the Society as Secretary from 1921 until he left Edinburgh in 1924.
* While on the staff of Edinburgh University, Baker submitted a 2-volume thesis "The Convergence of the Trigonometric Series of Dynamics" for the degree of D.Sc. which he was duly awarded.
* Already a member of the London Mathematical Society, Bevan Baker joined the American Mathematical Society in April 1923.
* Stimulated by a course of post-graduate lectures on the Partial Differential Equations of Mathematical Physics which Professor E T Whittaker gave in 1923 in the Mathematical Institute of Edinburgh University, Baker planned a comprehensive treatise covering the whole of this field.
* Bevan Baker was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 7 March 1921, his proposers being Sir Edmund T Whittaker, Cargill G Knott, Ellice M Horsburgh, Alexander H Freeland Barbour.
* An obituary of Bevan-Baker, written by E T Copson, appears in the Royal Society of Edinburgh Year Book 1964, pages 7-8.
* In 1939 Bevan-Baker published the book The Mathematical Theory of Huygens' Principle in collaboration with E T Copson.

Born 10 May 1890, Canonbury, London, England. Died 1 July 1963, Wednesbury, Staffordshire,England.
