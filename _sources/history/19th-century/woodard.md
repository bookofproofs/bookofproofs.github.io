**Dudley Woodard** was an American mathematician and educator who was the second African-American to earn a PhD in Mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Dudley R Woodard, born in Atlanta, Georgia, worked as a Railway Mail Clerk.
* He married Geneva Anderson on 8 March 1881 in Galveston, Texas and their first child was Dudley Weldon Woodard, the subject of this biography.
* Dudley R Woodard married his second wife Lulu Worthy on 7 December 1893 in Pike, Georgia.
* In the 1900 census, Woodard is living in Galveston, but not with his family, for he is a boarder at the house of Shiloh Morgan on 29th Street.
* The data is a little confused since Woodard's father was born on 20 February 1858 but appears on the 1900 census form as being born in February 1861.
* Later in the year 1900, Woodard moved to Ohio to study at Wilberforce College which had been founded by Methodists in 1856 to educate African Americans, particularly to train them as teachers.
* Woodard graduated from Wilberforce College in 1903 with an A.B. in mathematics.
* After the award of his Master's degree, Woodard was appointed to the Tuskegee Institute where he taught from 1907 to 1914.
* A year after he began teaching at the Tuskegee Institute, Woodard married Gertrude Lee Hadnott in Birmingham, Jefferson County, Alabama on 4 August 1908.
* Woodard's age on the Marriage License is is given as 27 (he was actually still 26) and Gertrude's age is given as 25.
* On 29 June 1909 Dudley and Gertrude Woodard had a son Dudley Hadnott Woodard (1909-1996).
* At the 1910 census Woodard is living in a rented house outside the town of Tuskegee with his wife Gertrude and new baby Dudley H.
* While at Tuskegee, Woodard published Negro progress in a Mississippi town, being a study of conditions in Jackson, Mississippi (1909), Practical Arithmetic (1911), and The Teaching of Geometry at Tuskegee (1913).
* The matter contained herein has all been taken by Mr D W Woodard, the author, from the industrial and business operations of the Institute.
* The title page gives the author as Dudley W Woodard, Head of Division of Mathematics, Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute.
* In 1914, Woodard left the Tuskegee Institute and became a teacher at Wilberforce College where he had himself studied as a student.
* Woodard was awarded a Ph.D. on Wednesday, 28 June 1928, for his thesis On Two-Dimensional Analysis Situs with Special Reference to the Jordan Curve Theorem.
* We note that with the award of a Ph.D., Woodard became the second African American to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics (the first was Elbert Frank Cox in 1925).
* In the Washington, District of Columbia, City Directory of 1929 he is listed as living at 127 West Street North West with his wife Gertrude Woodard.
* In 1929 Woodard established a Master of Science programme in mathematics at Howard University.
* Claytor had entered Howard University in September 1925 where he was taught by Woodard.
* Advised by Woodard, Claytor took the courses offered on group theory, topology, number theory, real analysis and complex analysis.
* Woodard achieved other important things at Howard.
* In an age of discrimination, Dudley Weldon Woodard had competed and triumphed in the face of overwhelming odds.
* Deane Montgomery, former president of the American Mathematical Society and the International Mathematical Union described Woodard as, "an extremely nice man, well-balanced personally." Leo Zippin, who was an internationally known specialist in Woodard's field, said that he was "one of the noblest men I've ever known." Dr Woodard was not only a brilliant mathematician, but a man of high intelligence and dignity; he enjoyed life in spite of his racial environment.
* In April 1942, Woodard completed a Registration Form.
* The National Association of Mathematicians honours Woodard with the Claytor-Woodard Lectures.

Born 3 October 1881, Galveston, Texas, USA. Died 15 July 1965, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.
