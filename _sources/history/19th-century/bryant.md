* Of course Bryant had no degree, for women could not take degrees at universities at this time.
* Still encouraged by Buss, Bryant decided to read for a B.Sc. degree but there were severe difficulties to overcome.
* While studying for her D.Sc., Bryant was elected to the London Mathematical Society in 1882.
* Bryant, however, does have the distinction of being the first woman to have a paper published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society.
* Bryant's conclusion that elongated rhombic semi-dodecahedra are the natural form of honeycomb cells had been observed by Kepler.
* In 1895 Frances Buss died and Bryant succeeded her as head of the North London Collegiate School.
* Bryant published on many topics, Irish history, religion, education, women's rights, and philosophy.
* A staunch supporter of Irish Home Rule, Sophie work books on Irish history - Celtic Ireland (1889), The Genius of the Gael: A study in Celtic psychology and its manifestations (1913) and Liberty, order and law under native Irish rule: a study in the Book of the Ancient Laws of Ireland (1923).
