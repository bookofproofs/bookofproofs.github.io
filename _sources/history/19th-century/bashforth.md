**Francis Bashforth **was an applied mathematician who invented the Bashforth Chronograph and conducted experiments to determine air resistance. He became the leading British authority on ballistics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Created a method for solving the motion of a projectile in a vacuum which was later published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.
2. Found a direct connection between the deviation from the deceleration of a projectile during flight and the air-density of the atmosphere.
3. Advanced the theory of trajectory calculation, making improvements to range tables in ballistics.
4. Conducted experiments on fired projectiles, exploring the dynamics of their motion by adjusting the angle of elevation for a given charge.
5. Created a method for calculating the average resistance of the air to projectiles, providing a means for improving accuracy in artillery fire.
6. Developed a consistent theory of the trajectory of a body moving in a resisting medium.
7. Discovered an equation that showed a direct relationship between air pressure, air density and air temperature.
8. Established a solid foundation for modern trajectory and wind tunnel research.
9. Extrapolated his equations and developed theories on a wide range of topics including the resistance of bodies in fluids, lift coefficients, supersonic flow, and boundary layer characteristics.

Born 8 January 1819, Thurnscoe, near Doncaster, Yorkshire, England. Died 13 February 1912, Brunnen, Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire, England.
