**Ernst Fiedler** was a German born Swiss  school teacher.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Three years later Wilhelm Fiedler was appointed to fill the chair of descriptive geometry at the Polytechnic in Zürich, which had been vacant since Wolfgang von Deschwanden's death.
* Ernst attended the Gymnasium in Zürich and, from 1879 onwards, the Polytechnic, where he studied mathematics at the Department for Mathematics and Physics Teachers.
* Fiedler was influential in the school's development, especially after having become Director of the school in 1904, when it was re-organised and renamed as Oberrealschule.
* Fiedler did not produce any mathematical research papers; he was very much a schoolteacher and not a research mathematician.
* Early on Fiedler made a name for himself in the Swiss army, which he joined in 1881.
* Fiedler was a member of the Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Schulgesundheitspflege, a society taking charge of all aspects of health and hygiene in Swiss schools.
* It is due to Fiedler that shorthand was introduced as an optional subject in secondary schools.
* Following a nervous breakdown, Fiedler became heavily involved in the temperance movement of the late 19th  and early 20th  centuries, educating the public on the dangers of alcohol abuse.
* Fiedler is only mentioned once in the minutes of the committee of the first International Congress of Mathematicians: he attended the meeting on 08 December 1896.
* Fiedler attended two further congresses, the 1908 ICM in Rome and the 1912 ICM in Cambridge, but did not give a talk at either.

Born 22 July 1861, Chemnitz, Saxony, Germany. Died 6 October 1954, Zurich, Switzerland.
