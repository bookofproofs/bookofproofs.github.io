### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Frederick Griffiths was born in Wales and had emigrated to the United States in 1880.
* He was a minister in Michigan before moving to Ohio in 1898 where Lois and her brother Harold (born 1898) were born.

* During her undergraduate years Lois was assistant to Comptroller Condon of the University of Washington.
* Entering the University of Chicago in October 1925, Griffiths undertook research for a doctorate in mathematics working with her thesis supervisor Leonard Dickson.
* Immediately following the award of her doctorate, Griffiths was appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where she spent the whole of her teaching career.
* In 1945 Griffiths produced a typewritten set of notes Determinants and systems of linear equations.
* Two later typewritten sets of notes by Griffiths Outline of the theory of groups (1948) and Matrices and linear dependence (1949) were never published.
* Before writing her textbook, Griffiths had published a number of excellent reviews of important algebra texts.
* Griffiths attended meetings of both the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America.
* As to her hobbies, Griffiths loved walking, gardening and cooking.
