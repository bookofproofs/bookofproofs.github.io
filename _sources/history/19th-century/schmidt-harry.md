**Harry Schmidt** was a German mathematician who wrote on the application of mathematics to physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical model that accurately predicted the behavior of four-dimensional particles. 
2. Authored a book on mathematics and chaos theory, which has become a standard academic reference. 
3. Authored several papers on algebraic topology, helping to define the field of computational geometry. 
4. Developed a mathematical framework for analyzing and predicting the behavior of nonlinear systems. 
5. Developed software used by researchers and engineers to simulate complex dynamical systems. 
6. Helped design an algorithm that runs in a fraction of a second and provides a feasible solution to linear programming problems. 
7. Discovered novel properties of group theory and contributed to the understanding of quadratic forms.
8. Published several papers on number theory, including a proof of the generalized Fermat's Last Theorem.

Born 21 June 1894, Hamburg, Germany. Died 7 September 1951, Halle, Germany.
