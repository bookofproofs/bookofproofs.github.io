**Harry Schmidt** was a German mathematician who wrote on the application of mathematics to physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Harry attended a private school in Hamburg from 1901 to 1904, then attended the Oberrealschule in Altona-Ottensen until 1907.
* In the spring of 1913 Schmidt graduated from high school passing his final examination.
* World events, however, were to have a major impact on Schmidt's university education.
* The effect of the war on Schmidt was that, as a student with expertise in physics and chemistry, he was required to undertake war work.
* In 1918 Schmidt began undertaking research at the University of Leipzig, working towards his doctoral thesis.
* Schmidt published a number of important books between 1920 and 1922, in German, English and Italian.
* In 1923 Schmidt was appointed as professor at the polytechnic institute in Koethen where he remained until 1937.
* From August 1937 Schmidt was employed as a ordinary professor for mathematics in the service of the Reich, working at the aviation laboratory in Berlin-Adlershof.
* This was a difficult period for Schmidt, for his wife died on 22 April 1941.
* Schmidt's home was destroyed in a bombing raid in August, before the Battle of Berlin which began in November and saw sixteen bombing raids over the winter of 1943-44.
* For a while after his home was destroyed Schmidt lived with friends in Berlin but in December he found a house in Koethen (Anhalt).
* Schmidt's employment at the aviation research laboratory came to an end.
* While he was working at the laboratory Schmidt published, jointly with Kurt Schr√∂der, a comprehensive report on the theory of laminar boundary layers deals with the basic conceptions and equations Laminare Grenzschichten.
* Before the end of 1945 Schmidt was appointed as an ordinary professor to the Martin-Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg.
* Although he had an appointment in Halle, Schmidt could not find accommodation there so remained living in his house in Koethen which is about 25 km north of Halle.
* It was a difficult railway journey for Schmidt to have to make every day.
* Sadly, after only a year living in his new home, Schmidt developed tuberculosis and taken to hospital on 6 April.
* Schmidt then requested that he be allowed premature retirement, but the University of Halle refused his request.
* After Schmidt died his colleagues completed the manuscript he was writing giving an introduction to vector and tensors.

Born 21 June 1894, Hamburg, Germany. Died 7 September 1951, Halle, Germany.
