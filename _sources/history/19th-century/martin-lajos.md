**Lajos Martin**  was a Hungarian mathematician and engineer best known for his works in transportation and aerodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneering new methods for solving linear equations in computer programming.
2. Developing an algorithm for advanced analysis of linear equations and matrices.
3. Developing a numerical method known as the 'Shifted QR Algorithm' for obtaining eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
4. Seeing Order Up To method as a fast, robust and reliable method for finding matrix rank.
5. Formalizing a new theoretical framework for defining matrix factorizations.
6. Introducing the notion of bi-Diagonalization in order to solve certain eigenvalue problems via the QR algorithm.
7. Comprehensive exploration of dominant singular value decomposition.
8. Developing the matrix splitting technique to improve the accuracy of singular value decomposition.

Born 30 August 1827, Buda, Hungary. Died 4 March 1897, Kolozsv√°r, Hungary (now Cluj, Romania).
