**Heinrich Burkhardt** was a German mathematician who worked on the theory of the elliptical functions, series expansions, group theory and the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Burkhardt-Noether Theorem which provided a further solution to the problem of algebraic curves. 
2. Proved Siegelâ€™s theorem on the finiteness of the class number of quadratic forms.
3. Contributed to the development of abstract algebra and Galois Theory.
4. Conducted research on the study of elliptic surfaces, which provided deep insights into the structure of surfaces with higher genus.
5. Studied the Riemann-Roch theorem and the Zariski topology.
6. Used algebraic geometry and analysis in order to solve curvature problems.
7. Published influential works such as "Galois Theory of Algebraic Functions" and "The Arithmetic Theory of Elliptic Curves".

Born 15 October 1861, Schweinfurt, Germany. Died 2 November 1914, Munich, Germany.
