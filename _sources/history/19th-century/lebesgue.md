**Lebesgue** formulated the theory of measure in 1901 and the following year he gave the definition of the Lebesgue integral that generalises the notion of the Riemann integral.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of measure and integral, which is the basis of modern integration theory.
2. Established the theory of Lebesgue measure, which provides a framework for integration of an arbitrary function over an arbitrary set.
3. Formulated the isoperimetric inequality, which states that the area of measure of any set is less than or equal to the square of its perimeter.
4. Derived the fundamental lemma of calculus, which states that if a continuous function is evaluated at each point in a partition of its domain, the integral of the function over the domain is equal to the sum of the evaluations of the function.
5. Proved the mean value theorem for integrals and created an extension of the theorem known as the general mean value theorem.
6. Investigated the fields of set theory and numerical analysis, devising solutions to a number of difficult problems in those areas.
7. Developed the theory of measure, a framework for rigorously defining areas, volumes, and other geometric figures. 
8. Established the Lebesgue differentiation theorem, which relates measurable functions to their derivatives.
9. Developed the Lebesgue integral, which generalizes the Riemann integral and allows integrals of non-continuous functions. 
10. Established a number of important theorems related to the use of measurable sets and functions in mathematical analysis.

Born 28 June 1875, Beauvais, Oise, Picardie, France. Died 26 July 1941, Paris, France.
