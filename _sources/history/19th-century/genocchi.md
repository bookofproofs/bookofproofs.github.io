**Angelo Genocchi** was an Italian mathematician who worked on number theory, series and the integral calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Genocchi was, however, very active politically.
* Genocchi and his liberal friends had formed a provisional government in Piacenza but before they could make political progress the Austrians attacked the region.
* Before the Austrians arrived in Piacenza Genocchi, greatly disappointed at the turn of events, and other liberals, left the city.
* Genocchi went to live in Turin, refusing requests from his friends to return to Piacenza saying he would not return until freedom returned.
* From 1859 Genocchi held the Chair of Algebra and Complementary Geometry at Turin, then the following year he moved to the Chair of Higher Analysis.
* The main research topics which Genocchi worked on were number theory, series and the integral calculus.
* In 1882 Genocchi broke his kneecap and Peano took over his teaching.
* The kneecap was broken while Genocchi was on his holidays in September 1882.
* In 1884 Differential Calculus and Fundamentals of Integral Calculus was published under Genocchi's name.
* This book was based on Genocchi's lectures but was largely the work of Peano.
* The book was important and widely aclaimed despite some unease over whether Peano had Genocchi's full agreement to publish the text with the additions he made.
* Despite making a partial recovery, during which time he resumed his teaching duties, soon Genocchi's health failed again and he slowly gave up all his activities.

Born 5 March 1817, Piacenza, Habsburg Empire (now Italy). Died 7 March 1889, Turin, Italy.
