**Angelo Genocchi** was an Italian mathematician who worked on number theory, series and the integral calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He proved an important theorem in differential calculus, namely the “Genocchi’s theorem of integration by parts.”
2. He published a study of the integrals and derivatives of power series.
3. He was the first mathematician to introduce the notations of the derivatives and the integration’s symbol.
4. He made important contributions to the study of elliptic integrals.
5. He studied the important concept of mathematical expectation.
6. He helped develop the dual systems of integral calculus.
7. He introduced the detailed study of analytic function theory.
8. He helped develop a number of methods for the analysis of prime series.
9. He proposed an equation of the fourth degree which was later known as the 'Genocchi equation.'
10. He was the first mathematician to investigate the 'volumes' of the figures of infinite scale.

Born 5 March 1817, Piacenza, Habsburg Empire (now Italy). Died 7 March 1889, Turin, Italy.
