**Nikolai Joukowski** or **Zhukovsky** was a Russian scientist who did pioneering work on aerodynamics. He is best known for the so-called _Joukowski aerofoil_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Nikolai Egorovich attended the Fourth Gymnasium for Men in Moscow, completing his secondary education there in 1864.
* After two years teaching at the Gymnasium, Zhukovskii received an invitation to teach mathematics at Moscow Technical School then, from 1874, he also taught theoretical mechanics there.
* While he was teaching these courses, Zhukovskii was also studying for his Master's Degree and in 1876 he was awarded this degree for a thesis on the kinematics of a liquid.
* After being awarded his Master's Degree, a special chair of mechanics was created for Zhukovskii at Moscow Technical School.
* Zhukovskii obtained a doctorate from Moscow University in 1882 for a dissertation on the stability of motion.
* Over his career Zhukovskii had a remarkable publications record producing over 200 publications on mechanics.
* Perhaps Zhukovskii is most famous, however, as the founder of the Russian schools of hydromechanics and aeromechanics.
* Zhukovskii purchased one of the eight gliders which Lilienthal sold to members of the public.
* In 1906 Zhukovskii published two papers in which he gave a mathematical expression for the lift on an airfoil.
* Zhukovskii was concerned both with theoretical and with experimental aspects of the subject.
* The Institute was renamed the N E Zhukovskii Academy of Military and Aeronautical Engineering in 1922 following Zhukovskii's death.
* Zhukovskii's works were published in 25 volumes from 1935 to 1950.

Born 17 January 1847, Orekhovo, Vladimir gubernia, Russia. Died 17 March 1921, Moscow, USSR.
