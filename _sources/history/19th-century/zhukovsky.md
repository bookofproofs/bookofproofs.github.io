**Nikolai Joukowski** or **Zhukovsky** was a Russian scientist who did pioneering work on aerodynamics. He is best known for the so-called _Joukowski aerofoil_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed analytical mechanics, using advanced mathematical principles for modeling the flow and behavior of particles, thereby creating a powerful foundation for technical calculations and theory.  
2. Developed the theory of air drag and is credited for the creation of the drag coefficient, which is now widely used for aerodynamic calculations. 
3. Established the principle of energy conservation for the requirements of aerodynamics.
4. Pioneered the use of the superposition of varying forces in theoretical aerodynamics. 
5. Proposed the idea of the Rankine-Hugoniot relation, now often used in fluid mechanics. 
6. Pioneered the concept of upper and lower bounds in hydrodynamics, which later led to the development of optimal control theory. 
7. Created the "Whirling of a Solid" theorem, which served as a milestone for the development of modern rotor dynamics. 
8. Instituted the use of asymptotic methods in the field of aerodynamics and hydrodynamics.
9. Developed a mathematical theory of the gyroscope, which served as the basis of modern guidance systems. 
10. Developed a general theory of motion of rigid bodies, laying the foundations for modern robotics.

Born 17 January 1847, Orekhovo, Vladimir gubernia, Russia. Died 17 March 1921, Moscow, USSR.
