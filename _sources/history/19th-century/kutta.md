**Wilhelm Kutta** was a German engineer who is best known for his work on the numerical solution of differential equations (the Runge-Kutta method).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the 'Kutta-Joukowski Theorem', which states that the circulation of a fluid around an aerofoil is equal to the product of the speed and the lift coefficient. 
2. Developed the Kutta Condition, which states that any non-lifting flow over the trailing edge of an aerodynamic body results in even pressure distribution over the profile surface. 
3. Invented 'Kutta-Zhukovsky Theory', which can be used to calculate the lift and force of motion in air or water on an airfoil or hydrofoil based on its velocity. 
4. Investigated the relationships between pressure, velocity, and flow for two-dimensional fluid. 
5. Applied methods of mathematical analysis to challenges in aerodynamics, such as the calculation of the center of pressure of an airfoil.
6. Established the fundamental connection between aerodynamics and mathematics in the field of fluid mechanics. 
7. Developed a second order ordinary differential equation that is fundamental to the study of aerodynamics. 
8. Developed the field of 'lifting line theory', which refers to a method of calculating the lift of an aircraft wing.

Born 3 November 1867, Pitschen, Upper Silesia (now Byczyna, Poland). Died 25 December 1944, FÃ¼rstenfeldbruck, Germany.
