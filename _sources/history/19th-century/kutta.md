**Wilhelm Kutta** was a German engineer who is best known for his work on the numerical solution of differential equations (the Runge-Kutta method).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Tragically Kutta's parents died when he was still young and, together with his brother Karl, he went to Breslau to be brought up by an uncle.
* After graduating from the Gymnasium, Kutta studied at the University of Breslau from 1885 to 1890.
* Kutta was appointed to a post at the Technische Hochschule at Munich as an assistant in mathematics and physics from 1894.
* It contains the now famous  Runge-Kutta method for solving ordinary differential equations.
* Sebastian Finsterwalder also taught at the Institute in Munich where Kutta worked and he was interested in aviation.
* He brought photographs of early aircraft to the Institute and Kutta became fascinated by the mathematics behind aviation, namely aerodynamics.
* At Stuttgart Kutta concentrated his teaching on engineers who benefited greatly from his inspiring presentation.
* The former contains the Runge-Kutta method for solving ordinary differential equations while the latter contains the Zhukovsky-Kutta (or Joukowski-Kutta) theorem giving the lift on an aerofoil.
* Zhukovsky made the discoveries independently of Kutta, and published his version four years after Kutta.
* However, Kutta went on to make further important contributions to aerodynamics.
* Two further topics which Kutta worked on were research on glaciers and also research in the history of mathematics.
* Kutta made measurements of glaciers working from photographs taken in the East Alps and also worked with others in constructing maps of the area covered by glaciers.
* On the other topic, namely the history of mathematics, our first comment is that this was a very natural interest for Kutta to have.
* Kutta's paper was published in 1901.
* Kutta was a remarkable person quite apart from his outstanding contributions to mathematics.
* However, Pfeiffer also writes that despite Kutta's wide ranging interests, he was a lonely man.

Born 3 November 1867, Pitschen, Upper Silesia (now Byczyna, Poland). Died 25 December 1944, FÃ¼rstenfeldbruck, Germany.
