**Rudolf Clausius** did important work in thermodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He pioneered the mathematical theory of thermodynamics, also known as "Clausius' Theorem", and introduced the notion of entropy. 
2. He was the first to accurately define energy and entropy, and he showed how to derive the 1st and 2nd Laws of Thermodynamics from a single statement. 
3. He developed the concept of a "thermodynamic potential", which quantifies how much work a system can do as a function of its internal energy and temperature. 
4. He derived the time-dependent relationships between energy and entropy, Enthalpy and Entropy, and Entropy and Temperature. 
5. He was one of the first to use statistical thermodynamics to explain observations about the behavior of gases. 
6. He provided the mathematical foundations for the Carnot Cycle, which describes how a heat engine works. 
7. He formulated the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, which describes the probability of finding a particle at a certain energy state. 
8. He also introduced what has come to be known as Clausius' theorem, which relates thermal efficiency and reversible processes.

Born 2 January 1822, Koslin, Prussia (now Koszalin, Poland). Died 24 August 1888, Bonn, Germany.
