**Wilhelm Fiedler** was a German mathematician, known for his textbooks of geometry and for his contributions to descriptive geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the "Fiedler Norm", a technique to estimate the quality of a given matrix.
2. Developed the “Fiedler Vector”, a method to find the approximate solution to certain problems involving matrices.
3. The Fiedler Variation, a method that uses linear algebra and optimization techniques to determine the “best” combination of elements in a matrix.
4. Proved a theorem that relates the spectral radius of a certain type of matrix with its Frobenius norm. 
5. Demonstrated a relationship between the spectral radius and the geometry of a matrix's eigenvectors.
6. Developed a method to calculate the singular values of a rectangular matrix.
7. Developed a linear algebraic technique to determine the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a matrix. 
8. Showed a relationship between two matrices and their inverses.

Born 3 April 1832, Chemnitz, Saxony, Germany. Died 19 November 1912, Zürich, Switzerland.
