**Stephen de Gurbs** was  notable for sponsoring a mathematical prize and stained glass window at the University of Aberdeen.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm to compute the perfect dissection of a regular polygon into any other number of polygons. 
2. Developed an algorithm to calculate the number of interior angles of a polygon, based on the number of sides.
3. Proved theorems related to two-graphs and graph decompositions.
4. Found significant results related to the ultimate number of convex polyhedra.
5. Explored the problem of providing adequate mathematical proofs for complicated theorems.
6. Discovered formulas for both the area and circumference of any regular polygon.
7. Constructed new properties of polyhedra and polytope solids.
8. Established various mathematically-valid approaches for figuring out the approximate surface area of polyhedra.
9. Pioneered the concept of relative graph theory and a system for unifying and interpreting graphical data.
10. Published a paper that independently reformulated the fundamental "Four Colour Theorem", thus providing a new proof for the theorem.

Born 31 March 1800, Mitcham, Surrey, England. Died 14 December 1892, Brighton, England.
