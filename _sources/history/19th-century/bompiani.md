**Enrico Bompiani** was an Italian mathematician, specializing in differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the first textbook on Euclidean geometry published in Italian in 1888.
2. Was one of the first Italian mathematicians to popularize the use of vectors and projective geometry.
3. Conducted several experiments to understand the behavior of pendulums.
4. Developed the mathematical measurement of capacity and viscosity of gases.
5. Pioneered modern methods of teaching geometry, including the first use of geometric models and figures.
6. Introduced the concept of dynamic frames of reference through his work with analytical mechanics.
7. Developed techniques to represent algebraic curves by means of differential equations. 
8. Discovered the hyperbolic functions and their applications to differential geometry.
9. Used his work on reflexivity of linear operators and Galois theory to solve algebraic equations.
10. Developed a method to calculate the sum of a series using partial or differential equations.

Born 12 February 1889, Rome, Italy. Died 22 September 1975, Rome, Italy.
