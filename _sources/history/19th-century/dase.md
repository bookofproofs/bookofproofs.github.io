4. He constructed the decimal expansion of π (pi) to 181 decimal places.
5. He determined the angles of a triangle when the lengths of its three sides were given.
6. He proved some important theorems in spherical trigonometry.
7. He solved a classical problem on the multiplication of two numbers.
8. He discovered a method for evaluating the integral of a function with a power series expansion.
9. He determined the roots of an equation of the fifth degree.
