**Otto Stolz**  was an Austrian mathematician who worked on mathematical analysis and infinitesimals.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Otto Stolz was credited with first proving the intermediate value theorem, one of the most important theorems in calculus.
2. He introduced the Stolz angle and Stolz–Cesàro theorem in the field of trigonometry.
3. He developed the Stolz–Cesàro theorem in summation theory, which provided a mathematical estimation of the sum of an infinite series.
4. He made contributions to the calculus of variations, an area of mathematics used in engineering and physics.
5. He also developed a new method for solving differential equations, which later became known as the Stolz iteration method.
6. He provided the first proof of Cauchy's convergence theorem in analytic number theory.
7. He developed Stolz theorem, a form of the second mean value theorem in real analysis.

Born 3 May 1842, Hall (now Solbad Hall in Tirol), Austria. Died 25 October 1905, Innsbruck, Austria.
