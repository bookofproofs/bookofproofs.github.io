**Otto Stolz**  was an Austrian mathematician who worked on mathematical analysis and infinitesimals.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After attending the Gymnasium in Innsbruck, Stolz studied at the University of Innsbruck before moving to the University of Vienna where he undertook research for his doctorate.
* After the award of his doctorate, Stolz habilitated at the University of Vienna and worked there as a Privatdozent until 1869.
* In July 1872 Stolz was appointed an extraordinary professor in his home town of Innsbruck.
* We mentioned the Stolz-Klein correspondence above.
* Topics covered are those of interest to Klein and to Stolz and include Klein's Erlangen program, nowhere differentiable continuous functions, geometry, and the topology of the line.
* In the 1870s Weierstrass's ε, δ approach to analysis became to standard approach and, in B Bolzano's Bedeutung in der Geschichte der Infinitesimalrechnung Ⓣ(Bolzano's importance in the history of calculus) (1881), Stolz pointed out that Bolzano had suggested a similar approach even before Cauchy had attempted his own way of making analysis more rigorous.
* This can actually be traced back to Eudoxus but the term 'Archimedes' axiom' used today was coined by Stolz in 1882 in Zur Geometrie der Alten, insbesondere über ein Axiom des Archimedes Ⓣ(On ancient geometry, in particular on an axiom of Archimedes).
* This two volume work, like all  Stolz's books, was very well written; it became a classic.
* A second edition was published in 1915, ten years after Stolz's death.

Born 3 May 1842, Hall (now Solbad Hall in Tirol), Austria. Died 25 October 1905, Innsbruck, Austria.
