**James Taylor** was a Scottish mathematics teacher who taught at Dollar Academy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After graduating, Taylor was appointed Mathematics Master at New College, Southsea, Portsmouth.
* In addition to his role as a teacher of mathematics, Taylor took in boys as boarders.
* When Mr Taylor took pen in hand, he showed that he possessed the gift of lucid expression, as is illustrated in the series of articles on "The Transit of Venus" in 1882, which he contributed to The Dollar Magazine of that year.
* The Edinburgh Mathematical Society was founded in February 1883 and Taylor was present at the first meeting, becoming a founder member.
* Somewhat confusingly another James Taylor, who was a Mathematical Master at  Edinburgh Academy, joined the Society in November 1886 so for around 12 years the Society had the rather confusing situation of having two members with precisely the same name (neither appears to have had a middle name).
* Taylor died on Monday 29 January 1910 at Institution Place, Dollar.

Born 19 June 1851, Keith, Scotland. Died 29 January 1910, Institution Place, Dollar, Scotland.
