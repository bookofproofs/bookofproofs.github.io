**James Taylor** was a Scottish mathematics teacher who taught at Dollar Academy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Taylor Expansion technique, which is a powerful mathematical tool used to approximate a function with a series.
2. Developed the Taylor's Theorem, which generalizes the techniques of calculus, providing and alternative way to define derivatives.
3. Wrote several influential books on mathematics and mathematical analysis.
4. Made great contributions to the fields of geometry and algebra. 
5. Developed the Taylor's Method of Approximations, which was a crucial step in the development of differential equations.
6. Published several important papers on the applications of mathematics.
7. Developed the Taylor's theorem for several variables.
8. Discovered the concept of expansions by integration.

Born 19 June 1851, Keith, Scotland. Died 29 January 1910, Institution Place, Dollar, Scotland.
