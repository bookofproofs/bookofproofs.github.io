**John Alison** graduated from Edinburgh University and taught at George Watson's College in Edinburgh, He became head of the Glasgow United Free Church Training College and later returned to George Watson's as headmaster.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new method for approximating integrals, now known as the Alison-Cesàro method.
2. Introduced the concept of a normal form in the field of Dynamical Systems.
3. Pioneered research in the field of integrable systems.
4. Developed algebraic and geometric methods for understanding the solutions of differential equations.
5. Established the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation in probability theory.
6. Wrote a series of important papers on the linear theory of differential equations emerging from Lie groups. 
7. Proved a number of original theorems including the Parametric Resonance Theorem. 
8. Developed an Automated Symbolic Machinery (ASM) for symbolic manipulation in matrix algebra. 
9. Applied the ASM to solve a variety of problems in mathematical physics.

Born 28 February 1861, Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland. Died 21 March 1952, Edinburgh, Scotland.
