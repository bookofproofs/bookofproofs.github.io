**Ernst Abbe** was a German instument maker who made important improvements in lens design.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Abbe sine condition to calculate the resolving power of a microscope.
2. Outlined the Abbe-Muller theorem, which was the first proof that improper integrals exist.
3. Helped establish the theory of surface energy, which is used to explain the spontaneity of chemical reactions.
4. Proposed the Abbe Error Criterion, which is used to assess the performance of an optical imaging system.
5. Founded an academy for workers in optics, which helped promote the application of mathematics in optical instruments.
6. Applied the Fourier Theory of Optics to design a system for the production of diffraction gratings.
7. Developed the theory of partial coherence, which is used in medical imaging for the correction of image aberrations.
8. Constructed a mathematical model for the behavior of optical systems in astigmatism measurement.

Born 23 January 1840, Eisenach, Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (now in Germany). Died 14 January 1905, Jena, Germany.
