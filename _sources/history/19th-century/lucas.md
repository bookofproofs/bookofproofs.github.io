**Edouard Lucas** was a French mathematician who is best known for his results in number theory. He studied the Fibonacci sequence and devised the test for Mersenne primes still used today.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* During the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) Lucas served as an artillery officer.
* After the French were defeated, Lucas became professor of mathematics at the Lycée Saint Louis in Paris.
* Lucas is best known for his results in number theory: in particular he studied the Fibonacci sequence and the associated Lucas sequence is named after him.
* Lucas also devised methods of testing primality, essentially those used today.
* The Lucas test for primes was refined by Lehmer in 1930.
* Lucas is also well known for his invention of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle and other mathematical recreations.
* Lucas died as the result of a freak accident at a banquet when a plate was dropped and a piece flew up and cut his cheek.

Born 4 April 1842, Amiens, France. Died 3 October 1891, Paris, France.
