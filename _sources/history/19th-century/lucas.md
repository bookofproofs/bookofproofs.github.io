**Edouard Lucas** was a French mathematician who is best known for his results in number theory. He studied the Fibonacci sequence and devised the test for Mersenne primes still used today.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to introduce and extensively use the notation for the Fibonacci numbers. 
2. He established a number of general theorems regarding Fibonacci numbers and their extensions.
3. He proved the existence of odd perfect numbers.
4. He studied a variety of Diophantine equations and discovered Lucas sequences.
5. He established Lucas' theorem, which gave a necessary and sufficient condition for a number to be prime.
6. He showed that the Fermat conjecture concerning the sum of two powers of the same integer could not, in general, be solved in terms of radicals.
7. He proved the nondivisibility of the nth Fibonacci number by the product of the first n Fibonacci numbers.
8. He proved theorems regarding the recursive nature of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers.
9. He proved that a regular n-gon can be constructed by straightedge and compass if, and only if, the prime factors of n are distinct Fermat primes.
10. He discovered Lucas pseudo-primes, which have been used in cryptography.

Born 4 April 1842, Amiens, France. Died 3 October 1891, Paris, France.
