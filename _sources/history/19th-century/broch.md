**Ole Jacob Broch** was a Norwegian mathematician, physicist and economist who became a government minister.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed and expanded the theory of the Laplace transformation and its applications, using it to solve linear partial differential equations.
2. Established a general theory for separable linear Partial Differential Equations.
3. Developed a new method of solving second-order linear differential equations with constant coefficients.
4. Developed a systematic study of the properties of functions definable by series of polynomials.
5. Advanced the study of linear and non-linear integral equations, including the development of practical applications related to engineering problems.
6. Discovered the analytical solution to the problem of Capillarity.
7. Developed the Broch–Hammer Principle which states the relativistic explication of conservation of energy-momentum.
8. Successfully solved many of the mathematical problems posed by the leading universities of Norway.

Born 4 January 1818, Fredrikstad, Norway. Died 5 February 1889, Sèvres, France.
