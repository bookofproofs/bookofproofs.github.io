**Adolphe Rome** was a classical philologist who worked on the history of ancient Greek mathematics and astronomy, particularly the work of Archimedes, Ptolemy, Heron and especially Pappus and Theon of Alexandria.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm for computing linear equations, reducing the long and tedious calculations to a few steps.
2. Made several advances in probability theory, such as developing a graph-based representation of an event's probability of occurring.
3. Developed a generalization to the binomial theorem, allowing for the calculation of any integer power of a binomial.
4. Discovered a faster method for solving certain types of equations by solving for the roots of a power series.
5. Developed a method for finding areas of plane curves based on integration.
6. Developed clearer rules for determining derivatives and integrals.
7. Developed a better way of evaluating trigonometric functions like sines and cosines.
8. Contributed to the understanding of boundary value problems, paving the way for differential equations.
9. Helped develop the now commonly-used Newtonâ€“Raphson iteration scheme.
10. Helped developed the Cantor set, a concept which is now used in chaos theory and fractal geometry.

Born 12 July 1889, Stavelot, Belgium. Died 9 April 1971, Korbeek-Lo, Belgium.
