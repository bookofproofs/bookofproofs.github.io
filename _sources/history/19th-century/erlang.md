**Agner Erlang**  was a Danish mathematician, statistician and engineer, who invented the fields of traffic engineering and queueing theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the field of queueing theory, which is used for modeling and analyzing the congestion problems that arise in communication networks.
2. Pioneered the concept of telephone traffic engineering, which led to the development of distributed systems for smoothing telephone traffic.
3. Invented the Erlang C formula, a tool for determining the required number of users for a given communication system.
4. Developed the theory of Markov chains, which is used for analyzing random processes.
5. Proposed the Erlang formula, which is used to calculate the probability of a given number of users being able to communicate with a given number of servers.
6. Developed the concept of the teletraffic network, which is used to analyze the performance of telephone networks.
7. Formulated the theory of stochastic processes, which is used to model and analyze processes with random characteristics.

Born 1 January 1878, Lonborg (near Tarm), Jutland, Denmark. Died 3 February 1929, Copenhagen, Denmark.
