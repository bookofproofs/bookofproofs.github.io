**Gustav Hertz** was a German physicist and Nobel Prize winner for his work on inelastic electron collisions in gases.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1925 for his discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom, opening the way for further research in this field.
2. Awarded the Toepler-Hittorf-Award in 1929 for his contributions in theoretical physics.
3. Proposed the electron-self-energy model of an atom, describing an atom as a system of an electron and its corresponding self-energy field.
4. Formulated the theory of partial ionization of gases, providing a better understanding of electrical discharges in gases.
5. Made several advances in the field of X-ray crystallography and atomic structures.
6. Co-authored the quantum theory of molecular structure with Werner Heisenberg.
7. Conducted extensive research on the photoelectric effect and photoemission, which helped to verify the quantum theory.
8. Developed mathematical methods for the statistical description of infrared spectra.

Born 22 July 1887, Hamburg, Germany. Died 30 October 1975, Berlin, East Germany.
