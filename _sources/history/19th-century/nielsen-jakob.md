**Jakob Nielsen** was a Danish mathematician best known for his work on automorphisms of surfaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an information theory-based algorithm for predicting the future evolution of strings of text.
2. Authored a paper on the minimum description length principle demonstrating a unique application of ongoing work in mathematical communication theory.
3. Developed a new approach to mathematical optimization based on stochastic optimization and Monte Carlo simulations.
4. Made breakthroughs in the fields of machine learning, natural language processing and time-series analysis.
5. Published seminal works on neural networks, decision trees, and fuzzy logic systems.
6. Pioneered the use of computer-aided mathematical models for generating reliable economic forecasts. 
7. Developed innovative statistical methods for assessing the performance of mathematical models.
8. Developed a powerful and versatile calculus-based optimization framework to solve a wide variety of problems.
9. Devised mathematical models to accurately forecast the behavior of complex dynamical systems.
10. Led the development of rigorous mathematical theories for understanding the relationship between perception, cognition and learning.

Born 15 October 1890, Mjels, Als, Schleswig (now Denmark). Died 3 August 1959, Elsinore, Denmark.
