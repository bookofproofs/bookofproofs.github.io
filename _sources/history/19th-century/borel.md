**Borel** created the first effective theory of the measure of sets of points beginning of the modern theory of functions of a real variable.  He was also a co-author of the [Heine-Borel Theorem][bookofproofs$6596].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Honoré Borel himself was the son of a craftsman from Montauben, the capital of Tarn-et-Garonne in the Midi-Pyrénées region.
* At the time Émile was born, his parents were living in a fine eighteenth century house in which Honoré Borel had a school for the children of Protestant families in the neighbourhood.
* Honoré and Émilie had two daughters who were much older than Émile, being sixteen and fourteen years old when he was born.
* Honoré Borel was an intelligent man and for the first years of his son's life he educated him at home.
* When Émile was eleven years old he left home in Saint Affrique and went to live with his eldest sister, Madame Lebeau, who was married to a minister from Montauben.
* Family friends urged Borel to enter the École Polytechnique, which was considered the more prestigious establishment, but he had other ideas.
* Borel was advised that a degree from the École Polytechnique would give him the best opportunities for a job in industry or business.
* The two became firm friends and through the Darboux family Borel came to know leading mathematicians of the day, in particular Émile Picard whom he later remarked was a major influence on him at this time.
* the theory of measure, Borel's theory of divergent series, his theory of non-analytic continuation and the theory of quasi-analytic functions all derive from ideas which make their first appearance in this paper.
* Later Borel spoke about the mathematicians who had influenced him most in his early years mentioning, among others, Camille Jordan, Émile Picard, Paul Appell, Édouard Goursat, Paul Painlevé and Marcel Brillouin.
* At almost exactly the same time that he was receiving his doctorate, when still only 22 years of age, Borel was appointed Maître de Conférence at the University of Lille.
* Borel achieved much over the next years, both in his career and in the outstanding mathematics which he produced.
* They had no children but adopted one of Borel's nephews, Fernand Lebeau, the son of his eldest sister whom he had lived with while a pupil at the Lycée at Montauben.
* Marguerite Borel was an outstanding author, writing under the pen name Camille Marbo (Marbo being the first three letters of Marguerite and the first two of Borel), and received the distinction of being awarded the Prix Femina in 1913 for La Statue voilée Ⓣ(The veiled statue).
* In 1909 Borel was appointed to a chair of Theory of Functions created specially for him at the Sorbonne and he went on to hold this professorship until 1941.
* In 1928, with financial support from Rockefeller and Rothschild, he set up the Institut Henri Poincaré (the Centre Émile Borel is now part of the Institute) and he ran the Institute for thirty years.
* Borel created the first effective theory of the measure of sets of points.
* Borel, although not the first to define the sum of a divergent series, was the first to develop a systematic theory for a divergent series which he did in 1899.
* In addition, between 1921 and 1927, Borel published a series of papers on game theory and became the first to define games of strategy.
* After 1924, Borel became active in the French government serving in the French Chamber of Deputies (1924-36) and as Minister of the Navy (1925-40).
* In 1946, when he was 75 years old, Borel published the fascinating book Les paradoxes de l'infini Ⓣ(The paradoxes of infinity).

Born 7 January 1871, Saint Affrique, Aveyron, Midi-Pyrénées, France. Died 3 February 1956, Paris, France.
