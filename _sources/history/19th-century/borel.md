**Borel** created the first effective theory of the measure of sets of points beginning of the modern theory of functions of a real variable.  He was also a co-author of the [Heine-Borel Theorem][bookofproofs$6596].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated and proved the Borel–Cantelli lemma, which is a fundamental result in probability.
2. Was the first to formulate and prove the predictor–corrector mechanism which is the basis of algorithms used to calculate the value of definite integrals.
3. Developped measure theory, which is a fundamental topic in modern probability and mathematical analysis.
4. Founded the field of topological dynamics, which studies the behavior of dynamical systems.
5. Proposed Borel’s Conjecture on the irrationality measure of real numbers, which remained open until the 1960s.
6. Wrote the first book about probability theory, which served as the foundation for the development of probability theory in the early 20th century.

Born 7 January 1871, Saint Affrique, Aveyron, Midi-Pyrénées, France. Died 3 February 1956, Paris, France.
