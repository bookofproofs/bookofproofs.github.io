**Mykhailo Pilipovich Krawtchouk** was a Soviet Ukrainian mathematician who worked on differential and integral equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a unified approach to probability theory that became known as the Krawtchouk polynomials.
2. Founded the idea of mathematical nuclei, also known as Krawtchouk systems.
3. Discovered the "Krawtchouk formula", which is used to express the sum of Krawtchouk polynomials of different orders.
4. Proposed an algorithm to calculate the number of set partitions.
5. Solved the problem of the determination of moments of an arbitrary distribution using Krawtchouk polynomials.
6. Formulated the Generalized Krawtchouk System Law.
7. Constructed what is now known as the Krawtchouk matrix.
8. Proposed a two-dimensional generalization of binomial coefficients.
9. Established a novel technique for constructing symmetric functions of two practical variables.

Born 27 September 1892, Chovnitsy, (now Kivertsi) Ukraine. Died 9 March 1942, Kolyma, Siberia, USSR.
