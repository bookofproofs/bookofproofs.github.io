**Eduard Čech** was a Czech mathematician known for his work in projective differential geometry and topology. He introduced the idea of the higher homotopy groups of a space.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed significantly in the field of Algebraic Topology, particularly by introducing the Čech homology, cohomology and the simplicial resolution.
2. Catalyzed the development of homology using algebraic means.
3. Brought a new approach to the fundamental problem of dimensionality in intuitive topology, introducing his concept of "upper" and "lower" homology.
4. Developed the notion of reduced cohomology, i.e., distinctiveness of the structure of a given space.
5. Formulated the Excess Theorem, the characterization of topological homeomorphisms.
6. Co-created the modern notation for homology groups involving differential (exact) sequences and their extension.
7. Proposed the concept of geometrical fineness as a means of measuring the richness of a topological space.
8. Demonstrated the unreducibility of the homological order of a regular space in connection with projective dimension.

Born 29 June 1893, Stracov, Bohemia (now Czech Republic). Died 15 March 1960, Prague, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic).
