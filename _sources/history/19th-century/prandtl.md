**Ludwig Prandtl** was a German engineer who worked on aerodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered modern boundary layer theory, which is the basis for aircraft and automobile aerodynamics.
2. Established the theory of fluid flow called Prandtl–Glauert transformation. 
3. Developed a two-dimensional incompressible flow model, now known as the Prandtl–Glauert equation. 
4. Discovered the Prandtl–Meyer expansion fan which concerns the mechanics of compressible fluids. 
5. Developed the concept of a boundary layer and laid the mathematical framework for its analysis. 
6. Formulated the equations of motion for incompressible flows which are now known as Prandtl's equations. 
7. Investigated the separation of a flow over a surface, leading to the formation of von Kármán vortex streets. 
8. Established the basic principles of pipe friction and developed formulas to calculate it. 
9. Created the mathematical theory of pulsating flows, now known as Prandtl's theories of pulsating fluid flow. 
10. Developed the Prandtl-Helmholtz instability theory to explain why clouds break up and form rain.

Born 4 February 1875, Freising, near Munich, Germany. Died 15 August 1953, Göttingen, Germany.
