**Edmond Bour** was a French mathematician and engineer who made  significant contributions to analysis, algebra, geometry and applied mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed to the development of the logarithm, which was a significant new mathematical tool used to simplify calculations.
2. Developed a series of interlocking gears to facilitate the computation of logarithmic and trigonometric tables.
3. Discovered the theorem on the summation of series, now known as Bour's theorem.
4. Published a book on the use of logarithms and trigonometry for calculation in 1621.
5. Investigated the area of the circle and triangle.
6. Applied Euclidean geometry to mechanical problems.
7. Proposed the idea of a mobile 'armillary sphere' to track astronomical movements. 
8. Established a workable link between astronomy, mathematics and mechanics. 
9. Created a device known as a 'logarithmic spiral compass' for use in surveying. 
10. Developed a force meter for measuring the force of jet propulsion.

Born 19 May 1832, Gray, Haute-Sa√¥ne, France. Died 9 March 1866, Paris, France.
