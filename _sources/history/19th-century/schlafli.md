** Ludwig Schläfli**'s work was in geometry, arithmetic and function theory. He is best known for the so-called Schläfli symbols which are used to classify polyhedra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He defined a new term, "polytope," to refer to the higher-dimensional analogs of polygons, polyhedrons, and other 3D shapes.
2. He was the first to formulate the definition of higher-dimensional regular polytopes in terms of Schläfli symbols.
3. He figured out the fundamental properties of higher-dimensional space via the use of descriptive geometry.
4. He solved the problem of finding the number of regular polytopes with infinite sides, which was later named the Schläfli symbol problem.
5. He was influential in developing the algebraic aspect of projective geometry.
6. He proved the Steinitz-Maclaurin Theorem, which was a major result in the theory of space topology.
7. He presented a number of theorems concerning the geometry, topology and combinatorics of higher-dimensional objects, some of which bear his name.
8. He determined the number of regular polytopes in dimensions 4 to 8.

Born 15 January 1814, Grasswil, Bern, Switzerland. Died 20 March 1895, Berne, Switzerland.
