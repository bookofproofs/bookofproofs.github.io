**Pavel Aleksandrov** was a Russian mathematician who made important contributions to general topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the classic solution to the Plateau problem of finding the minimal surface of a given boundary.
2. Showed how to reconcile the continuity and discontinuity of functions in his proof of the existence of integrals and defined the concept of measure theory for the first time.
3. Co-discovered the Aleksandrov–Bakelman–Pucci inequality in elliptic differential equations.
4. Proved theorems about connectedness and the existence of certain boundaries in metric spaces.
5. Discovered Aleksandrov spaces, which bear his name due to their fundamental role in the theory of topological manifolds and integral geometry.
6. Subsequently showed how to construct smooth integrals on suchobjects.
7. Formulated a generalization of Euclidean geometry, the Lobachevsky–Bolyai–Gauss geometry, which provided an entirely new approach to analyzing the shapes of physical surfaces and other objects.

Born 7 May1896, Bogorodsk (also called Noginsk), Russia. Died 16 November 1982, Moscow, USSR.
