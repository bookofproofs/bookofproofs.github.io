Hilbert's work in geometry had the greatest influence in that area after Euclid. A systematic study of the axioms of Euclidean geometry led Hilbert to propose 21 such axioms and he analysed their significance. He made contributions in many areas of mathematics and physics.

Born 23 January 1862 Wehlau, near Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 14 February 1943 Göttingen, Germany.
