**Hilbert**'s work in geometry had the greatest influence in that area after Euclid. A systematic study of the axioms of Euclidean geometry led Hilbert to propose 21 such axioms and he analysed their significance. He made contributions in many areas of mathematics and physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated a complete set of axioms for geometry, now known as Hilbert’s axioms. 
2. Developed a general theory of integral equations and calculus of variations. 
3. Came up with a theory of infinite dimensional spaces. 
4. Applied mathematical rigour to the field of physics.
5. Developed the 23 unsolved mathematical problems, which is seen as an attempt to set the guidelines for future research in mathematics. 
6. Put forward a breakthrough approach to establish the consistency and completeness of mathematics, now known as the Hilbert Program. 
7. Developed the notions of a ‘Grundlagen der Geometrie’, a foundation of geometry, that was widely accepted and used by many subsequent mathematicians. 
8. Established a completely new physical theory in order to predict solutions of partial differential equations.

Born 23 January 1862, Wehlau, near Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 14 February 1943, Göttingen, Germany.
