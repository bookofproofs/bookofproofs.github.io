**Ludwig Wittgenstein** was a philosopher who worked on the foundations of mathematics and on mathematical logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Revolutionized the Gottingen School of Mathematics with his publication of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus in 1921.
2. Built on the theories of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell to develop a new logical system of philosophy. 
3. Developed a theory of language around the notion of logical meaning, known as the picture theory of meaning.
4. Created the theory of languag games, which describes how language is used in different ways in different contexts.
5. Deepened understanding of the mathematical foundations of philosophy, concentrating on issues such as logical necessity and the limits of philosophical analysis.
6. Developed the concept of ‘family resemblances’ to explore the complexity of language use. 
7. Used mathematical analysis to explore the distinction between what is said and what is shown in language.
8. Developed the concept of logical typing, showing how the use of specific types of expressions can lead to false conclusions. 
9. Formulated the concept of ‘language games’ in response to questions about the truth in logic. 
10. Developed a system of connective logic andmathematical logic to study the properties of language.

Born 26 April 1889, Vienna, Austria. Died 29 April 1951, Cambridge, England.
