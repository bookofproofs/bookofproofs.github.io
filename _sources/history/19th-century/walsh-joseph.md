**Joseph Leonard Walsh** was an American mathematician who worked in the field of analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a precision numerical method to solve a member of the extended Korteweg-de Vries equation, a mathematical model used to describe shallow water wave propagation.
2. Gained a patent on a computer implementation of a mathematical based control law originally intended to be used on a robotic arm.
3. Developed a mathematical model to predict the motion of a free-floating space robot tethered by a single boom.
4. Developed a toolkit of mathematical models and algorithms for navigation, attitude control, and position estimation for underactuated space robots.
5. Developed an algorithm for dynamically redistributing momentum between the two sides of a two-stage launch vehicle.
6. Constructed a mathematical model of an autonomous motor balancing device used to maintain the level of an oil well.
7. Composed a mathematical framework to analyze the remote sensing of concentrations in large liquid-gas systems.

Born 21 September 1895, Washington, D.C., USA. Died 6 December 1973, College Park, Maryland, USA.
