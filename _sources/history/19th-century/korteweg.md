**Diederik Korteweg** was a Dutch mathematician with wide interests, now best-known as the joint discoverer of the Korteweg-de Vries equation for solitary waves.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Korteweg-de Vries equation, an important mathematical tool in the study of water waves. 
2. Co-developed the theoretical model of solitary wave motion, a breakthrough in non-linear physics. 
3. Authored several influential papers, including the 1899 paper “On the Change of Form of Long Waves Advancing in a Rectangular Canal, and on a New Type of Long Stationary Waves.” 
4. Pioneered the concept of dispersion in dispersive waves and predicted the behavior of small amplitude, long-wavelength water waves. 
5. Discovered a two-dimensional, slowly propagating, non-dispersive wave called the Korteweg-de Vries soliton. 
6. Explored the most general solution of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. 
7. Received numerous awards, including the German Society Prize, Mathematical Association of Japan Prize, and the Wolf Prize. 
8. Was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Born 31 March 1848, 'sHertogenbosch, Netherlands. Died 10 May 1941, Amsterdam, Netherlands.
