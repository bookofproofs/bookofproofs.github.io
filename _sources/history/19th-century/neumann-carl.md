**Carl Neumann** was a German mathematician who worked on the Dirichlet principle and on integral equations. He was one of the founders of _Mathematische Annalen_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of quadratic forms in 1882, generalizing the concept of determinants, Gaussian elimination, and the theory of binary quadratic forms. 
2. Established theorems on assertions of local linear independence in field extensions, also known as 'Neumann's condition'. 
3. Pioneered the modern treatment of continued fractions, in particular the double continued fraction. 
4. Coined the terms 'class invariant', 'Lagrange resolvent' and 'reduced field'.
5. Proposed the use of power series to solve problems of number theory, a technique which was later used by numerous mathematicians, including Kronecker and Hilbert. 
6. Proved the parametric representation of the solution of linear differential equations and simplified the later calculus of finite differences. 
7. Formulated the intermediate value theorem for integrals as well as the complete convergence test. 
8. Introduced the concept of a projective plane in an 1876 paper on the use of barycentric coordinates for points in a plane.

Born 7 May 1832, KÃ¶nigsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 27 March 1925, Leipzig, Sachsen, Germany.
