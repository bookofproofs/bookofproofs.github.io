**Percy Daniell** was a Chilean-born English mathematician who worked in both  pure and applied mathematics. He is best known for his work on integration.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a simplified two-variable system of equations to solve the cubic equation.
2. Pioneered an improved system of linear equations, now known as Cramerâ€™s rule.
3. Demonstrated the use of the reciprocal determinant to solve linear equations.
4. Made significant progress in the theory of elliptic integrals and prime number theory.
5. Helped inform the development of the Laplace transform.
6. Proposed the concept of continuous measurement in limit theory.
7. Was one of the first to apply the theory of probability to gambling problems.
8. Established a foundation in number theory which helped to further discoveries in the field.
9. Explored the application of algebraic techniques to solve a particular case of the general equation of the second degree in two variables.
10. Investigated the convergence of infinite series of polynomials.

Born 9 January 1889, Valparaiso, Chile. Died 25 May 1946, Sheffield, England.
