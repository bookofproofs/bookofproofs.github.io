**Alfred Tauber** was a Slovakian-born mathematician, known for his contribution to mathematical analysis and to the theory of functions of a complex variable.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Tauberian theorem, which states that the properties of the Laplace transform remain essentially unchanged under certain mathematical operations. 
2. Authored the influential book “A Mathematical Introduction to Fluid Mechanics”, published in 1972.
3. Developed a generalization of the theorems of Jacobi and Riemann-Hilbert, which laid the basis for a new theory of Laplace transforms.
4. Contributed to the development of the Bessel functions and generalized space-translation invariance. 
5. Coined the term “Laplace integral transform” which is frequently used in mathematical analysis and theory. 
6. Found extensive applications of Tauberian theorems in the theory of partial differential equations, functional analysis and almost periodic functions. 
7. Provided fundamental theorems in real analysis, including the intermediate value theorem and the mean value theorem. 
8. Established results related to integral equations, orthogonal polynomials, and finite Fourier transforms.

Born 5 November 1866, Pressburg (now Bratislava), Slovakia. Died 26 July 1942, Theresienstadt, Germany (now Terezin, Czech Republic).
