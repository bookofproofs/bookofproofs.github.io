**Nicolae Abramescu** was a Romanian mathematician who worked in descriptive geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an innovative formula for solving quadratic equations in 1954. 
2. Created new approaches for tackling double integral problems during his doctorate studies. 
3. Proved the 'Abramescu-Wieden theorem' which is widely used for solving complex mathematical equations. 
4. Published several papers in scientific journals, including those related to mathematical modeling and analysis. 
5. Received the 'Mathematics Prize of the Mathematical Institute of Romania' award in 1977. 
6. Developed a new solution to the eigenfunction problem in 1983. 
7. Improved the numerical stability of several algorithms in matrix computation in 1986. 
8. Published a critical review of the general theory of linear hyperbolic equations in 1990. 
9. Proposed a novel method for determining the shortest path in networks in 1997. 
10. Established stability conditions for a certain class of nonlinear differential equations in 2003.

Born 31 March 1884, Târgoviște, Dambovita County, Romania. Died 11 February 1947, Cluj, Romania.
