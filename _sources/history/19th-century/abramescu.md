**Nicolae Abramescu** was a Romanian mathematician who worked in descriptive geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Nicolae attended primary and secondary school in his home town of Târgoviște before going to the high school in Ploiești.
* Already Abramescu had become fascinated by mathematics and, while a high school student, he had avidly read the Gazeta Matematica (The Mathematical Gazette) and began to make contributions to this publication.
* After graduating from the Ploiești High School, Abramescu entered the Mathematics programme in the Faculty of Science of the University of Bucharest.
* Abramescu graduated from the University of Bucharest in 1904 and, later that year, he was appointed as a substitute teacher in the secondary school in Ploiești.
* One of the students he taught while at this school was Aurel Angelescu who was in the eighth grade when Abramescu gave the course that became his book.
* Abramescu went from Ploiești to Botoșani where again he was a substitute teacher.
* In November 1919 Abramescu was appointed as an Associate Professor at the University of Cluj, following the recommendation of Gheorghe Țițeica.
* On 1 October 1926, Abramescu was appointed full professor of Descriptive and Infinitesimal Geometry at the University of Cluj, a position that he kept until the end of his career.
* Abramescu was one of 26 professors who signed a petition protesting against this break-up of the University of Cluj.
* Abramescu did much work in restoring the mathematics library and teaching equipment.
* At the University of Cluj, Abramescu taught many different courses throughout his career.
* We mentioned above some of the high school level texts that Abramescu wrote.
* Nicholas Abramescu is an example of someone with titanic and rare will power who deserves to be known, so that his example can be followed.
* In the second edition, published in 1937, Abramescu says that the work he has put into writing the book would be well rewarded if it helps students, fills them with enthusiasm and hope for the future.
* Nicolae Abramescu put a lot of effort in organising the Cluj Scientific Society, and the First Congress of Romanian Mathematicians which was held in Cluj from 9 - 12 May 1929.
* Among the honours given to Abramescu we mention his election to the Romanian Academy of Sciences on 5 June 1943.
* Abramescu died in February 1947 at Cluj.

Born 31 March 1884, Târgoviște, Dambovita County, Romania. Died 11 February 1947, Cluj, Romania.
