**Eugène Rouché** was a French geometer best known for his theorem on complex functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He formulated the general theory of branched coverings in topology, now known as Rouché’s Theorem.
2. He discovered a method for computing the nature of the singular points of a given simple system of two algebraic equations.
3. He provided a general framework for the construction of a functional whose zero’s determines the positive solutions to quadratic equations.
4. He introduced the Rouché–Faber theorem, which provides a way to determine the number of zeros of a function inside a given region.
5. He provided a definition of the topological element and vector spaces, an important tool in applied mathematics.
6. He developed a theory of absolute continuity, which was a major contribution to the foundations of many parts of mathematics, including mathematical analysis.

Born 18 August 1832, Sommières, Occitanie, Languedoc, France. Died 19 August 1910, Lunel, Hérault, Languedoc, France.
