**Karl August Reinhardt** was a German mathematician who worked on various tiling problems He gave a partial solution to Hilbert's eighteenth problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Reinhardt–Wielandt Theorem which unifies the spectral theory of normal matrices.
2. Explored the theory of sums of Hermitian operators and applied that to the theory of matrices.
3. Proved the subadditivity principle in operator theory.
4. Identified a sufficient condition for a linear operator to be of trace-class.
5. Established the general theory of Banach algebras.
6. Found a formula which allows the calculation of the Derivative of the Trace of a Matrix with respect to the Matrix itself.
7. Developed a theory of Markov operators, based on the study of matrices.
8. Discovered and proved a relation between non-diagonalizable matrices, which can be stated as “the sum of two non-diagonalizable matrices is non-diagonalizable".
9. Searched the structure of all normal operators, a critical result necessary for understanding matrix theory.
10. Contributed to the theory of projective modules and their modules of differentials.

Born 27 January 1895, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Died 27 April 1941, Berlin, Germany.
