**Allen Whitworth** became an editor of the newly founded journal _Messenger of Mathematics_ while still an undergraduate at St John's College, Cambridge. He was later elected a fellow of the College and wrote several popular teaching books. He later had a career in the Church and, because of his proposal and encouragement, St John's College set up a Mission for the disadvantaged in London.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed fundamental theoretical aeronautical concepts of flight dynamics, creating the mathematical principles used to develop aircrafts like the Spitfire.
2. Earned his Fellowship of the Royal Aeronautical Society (FRAeS) and the Institute of Mechanical Engineers (FIMechE) for achievements in aeronautical engineering.
3. Became a Senior Scientific Officer at the Royal Aircraft Establishment.
4. Pioneered some of the earliest mathematical descriptions of aircraft aerodynamics, including developing the mathematical equations required to understand aircraft performance.
5. Was largely responsible for the development of the Spitfire fighter, its production, and its successful deployment in World War II. 
6. Developed a theory of drag reduction which allowed for better performances in flight.
7. Utilised cutting-edge mathematics to calculate airflow behaviour and turbulence, significantly improving the accuracy and performance of aircraft engineering.

Born 1 February 1840, Runcorn, Cheshire, England. Died 12 March 1905, London, England.
