**Boris Grigorievich Galerkin** was a  Soviet mathematician and engineer best known for his method of approximate integration.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Galerkin Method for solving Ordinary Differential Equations, which has become a basic approach for the numerical analysis and modeling of many practical problems.
2. Formulated and developed the Key Variational Principle, a formulation and generalisation of the classical Hamilton's Principle of Mechanics.
3. Pioneered the Finite Element Method (FEM), a numerical approximation technique used to solve partial differential equations, which revolutionized computational mechanics.
4. Formulated the variational form of the equations of linear elasticity and derived the corresponding coupled equations for strain and displacement fields.
5. Developed the Enriched Finite Element Method for the analysis of solids and fluids.
6. Demonstrated the existence of three-dimensional structures, now referred to as Galerkin triangles, which are often used to construct models for solving elasticity problems.
7. Conceptualised the concept of Generalised Integral Transforms, a multi-dimensional version of Fourier Transforms.
8. Pioneered the use of the Rayleigh-Ritz Method for solving boundary-value problems.
9. Coined the term ‘Kinematical Approximation’ and developed methods to estimate kinematic fields in dynamical systems.

Born 4 March 1871, Polotsk, Belarus. Died 12 June 1945, Moscow, USSR.
