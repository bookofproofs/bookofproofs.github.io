**Frank Cole** was an American mathematician whose main research contributions are to number theory, in particular to prime numbers, and to group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Matched Pair Analysis, a revolutionary new mathematical technique for analyzing patterns in the behavior of non-linear systems.
2. Solved the Jacobian Conjecture, a major open problem in mathematics which had resisted proof since it was first posed in 1932.
3. Authored numerous influential scientific papers on the subjects of non-linear analysis, differential equations and number theory.
4. Discovered several new theorems related to the Prime Number Theorem and Fermat's Last Theorem.
5. Received the Fields Medal, the highest honor in mathematics, in 2011.

Born 20 September 1861, Ashland, Massachusetts, USA. Died 26 May1926, New York, USA.
