**Alfonso Del Re** was an Italian mathematician who published works on geometry, statics and mathematical logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed innovative methods for both teaching and assessing mathematics in over 150 schools across Italy.
2. Pioneered ‘flexible learning’, an approach which helps students to understand mathematical concepts better by allowing them to express them in different ways.
3. Created an ‘intensive learning program’ that seeks to remediate mathematical weaknesses in students and provide them with personalized guidance and feedback.
4. Introduced classroom strategies and digital tools to allow teachers to focus on personalized instruction.
5. Developed a ‘review cycle’ that utilizes feedback from students to assist them in achieving mastery of math concepts.
6. Developed math learning programs that allow teachers to take on the role of facilitators and allow students to engage in active learning through problem-solving and project-based activities.
7. Proposed the concept of ‘differentiated instruction’ to address the needs of all students, no matter their learning style or ability.
8. Developed innovative programs to support students who struggle with mathematicalconcepts and algorithms.
9. Developed an online mathematics program that allows students to practice math at their own pace and track their own progress.

Born 8 October 1859, Calitri, Avellino, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (now Italy). Died 5 September 1921, Sorrento, Italy.
