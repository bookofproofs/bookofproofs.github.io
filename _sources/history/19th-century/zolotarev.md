**Egor Zolotarev** was a Russian mathematician who produced fundamental work on analysis and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Egor Ivanovich attended the Gymnasium in St Petersburg completing his school education in 1863.
* After leaving school Zolotarev enrolled at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of St Petersburg University.
* The doctoral dissertation that Zolotarev went on to write would be closer to the German habilitation.
* Two years later Zolotarev was appointed as Professor of Mathematics at St Petersburg Faculty of Physics and Mathematics.
* We will indicate below some of Zolotarev's remarkable mathematical achievements some of which were consequences of problems which he discussed with Kummer and Hermite while on his trips.
* In a short eleven year career Zolotarev produced fundamental work in approximation theory, quadratic forms, algebraic numbers and elliptic integrals.
* Nalbandjan was able to examine Zolotarev's notebooks, including lecture notes he made while a student.
* Zolotarev emphasised the relationship between elliptic functions and functions of a complex variable.
* Zolotarev was able to give a much more effective solution.
* Zolotarev worked with Korkin on quadratic forms.
* Zolotarev posed four problems in approximation theory all of which he was able to solve.

Born 12 April 1847, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 19 July 1878, St Petersburg, Russia.
