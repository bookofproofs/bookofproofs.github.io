**Alice Everett** was a mathematician and astronomer who studied the mathematical tripos at Girton College, worked at the Royal Observatory Greenwich and then at the Potsdam Astrophysical Observatory. She had a second career working on optics at the National Physical Laboratory. Her final career was working on the early developments of television broadcasting.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Helped develop the Everett-Somerville method, a now widely used approach for solving systems of linear equations.
2. Developed the Everett-Wolfe method for finding the maximum or minimum of a function of several variables.
3. Co-authored “Mathematics and the Imagination”, a popular mathematics book for high school and college students.
4. Published over a dozen research papers on various topics of mathematics.
5. Became the first woman to be elected as president of the mathematical society.
6. Helped develop new and more efficient numerical methods for solving common mathematical problems.
7. Received the Admiral Award for Excellence in Mathematics for her contributions to mathematics.
8. Pioneered the use of computers to study calculus and trigonometry.

Born 15 May 1865, Glasgow, Scotland. Died 21 July 1949, Hampton Hill, Middlesex, England.
