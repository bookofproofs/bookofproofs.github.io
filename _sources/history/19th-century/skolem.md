**Thoralf Skolem** was a Norwegian mathematician who worked in mathematical logic and set theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founder of modern model theory, a branch of mathematical logic used to study the properties of structures.
2. Developed the concept of relative definability and the Skolem paradox relating set theory to model theory.
3. Proved that in any finitely axiomatizable theory, the models of the theory are elementarily equivalent.
4. Constructed the first recursive functions which are not primitive recursive.
5. Formulated the 'downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem', which states that for any set of axioms, if the axioms are consistent, then they have a countable model.
6. Was a pioneer in the development of higher set theory and non-standard analysis.
7. Developed a simplified proof of Viète's Formula.
8. Also made contributions in number theory, combinatorics and graph theory.

Born 23 May 1887, Sandsvaer, Buskerud, Norway. Died 23 March 1963, Oslo, Norway.
