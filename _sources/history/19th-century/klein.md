**Felix Klein** was a German mathematician whose synthesis of geometry as the study of the properties of a space that are invariant under a given group of transformations, known as the _Erlanger Programm_, profoundly influenced mathematical development.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Klein developed the Concept of Group Theory and its Application to Geometry.
2. He proposed the Erlangen Program, which unified several branches of geometry under the concept of transformation groups.
3. He introduced the unifying idea of an automorphism group, which was particularly useful in the field of Non-Euclidean Geometry.
4. He studied the invariant theory and iterative equations, contributing majorly to the theories surrounding them.
5. He developed and popularized an exact sequence named the "Klein Fours" which were important in topology and knot theory.
6. Klein also made considerable contributions to Point and Space sets, helping to define the geometry of each.
7. He proved the Heine-Borel theorem, a fundamental property of closed intervals in real numbers.

Born 25 April 1849, Düsseldorf, Prussia (now Germany). Died 22 June 1925, Göttingen, Germany.
