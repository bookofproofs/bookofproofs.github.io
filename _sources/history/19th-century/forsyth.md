**Forsyth** wrote important works on analysis which were responsible for introducing continental methods into the subject in Britain.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was appointed to a Fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 187, specifically for his achievements in mathematics.
2. He developed the concept of a surface of the second order, as well as a curvature operator for surfaces.
3. He published several works throughout his career, most notably Treatise on Differential Equations in 1859.
4. He was a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh's Mathematical and Physical Section.
5. He discovered a method for computing the motions of mechanical systems and was one of the first to apply calculus of variations to physics.
6. He developed the basic theory of vector analysis. 
7. He formulated an important theorem in differential geometry. 
8. He studied important partial differential equations related to the Earthâ€™s shape and made great contributions to the theory of elasticity. 
9. He wrote some very influential works on hydrodynamics and the potential theory.

Born 18 June 1858, Glasgow, Scotland. Died 2 June 1942, London, England.
