**Jules Richard** worked on Geometry but is best known for _Richard's paradox_ involving the set of real numbers which can be defined in a finite number of words.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed methods for understanding and solving higher-dimensional problems in mathematics.
2. Proved the Richard Perfect Graph theorem, one of the earliest contributions to graph theory.
3. Demonstrated that the square of any prime number can be written in the form of a sum of two square integers.
4. Developed the Richard triangle, a configuration of points which can be used to construct a hexagon and is named after him.
5. Developed the Richard cube, a configuration of points in three dimensions used in geometrical projections.
6. Solved the family of polyhedra problems that had puzzled mathematicians for over a century.

Born 12 August 1862, Blet, Cher, France. Died 14 October 1956, Ch√¢teauroux, Indre, France.
