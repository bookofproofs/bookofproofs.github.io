**Mikhail Vashchenko-Zakharchenko** worked on the theory of linear differential equations, the theory of probability and non-euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Following his studies in Kiev, Vashchenko-Zakharchenko went to France where he studied mathematics at the Sorbonne and then he spent the academic year 1847-48 studying at the Coll√®ge de France.
* After returning from France, Vashchenko-Zakharchenko continued his studies at Kazan University in the Russian city of Kazan about 600 km east of Moscow.
* Vashchenko-Zakharchenko entered the university soon after these major improvements had taken place and obtained his candidate's degree in 1854.
* After receiving his Master's Degree, Vashchenko-Zakharchenko was appointed to the University of Kiev as a Privatdozent in 1863.
* Vashchenko-Zakharchenko made contributions to several areas of mathematics.
* With wide ranging interests, it was natural for Vashchenko-Zakharchenko to write on a variety of topics and, indeed, his twelve textbooks cover many different topics.
* We also mention Vashchenko-Zakharchenko's Analytic geometry which he published in 1887.
* That a man so well acquainted with modern investigations of the principles of the science of space as Mr Vashchenko-Zakharchenko (a bibliography of this subject is also appended to the volume) should prove such an ardent adherent of Euclid, pure and simple, for the schools, is a truly remarkable fact.
* The article by Ziwet makes some interesting deductions from the data given in Vashchenko-Zakharchenko's Euclid where he lists 455 published editions of Euclid's Elements.
* What Vashchenko-Zakharchenko's list of editions shows is that by the middle of the 19th  century Euclid's Elements was used as a textbook in Britain but in no other country in the world.
* For example, the last edition of Euclid's Elements listed by Vashchenko-Zakharchenko as published in France appeared in 1778.
* Vashchenko-Zakharchenko also wrote an important work on the history of mathematics in 1883 in which he discussed the history of mathematics up to the 15th  century.
* Despite the fact that Vashchenko-Zakharchenko's translation of Euclid was free and sometimes inaccurate, and that his 'History of Mathematics: Historical treatise on the development of geometry, Volume 1' was little more than a compilation of the works of Western European authors, especially Moritz Cantor, both work were of considerable importance.
* Vashchenko-Zakharchenko wrote on other historical topics too; for example he wrote a history of the development of analytic geometry.

Born 12 November 1825, Maliivka, Zolotonosha, Poltava, Ukraine. Died 27 August 1912, Kiev, Russian Empire (now Kyiv, Ukraine).
