**Albert Wangerin** was a German mathematician who worked on potential theory, spherical functions and differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Bayesian theorem, which revolutionized probability theory and provided a foundation for future mathematical analysis.
2. Established the concept of conditional probability, enabling mathematicians to make more accurate predictions.
3. Developed game theory, which has since been widely utilized in economics, finance, and fields related to decision making.
4. Published the first book on probability theory, which significantly advanced the field of mathematics.
5. Wrote several papers on the mathematical properties of the exponential growth in both continuous and discrete time.
6. Investigated the relationship between normal and binomial distributions, extending their use in a wide range of fields.
7.Studied the mathematical properties of the Gaussian distribution, which became widely used to describe the probability of outcomes in many natural phenomena.
8. Developed the first mathematical model of Brownian motion, helping to further the field of finance and economic risk analysis.

Born 18 November 1844, Greiffenberg, Prussia, Germany. Died 25 October 1933, Halle, Germany.
