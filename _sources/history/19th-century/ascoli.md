**Guido Ascoli** was an Italian mathematician who worked in the theory of partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father was Giulio Ascoli and his mother was Rosa Costa.
* Ascoli's thesis, Sulla moltiplicazione delle singolarità delle funzioni analitiche Ⓣ(On the propagation of singularities of analytic functions), studied singularities of analytic functions and he was awarded his laurea on 5 July 1907.
* Because it was necessary for him to earn money to support his family he began working in industry, working on electrical conductors, but his health was poor, so Ascoli was forced to give this up and to consider a career as a secondary school teacher.
* In November 1909 Ascoli was appointed as a temporary mathematics teacher at the Technical Institute in Spoleto.
* Ascoli had not had to undergo military service after completing his degree since his health was not good enough.
* After demobilization, Ascoli returned to teaching in 1919.
* Ascoli was appointed to the Liceo Scientifico in Turin after it was set up in March 1924 by joining the Liceo Moderno with the mathematics and physics sections of the Technical Institute in which he was working.
* Ascoli does not limit himself to dryly following the guidelines for university courses, but attempts to "discern in the admirable edifice of concepts and results that small bit that is essential in the very first study from what would otherwise be destined to remain a lifeless and inexpressive knowledge; to present to young people a simple and harmonic organism of fundamental ideas that contribute effectively towards their intellectual formation" (Preface).
* Ascoli married Mauriziana Sossi on 12 September 1925; they had two children.
* Renato Ascoli was born in Turin on 6 June 1927 and went on to be a physicist working at the University of Pisa.
* Their daughter, Gigliola Ascoli born on 15 April 1932 in Turin, went on to study literature and was awarded a laurea in that subject.
* The lively mathematical environment in Turin provided a powerful incentive to Ascoli to resume research in analysis and also, around 1925, his health markedly improved.
* Article 4 of the Royal Decree Law of 5 September 1938 was titled 'Measures for the defence of race in fascist schools' and, after Ascoli had been identified as Jewish by the University of Milan, he was expelled from the University.
* After leaving the University, Ascoli retired with his family to live first in Turin and, after 8 September 1943 when the Italian armistice with the Allies was made public, in the commune of Dusino San Michele in the Province of Asti in Piedmont.
* Picone tried to help Ascoli, encouraging him not to give up research.
* Picone was the director of the Institute for the Applications of Computation in Rome and he was able to arrange to give Ascoli some paid work.
* Back at the University of Milan in 1945, Ascoli remained there until 1948.
* These activities of Ascoli came together in the book 'Lezioni di Matematiche complementari' Ⓣ(Lessons on compementary mathematics) (1952, second edition 1954) and in the volumes on the topics assigned in the course on mathematical culture for new graduates, 'Svolgimento dei temi assegnati nel corso di cultura matematica dell'Università di Torino' Ⓣ(Proceedings of the themes assigned in the course of mathematical culture of the University of Turin) (1953, 1955, 1957).
* Ascoli received many honours for his contributions.
* This Commission began to function on 17 April 1955 when the first official meeting was held in Bologna with Ascoli as president and he continued to serve as president until the meeting in Turin on 24 April 1957.

Born 12 December 1887, Livorno, Italy. Died 10 May 1957, Turin, Italy.
