**Guido Ascoli** was an Italian mathematician who worked in the theory of partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Guido Ascoli developed an axiomatic approach to Euclidean geometry which became an influential foundational approach within the field. 
2. He introduced the concept of an endomorphism and a retraction, which is now an important part of algebraic topology.
3. He solved Hilbert's fifth problem regarding the connection between topology and algebra. 
4. Ascoli also made advances in the knowledge of algebraic surfaces, including the fact that they could be described using polynomials.
5. He studied the theory of hyperalgebras and developed methods to establish their relationships with algebraic geometry. 
6. His work in differential geometry led to the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem.
7. He is best known for the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem which states that a sequence of continuous functions is relatively compact if and only if it is equicontinuous and pointwise bounded.

Born 12 December 1887, Livorno, Italy. Died 10 May 1957, Turin, Italy.
