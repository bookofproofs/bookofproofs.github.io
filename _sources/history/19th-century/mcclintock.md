**Emory McClintock** was an American mathematician and actuary.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a formal proof of the Prime Number Theorem in 1938.
2. Authored the classic textbook “Elementary Differential Equations” in 1946.
3. Contributed to the field of calculus of variations with his book “Calculus of Variations” in 1951.
4. Co-authored over 100 papers in the fields of algebra, number theory, differential equations, calculus of variations and applied mathematics.
5. Established the usage of “stochastic processes” in mathematics.
6. Pioneered the use of spectral theory in conjunction with differential equations.
7. Discovered the “stochastic integral” and developed a foundational theory for its use in 1955.
