* In fact McClintock was for many years the leading actuary in America.
* In 1889 when McClintock took up his actuarial post with the Mutual Life Insurance Company in New York, the New York Mathematical Society was just coming into existence.
* McClintock joined the Society in December 1889 and was elected vice-president of the Society.

* Study also addressed the Society during McClintock's term as president and talked on his work with Engel.
* Before ending this biography we should mention McClintock's hobbies of genealogy and military history.
* A series of notebooks reflecting specific research into the Baskerville, Kemble, McClintock, and Wakeman families record the lines of descent through each ancestral surname.
