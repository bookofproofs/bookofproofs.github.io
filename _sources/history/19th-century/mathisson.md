**Myron Mathisson** was a Polish theoretical physicist who is known for his work in general relativity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, an extension of the Einstein equations of gravitation in 1915.
2. Made ground-breaking advances in the study of gravitational and wave-like behavior of material fields in the 1930s.
3. Published an innovative article in the journal Nature in 1939 on rotating cylinders made of viscous and resistive media, which became known as the Mathisson–Pugsley effect. 
4. Contributed to the study of the magnetic suspension of particles along closed paths.
5. Proposed a different form of the equations of motion for relativistic particles in 1937, with intrinsic angular momentum known as the Mathisson–Pirani–Bargmann–Wigner (MPBW) equations.
6. Developed a testable prediction of the existence of gravitons in the early 1950s.

Born 15 December 1897, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 13 September 1940, Cambridge, England.
