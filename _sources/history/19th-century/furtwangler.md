**Philipp Furtwängler** was a German mathematician best known for his number theory and in particular for his proof of the principal ideal theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the concept of polynomial rings, allowing algebraic operations to be applied to expressions of complex variables.
2. Established an algebra of finite fields, which allowed the investigation of algebraic extensions of these fields.
3. Constructed a representation of the unitary group U(n), which allowed for the study of complex matrices.
4. Developed a theory for the classification of algebraic number fields and the representation of real algebraic integers, which is now known as the Furtwängler number system.
5. Constructed a topological characterization of the class field theory, an important tool for studying complex number systems.
6. Contributed to the field of representation theory by constructing the first representations of the unitary groups that allowed for numerical calculations.
7. Pioneered an algebraic approach to the study of modular forms, allowing for efficient computation of values of polynomials at integral points.
8. Developed a general theory of finite groups, which allowed for a systematic classification of finite group-theoretic objects.
9. Developed a generalization of homology theory that could be applied to arbitrary group-like objects, now known as the Furtwängler homology theory.
10. Contributed to the early development of category theory, which allowed the application of mathematical theories to diverse types of objects.

Born 21 April 1869, Elze, Hanover, Prussia, now Germany. Died 19 May 1940, Vienna, Austria.
