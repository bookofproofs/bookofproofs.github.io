**Georg Cantor** was a Russian-born mathematician who can be considered as the founder of set theory and introduced the concept of infinite numbers with his discovery of cardinal numbers. He also advanced the study of trigonometric series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method of computing the cardinality of infinite sets, now known as "Cantor's diagonal argument," which led to a new field of mathematics called set theory.
2. Introduced the concept of a one-to-one correspondence between two sets, which is now known as bijective correspondence.
3. Formulated the first theory of transfinite numbers, which allow for generalizations of the concepts of "size" and "infinity" beyond the normal interpretations.
4. Introduced the study of cardinal numbers, establishing the term "cardinality" to describe the size of a set.
5. Developed new methods for characterizing continuous functions and developing the theory of trigonometric series.
6. Established the basis for set theory, which provided the framework for much of modern mathematics.
7. Demonstrated that irrational numbers could be "measured" in a meaningful way.

Born 3 March 1845, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 6 January 1918, Halle, Germany.
