**Hermann Schwarz** worked on the conformal mapping of polyhedral surfaces onto the spherical surface and on a problem of the calculus of variation, namely surfaces of least area.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Schwarz Integral Theorem in 1870, which states that a sufficiently smooth vector field is conservative.
2. Constructed the Schwarz triangle mapping in 1880, which is the conformal mapping of a triangle onto the unit disc. 
3. Developed two important theorems related to meromorphic functions, namely the area theorem and the lemniscate theorem, both in 1871. 
4. Discovered the analytic Rosenhain representation for abelian functions in 1875. 
5. Established the Schwarz–Christoffel mapping in 1877, facilitating the conformal mapping of polygons onto the unit disc. 
6. Authored the treatise Über quadratische Differentialformen, which discussed quadratic differential forms, in 1889.

Born 25 January 1843, Hermsdorf am Kynast, Silesia (now Sobieszów, Jelenia Góra, Poland). Died 30 November 1921, Berlin, Germany.
