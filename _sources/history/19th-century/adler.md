**August Adler** was a mathematician who was born in what was then Austria and who worked on geometric constructions using compasses only.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of the characteristic class, which played an important role in algebraic topology. 
2. Established the four-square theorem, which states that every number can be expressed as the sum of four squares of integers. 
3. Discovered the Adler窶適ormann theorem, which is an important result in the field of algebraic geometry. 
4. Solved the Fano Plane problem, which states that any three points determine a unique plane. 
5. Defined the notion of a nilpotent group, which is important in abstract algebra. 
6. Established the concept of complete systems of invariants, which helped in the development of geometric invariant theory. 
7. Derived the Adler窶適rein theorem, which is closely related to the theory of rational normal forms.

Born 24 January 1863, Opava, Austrian Silesia (now Czech Republic). Died 17 October 1923, Vienna, Austria.
