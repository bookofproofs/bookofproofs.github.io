**Fredholm** is best remembered for his work on integral equations and spectral theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Fredholm integral equation, which solved a number of previously intractable mathematical problems.
2. Discovered the Fredholm alternative and the Fredholm theory of integral equations.
3. Developed the theory of linear integral operators and its applications to analysis.
4. Demonstrated how theory of linear integral operators could be used to solve ordinary differential equations.
5. Used his theory to develop the theory of analytic functions of a complex variable, now referred to as Fredholm theory.
6. Introduced the notion of a Hilbert space, which is a linear vector space, endowed with an inner product.
7. Established the foundations of modern functional analysis.
8. Proved the Fredholm alternative theorem, which is of considerable influence to modern analysis.

Born 7 April 1866, Stockholm, Sweden. Died 17 August 1927, Danderyd, County of Stockholm, Sweden.
