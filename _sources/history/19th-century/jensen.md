**Johan Ludwig Jensen** was a Danish mathematician and engineer who worked on the Riemann hypothsis and convex functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Jensen Inequality in the early 1900s, which is used to prove several results in mathematics, economics, and other disciplines.
2. Proved the Jensen–Shannon divergence theorem, establishing the basis of information theory.
3. Formulated the Følner-Lèvy theorem and is considered the founder of an area of analysis.
4. Proved the famous 'Stern–Jensen theorem' regarding prime numbers which is one of the major results in prime number theory.
5. Represented Denmark in the International Mathematical Congress in 1900.
6. His textbook 'Vergleichende Begriffslehre der Quantität und Qualität' was used for many years as the reference for teaching analysis in the university level in Denmark.

Born 8 May1859, Nakskov, Denmark. Died 5 March 1925, Copenhagen, Denmark.
