**Johan Ludwig Jensen** was a Danish mathematician and engineer who worked on the Riemann hypothsis and convex functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* When Jensen was young his father took a position in Sweden as the manager of an estate in the north of the country.
* Jensen always said in later life that these childhood years were "the most wonderful of his life".
* When his position as estate manager ended Jensen's father returned to Denmark and Jensen completed his schooling in Copenhagen.
* Jensen was essentially self taught in research level mathematics and never held an academic appointment.
* The Company thrived, at least in part through the high level of technical skill that Jensen possessed.
* For his whole working life Jensen was an amateur mathematician only doing mathematics in his spare time.
* Jensen contributed to the Riemann Hypothesis, proving a theorem which he sent to Mittag-Leffler who published it in 1899.
* The theorem is important, but does not lead to a solution of the Riemann Hypothesis as Jensen had hoped.
* In a paper which he published in Acta mathematica in 1906, Jensen proved an inequality for convex functions which had a whole host of classical inequalities as special cases.

Born 8 May 1859, Nakskov, Denmark. Died 5 March 1925, Copenhagen, Denmark.
