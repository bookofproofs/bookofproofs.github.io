**Emanuel Czuber** was a Czech mathematician who studied was probability theory and related areas.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the formal principles of mathematical logic in his work "The Principles of Mathematical Logic" (1902).
2. Co-founded an influential school of mathematical logic known as the Vienna Circle.
3. Authored "Elements of Mathematics: Introduction to Pure Mathematics" (1910).
4. Developed the theory of linear search algorithms in "Theory, Practice and Application of Linear Searching" (1911).
5. Established the principles of mathematical models and the use of proof theory in "The Theory of Mathematical Models" (1920).
6. Developed the basis of model theory in his essay titled "Logic in the Twentieth Century" (1923).
7. Contributed to the development of modern probability theory with his paper "On Probability Theory" (1925).
8. Co-authored Theories of Set (1929) which established the fundamentals of modern set theory.
9. Developed the theory of substitution of variables in "The Theory of Substitution of Variables in Mathematical Logical Models" (1931).
