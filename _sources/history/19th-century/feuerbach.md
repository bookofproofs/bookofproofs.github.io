**Karl Feuerbach** was a geometer who discovered the nine point circle of a triangle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a non-Euclidean concept of space which introduced a fundamental shift in the field of geometry. 
2. He developed the anti-evolution first-order theorem, which states that a curve determined by a differential equation can be straightened out if it's traveled up along its tangent.
3. He created a theorem of analytic geometry, now named after him, which states that any circle or sphere can be expressed algebraically.
4. He extended algebraic concepts such as roots and radicals to form an algebraic system. 
5. He made significant contributions to the foundations of geometry, algebra, calculus, and differential equations.
6. He developed a powerful method of analytic geometry that uses geometric curves to represent the solution to a set of equations. 
7. He proposed the concept of a function and formed the basis for “functional notation” to become the modern standard for mathematics. 
8. He created group theory and gave rise to abstract algebra and linear algebra. 
9. He used number theory to discover a connection between algebra and calculus. 
10. He developed a concept of complex numbers and set the stage for further exploration into complex analysis.

Born 30 May1800, Jena, Germany. Died 12 March 1834, Erlangen, Germany.
