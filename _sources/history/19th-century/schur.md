**Issai Schur** is mainly known for his fundamental work on the representation theory of groups but he also worked in number theory and analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Issai Schur proved the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem which states that all normal subgroups of a finite group can be written as a direct product of Sylow subgroups.
2. He developed the Schur-Frobenius Theorem which establishes a relationship between the irreducible characters of a group and its representations. 
3. He proved the Modular Linear Equation, describing a necessary and sufficient condition for all linear equations with real coefficients to have solutions. 
4. He solved Hilbert's FourthProblem which asked for an analogue of the Cauchy-Kowalevski Theorem for linear partial differential equations. 
5. He established a number of results in algebraic topology, including in the theory of the genus of a graph. 
6. Issai Schur contributed to the development of character theory in group theory by introducing the Schur multiplier. 
7. He was responsible for the Schur-Schmidt theorem which provides useful information about groups of order 8. 
8. He worked on classical invariant theory and introduced the terms absolute invariant and relative invariant. 
9. He introduced the Schur complement, a matrix operation important in various applications in mathematics, such as in the analysis of large sparse matrices.

Born 10 January 1875, Mogilev, Russian Empire (now Belarus). Died 10 January 1941, Tel Aviv, British Mandate for Palestine (now Israel).
