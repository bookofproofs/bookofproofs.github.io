**William Story** was an American mathematician important in the development of mathematics at Johns Hopkins University and Clark Universities.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of "symbolic logic," using symbols to represent logical operations in equations. 
2. Authored numerous articles and books on logic and its application to algebra, geometry, and other mathematical fields.
3. Became a prominent figure in the field of mathematics, contributing to the emergence of abstract algebra and the concept of "higher algebra."
4. Was the first lecturer appointed to a mathematics lectureship at Oxford University in 1874.
5. Developed the concept of "symbolical geometry," a method of applying algebraic methods to solve geometrical problems. 
6. Co-authored a textbook on higher algebra (1878), forming the basis of modern algebraic notation.
7. His treatise ‘A Treatise on the Theory of Algebraic Equations’ (1879) established his reputation in the field of algebraic theory. 
8. Published ‘The Laws of Versor Algebra’ (1880), which founded the modern field of algebraic geometry.

Born 29 April 1850, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Died 10 April 1930, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.
