**Paul du Bois-Reymond** gave a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges at a point (and in fact at a dense set of points).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
Paul du Bois-Reymond was a prominent mathematician of the 19th century. He is best known for his contributions to the development of calculus in the fields of analytical mechanics, calculus of variations, state equations, and integral equations.

1. He contributed to the development of calculus in analytical mechanics.
2. He developed the calculus of variations.
3. He discovered state equations that describe the behavior of electrical and magnetic fields.
4. He uncovered the importance of integral equations in the study of boundary value problems.
5. He formulated a variant of the wave equation and introduced the notion of potential function.
6. He promoted the use of Hamilton's principle to obtain equations of motion for mechanical systems.
7. He developed a general theory of electric and magnetic potentials and fields.
8. He published a book on the theory of elasticity.
9. He formulated a general statement concerning the Dirichlet-Neumann problem. 
10. He introduced the concept of continuity for a real function.

Born 2 December 1831, Berlin, Germany. Died 7 April 1889, Freiburg, Germany.
