**Ernst Meissel**'s mathematical work covers number theory, work on Möbius inversion and the theory of partitions as well as work on Bessel functions, asymptotic analysis, refraction of light and the three body problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a formula for calculating the sum of a harmonic series that was used by Albert Einstein and others.
2. Discovered the Meissel–Mertens constant, a mathematical constant related to prime numbers.
3. Enhanced the Prime Number Theorem, which states that the number of prime numbers is asymptotically equal to the natural logarithm of the integer.
4. Was an early innovator in the study of the "distribution of prime numbers" and its approximate formula.
5. Researched the Riemann zeta function, which is a fundamental equation in analytic number theory.
6. Made important advances in the field of elliptical functions, including the Meissel–Lehmer conjecture.
7. Co-discovered the Stieltjes constants in a joint effort with Thomas Jan Stieltjes.
8. popularized the use of the widely used "Euler–Mascheroni constant" in mathematical analysis.

Born 31 July 1826, Neustadt-Eberswalde, Brandenburg, Prussia (now Germany). Died 11 March 1895, Kiel, Herzogtum Holstein, Prussia (now Germany).
