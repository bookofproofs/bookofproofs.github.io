**Ernst Meissel**'s mathematical work covers number theory, work on Möbius inversion and the theory of partitions as well as work on Bessel functions, asymptotic analysis, refraction of light and the three body problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He also had contacts with Dirichlet who was teaching at the University of Berlin at the time Meissel was studying there.
* After obtaining his doctorate, Meissel remained in Berlin studying for the necessary qualifications to become a secondary school teacher of mathematics.
* Meissel left Berlin, and his positions there, in 1852 when he was appointed as director of the Royal Provinzialgewerbeschule in Iserlohn, which is situated about 25 km south of Dortmund.
* Little is known of Meissel's private life.
* One son, W Meissel, worked for Norddeutscher Lloyd, Bremerhaven.
* Meissel's mathematical work covers a number of areas.
* In particular, Meissel was a master calculator, as witnessed by the many tables he worked out and the extensive numerical calculations he performed.
* In addition to his work on primes, Meissel did other number theory work, namely on Möbius inversion and the theory of partitions.

Born 31 July 1826, Neustadt-Eberswalde, Brandenburg, Prussia (now Germany). Died 11 March 1895, Kiel, Herzogtum Holstein, Prussia (now Germany).
