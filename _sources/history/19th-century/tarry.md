**Gaston Tarry** was a French combinatorialist whose best-known work is a method for solving mazes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored two books on the subject of mathematics: 'A Treatise on Mathematics' (1899) and 'The Fundamental Principles of Mathematics' (1902).
2. Developed the Tarry-Escott problem of graph theory.
3. Discovered the Tarry-Gorenstein theorem in 1909, which showed that any two planar figures of arbitrary dimensions could be decorated with the same set of line segments.
4. Developed several novel methods in number theory, including the use of prime numbers in patterns and the use of transcendental numbers in equations.
5. Constructed a self-contained elementary proof of the Kepler-Bouwkamp theorem, which states that any line linking the vertices of a triangle divides the area of the triangle into three equal parts.
6. In 1897 proposed a set of 13 equations that form a basis for solving the cubic equation. 
7. Published his monograph 'Theoretical Arithmetic' in 1910.

Born 27 September 1843, Villefranche-de-Rouergue, Aveyron, France. Died 21 June 1913, Le Havre, France.
