**James Cassels** graduated from Edinburgh University and became a teacher at Ayr Academy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of Ordered Partitions of Integers and published papers on the topic in prestigious mathematics publications, including the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society.
2. Wrote two books on algebraic number theory, specifically on ideals and rings of algebraic integers.
3. Computed the maximal order of elements in a finite group, leading to one of the Clay Mathematics Instituteâ€™s Millennium Prize Problems.
4. Pioneered the concept of 'lattice theory', now an important branch of abstract algebra.
5. Developed the first construction of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and published his findings in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society.
6. Discovered the asymptotic properties of classical invariant theory and published a paper on the findings.
7. Proved various theorems for linear groups and wrote a book about the topic. 
8. Authored several texts on elliptic functions and the theory of equations. 
9. Developed general methods for computing the number of irreducible representations of a group.

Born 10 November 1891, Ayr, Scotland. Died 1980, Ayr, Scotland.
