**Forest Ray Moulton** was an American astronomer. He was one of the proponents of the _planetesimal hypothesis_ of the origin and evolution of the solar system.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Served as the editor-in-chief of Annals of Mathematics, the leading mathematical journal of the time.
2. Was a consultant for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics on the formulation of certain theoretical assumptions used in airplane performance calculations.
3. Published groundbreaking research on the dynamics of planetary motion and developed foundational concepts such as the perturbation theory.
4. His work on the theory of the lunar motion provided the basis for a satellite navigation system more than 50 years in advance of the system now used by GPS.
5. Developed a framework for a rotating star that solved the dark energy problem proposed by Einstein.
6. Wrote treatises on mathematical astronomy and calculus of variations.
7. Appointed to the Department of Mathematics at John Hopkins University, where he taught and wrote several influential books on mathematics.
8. Established the Moulton School of Mathematics at the University of Chicago, now known as the Moulton Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

Born 29 April 1872, LeRoy, Michigan, USA. Died 7 December 1952, Wilmette, Illinois, USA.
