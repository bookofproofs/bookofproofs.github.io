**Forest Ray Moulton** was an American astronomer. He was one of the proponents of the _planetesimal hypothesis_ of the origin and evolution of the solar system.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Belah Moulton had fought in the Civil War and had received the land as a war veteran.
* However it was heavily forested land and Belah had to clear the trees before he could start to farm there.
* In fact Forest was his parent's first child and he was born in a log cabin in the forest.
* a perfect ray of light and happiness in that dense forest.
* No formal schooling was possible for Forest in the rural environment that he grew up in, but his parents and grandparents (particularly his mother) gave him a solid foundation to his education.
* Moulton became a part-time instructor at Albion in 1892 and held this position until he graduated from the College in 1894.
* Moulton's main interests were in the application of mathematics to problems in astronomy.
* Moulton is best known, however, as the co-author with Thomas C Chamberlin of the Chamberlin-Moulton planetesimal hypothesis of the origin and evolution of the solar system.
* Moulton began working with Chamberlin, who was professor of geology at Chicago, when he was undertaking graduate studies at Chicago.
* However it was Moulton who made Chamberlin's idea into a solid theory by providing the necessary mathematical calculations.
* Moulton's Company came close to collapse in 1933 but it just survived.
* Moulton and his wife Estella divorced in 1936 and, in 1939, he married Alicia Pratt.
* In 1950 Moulton, by this time 78 years old, moved to Evanston, Illinois, where one of his brothers was Professor of Mathematics at Northwestern University.
* Moulton's most famous pupil was Edwin Hubble.

Born 29 April 1872, LeRoy, Michigan, USA. Died 7 December 1952, Wilmette, Illinois, USA.
