**Johannes van der Corput** was a Dutch mathematician who worked in the field of analytic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first convergent method for the numerical evaluation of integrals.
2. Developed important ideas for accelerating convergence of infinite series expansions.
3. Established general theorems in potential theory.
4. Developed methods for dealing with continuous superpositions of finite parts in potential theory.
5. Showed that any associated systems of linear algebraic equations in which every equation has an odd number of unknowns can be solved by the addition or subtraction of one equation to or from the sum of all the others. 
6. Developed van der Corput sequences which offer low-discrepancy distribution of pseudo-random numbers.
7. Obtained results on the approximation and representation of functions by trigonometric polynomials of one or more variables.
8. Discovered the van der Corput inequality for interpolation of trigonometric polynomials.
9. Developed the first volume-preserving transformation of a quadrant onto itself.
10. Established the existence of quasi-cycle periodic systems and provided solutions.

Born 4 September 1890, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Died 13 September 1975, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
