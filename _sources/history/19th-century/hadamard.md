**Jacques Hadamard** was a French mathematician whose most important result is the prime number theorem which he proved in 1896. This states that the number of primes `$<n$` tends to infinity as fast as `$\frac{n}{\log_e(n)}$`.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the prime number theorem and the Hadamard-Frobenius determinant theorem.
2. Developed the concept of a ‘well-posed’ problem in mathematics.
3. Developed the Rademacher–Menchoff theorem of random Fourier series.
4. Pioneered the field of ‘matrix analysis’ with his book on the subject.
5. Formulated the maximum principle of deterministic dynamical systems, a key ingredient of chaotic dynamics.
6. Developed the Hadamard Variation in Rayleigh heat Radiation.
7. Published a book on the ‘Behaviour of Functions’, that is still used as a reference today.
8. Introduced important concepts such as the Hadamard no-counterexamples theory, the Hadamard's law of succession, and a generalized matrix inversion formula.
9. His works on irrational numbers and the three-body problem have been celebrated and utilized in number theory and celestial mechanics.
10. Delved deep into the field of non-Euclidean geometry, providing solutions to certain unsolved cases.

Born 8 December 1865, Versailles, France. Died 17 October 1963, Paris, France.
