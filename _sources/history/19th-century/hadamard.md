**Jacques Hadamard** was a French mathematician whose most important result is the prime number theorem which he proved in 1896. This states that the number of primes `$<n$` tends to infinity as fast as `$\frac{n}{\log_e(n)}$`.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Amédée Hadamard, who was of a Jewish background, was a teacher who taught several subjects such as classics, grammar, history and geography while Jacques' mother taught piano giving private lessons in their home.
* At the time that Jacques was born Amédée was teaching at the Lycée Impérial in Versailles but the family moved to Paris when Jacques was three years old when his father took up a position at the Lycée Charlemagne.
* Hadamard's family, like many others, ate elephant meat to survive.
* Between the surrender and the signing of the treaty there was essentially a civil war in Paris and the Hadamards' house was burnt down.
* The war was not the only cause of sadness for the Hadamards.
* Jacques' young sister Jeanne died in 1870 before the siege of Paris and another sister Suzanne, who was born in 1871, died in 1874.
* Jacques began his schooling at the Lycée Charlemagne where his father taught.
* In 1875 Hadamard's father, having acquired a poor reputation as a teacher, was transferred to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and Jacques attended this school from 1876.
* In 1884 Hadamard took the entrance examinations for École Polytechnique and École Normale Supérieure; he was placed first in both examinations.
* Hadamard obtained his doctorate in 1892 for a thesis on functions defined by Taylor series.
* In the same year Hadamard received the Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques for his paper Determination of the number of primes less than a given number.
* He never submitted an entry for the prize but Hadamard, between the time his thesis was submitted and his oral examination, realised that his results could be applied to zeta functions.
* The year 1892 was significant for Hadamard in addition to the academic achievements described above.
* In June of that year he married Louise-Anna Trénel who was, like Hadamard, of a Jewish background.
* They moved to Bordeaux the following year when Hadamard was appointed as a lecturer at the University.
* The four years which he spent in Bordeaux were not only busy ones for his family life, with two sons Pierre and Étienne being born during this time, but they were also extremely productive ones for Hadamard's research.
* This theorem was conjectured in the 18th  century, but it was not proved until 1896, when Hadamard and (independently) Charles de la Vallée Poussin, used complex analysis.
* Solving this important open problem was not Hadamard's only remarkable contribution of 1896.
* The topic proposed for the prize had been one on geodesics and Hadamard's work in studying the trajectories of point masses on a surface led to certain non-linear differential equations whose solution also gave properties of geodesics.
* Another result which Hadamard published during his time in Bordeaux was his famous determinant inequality of 1893.
* Matrices whose determinants satisfied equality in the relation are today called Hadamard matrices and are important in the theory of integral equations, coding theory and other areas.
* Hadamard first became involved in politics during his time in Bordeaux.
* Alfred Dreyfus, whose wife was a relation of Hadamard, came from Alsace.
* At first Hadamard, like many people, assumed that Dreyfus was guilty.
* Hadamard took an active part in clearing Dreyfus's name which finally happened on 22 July 1906, when Dreyfus was reinstated and decorated with the Legion of Honour.
* Long before the Dreyfus Affair had ended Hadamard had, as we have indicated, moved from Bordeaux to Paris.
* Hadamard received the Prix Poncelet in 1898 for his research achievements over the preceding ten years.
* During Hadamard's first five years in Paris another three children were born, first another son Mathieu and then two daughters Cécile and Jacqueline.
* Poincaré had strongly supported Hadamard for this chair but, within a few months, he died at the tragically young age of 58.
* Hadamard then undertook the hugely difficult task of surveying Poincaré's work and by the end of the summer of 1912 he had produced two major articles.
* Near the end of 1912 Hadamard was elected to the Academy of Sciences to succeed Poincaré.
* Both were killed at Verdun and Hadamard was lecturing in Rome when Pierre was killed.
* Hadamard knew only one way to push the pain of these tragedies away enough to allow him to keep going, and that was to throw himself even more vigorously into mathematics.
* Between the wars Hadamard's politics moved towards the left, mainly in response to the Nazis rise to power in 1933.
* Hadamard left the United States soon after and spent a year in England before returning to Paris as soon as was possible after the end of the war.
* One further tragedy was to hit Hadamard before his death.
* This seemed to finally kill Hadamard's spirit and he did not leave his house after this, almost waiting to die.
* There is no way that an article of this length can even indicate the range of Hadamard's mathematical contributions.
* As well as about 300 scientific papers and books Hadamard also wrote books for a wider audience.
* We should also, however, indicate Hadamard's style of teaching.

Born 8 December 1865, Versailles, France. Died 17 October 1963, Paris, France.
