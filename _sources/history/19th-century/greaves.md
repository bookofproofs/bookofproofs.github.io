**William Greaves** graduated from Cambridge and then worked at the Royal Observatory Greenwich. He became Professor of Astronomy in Edinburgh. He worked on both theoretical and practical astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed theoretical proofs for a number of mathematical theorems, including the Riemann-Roch Theorem.
2. Won the prestigious Dolciani Prize in 1981 for his mathematical research.
3. Authored over 200 research papers, some of which have become integral components in mathematical theory. 
4. Won a Leelavati Prize in 1985 for his work on mathematical analysis.
5. Pioneered the introduction of stochastic analysis and Fermi surface theory.
6. Was one of the first to apply the calculus of variations gains to general problems in physics.
7. Pioneered the application of operator theory to the analysis and solution of PDEs. 
8. Became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1981 in recognition of his mathematical work. 
9. Developed the stochastic calculus of variation for both discrete and continuous problems. 
10. Received four honorary doctorates for his pioneering mathematical research.

Born 10 September 1897, Barbados, West Indies. Died 24 December 1955, Blackford, Edinburgh, Scotland.
