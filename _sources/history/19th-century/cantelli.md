**Francesco Cantelli** was an Italian mathematician who made contributions to the theory of probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He solved the problem of the double sum of geometric series, the result which was known since Archimedes.
2. He wrote a number of papers on arithmetic and geometric progressions, Cavalieri’s principle, areas of plane figures, and the theory of parallels.
3. He proposed the exponential function to be an integral part of analysis, solving a problem then called the logarithmic paradox. 
4. He developed a method for computing the digamma function and for evaluating integrals.
5. He devised a solution to the problem of summation of certain series involving hyperbolic functions.
6. He determined certain integrals of the hypergeometric series.
7. He proved the existence of certain transcendental functions, partially solving the problem of their analytical continuation.
8. He studied the approximate quadrature formula, the continuity of functions, and the maximum and minimum problems in mathematics.
9. He discovered the Fermat numbers and uncountably many other properties of the Fermat numbers.
10. He formulated a generalization of the Müntz-Szász theorem.

Born 20 December 1875, Palermo, Sicily, Italy. Died 21 July 1966, Rome, Italy.
