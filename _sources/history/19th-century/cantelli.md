**Francesco Cantelli** was an Italian mathematician who made contributions to the theory of probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Palermo Observatory, where Cantelli worked, had been quite famous.
* Its most important discovery had been 100 years before Cantelli worked there, on 1 January 1801, when the asteroid Ceres was discovered.
* Cantelli's investigation confirmed the hypothesis favouring the year 1301.
* Cantelli's work in astronomy involved statistical analysis of data and his interests turned more towards the statistical style of mathematics and to applications of probability to astronomy and other areas.
* In 1922, while still working as an actuary at the Istituti di Previdenza, Cantelli qualified to teach in universities.
* In 1925 Cantelli was called to Naples where he taught actuarial and financial mathematics.
* However others made important contributions, and a number of Italians, including Cantelli, Castelnuovo and de Finetti, did outstanding work in this area.
* Although his name is frequently connected with the name of E Borel, Cantelli's approach to probability is very different from that of Borel.
* Cantelli, in his work on the law of large numbers, was developing ideas which had been first suggested by Jacob Bernoulli in the 17th  century.
* Around the time that Cantelli worked on the law of large numbers, Borel was also interested in the topic.
* In spite of these aspects, the Cantelli treatment of stochastic convergence turns out to be exceptionally transparent and quite satisfactory even with respect to the present expositions of the subject.
* Financial mathematics was also a topic of Cantelli's research.

Born 20 December 1875, Palermo, Sicily, Italy. Died 21 July 1966, Rome, Italy.
