**Peter Ramsay** graduated from Glasgow University and taught at George Watson's School in Edinburgh. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Peter Ramsay developed the Ramsay number, a type of integer related to graph theory. 
2. He proved Ramsey's theorem in 1930, a landmark theorem in mathematics that relates to the popularly known "Erdős–Rado theorem".
3. He solved, independently of formalist David Hilbert, the problem of monotone subsequences of irrational numbers.
4. He also conducted work on topological graphs and invented the notions of abstract and geometric complete graphs.
5. He formally proved that a certain 4-vertex graph is the only possible graph with smallest degree of every vertex equaling two.
6. He introduced the concepts of homostrophic and heterostrophic sets.
7. He discovered and proved the Heawood conjecture regarding the graph coloring problem.

Born 1879, Glasgow, Scotland. Died 2 July 1926, Edinburgh, Scotland.
