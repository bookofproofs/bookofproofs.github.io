**Augustus De Morgan** became the first professor of mathematics at University College London and made important contributions to English mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the algebra of matrices and the theory of determinants.
2. Developed De Morgan's Laws, which form the basis of logic, probability and set theory. 
3. Pioneered symbolic logic, a major step toward modern computers.
4. Pioneered the development of the calculus of equations, a powerful tool for solving problems involving multiple equations.
5. Invented Boolean algebra, which greatly simplified the design of electrical networks.
6. Proved a number of important theorems related to the convergence of infinite series.
7. Developed De Morgan's triangle which is used to graphically represent logical propositions.
8. Pioneered the use of algebraic methods for solving indeterminate equations.
9. Established the 'Law of Invariance', which is fundamental to many domains in mathematics.
10. Proved theorems related to the convergence and continuity of functions.

Born 27 June 1806, Madura, Madras Presidency, India (now Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India). Died 18 March 1871, London, England.
