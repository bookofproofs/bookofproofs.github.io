**George-Henri Halphen** was a French mathematician who worked on the singularity theory of algebraic curves as well as invariant theory and projective differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis into a complete proof.
2. Contributed to study of invariants of trigonometric functions and number theory.
3. Published key works in algebra, analysis and geometry.
4. Established the Halphen Theory, regarding analytical mechanics and the topology of surfaces.
5. Used his expertise of asymptotic theory to solve dynamical problems through the application of methods such as the theory of residues.
6. Demonstrated the notion of transformations of Bessel functions, leading to the development of an efficient algorithm for the integration of these functions.
7. Produced groundbreaking works in the field of Hilbert-type inequalities and the algebraic theory of complex curves. 
8. Resolved the problems related to the finite representation of regularize solutions of Pfaff equations. 
9. Identified the complementary series solutions to the hypergeometric functions.
10. Developed the theory of Elliptic functions and its application to the linear differential equations of second order.

Born 30 October 1844, Rouen, France. Died 23 May 1889, Versailles, France.
