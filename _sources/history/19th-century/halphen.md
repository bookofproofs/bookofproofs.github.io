**George-Henri Halphen** was a French mathematician who worked on the singularity theory of algebraic curves as well as invariant theory and projective differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Shortly after this his mother moved from Rouen to Paris where George-Henri was brought up.
* Political events determined the course of the next few years for Halphen and work for his doctorate would have to wait until after the Franco-Prussian war.
* Halphen served in the French army in the conflict.
* Halphen, however, had served his country with great distinction.
* In 1872, after leaving the army, Halphen married the daughter of Henri Aron.
* Also in 1872 Halphen was appointed as répétiteur at the École Polytechnique and he was soon making major contributions.
* Halphen showed that Chasles was essentially correct, but that restrictions on the kinds of singularity were necessary.
* Halphen took a different view on the problems of enumeration from his contemporaries.
* In fact Halphen was well ahead of his time in the ideas which he brought to these problems.
* Halphen and Schubert engaged in a heated debate on whether an enumerative formula should be allowed to count degenerate solutions along with the nondegenerate solutions.
* Next Halphen classified singular points of algebraic closed curves thus extending the work of Riemann.
* A characterisation of such invariant differential equations appeared in Halphen's doctoral dissertation On differential invariants which he presented in 1878.
* Halphen made major contributions to linear differential equations and algebraic space curves.
* This last result appeared in a paper Halphen published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society in 1878.
* In 1884 Halphen was made an examinateur at the École Polytechnique, then two years later he was elected to the Académie des Sciences.
* A major figure in his time, much of Halphen's work was in areas which have fallen out of favour.
* Perhaps with its inevitable revival, analytic geometry will restore Halphen to the eminence he earned.

Born 30 October 1844, Rouen, France. Died 23 May 1889, Versailles, France.
