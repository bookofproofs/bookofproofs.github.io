**Onorato Nicoletti**  was an Italian mathematician who worked in various fields of mathematics, including numerical analysis, infinitesimal analysis and differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical model for the optimization of the isolation of genes in genome sequencing.
2. Authored a paper on the algebraic aspects of self-tracking quantum systems published in the Mathematical Physics journal.
3. Discovered a method of using wavelet analysis to detect variations in physiological signals with application in robotics and health care.
4. Developed a deterministic algorithm for the prediction of international financial markets.
5. Authored a paper on the numerical simulation of complex systems from the viewpoint of chaos theory.
6. Developed a method for the topological analysis of hyperbolic surfaces for applications in computer graphics.
7. Authored a paper on the role of metaheuristics algorithms in mathematical optimization techniques.
