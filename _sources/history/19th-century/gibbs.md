**J Willard Gibbs** was an American mathematician best-known for the _Gibbs effect_ seen when Fourier-analysing a discontinuous function.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1.He formulated the first full set of equations governing the behavior of multi-component mixtures, thereby laying the foundation for the field of chemical thermodynamics.
2. He developed a theoretical basis for border work, or the study of the transfer of heat or matter across a boundary.
3. He developed the Einstein-Gibbs equality for the average value of a thermodynamic quantity in a mixture of fluids.
4. He developed the concept of phase diagrams for the chemistry of matter, which can be used to explain a substance's properties in different thermodynamic states.
5. He developed the Gibbs Free Energy equation, which describes the changes in energy that take place when molecules move from one state to another.
6. He developed the concept of statistical thermodynamics, which describes the relationship between a molecule's energy level and its interaction with its environment.
7. He introduced important mathematical tools, such as the use of vector calculus to study phase transitions.
8. He pioneered the use of vector notation in thermodynamics, thus introducing a powerful tool to the field.
9. He developed the Gibbs-Duhem equation, which describes the relationship between the chemical potentials of substances in a chemical reaction.
10. He formulated the Gibbsâ€“distribution law, which links the thermodynamic properties of a system to the probability of its various states.

Born 11 February 1839, New Haven, Connecticut, USA. Died 28 April 1903, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.
