**J Willard Gibbs** was an American mathematician best-known for the _Gibbs effect_ seen when Fourier-analysing a discontinuous function.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In fact the Gibbs family originated in Warwickshire, England and moved from there to Boston in 1658.
* However Gibbs is said to have taken after his mother in physical appearance.
* Gibbs was educated at the local Hopkins Grammar School where he was described as friendly but withdrawn.
* Remaining at Yale, Gibbs began to undertake research in engineering, writing a thesis in which he used geometrical methods to study the design of gears.
* He was not short of money however since his father had died in 1861 and, since his mother had also died, Gibbs and his two sisters inherited a fair amount of money.
* From 1866 to 1869 Gibbs studied in Europe.
* Gibbs returned to Yale in June 1869 and, two years later in 1871, he was appointed professor of mathematical physics at Yale.
* Perhaps it is also surprising that Gibbs did not publish his first work until 1873 when he was 34 years old.
* Few scientists who produce such innovative work as Gibbs did are 34 years of age before producing signs of their genius.
* Gibbs' important 1873 papers were Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of Fluids and A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces.
* In 1876 Gibbs published the first part of the work for which he is most famous On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances, publishing the second part of this work in 1878.
* The second paper extended the diagrams into three dimensions and this work impressed Maxwell so much that he constructed a three dimensional model of Gibbs's thermodynamic surface and, shortly before his death, sent the model to Gibbs.
* Gibbs' work on vector analysis was also of major importance in pure mathematics.
* Using ideas of Grassmann, Gibbs produced a system much more easily applied to physics than that of Hamilton.
* A series of five papers by Gibbs on the electromagnetic theory of light were published between 1882 and 1889.
* Except for his early years and the three years in Europe, Gibbs spent his whole life living in the same house which his father had built only a short distance from the school Gibbs had attended, the College at which he had studied and the University where he worked the whole of his life.
* Gibbs was highly esteemed by his friends, but U.S. science was too preoccupied with practical questions to make much use of his profound theoretical work during his lifetime.
* The American Mathematical Society named a lecture series in honour of Gibbs.

Born 11 February 1839, New Haven, Connecticut, USA. Died 28 April 1903, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.
