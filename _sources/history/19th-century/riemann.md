**Bernhard Riemann**'s ideas concerning geometry of space had a profound effect on the development of modern theoretical physics. He clarified the notion of integral by defining what we now call the Riemann integral.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proposed the Riemann hypothesis in 1859, one of the most famous and important unsolved problems in mathematics.
2. Pioneered the field of Riemannian geometry, which is the foundation for Einstein's theory of general relativity.
3. Constructed a firm foundation for the modern theory of integration, fundamental for calculus.
4. Developed a formula for prime-counting, known as the Riemann zeta function.
5. Established the field of hyperbolic geometry.
6. Popularized the use of Dirichlet's Principle in mathematical analysis.
7. Published several influential papers on analytic number theory, probability theory and differential geometry.
8. Provided the necessary mathematics for Bernhard Bolzano's proof of the so-called Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

Born 17 September 1826, Breselenz, Hanover (now Germany). Died 20 July 1866, Selasca, Italy.
