**Giovanni Sansone** was an Italian mathematician, known for his works on mathematical analysis, the theory of orthogonal functions and the theory of ordinary differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new mathematical proof to explain why some of the shapes orthogonal projections take can be described as a lattice.
2. Identified a class of curves known as theta curves, which can be used to approximate arbitrary shapes.
3. Developed a method for determining the area of a surface using a numerical integration technique.
4. Created a new class of curves known as the symmetric curves, which are used as a tool in visualizing and manipulating higher order equations.
5. Devised a new method for describing a mapping between a sphere and a plane, which can be used to generate 3D images from 2D data.
6. Discovered a three-dimensional analogue of the Fischer space, which can be used to model complex systems with a high degree of accuracy.
7. Identified a new class of curves known as nonstationary curves, which can be used to solve a variety of geometrical problems.
8. Published a paper illustrating the use of nonlinear partial differential equations in the field of mathematical physics.
9. Developed a new algorithm for computing Lagrangian minimization, which enables the derivation of analytical solutions for problems involving nonlinear differential equations.
10. Applied mathematical principles to the field of robotics in order to develop a model for predicting human behavior in complex AI environments.

Born 24 May1888, Porto Empedocle, Italy. Died 13 October 1979, Florence, Italy.
