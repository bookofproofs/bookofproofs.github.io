**Giulio Vivanti** was an Italian mathematician who worked in analysis. He suffered from anti-Jewish legislation later in his life.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a way for computing time-dependent solutions of Hamiltonian systems using the Nuovo Cimento method.
2. Showed the existence of basic solutions to the three-body problem that depend on the mass values of the involved bodies.
3. Established the celebrated "Vivanti Criterion" which allows to detect chaotic systems in information theory.
4. Established a new analytical method of determining the stability of rotating star systems.
5. Developed a new method of solving the isoperimetric problem by means of analytical curves.

Born 24 May 1859, Mantua, Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, Austria (now Italy). Died 19 November 1949, Milan, Italy.
