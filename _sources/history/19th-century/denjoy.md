**Denjoy** was a French mathematician who did outstanding work on the functions of a real variable.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He introduced the Denjoy integral, which improved upon the Lebesgue integral by allowing for the differentiation of discontinuous functions.  
2. He was the first to provide a rigorous definition of a differentiable function, known as the Denjoy–Young–Saks theorem. 
3. He introduced the notion of Absolutely Convergent Fourier Series (ACFS), an important tool in modern harmonic analysis.
4. He developed the Denjoy–Koksma inequality, which is used to bound the error rate of numerical integration. 
5. He solved the Johan Jerosch problem, a mathematical problem related to measure theory. 
6. He pioneered the uses of modern set theory in the study of topology. 
7. He developed the Denjoy–Carleman differential equation, a class of non-linear equations used to classify functions.

Born 5 January 1884, Auch, Gers, France. Died 21 January 1974, Paris, France.
