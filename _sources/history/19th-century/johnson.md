**William Johnson** was an English mathematician, logician and economist.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Johnson viewed probability as expressing logical relations between evidence propositions and hypothesis propositions.
* In the 1920s the Cambridge philosopher William Ernest Johnson in effect characterized symmetric Dirichlet priors for multinomial sampling in terms of a natural and easily assessed subjective condition.
* Johnson's proof can be generalized to include asymmetric Dirichlet priors and those finitely exchangeable sequences with linear posterior expectation of success.
* Some interesting open problems that Johnson's result raises, and its historical and philosophical background, are also discussed.
* Despite his shyness, Keynes remarked that Johnson was an excellent conversationalist.

Born 23 June 1858, Cambridge, England. Died 14 January 1931, Northampton, England.
