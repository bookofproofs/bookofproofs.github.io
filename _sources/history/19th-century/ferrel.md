**William Ferrel** was an American astronomer who worked on the theory of tides.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Ferrel Cell theory which hypothesizes the dynamics of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere.
2. Improved the earlier theories of oceanic currents.
3. Proposed the use of statistical methods for weather forecasting.
4. Discovered the Coriolis effect, determining how air and ocean currents are displaced to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern hemisphere.
5. Developed a method to measure winds in the upper atmosphere and estimated the temperature of the upper atmosphere.

Born 29 January 1817, Bedford (now Fulton) County, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 18 September 1891, Martinsburg, West Virginia, USA.
