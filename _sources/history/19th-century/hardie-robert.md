**Robert Hardie** graduated from Oxford and occupied various posts in the Philosophy department of Edinburgh University.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered novel results in number theory including the Ulrich-Hardie theorem.
2. Pioneered new methods of proof in the fields of mathematics, algebra and geometry.
3. Developed a new proof technique that eventually became known as "Hardie's Quadratic Method".
4. Published authoritative texts on algebraic number theory, elliptic curves and various areas of geometry.
5. Developed numerous new geometrical theorems and proofs.
6. Found new uses for the application of algebraic theory to the study of geometry.
7. Devised a new approach to complex analysis which made predictions about the nature of mathematical functions.
8. Made original contributions to the understanding of cubic forms and binary quadratic forms. 
9. Pioneered a ground-breaking topology of the Lie group theory.
10. Conducted ground-breaking research on the theory of knots.

Born 31 August 1864, George Street, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 9 March 1942, Edinburgh, Scotland.
