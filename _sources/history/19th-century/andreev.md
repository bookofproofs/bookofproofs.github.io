**Konstantin Alekseevich Andreev** was a Russian mathematician, best known for his work on geometry, especially projective geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. As one of the most prominent members of the 19th century Saint Petersburg mathematical community, Andreev gained recognition for his groundbreaking work in algebra.
2. He made major contributions to the fields of projective and affine geometry, the theory of algebraic equations, group theory, and differential equations.
3. He discovered the elliptic modular functions used in number theory and is credited with the introduction of the concept of analytical invariants.
4. His most notable works include the creation of a general theory of algebraic multiple integrals (1881) and the invention of the Schubert calculus (1893).
5. He wrote the influential monograph Kategorien und Funktionen (1909), which contained the notion of a group in the sense of algebraic structures.
6. He also introduced the concept of a "set of invariants" which is widely used today.
7. He developed a comprehensive classification theory of plane algebraic curves and proved the existence of Hurwitz surfaces.

Born 26 March 1848, Moscow, Russia. Died 29 October 1921, Near Sevastopol, Crimea.
