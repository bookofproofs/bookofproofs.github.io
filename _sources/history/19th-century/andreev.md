**Konstantin Alekseevich Andreev** was a Russian mathematician, best known for his work on geometry, especially projective geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However, when Konstantin Alekseevich was young his father's business collapsed and the family suffered severe hardship.
* But financial problems were not all that troubled the family for Konstantin Alekseevich had very poor health as a child.
* These problems made it impossible for Konstantin Alekseevich to attend school until he was twelve years of age.
* In 1867 Andreev entered the mathematics department in the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of Moscow State University.
* Among the professors who influenced Andreev so much during his undergraduate years, he mentions in particular August Yulevich Davidov and Nicolai Vasilievich Bugaev.
* While he was a student, Andreev wrote an essay On mortality tables for which he was awarded a gold medal.
* The quality of the essay was so high it was published in the Memoirs of Moscow University in 1871, becoming Andreev's first publication.
* In this same year of 1871 Andreev began graduate studies taking the two-year course which was necessary preparation for becoming a university professor.
* In that year a vacancy occurred at Kharkov University and Bugaev strongly recommended Andreev for the position.
* At Kharkov, Andreev joined the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics which he helped build into a leading centre.
* While Andreev was on the faculty, he was joined by Aleksandr Mikhailovich Lyapunov and Vladimir Andreevich Steklov in 1885.
* Andreev defended his Master's thesis On a geometric formation of planar curves in February 1875 and, following a successful defence, he became an assistant professor at Kharkov.
* Andreev took a leading role in the foundation and development of the Kharkov Mathematical Society.
* This Society is one of the oldest mathematical societies and was founded in 1879, the year Andreev became an extraordinary professor.
* Andreev became an ordinary professor at Kharkov in 1886 and, one year earlier he had become a professor at the Kharkov Technological Institute in the year of its foundation.
* In October 1898 Andreev left Kharkov to take up an appointment at Moscow University where he was appointed to the chair of mathematics.
* Andreev is best known for his work on geometry, although he also made contributions to analysis.
* Gram determinants were introduced by J P Gram in 1879 but Andreev invented them independently in the context of problems of expansion of functions into orthogonal series and the best quadratic approximation to functions.

Born 26 March 1848, Moscow, Russia. Died 29 October 1921, Near Sevastopol, Crimea.
