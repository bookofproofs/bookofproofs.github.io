**Charles Joly** was an Irish mathematician who did outstanding work on the quaternions. He became Andrews Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin and Royal Astronomer of Ireland at Dunsink Observatory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* John Swift Joly was rector of St Catherine's Church of Ireland, Tullamore and he came from a family who had emigrated from the Austrian Netherlands in the middle of the eighteenth century.
* His great-grandfather was Jean Jasper Joly (1740-1823) who came to Dublin from France in 1769.
* Jean Jasper Joly's son, Charles Joly, was the father of John Swift Joly who had married Elizabeth Slator, the daughter of Rev Nathaniel Robert Slator and Frances Alicia Berry, at St Mary's Church, Athlone, Ireland on 12 August 1863.
* Let us note at this point that there is some confusion in the literature between Charles Jasper Joly, the subject of this biography, and John Joly (1857-1933) who became a leading physicist.
* Charles Jasper Joly and the physicist John Joly were related since John Joly's grandfather Henry Edward Joly (1784-1852) was the brother of Jean Jasper Joly's son, Charles Joly.
* Returning to the Rev John Swift Joly and his wife Elizabeth, they had five children: Charles Jasper Joly (1864-1906), the subject of this biography; Henry Nathaniel Joly (1866-1954); Frances Isabel Joly (1868-1947); Isabel Emily Joly (1871-1921); and John Swift Joly (1876-1943).
* Henry Nathaniel Joly followed his father in joining the church while John Swift Joly Jr became a leading surgeon.
* Let us note here that Frances Isabel Joly married Henry Joly, the brother of the physicist John Joly.
* When Charles Jasper Joly as still a baby, the family moved from Tullamore to Athlone were his father became the rector of the parish.
* This Protestant school, established by the Erasmus Smith Trust in 1669, was, when Joly  was a pupil, situated in College Street.
* Joly gained a reputation as a fine mathematician, being awarded numerous prizes and medals, and won a scholarship to Trinity College Dublin which he entered in 1882.
* as a student in Trinity College there was nothing accomplished by Joly that has not been accomplished by many a man who subsequently remained without further distinctions through life.
* Despite this slightly uninspiring undergraduate career, nevertheless Joly graduated in 1886 as the top mathematician of his year.
* KÃ¶nig was studying optics, in particular vision and its defects, and this was the path that Joly would probably have followed but for the death of his father on 3 December 1887.
* Year after year Joly fell short of success.
* It was not till 1894 that Joly was successful in his efforts to gain Fellowship.
* The somewhat peculiar way that the Fellowship competition was organised meant that publishing original work was of no great help so it was not until he obtained the Fellowship that Joly began publishing mathematical papers relating to the quaternions.
* On 20 March 1897, Joly married Jessie Sophie Meade (1874-1945) in Dublin.
* Charles and Jessie Joly had three daughters: Jessie Elizabeth Joly (1898-1987); Lucy Mary Joly (1899-1966); and Frances Isabel Joly (1905-1982).
* Also in 1897 Joly was appointed as Andrews Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin and Royal Astronomer of Ireland at Dunsink Observatory.
* Once established in Dunsink Observatory, Joly began publishing on both astronomy and on mathematics related to quaternions.
* In 1900 the International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Paris in August and Macfarlane travelled from Canada to Paris, stopping in Dublin for a few days to visit Joly.
* About Hamilton's habits and peculiarities Joly had a great stock of information.
* One day Professor Joly took me to see the Quaternion bridge.
* In 1903 Joly published the paper Quaternions and Projective Geometry which, being over 100 pages in length, could easily have been a book.
* Joly was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1904, then in the following year, he published his book A Manual of Quaternions.
* Shortly after he returned to Dublin from South Africa, his daughter Jessie Elizabeth Joly contracted typhoid.
* Soon Joly too became ill with the disease.

Born 27 June 1864, Tullamore, County Offaly, Ireland. Died 4 January 1906, Dunsink, Dublin, Ireland.
