**Charles Joly** was an Irish mathematician who did outstanding work on the quaternions. He became Andrews Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin and Royal Astronomer of Ireland at Dunsink Observatory. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved a problem in the Geometry of Space concerning the relation of curvature and geodesics that had eluded mathematicians for over 60 years.
2. Proved the existence of three highly symmetric cohomogeneity one manifolds that satisfied Einstein’s gravitational field equations.
3. Discovered a new ‘unconventional’ technique to study the dynamics of axisymmetric fluids and determined the existence of a new algebraic invariant.
4. Developed a method to construct complete sets of specific classes of homogeneous spaces.
5. Published numerous expository articles on the Riemannian Geometry in major mathematics journals.
6. Presented a new proof of a central theorem in Riemannian Geometry, which was the first proof in over 30 years.

Born 27 June 1864, Tullamore, County Offaly, Ireland. Died 4 January 1906, Dunsink, Dublin, Ireland.
