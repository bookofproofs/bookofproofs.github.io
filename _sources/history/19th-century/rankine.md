**William Rankine** worked on several areas of applied mathematics including mechanics, thermodynamics and waves.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Although he was the second of his parents children, his older brother David died when young so William was brought up as an only child.
* William did not enjoy good health as a child and could only attend school for short periods.
* Rankine's interests were divided between music and mathematics.
* For two years from 1836 to 1838 Rankine studied at the University of Edinburgh, attending a wide range of lectures in science subjects, but choosing not to attend mathematics classes.
* This was not Rankine's first experience of engineering for while he studied at Edinburgh University he had worked on the Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway which his father was overseeing.
* From 1839 to 1841 Rankine worked on numerous projects that John Benjamin MacNeill was involved with, including river improvements, waterworks, railways and both harbours.
* Some of the work took Rankine to Ireland.
* Further papers read to the Institution of Civil Engineers were highly thought of and several won Rankine prizes.
* Rankine was appointed to the regius chair of civil engineering and mechanics at Glasgow in 1855.
* Rankine's study of the applications of mathematics began quite early in his career as an engineer.
* Both Rankine and Clausius approached the second law of thermodynamics from the point of view of the transformation from one kind of energy to the other.
* But whereas Clausius considered the conversion between heat and work and the flow of heat from high to low temperature in a cyclic process, Rankine concentrated on the change from kinetic (molecular) to potential energies, and related this change to heat flow by use of his "heat-potential" function.
* Rankine's work was extended by Maxwell.
* Rankine also wrote on fatigue in the metal of railway axles, on earth pressures in soil mechanics, and the stability of walls.
* Rankine's health deteriorated rapidly during the final six months of his life.

Born 5 July 1820, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 24 December 1872, Glasgow, Scotland.
