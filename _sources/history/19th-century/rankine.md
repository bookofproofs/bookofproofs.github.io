**William Rankine** worked on several areas of applied mathematics including mechanics, thermodynamics and waves.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed one of the first comprehensive theories of thermodynamics, establishing important concepts such as the Rankine scale for measuring temperature.
2. Formulated the concepts of pressure-volume diagrams and the first law of thermodynamics.
3. Established initial steps of the Rankine cycle, a mathematical system used to describe the energy produced by steam engines and other heat engines.
4. Researched, developed and wrote the book “Manual of Applied Mechanics,” which explored the effects of pressure and load on various engineering materials and components.
5. Developed the Rankine-Hugoniot equations, which relate the pressure, velocity and density of a gas or a plasma across an interface.

Born 5 July 1820, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 24 December 1872, Glasgow, Scotland.
