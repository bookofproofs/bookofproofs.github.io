**Georges Humbert ** was a French mathematician who worked on geometry and hyperelliptic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. First to identify the successive minima of a positive definite quadratic form and to prove a relationship between them; 
2. Discovered the mass formula for the number of positive-definite integral binary quadratic forms of a given discriminant; 
3. Worked on uniformization theory, foundational to modern number theory;
4. Formulated theorems of class field theory, required to prove Fermat's Last Theorem in algebraic form;
5. Established an integral basis for the imaginary quadratic fields;
6. Contributed to the study of group theory;
7. Proved a theorem on the largest prime divisor of a given number; 
8. Developed a theory of the condensation of ideals in certain number fields;
9. Provided key contributions to the field of diophantine approximation.

Born 7 January 1859, Paris, France. Died 22 January 1921, Paris, France.
