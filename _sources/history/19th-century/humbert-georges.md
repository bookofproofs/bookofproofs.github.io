**Georges Humbert ** was a French mathematician who worked on geometry and hyperelliptic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His grandparents sent Georges to the Oratorian College of Juilly to become a boarder there.
* Humbert obtained a doctorate in mathematics in 1885 for his thesis Sur les courbes de genre un Ⓣ(On curves of genus one).
* Humbert married Marie Jagerschmidt in 1890 and in the following year his son Pierre was born.
* Pierre Humbert grew up to be a mathematician and has a biography in this archive.
* Georges Humbert's delight at the birth of his son was short-lived, however, for his wife died in 1892.
* Humbert married again in 1900 and with his second wife Suzanne Lambert-Caillemar had two further children.
* On the death of Hermite in 1901, Humbert was elected to fill his place in the Académie des Sciences.
* Georges Humbert would be better known today if the area of mathematics in which he worked had remained in favour.

Born 7 January 1859, Paris, France. Died 22 January 1921, Paris, France.
