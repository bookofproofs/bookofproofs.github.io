### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His grandparents sent Georges to the Oratorian College of Juilly to become a boarder there.
* Humbert obtained a doctorate in mathematics in 1885 for his thesis Sur les courbes de genre un Ⓣ(On curves of genus one).
* Pierre Humbert grew up to be a mathematician and has a biography in this archive.
* On the death of Hermite in 1901, Humbert was elected to fill his place in the Académie des Sciences.
* Georges Humbert would be better known today if the area of mathematics in which he worked had remained in favour.

Born 7 January 1859, Paris, France. Died 22 January 1921, Paris, France.
