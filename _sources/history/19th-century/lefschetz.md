**Lefschetz** was the main source of the algebraic aspects of topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a topology as one of the most influential branches of mathematics.
2. Introduced the concept of Intrinsic Dimension and the use of algebraic topology to explore a variety of geometric objects. 
3. Advanced ideas around fixed-point theorems including the Lefschetz Fixed Point Theorem and the Lefschetz Principle. 
4. Established the algebraic mapping theory and the exterior calculus approach to differential equations. 
5. Developed the k-dimensional homology theory, which occupied a large part of algebraic topology. 
6. Formulated the Relative Lefschetz theorem regarding the study of correspondence between critical points of a polynomial of two sets. 
7. Improved mathematical methods for solving partial differential equations such as the Lefschetz Alternating Method. 
8. Pioneered the use of Computational Algebraic Topology applications for data analysis and visualization tasks. 
9. Wrote the book "Algebraic Topology: An Introduction" which was groundbreaking for its time.

Born 3 September 1884, Moscow, Russia. Died 5 October 1972, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
