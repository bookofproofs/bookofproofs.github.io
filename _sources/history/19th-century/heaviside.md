**Oliver Heaviside** proved important results in electromagnetism and vector calculus. He reduced Maxwell's 20 equations in 20 variables to 4 equations in 2 variables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Heaviside independently developed a method of solving equations involving operators.
2. Heaviside developed the operational calculus, an approach to solving differential equations.
3. Heaviside greatly enhanced the algebraic definitions of symmetrical functions such as Laplace transforms and vector fields.
4. Heaviside introduced the concept of impedance, which paved the way for modern power engineering.
5. Heaviside demonstrated the uniqueness of the representation of functions using a Fourier series.
6. Heaviside remodelled Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism in terms of his vector calculus.
7. Heaviside derived the power loss formula that is still used today to calculate the efficiency of long distance power transmission.
8. Heaviside applied principles of circuit analysis to create a new method of synthesising dynamical systems.
9. He introduced a novel approach to the mechanism of electromagnetic induction.
10. He developed a notion of a potential function which became fundamental to modern analysis.

Born 18 May 1850, Camden Town, London, England. Died 3 February 1925, Torquay, Devon, England.
