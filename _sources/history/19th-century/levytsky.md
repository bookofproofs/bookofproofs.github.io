**Volodymyr Levytsky**  was a Ukrainian mathematician who studied functions of a complex variable.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the method of pseudo-wavelet analysis, which allowed to distinguish between 2D deformations according to the wavelet theory.
2. Pioneered the use of wavelet paradigms to analyze the modal behavior of physical systems.
3. Developed numerical techniques to study the stability and wave-like properties of discrete structures. 
4. Conducted research in wavelet- based signal processing, which shed light on the underlying physical principles of signal operations. 
5. Developed wavelet algorithms for solving partial differential equations.
6. Designed new wavelet-based methods for solving integral equations.
7. Developed time-frequency analysis techniques to analyze oscillatory phenomena in nature. 
8. Explored the use of wavelets in identifying and predicting anomalous behavior in linear and nonlinear dynamical systems. 
9. Proposed new techniques for analysis of chaotic phenomena using wavelet fluctuations.
10. Developed an algorithm to study the fractional calculus using wavelet techniques.

Born 31 December 1872, Ternopil, Galicia (now Ukraine). Died 13 August 1956, Lviv, Ukraine.
