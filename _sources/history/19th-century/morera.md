**Giacinto Morera** was an Italian mathematician who made contributions to dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Morera extended his knowledge of mathematics, first at the University of Pavia in Italy under the direction of Eugenio Beltrami and Felice Casorati, then at the University of Pisa under the direction of Enrico Betti and Ulisse Dini, and finally in Leipzig with Adolph Mayer and Felix Klein.
* Morera studied the fundamental problems which arise in dynamics with particular regard to the use of the Pfaff method applied to Jacobian systems of partial differential equations and to the problem of Lie transformations of the canonical equations of motion.

Born 18 July 1856, Novara (now Italy). Died 8 February 1907, Turin, Italy.
