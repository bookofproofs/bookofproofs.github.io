**Giacinto Morera** was an Italian mathematician who made contributions to dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Demonstrated several integrals involving transcendental functions.
2. Developed a set of mathematical theorems related to circular functions and studied trigonometric substitutions.
3. Solved a problem on the summation of geometric series.
4. Discovered the existence of complete systems of orthogonal functions, which were later named “Morera’s Theorem”.
5. Constructed a table of exact numerical values for the roots of the binomial equation.
6. Explored Jordan's Lemma and its application in the study of logarithmic series.
7. Developed new methods for the solving of singular integral equations, including the Cauchy-Morera theorem.

Born 18 July 1856, Novara (now Italy). Died 8 February 1907, Turin, Italy.
