**Federigo Enriques** was an Italian mathematician who made important contributions to geometry and to the history and philosophy of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the School of Mathematics in Rome and transplanted the new and improved mathematics teaching method from his homeland to Italy.
2. Contributed to the development and transformation of Cartesian geometry.
3. Reintroduced the terms 'discrete' and 'continuous' into mathematical terminology.
4. Wrote several treatises on the scientific principles underlying mathematics and its teaching, making algebra and geometry easier to understand.
5. Instrumental in introducing infinite sets into the general discourse of mathematics.
6. Established a new elementary geometry theory that changed the assumptions on which Euclid's earlier theories were based.
7. Wrote on mechanics, having outlined a universal scientific method.
8. Published a treatise on quadrature which contained what is now known as the Enriques–Babbage theorem.
9. Developed a two–dimensional vector system that is still used to this day.
10. His work with the Calcolatore was an important moment in the history of computers and mechanical calculators.

Born 5 January 1871, Leghorn (now Livorno), Tuscany, Italy. Died 14 June 1946, Rome, Italy.
