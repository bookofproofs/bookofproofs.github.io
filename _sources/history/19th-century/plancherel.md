**Michel Plancherel**'s main research fields were analysis, mathematical physics and algebra.  He is best known for Plancherel's theorem in harmonic analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Plancherel formula, a fundamental result in harmonic analysis, by generalizing an earlier result of Paley and Wiener. 
2. Published three prominent papers on the theory of continuous waves, which greatly impacted the study of Fourier analysis. 
3. Developed the theory of ultra-spherical harmonics and spherical harmonics, which is used in multiple areas of mathematics and physics. 
4. Developed the Hecke-Plancherel formula, which is a powerful tool used in analytic number theory. 
5. Solved the Bochner-Lévy problem, which was a long-standing open problem concerning L2-based analytic theory of Fourier integrals.
6. Researched the theory of Banach algebras, providing many important results and influencing subsequent developments in the field. 
7. Made seminal contributions to the theory of integral equations, specifically concerning singular integral equations. 
8. Co-authored a well-known text on harmonic analysis, which is an essential reference for students studying the topic.

Born 16 January 1885, Bussy, Kanton Freiburg, Switzerland. Died 4 March 1967, Zürich, Switzerland.
