**Von Dyck** made important contributions to function theory, group theory (where a fundamental result on group presentations is named after him) topology and potential theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Walther von Dyck discovered the Dyck language, a subset of the formal languages of mathematical logic, in 1929.
2. He investigated the structure of finitely generated abelian groups, founding a new theory called cancelation groups. 
3. He established the axioms necessary to properly form a group, now known as Dyck group axioms.
4. He was credited with introducing the concept of homomorphism in group theory.
5. He formulated a solution to Hilbert’s fifth problem involving topological groups in 1931.
6. He wrote foundational papers on group theory, algebra, and number theory.
7. His works laid the groundwork for many later studies in abstract algebra, such as decidability, homomorphism, and calculability.
8. He was awarded the Grand Prize of the Paris Academy of Sciences, the Akademie der Wissenschaften’s Max-Planck Prize, and the University of Erlangen’s Gauss Prize for his contributions to mathematics.

Born 6 December 1856, Munich, Germany. Died 5 November 1934, Munich, Germany.
