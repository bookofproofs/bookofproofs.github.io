**Arthur Cayley**'s most important work was in developing the algebra of matrices and work in non-euclidean and _n_-dimensional geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Came up with the theory of matrices, greatly contributing to linear algebra.
2. Pioneered group theory and contributed to the development of invariants.
3. Established the field of combinatorics and enumerative chemistry.
4. Devised a method for the solution of cubic equations, now known as the Cayley–Hamilton Theorem.
5. Formulated, in 1856, the first version of what came to be known as the Cayley tree, a way of representing a tree graph. 
6. Discovered and developed the theory of permutation groups.
7. Developed the concept of a graph in the branch of mathematics known as graph theory. 
8. Proved the non-Euclidean nature of space.
9. Extended Boole's work, leading to the development of abstract algebra.
10. Demonstrated the existence of non-Euclidean surfaces and Euclidean models of some of them.

Born 16 August 1821, Richmond, Surrey, England. Died 26 January 1895, Cambridge, England.
