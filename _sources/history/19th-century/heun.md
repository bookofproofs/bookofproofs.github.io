**Karl Heun** was a German mathematician best known for the _Heun differential equation_ which generalises the hypergeometric differential equation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Heun's Method, a numerical method for solving nonlinear differential equations, in 1880.
2. Researched elliptic functions and complex functions as they related to group theory.
3. Developed Heun's series, an analytical approach to solving certain differential equations.
4. Contributed to the theory of linear differential equations and their applications to mathematics problems.
5. Discovered a special case of Abel's equation, now referred to as "Heun's equation," in 1890.
6. Published several papers related to potential theory, which provided a basis for theoretical physics.
7. Discovered the Heun transformation, a geometric transformation used in the study of algebraic curves.
8. Introduced the use of polynomials to solve different types of equations.
9. Developed a method of solving linear differential equations using series expansions.
10. Contributed to the study of elliptic functions and their integrals.

Born 3 April 1859, Wiesbaden, Germany. Died 10 January 1929, Karlsruhe, Germany.
