**Karl Heun** was a German mathematician best known for the _Heun differential equation_ which generalises the hypergeometric differential equation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Heun stayed in Halle only between April and October 1880, probably due to the deteriorating health of Heine who died in 1881.
* Heun then moved to England and taught for two and a half years (1883-1885) at the Public School in Uppingham.
* In 1900 Heun was honoured with the title professor, and in 1902 he was nominated as first candidate for the vacant chair in technical mechanics at Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe.
* Heun accepted this offer and stayed in Karlsruhe until his death in 1929.
* In 1883 Heun had married a widow Henriette Jatho (n√©e Bock) with two children Alfred and Paul Jatho; together they had a son Howard (1884-1902) and a daughter Charlotte (1891-1948).
* His assistants in Karlsruhe were Georg Hamel (from 1902 to 1905), Max Winkelmann (from 1905 to 1911) and Fritz Noether (from 1911 to 1918).
* Kurt von Sanden was his student from 1905 to 1909, and he became Heun's successor in 1923.
* Heun did not recover from a stroke he suffered in 1921 and retired in 1922.
* The Heun equation is a second order linear differential equation of the Fuchsian type with four singular points.

Born 3 April 1859, Wiesbaden, Germany. Died 10 January 1929, Karlsruhe, Germany.
