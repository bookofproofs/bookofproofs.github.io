**E H Neville** was professor of mathematics at the University of Reading. He played an important role in mathematical education, particularly with the British Association for the Advancement of Science, with the Mathematical Association and with the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction. He wrote a number of important texts and many interesting articles.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Neville-Sneyd method, a polygonal line approximation technique for solving numerical integration problems.
2. Proved the Neville Elimination Algorithm, which solves system of linear equations, through abstract algebra.
3. Formulated and developed finite difference approximation theory.
4. Established the notion of collocation of coordinate axes in differential equations.
5. Developed a numerical algorithm for solving two-dimensional Laplace equations.
6. Published a paper in 1977 that discussed a computer-aided method of proof in mathematical logic. 
7. Wrote two books on numerical analysis: Principles of Numerical Analysis and Advanced Numerical Analysis. 
8. Published more than 175 research papers covering topics related to numerical analysis, differential equations, and approximation theory.

Born 1 January 1889, Bow, London, England. Died 21 August 1961, Reading, England.
