**George Greenhill**  became Professor of Mathematics at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. His main work was on Elliptic Functions but he published widely on applications of mathematics to practical problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His mother was Louisa Greenhill (born in Oxford, Oxfordshire about 1811).
* George Greenhill attended Christ's Hospital School, where he was awarded a Thompson Mathematical Gold Medal, and from there he went up to St John's College, Cambridge in 1866.
* After a short time as Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Royal Indian Engineering College, Coopers Hill, Greenhill returned to Cambridge in 1873, becoming a fellow and lecturer at Emmanuel College.
* under the martial regime of Chesney, who was at that time President, Greenhill's independent spirit was ill at ease.
* In 1876 Greenhill was appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich.
* Greenhill's work was mainly on elliptic functions.
* As might be imagined given that Greenhill spent most of his life working in a military establishment, his work was often directed towards applications to ballistics and other military applications.
* An important contribution Greenhill made to the theory of elasticity was his study of the greatest length that a cylinder can have before it bends under its own weight.
* As well as his original research, Greenhill wrote several excellent texts and encyclopaedia articles.
* Greenhill received many honours for his work.

Born 29 November 1847, Twickenham, London, England. Died 10 February 1927, London, England.
