**George Greenhill**  became Professor of Mathematics at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. His main work was on Elliptic Functions but he published widely on applications of mathematics to practical problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a formulation of a solution to the general second order differential equation in 1880.
2. Made remarkable contributions to elliptic functions, spherical trigonometry and other mathematical disciplines.
3. Published papers on the numerical solution of the differential equations of mathematical physics and on the applications of algebraic operational calculi.
4. Founded the University of London Mathematical Society in 1883 and later became its first president. 
5. Wrote articles on the inverse potential problem, finite differences and calculus of variations.
6. Edited the journal Mathematical Questions with Solutions, which was published from 1877–1880.
7. Authored the book Calculus for Beginners (1885).
8. Developed the theory of hydrodynamics and mathematical problems in electricity, published in the Royal Society’s Proceedings.

Born 29 November 1847, Twickenham, London, England. Died 10 February 1927, London, England.
