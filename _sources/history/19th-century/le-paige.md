**Constantin Le Paige** was a Belgian mathematician who worked on the theory of algebraic form, especially algebraic curves and surfaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Completed a major revision of the French translation of [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621].
2. Wrote a significant number of works on geometry, including Euclid's Parallel Postulate, Apollonius's Conics, and a study of the properties of cube roots.
3. Developed a method for solving cubic equations which was used in Albert Girard's In Artem Analyticam Isagoge.
4. Constructed a new form of multiplication table which consists of all nine digits, known as the Le Paige Table.
5. Wrote several treatise on plane and solid geometry, including Treatise on the Measurement of Plane and Solid Figures and Compendium of Euclid, Archimedes, and Apollonius.
6. Contributed to the development of calculus and analytical geometry, including the use of a geometrical approach and the introduction of the concept of a chord.
7. Provided valuable insight into the history and development of algebra, including insights into the works of Diophantus of Alexandria.
8. Influenced the work of several prominent mathematicians, such as Pierre de Fermat and Isaac Newton.

Born 9 March 1852, Liège, Belgium. Died 26 January 1929, Liège, Belgium.
