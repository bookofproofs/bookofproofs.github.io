**Rudolf Wolf**  was a Swiss astronomer and mathematician best known for his research on sunspots.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Wolf number system for calculation of planetary positions.
2. Published a major work in 1848 covering the formulas for determining the orbits of the planets.
3. Dismembered the field of celestial mechanics into two distinct classes: the “general problem” and the “problem of three bodies”.
4. Published a paper in 1846 that contradicted the accepted belief that the asteroid Juno possesses a tail.
5. Developed a method of expanding functions into orthogonal series and was among the first to use the hypergeometric functions in astronomy.
6. Discovered the precession of the equinoxes.
7. Created a planetary theory of his own that discussed the potential of planets and other celestial bodies to perturb each other.
 8. Published a book in 1854 that provided detailed tables of the longitudes, latitudes, and the motions of double stars.

Born 7 July 1816, Fällanden (near Zürich), Switzerland. Died 6 December 1893, Zürich, Switzerland.
