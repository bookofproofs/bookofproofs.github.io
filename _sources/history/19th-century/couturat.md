**Louis Couturat** was a French mathematician who worked on logic and the foundations of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote Le Calcul Infinitésimal (1903), which was the first textbook ever written on differential and integral calculus.
2. Demonstrated that the logicism of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell was internally inconsistent. 
3. Contributed to the development of mathematical logic by assigning the first purely mathematical meaning to the symbolic language of logic.
4. Developed an algorithm for solving the decision problem in mathematical logic.
5. Co-authored Traité de Logique Algorithmique (1914), a comprehensive work on the foundations of logic, which included the first presentation of the modern Boolean calculus.
6. Advocated for the development of logic machines to automate the logical processes of deduction and reasoning.
7. Constructed and patented the Logique Machine for C.S Perry & Co (1910).

Born 17 January 1868, Ris-Orangis (near Paris), France. Died 3 August 1914, Between Ris-Orangis and Melun, France.
