**William P Milne** studied at Aberdeen and Cambridge universities. He taught at Clifton College and then became Professor of Mathematics at Leeds.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* William Milne was educated at Peterhead Academy and Aberdeen Grammar School before going up to Aberdeen University.
* Almost ten years after he retired, Milne published Eppie Elrick, described at the time as a new doric classic.
* However, Milne was also interested in mathematical education and published a series of papers and mathematical notes in the Mathematical Gazette.
* Milne joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in December 1910.
* Even before he was formally through the procedure of membership, his papers were being read to the Society; Triangles Triply in Perspective by Charles McLeod and William P Milne, was communicated to the meeting on Friday 10 June 1910 by A D Russell.
* At the meeting at which his membership was confirmed, on Friday 9 December 1910, Milne read the paper A harmonic property of cubic curves.
* Further papers read by Milne to the Society include: The Focal Circles of Circular Cubics  on 10 February 1911; The system of cubic curves circumscribing two triangles and a polar to them (communicated by Neil McArthur to the meeting of 10 November 1911); An easy geometrical representation of the Sextic Covariant of a Binary Quartic (communicated by Neil McArthur to the meeting of 10 November 1911); Investigations on Circular Cubics and Bi-circular Quartics on 10 May 1912; Nonagons nonuply in perspective (communicated by N McArthur on 9 May 1913); Easy Proof of von Staudt's Theorem (communicated by P Comrie on 15 January 1915); The apolar locus of two tetrads of points (communicated by P Ramsay on 12 January 1917); and The co-apolars of a cubic curve (communicated by Archibald Milne on 9 February 1917).

Born 22 May 1881, Longside, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Died 3 September 1967, Glack, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.
