**George Boole** approached logic in a new way reducing it to a simple algebra, incorporating logic into mathematics. He also worked on differential equations, the calculus of finite differences and general methods in probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered Boolean Algebra, a branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values true and false.
2. Developed a mathematical system of logic, now known as Boolean logic, and established its principles.
3. Postulated that equations can be used to express logical relationships, resulting in what is now known as Boolean algebra.
4. Developed a symbolic notation and system of mathematical logic for logical operations such as negation and disjunction.
5. Demonstrated that the operations of algebra can be expressed and manipulated in terms of a binary system of just two values (true or false).
6. Established that algebraic laws can be applied to the logical operations of binary numbers, which is the foundation of digital computing.
7. Revolutionized how people think about the boundaries of mathematics and logic, emphasizing that their principles are applicable to any branch of knowledge.
8. Wrote a book called An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, on Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities.

Born 2 November 1815, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England. Died 8 December 1864, Ballintemple, County Cork, Ireland.
