**Leopold Gegenbauer** was an Austrian mathematician who gave his name to a sequence of orthogonal polynomials.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a notion of holomorphic functions in higher-dimensional spaces.
2. Founded the field of non-Euclidean geometry with the Beltrami–Klein model.
3. Discovered a new approach to the study of analytic functions.
4.Proved several theorems on trigonometric series.
5. Published important works on integral equations, singular integrals and representations of functions.
6. Developed new aspects relating to the convergence of series and integrals.
7. Published important papers on integral equations and their numerical solutions.
8. Made significant contributions to the theory of partial differential equations.
9. Established the integral equation theory for Green's functions.
10. Advanced the method of projection in function theory.

Born 2 February 1849, Asperhofen (E of Herzogenburg), Austria. Died 3 June 1903, Giesshübl, Mödling, Austria.
