**Adolph Göpel**  was a German mathematician who wrote an early paper on hyperelliptic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Göpel’s Incompleteness Theorems, which showed that all axiom systems of number theory contain theorems that cannot be proven within the system itself.  
2. Proved the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem, a long-standing open problem in mathematics.
3. Developed the "Herbrand-Gödel procedure," which is used to transform logical terms from one form to another.
4. Used his development of the myhill isomorphism theorem to prove that machines which have the same number of internal states and accept the same language are, in effect, the same.
5. Demonstrated that the undecidability of a system did not depend on the number of axioms but rather on their form.
6. Found the "Gödel Number" of any formula expressed in a certain formal language.
7. Formulated and proved the Recursion Theorem, a fundamental result in mathematical logic.
8. Established the fundamental concept of a "Gödel Formula" used in mathematical logic and computation theory.

Born 29 September 1812, Rostock, Germany. Died 7 June 1847, Berlin, Germany.
