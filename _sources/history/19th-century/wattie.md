**James Wattie** studied at Aberdeen and Oxford. He taught for a while at George Watson's College in Edinburgh and the Church of Scotland Training College in Aberdeen before becoming a Schools Inspector.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Adapting Thomas Newcomenâ€™s atmospheric steam engine to create a more efficient steam engine used in factories.
2. Being instrumental in developing the science of thermodynamics.
3. Pioneering new methods of using steam to reduce the effort needed to power machines.
4. Introducing the concept of latent heat, or the heat of transformation.
5. Developing equations connecting the conservation of energy, work, and heat.
6. Establishing the relationship between pressure, temperature, and volume in gases.
7. Demonstrating the application of thermodynamics to steam engines.

Born 17 November 1862, Aberdeen, Scotland. Died 6 January 1943, Glasgow, Scotland.
