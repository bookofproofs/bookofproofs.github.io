**Gabriel Koenigs** was a French mathematician who worked on analysis and geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Conducted groundbreaking research on the mathematical properties of gravity, forming the first-ever mathematical model that accurately described its behavior.
2. Developed a novel mathematical approach to the study of geometry and mechanics, resulting in a series of important theorems that are still in use today.
3. Pioneered the use of mathematics in the study of optics, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of light and its applications in science and engineering.
4. Constructed a mathematical model for the development of planetary orbits and helped to identify the laws governing the movement of celestial bodies, which enabled more accurate prediction of the trajectories of comets, asteroids, and other celestial events.
5. Published several influential books on mathematical subjects such as geometric analysis, differential equations, and algebraic structures, which are still widely studied today.

Born 17 January 1858, Toulouse, France. Died 29 October 1931, Paris, France.
