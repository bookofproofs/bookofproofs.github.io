**Minkowski** developed a new view of space and time and laid the mathematical foundation of the theory of relativity. He developed [Spacetime diagrams][bookofproofs$6307].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Minkowski developed the theory of quadratic forms and published a two-volume treatise on the subject in 1896. 
2. He also developed the theory of Minkowski spaces, now a fundamental tool in the mathematics of general relativity. 
3. He was the first mathematician to recognize the importance of four-dimensional space-time, and is credited with coining the term 'space-time' in 1908. 
4. Minkowski introduced important notions into potential theory, including the use of the Hilbert space, and he discovered and proved the Minkowski inequality. 
5. He studied the theory of absolutely convergent Fourier series, and is responsible for the concept of 'Minkowski's inequality'. 
6. He developed a new approach to the mathematical model of curves and surfaces, which are now called Minkowski's Theorem. 
7. In addition to his mathematical achievements, Minkowski was one of the first people to recognize that Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity could be understood geometrically in four-dimensional space-time.

Born 22 June 1864, Alexotas, Russian Empire (now Lithuania). Died 12 January 1909, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany.
