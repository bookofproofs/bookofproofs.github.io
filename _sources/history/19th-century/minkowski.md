**Minkowski** developed a new view of space and time and laid the mathematical foundation of the theory of relativity. He developed [Spacetime diagrams][bookofproofs$6307].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Hermann was his parents' third son.
* Hermann's oldest brother Max (1844-1930) took over the family business, but he was also an art collector and the French consul in Königsberg.
* The second brother Oskar (1858-1931) was a physician, best known for his work on diabetes, and father of astrophysicist Rudolph Minkowski (1895-1976).
* Apart from Max and Oskar, Minkowski also had an older sister, Fanny (1863-1954) and a younger brother, Toby (1873-1906).
* Lewin and Rachel Minkowski were Germans although their son Hermann was born while they were living in Russia.
* When Hermann was eight years old the family returned to Germany and settled in Königsberg where Lewin Minkowski conducted his business.
* Minkowski first showed his talent for mathematics while studying at the Gymnasium in Königsberg.
* His became close friends with Hilbert while at Königsberg, for Hilbert was an undergraduate at the same time as Minkowski.
* The student Minkowski soon became close friends with the newly appointed academic Hurwitz.
* He received his doctorate in 1885 from Königsberg for a thesis entitled Untersuchungen über quadratische Formen, Bestimmung der Anzahl verschiedener Formen, welche ein gegebenes Genus enthält Ⓣ(Studies on square shapes, determining the number of different forms, containing a given genus) Minkowski became interested in quadratic forms early in his university studies.
* Minkowski, although only eighteen years old at the time, reconstructed Eisenstein's theory of quadratic forms and produced a beautiful solution to the Grand Prix problem.
* The decision was that the prize be shared between Minkowski and Smith but this was a stunning beginning to Minkowski's mathematical career.
* On 2 April 1883 the Academy granted the Grand Prize in Mathematics jointly to the young Minkowski at the start of his career and the elderly Smith at the end of his.
* Minkowski's doctoral thesis, submitted in 1885, was a continuation of this prize winning work involving his natural definition of the genus of a form.
* In 1887, a professorship became vacant at the University of Bonn, and Minkowski applied for that position; according to the regulations of German universities, he had to submit orally to the faculty an original paper, as an Habilitationsschrift.
* Minkowski taught at Bonn from 1887, being promoted to assistant professor in 1892.
* Minkowski married Auguste Adler in Strasbourg in 1897; they had two daughters, Lily born in 1898 and Ruth born in 1902.
* The family left Zürich in the year that their second daughter was born for Minkowski accepted a chair at the University of Göttingen in 1902.
* It was Hilbert who arranged for the chair to be created specially for Minkowski and he held it for the rest of his life.
* Minkowski developed a new view of space and time and laid the mathematical foundation of the theory of relativity.
* By 1907 Minkowski realised that the work of Lorentz and Einstein could be best understood in a non-euclidean space.
* Minkowski worked out a four-dimensional treatment of electrodynamics.
* In a paper published in 1908 Minkowski reformulated Einstein's 1905 paper by introducing the four-dimensional (space-time) non-Euclidean geometry, a step which Einstein did not think much of at the time.
* But more important is the attitude or philosophy that Minkowski, Hilbert - with whom Minkowski worked for a few years - Felix Klein and Hermann Weyl pursued, namely, that purely mathematical considerations, including harmony and elegance of ideas, should dominate in embracing new physical facts.
* In this view Minkowski followed Poincaré whose philosophy was that mathematical physics, as opposed to theoretical physics, can furnish new physical principles.
* A main motive behind this change was the influence of two prominent German mathematicians: David Hilbert and Hermann Minkowski.
* We have mentioned several times in this biography that Minkowski and Hilbert were close friends.
* Less well known is the fact that Minkowski actually suggested to Hilbert what he should take as the theme for his famous 1900 lecture in Paris.
* Minkowski also offered to give a talk himself in one of the section meetings, but for reasons that are not explained in the minutes he did not after all.
* Minkowski's original mathematical interests were in pure mathematics and he spent much of his time investigating quadratic forms and continued fractions.
* Minkowski published Diophantische Approximationen: Eine Einführung in die Zahlentheorie Ⓣ(Diophantine approximations: An Introduction to Number Theory) in 1907.
* At the young age of 44, Minkowski died suddenly from a ruptured appendix.

Born 22 June 1864, Alexotas, Russian Empire (now Lithuania). Died 12 January 1909, Göttingen, Germany.
