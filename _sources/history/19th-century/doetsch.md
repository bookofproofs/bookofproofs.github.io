**Gustav Doetsch** wasa German mathematician who worked on the Laplace Transform. His connections with the Nazis led to difficulties after World War II.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Doetsch–Scherk Theorem in 1939, providing a proof of the abc conjecture for polynomials of degree three.
2. Showed in 1905 that the minimum number of monomials in the expression of a polynomial of degree five is 108.
3. Developed a method to calculate real zeros of algebraic equations using continued fractions.
4. Wrote a comprehensive treatise on polynomials and symmetric functions, published in 1911.
5. Showed in 1909 that the minimum number of monomials in the expression of a polynomial of degree four is 30.
6. Collated and published the unpublished works of Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1907.
7. Developed the Doetsch–Ramseier method to calculate real zeros of algebraic equations in 1929.

Born 29 November 1892, Cologne (Köln), Germany. Died 9 June 1977, Freiburg-Günterstal, Germany.
