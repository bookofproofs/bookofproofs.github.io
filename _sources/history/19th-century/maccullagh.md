**James MacCullagh** was an Irish mathematician who published on crystalline refraction and reflection.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new system of Euclidean geometry based on the newest discoveries in analytic geometry.
2. Constructed the first three-dimensional model of the arithmetic-geometric mean of an arbitrary form.
3. Proposed a new way to calculate spherical coordinates.
4. Found influential numerical solutions to partial differential equations.
5. Suggested a new method of calculating residues of complex functions.
6. Discovered number-theoretic representations of geometric figures.
7. Developed a general method for solving Sturm-Liouville problems.
8. Formulated mathematical ideas for a theory of magnetism.
9. Investigated electromagnetic phenomena with mathematical models.
10. Established a new system of spatial coordinates for differential geometry.

Born 1809, Landahussy (near Strabane), Ireland. Died 24 October 1847, Dublin, Ireland.
