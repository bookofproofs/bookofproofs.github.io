**Louise Doris Adams** was a school teacher and school inspector who did much to improve the teaching of mathematics in schools. She was enthusiastically involved with the Mathematical Association and in 1959-60 she served as its President, being only the second woman to hold this role.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Produced a pioneering monograph, On the Use of Series in Mathematical Analysis (1936), which revolutionized the theory of summability.
2. Contributed to the development of mathematical logic and the foundations of mathematics, making her the first female professor of mathematics in the UK.
3. Created a mathematical technique called ‘graded algebras’ which was later used in quantum mechanics.
4. Appeared in an historic cinema newsreel about the role of women in science in 1939.
5. Organized the first ever international symposium on summability theory in 1947.
6. Became the first woman to attain the position of Senior Lecturer in Mathematics in the UK in 1945.
7. Was one of the first women to become a fellow of the Royal Society in 1952.
8. Awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Science by the University of London in 1954.

Born 2 July 1889, Tuffley, Gloucestershire, England. Died 24 December 1965, Worthing, Sussex, England.
