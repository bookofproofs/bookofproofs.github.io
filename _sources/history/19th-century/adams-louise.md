**Louise Doris Adams** was a school teacher and school inspector who did much to improve the teaching of mathematics in schools. She was enthusiastically involved with the Mathematical Association and in 1959-60 she served as its President, being only the second woman to hold this role.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We note right at the beginning of this biography that she sometimes used the name Louise Adams, sometimes Doris Adams and sometimes L D Adams.
* William Adams was born in Birmingham, Warwickshire, and married Sarah Louisa Cotterell (1848-1874) on 4 December 1873 in Gloucester, Gloucestershire.
* William and Sarah had a son Harold Cotterell Adams (1874-1964) born on 18 October 1874 but sadly Sarah Adams died on 9 November 1874 so it must have been due to complications following child birth.
* William Adams married Caroline Evans (1862-1924) on 10 February 1885 at Wycliffe Church, Leicester, Leicestershire.
* William and Caroline Adams had two children, Arthur B Adams, born 1887, and Louise Doris Adams, the subject of this biography.
* William Adams gives his occupation as Foreign Timber Merchant and the family have three servants, a cook, a housemaid and a nurse.
* Louise Doris Adams was educated first at Miss Reynolds school in Weymouth, Dorset.
* Doris Adams, aged 11 at the time, was the second youngest pupil, the ages of the pupils ranging from 9 to 18.
* Adams moved to the famous girls boarding school, Roedean School, near Brighton, on the south coast of England due south of London.
* On the Bedford College Entrance Form Adams' address is Woodside, Loughton, Essex.
* One of the most interesting items on Adams' Entrance Form is the names of her two referees.
* Adams' record shows that she was in the Faculty of Science and, in her first year at Bedford, 1906-07, she attended 400 hours of lectures.
* The 1911 UK Census shows Doris Adams (this is the name on the form) at the home of Arthur H D Acland in Dunkery House, Golf Road, Felixstowe.
* Adams graduated with a Second Class Honours Degree in Mathematics from the University of London in 1911.
* In 1948 Adams was the director of an in-service course for teachers which explored the applications of mathematics to a variety of topics such as astronomy, biology, geography and social sciences.
* Afterwards Miss Adams visited these teachers and her experienced appraisal of conditions and results helped to raise the status of mathematics in the schools and ensured a larger share of the annual budget for a subject until then largely regarded as non-practical.
* Miss Adams never came empty-handed and always left behind, in exchange, one might say, for the children's work she took away, a suggestion or a question, thrown out casually, but later found to be full of meaning and a source of fruitful investigation.
* This exhibition showed work quite advanced for its time and many of the ideas found there are still being put forward as "new." Miss Adams led a team of three speakers in a symposium on this exhibition.
* Adams wrote the book A Background of Primary School Mathematics which was published by Oxford University Press in 1953.
* Miss Adams tells stories of some eighty individual children, of all ages from two to twelve, observed in their homes, in school, or in chance meeting in train or bus; she describes work seen in progress in about fifteen classes and she suggests other ways in which primary school mathematics may be linked with the children's experience.
* As old age approached, Adams continued to actively and enthusiastically support the West Country group of the Association as well as travelling with some of the members to London to chair meetings of Mathematical Association committees.
* Miss Adams drove her committee hard, particularly those within telephoning distance, who might be roused at an early hour to hear of a new idea.

Born 2 July 1889, Tuffley, Gloucestershire, England. Died 24 December 1965, Worthing, Sussex, England.
