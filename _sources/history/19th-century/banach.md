**Banach** founded modern functional analysis and made major contributions to the theory of topological vector spaces. In addition, he contributed to measure theory, integration, and orthogonal series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He helped lay the foundations of functional analysis, a branch of mathematics dealing with linear operators and spaces of functions. 
2. He developed aversion of the Hahn-Banach theorem, which states that every linear functional on a normed vector space can be bounded by a real number. 
3. He was co-founder of the Lwów School of Mathematics, a research center dedicated to mathematical research in Lvov, Poland. 
4. He formulated the fundamental theorem of calculus, which is a cornerstone in the field of real analysis. 
5. He developed the Banach-Tarski paradox, a striking example of how moving a single object can create two different objects with an equal volume.
6. He introduced the concept of a Banach space, a space where all the norms are continuous. This is a fundamental concept in the theory of topological vector spaces. 
7. He was a leader in the establishment of measure theory, which studies how sets of real numbers are turned into measurable sets. 
8. He was a major contributor to the integration theory and also formulated an integral that extended the notion of the definite integral. 
9. He helped pave the way for modern analysis, introducing the idea of a normed algebra, a basic concept in algebraic topology.

Born 30 March 1892, Kraków, Austrian Empire (now Poland). Died 31 August 1945, Lvov, (now Lviv, Ukraine).
