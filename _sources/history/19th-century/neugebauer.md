**Otto Neugebauer** was an Austrian mathematician who made important contributions to the history of ancient mathematics and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the field of study concerning the history of ancient mathematics, known as the “History of Ancient Mathematical Science”.
2. Investigated and reconstructed Babylonian algorithms, leading to a deeper understanding of Babylonian mathematics and astronomy.
3. Credited with giving an accurate history of ancient astronomic science and its interactions with mathematics.
4. Transformed the study of Ancient Egyptian mathematics by both his meticulous examination of mathematical papyri and his ability to put into context the work of the ancient Egyptians.
5. Pioneered textual criticism and analysis of Babylonian mathematical astronomical texts.
6. Established an analytical system used to accurately categorize and assign meaning to ancient mathematical texts.
7. Published the book “The Exact Sciences in Antiquity”, providing a comprehensive survey of ancient mathematical and astronomical practices up to the time of the Renaissance.
8. Wrote widely-respected papers describing the mathematics behind the Pythagorean theorem, the 3:4:5 triangle, and other geometric relationships.
9. Published the book “The Fundamental Principles of Inopportune Theory of the Babylonians”, providing a comprehensive description and analysis of ancient Babylonian mathematics and astronomy.
10. Contributed to the development of the five-year mathematical plan, a system used to organize teaching and research in mathematics.

Born 26 May1899, Innsbruck, Austria. Died 19 February 1990, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
