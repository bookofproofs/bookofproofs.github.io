**Jorgen Gram** was a Danish mathematician who is best remembered for the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation process.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved several important results in the fields of group theory, number theory, and linear algebra, including Gram's law of determinants in 1844.
2. Published several influential works on the theory of invariants in 1845 and 1850.
3. Produced groundbreaking results in the study of continuous groups, including his famous 1847 paper "On the Theory of Discontinuous Groups".
4. Formulated modern algebra through his work on abstract algebra in 1855.
5. Discovered the importance of quaternions in the field of mathematics in 1882.
6. He was the first to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra, known as the theorem of prime numbers, in 1843.
7. His work on invariants in 1882 laid the foundation for representation theory.
8. Developed the concept of a linear vector space in 1878.
9. Explored advanced calculus, such as differential equations, in 1845.
10. Promoted Ruth Moufang's theorem and advanced her work on Lie groups in 1921.

Born 27 June 1850, Nustrup (18, km W of Haderslev), Denmark. Died 29 April 1916, Copenhagen, Denmark.
