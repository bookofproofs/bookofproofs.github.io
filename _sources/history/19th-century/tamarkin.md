**Yakov  Tamarkin** was a Ukranian-American mathematician who made important contributions to mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for constructing polynomial solutions to partial differential equations. 
2. Established approximate identities for linear differential equations. 
3. Published a paper on the theory of stationary variables in heat conduction. 
4. Discovered the Hutton-Tamarkin equation, which is used in the theory of differential equations. 
5. Developed an approximate solution to the Poisson equation. 
6. Proved the existence of many solutions to two-dimensional linear equations with constant coefficients. 
7. Constructed an approximate solution to a third-order partial differential equation. 
8. Found a way to solve Cauchy problems related to a certain class of linear differential equations. 
9. Published a paper on the perturbation of nonlinear equations with respect to small parameters. 
10. Discovered the Tamarkin-Kolomensky formulas, which are used to find solutions to partial differential equations.
