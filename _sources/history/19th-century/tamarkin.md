**Yakov  Tamarkin** was a Ukranian-American mathematician who made important contributions to mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father, David Tamarkin, was a doctor, and his mother was Sophie Krassilschikov.
* The family moved to St Petersburg where Tamarkin attended the Second Gymnasium.
* Tamarkin was in the same class at the Second Gymnasium as Alexander Friedmann and the two became very close friends.
* Smirnov was also a pupil at the Second Gymnasium and was one year older than Tamarkin and Friedmann.
* In each class Tamarkin and Friedmann performed brilliantly and from the fifth form onwards they concentrated hard on their mathematical studies.
* One amusing fact which the school records show is that Tamarkin was often late for school.
* In 1905 Tamarkin and Friedmann wrote a paper on Bernoulli numbers which they submitted to Hilbert for publication in Mathematische Annalen.
* The year 1905 was not only one of great scientific importance for Tamarkin, it was also one where he became extremely active politically.
* Tamarkin graduated from the Second Gymnasium in 1906 with a gold medal and entered the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of the University of St Petersburg in August of that year.
* Tamarkin maintained his close friendship and academic collaboration with Friedmann and by 1908 the two were attending lectures by Steklov on partial differential equations.
* In April 1909 Steklov set Tamarkin a project.
* Tamarkin graduated in 1910 with the equivalent to a Master's degree, then remained at St Petersburg to prepare for the position of professor of mathematics.
* For his Magister degree, Tamarkin had to both take examinations and also to write a thesis.
* As well as teaching at the University, Tamarkin taught at two other institutions in St Petersburg, namely the Electro-Technical School and the School of Communications.
* In 1919 Tamarkin married Helen Weichart; they had one son.
* Friedmann and Besicovitch had worked there through the difficult times and in late 1919 Tamarkin went there too.
* Both Friedmann and Besicovitch returned to Petrograd (as St Petersburg was then called) but Tamarkin spent two years at Perm until 1922 both as professor and dean of the university.
* In 1927 Tamarkin was appointed to Brown University where he remained for the rest of his career.
* Not only did Tamarkin publish in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society and in the Annals of Mathematics but he also was an editor of these two journals; the first from 1927 to 1936, and the second from 1928 to 1939.
* Tamarkin published a series of papers written jointly with Hille between 1932 and 1934.
* In 1945 when he was 56 years old, Tamarkin suffered a heart attack.

Born 11 July 1888, Chernigov, Ukraine. Died 18 November 1945, Washington, D.C., USA.
