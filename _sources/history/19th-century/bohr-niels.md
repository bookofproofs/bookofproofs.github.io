**Niels Bohr** is best known for the investigations of atomic structure and also for work on radiation, which won him the 1922 Nobel Prize for physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Niels Bohr developed the first atomic model, which served as the foundation for modern quantum mechanics.
2. Niels Bohr made several groundbreaking mathematical calculations in the field of atomic physics, such as the black body radiation formula and the Balmer series formula. 
3. He also provided important insights into the structure of elemental matter, which had implications on mathematics related to the field.
4. Niels Bohr also developed a mathematical model of atomic structure, which is now known as the Bohr model.

Born 7 October 1885, Copenhagen, Denmark. Died 18 November 1962, Copenhagen, Denmark.
