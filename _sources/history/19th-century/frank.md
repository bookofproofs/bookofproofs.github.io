**Philipp Frank** was an Austrian-born physicist, mathematician and philosopher who moved to America.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the construction of modern axiomatic theories of Euclidean geometry. 
2. Developed a new approach to non-Euclidean geometry. 
3. Was a leading figure in the field of mathematical philosophy, writing several influential books on the philosophy of science. 
4. Developed groundbreaking theories of the calculus of variations and partial differential equations. 
5. Developed the classic approach to probability theory published in his founding textbook on the topic. 
6. Founded the original theory of group theory as an algebraic structure. 
7. Proposed an alternative and controversial theory of physics, in which Newton's law of gravity is replaced with an alternative equation. 
8. Provided the first rigorous definition of a continuous function. 
9. Developed a novel approach to the geometry of convex sets. 
10. Was one of the first to realize the importance of the axiom of choice.

Born 20 March 1884, Vienna, Austria. Died 21 July 1966, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
