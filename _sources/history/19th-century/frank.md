**Philipp Frank** was an Austrian-born physicist, mathematician and philosopher who moved to America.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Philipp studied physics at the University of Vienna obtaining a doctorate in theoretical physics in 1907 after working under Boltzmann.
* The group of students that Frank is describing in this quotation is the group who would eventually become known as the Vienna Circle.
* During this time Frank became a friend of von Mises, who obtained his doctorate from Vienna in the 1907, the same year as Frank.
* In 1907 Frank wrote an important paper on causality.
* Einstein was impressed by Frank's ideas which he put forward in this paper and the resulting discussions led to another life long friendship, this time between Frank and Einstein.
* Frank received his habilitation and was appointed a lecturer in the University of Vienna in 1910.
* On Einstein's recommendation Frank succeeded him to the chair of theoretical physics in the German University of Prague in 1912.
* Frank, Hahn and von Mises became part of the somewhat larger group active during the 1920s in the Vienna Circle of Logical Positivists.
* The friendship between Frank and von Mises developed into a collaboration in the mid 1920s.
* Frank remained at the German University in Prague until 1938.
* Political pressure was put on Frank and other members of the Vienna Circle, and the group disbanded with many of its members including Frank fleeing to the United States.
* In the United States Frank was first appointed as a visiting lecturer, then made a lecturer in physics and mathematics at Harvard.
* In 1947 Frank wrote an excellent biography Einstein: His Life and Times.
* Frank worked on a wide range of topics in mathematics, and when one takes into account his publications on physics and philosophy it was a truly remarkable breadth.

Born 20 March 1884, Vienna, Austria. Died 21 July 1966, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
