**Eduard Wiltheiss** was a German mathematician who made major contributions to the theory of abelian functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father was Johann Georg Wiltheiss, a book binder, and his mother was Elisabeth Mohr.
* The family were members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, and Eduard was baptized into this church.
* In April 1874, immediately following his Abitur examinations, Wiltheiss entered the University of Giessen to study mathematics.
* However Gordan had undertaken research on abelian functions before becoming fascinated by invariant theory, and Wiltheiss went on to undertake research on that topic, making a major contribution to the theory of abelian functions.
* From Giessen Wiltheiss went to Berlin in 1876 to continue his mathematical studies.
* On 25 April 1881 Wiltheiss presented his habilitation thesis Bestimmung Abelscher Funktionen mit zwei Argumenten, bei denen complexe Multiplikationen stattfinden â“‰(Determination of Abelian functions with two arguments, where complex multiplications take place)  to the University of Halle and became a privatdozent there.
* In November 1886, after five years as a privatdozent, Wiltheiss was appointed as an extraordinary Professor of Mathematics in Halle.
* Wiltheiss was a founder member of the German Mathematical Society along with his colleague at Halle Hermann Wiener, as were Cantor, Gordan, Hilbert, Klein, Minkowski, Study and Heinrich Weber who all gave lectures at the Bremen meeting.
* The research which Wiltheiss carried out was mostly in the area of abelian functions, in particular studying hyperelliptic functions and theta functions.
* Wiltheiss predominantly lectured to students who were beginning their studies, on topics such as differential and integral calculus, geometry, and algebra.
* At the end of May Wiltheiss underwent an operation in Jena but sadly it was not successful.

Born 12 June 1855, Worms, Germany. Died 7 July 1900, Halle, Germany.
