**Gustave Dumas**  was a Swiss mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Dumas attended secondary school in Lausanne; after having completed his baccalaureate he stayed there to study mathematics at the university.
* Dumas then went to Berlin for some months, where he attended lectures by Georg Frobenius, Hermann Schwarz and Kurt Hensel.
* Dumas taught higher mathematics as a Privatdozent at the Polytechnic; he was promoted to Titularprofessor in 1913.
* Dumas stayed at his alma mater until he retired in 1942, teaching mainly differential and integral calculus to future engineers and mathematicians.
* Among his students was Georges de Rham, who became Dumas's assistant in the mid-1920s.
* In addition, Dumas wrote a couple of papers on technical education in the French-speaking part of Switzerland.
* Dumas joined the organising committee of the first International Congress of Mathematicians at the preliminary meeting in July 1896, as the French-speaking secretary.
* Rudio and Franel, the two general secretaries at the congress, also had their personal secretaries, Hirsch and Dumas.
* It can be assumed that Dumas, as the native French speaker, was Franel's secretary.
* Dumas did not give a talk at the congress, but he was among the signatories of the invitations.
* Dumas attended more ICMs than most of his colleagues on the organising ccommittee.
* Dumas also served on the organising committee of the 1932 congress in ZÃ¼rich.
* Dumas became a member of the Swiss Mathematical Society (Schweizerische Mathematische Gesellschaft: SMG) when it was founded in 1910.
* Furthermore, Dumas was a member of the Euler-Kommission from 1919- 1943.
* Apart from mathematics and education, Dumas also had a strong interest in literature and philosophy.

Born 5 March 1872, L'Etivaz, Vaud canton, Switzerland. Died 11 July 1955, Lausanne, Switzerland.
