**Gustave Dumas**  was a Swiss mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed theorem on the harmonic mean of two triangles.
2. Developed Dumas' theorem which described the conditions under which a linear operator is bounded.
3. Published his work on the concept of fractional derivatives for differential equations.
4. Developed a unified concept of abstract algebra and abstract analysis.
5. Represented France at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1904 and 1908.
6. Authored the treatise ‘Geometry of Polynomials: Theory and Problems’ in 1901.
7. His teachings inspired the mathematization of economics that brought the concept of Cobb-Douglas Production Function in 1934.
8. Contributed to the field of linear algebra and multi-dimensional analysis.
9. Provided an early proof of unimodality in mathematical analysis.
10. Proposed the idea of associativity and commutativity in group theory.

Born 5 March 1872, L'Etivaz, Vaud canton, Switzerland. Died 11 July 1955, Lausanne, Switzerland.
