**Douglas Hartree** was an English mathematician and physicist who worked in numerical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the electronic numerical analysis in the 1930s, utilizing the differential analyser, an analog computer based on mechanical components.
2. Developed the Hartree Approximation, a mathematical method for solving equations.
3. Used the newly developed Monte Carlo Method to predict atomic wavefunctions for multi-electron atoms in 1929. 
4. Devised an algorithm for differentiating between wave functions in the Hartree method. 
5. Solved the wave equation for the planetary model of an atom.
6. Developed a relativistic wave equation for the Hamiltonian matrix of an atom.
7. Developed an equation based on oscillator theory to predict the optical properties of molecules. 
8. Made contributions to the principles of quantum mechanics.
9. Assisted in operational research during the Second World War.
10. Spearheaded the development of the Manchester Mark I, the first stored-program digital computer in Britain.

Born 27 March 1897, Cambridge, England. Died 12 February 1958, Cambridge, England.
