### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the first proof of the subgroup theorem in group theory in 1889.
2. Developed an algebraic approach to the theory of groups in 1890–91.
3. Developed a functional calculus based on a formal power series in 1895.
4. Published significant works on the theory of invariant systems and algebras in 1896 and 1898.
5. Contributed to the development of non-associative algebra in 1910.
6. Contributed to the foundations of general topology in 1918.
7. Published the first book on Lie algebras in 1922.
8. Developed theories for special functions in mathematics in 1922.
9. Developed the theory of homogeneous algebraic system in 1925.
10. Investigated a variety of mathematical topics, including fixed point theorems, algebraic geometries, and hyper-complex numbers, in the 1930s.
