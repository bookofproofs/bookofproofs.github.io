**Stanisław Lesniewski** was a Russian-born mathemtician who was one of the founders of the Polish school of logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Propositional Calculus, which is an axiomatic system for logic. 
2. Developed a three-valued logic based on his calculus.
3. Introduced the notion of domains to serve as a foundation of mathematics.
4. Discovered the implications of propositional logic with respect to truth and grounding.
5. Put forth a late conventionalist approach to mathematics, claiming that the foundations of mathematics should be based on definitions and conventions.
6. Established the category of Western ontology, which is based on the idea of ontological relativehood.
7. Developed the logic of partial terms, which allowed for the expression of incomplete objects to be expressed through propositions.
8. Founded the school of thought known as Lvov-Warsaw School, which was based on his classification theory.

Born 30 March 1886, Serpukhov (near Ivanovo-Vosniesiensk), Russia. Died 13 May1939, Warsaw, Poland.
