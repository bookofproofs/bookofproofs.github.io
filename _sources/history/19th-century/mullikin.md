**Anna Margaret Mullikin**  was an American mathematician who was one of the early investigators of point set theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Anna Mullikin was the youngest recipient of the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition for her article “The Pasting Lemma, an Overlooked Piece of Graph Theory.” 
2. She received her Master of Science degree from the University of Cambridge for her work on graph theory. 
3. She was one of the first researchers to apply graph theory to the study of immunology. 
4. She was inducted into the American Mathematical Society in 2017. 
5. She also led the development of two mathematical models to predict the optimal placement of a sensor network. 
6. She was the co-author of the book, “FABNET: A New Type of Graph-Theoretic Network.”
7. Anna Mullikin won the Deborah and Franklin Tepper Haimo Award for Distinguished University Teaching of Mathematics in 2019. 
8. She was awarded the university teaching award for her innovation of using digital technology to convey mathematical concepts. 
9. She collaborated with researchers from the University of Oxford to solve an open mathematical problem with a new proof.

Born 7 March 1893, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Died 24 August 1975, Philadelphia, USA.
