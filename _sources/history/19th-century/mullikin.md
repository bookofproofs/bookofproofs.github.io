**Anna Margaret Mullikin**  was an American mathematician who was one of the early investigators of point set theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Anna's brother, Richard Nicholas, was awarded an A.B. and a Ph.D. in chemistry from Johns Hopkins University after which he worked as a chemist for the Dupont Corporation.
* Anna Mullikin taught mathematics first at Science Hill School in Shelbyville, Kentucky, taking up the appointment in 1915 following her graduation.
* On 25 October 1919 Robert Moore read a paper by Mullikin to a meeting of the American Mathematical Society held at Columbia University.
* He arranged a position for Mullikin as an Instructor at the University of Texas for the session 1920-21.
* The American Mathematical Society met again at Columbia University on 28 December 1920 and Mullikin, now at the University of Texas in Austin, attended the meeting and gave a lecture on Certain theorems concerning connected point sets.
* On 26 February 1921 the American Mathematical Society met again at Columbia University but this time neither Mullikin nor Robert Moore attended.
* However Mullikin's paper A necessary and sufficient condition that the sum of two bounded, closed and connected point sets should disconnect the plane was read to the Society by title.
* It is clear that by this stage Mullikin had proved all the results which she would include in her thesis.
* Leaving Austin, Mullikin returned to the University of Pennsylvania after teaching for a year at the University of Texas.
* Although Robert Moore was now at the University of Texas he continued to be Mullikin's thesis advisor.
* We note that the Transactions had a policy not to publish doctoral theses so it is a tribute to the quality and importance of Mullikin's work that they agreed publication.
* Zygmunt Janiszewski, who died in January 1920, had proved similar results to Mullikin although her work was completely independent of his.
* Mullikin's results have been highly significant in the development of the subject.
* In 1922-23 Mullikin taught at the William Penn High School for Girls in Philadelphia after which she was appointed to Germantown High School.
* Towards the end of her teaching career, Mullikin collaborated with Ethel L Grove, who had taught at Cuyahoga Heights High School in Cleveland, and Ewart L Grove, who taught at the University of Alabama, in writing textbooks.
* As a high-school teacher Mullikin served as an excellent mentor and role model for all her students during a 40-year teaching career.
* As a person Miss Mullikin was generous of spirit and purse, leaving a financial legacy which continues to benefit humanity.

Born 7 March 1893, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Died 24 August 1975, Philadelphia, USA.
