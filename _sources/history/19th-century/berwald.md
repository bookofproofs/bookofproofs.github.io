**Ludwig Berwald** was a Czech mathematician who made important contributions to differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Max and Friedericke had there children; Ludwig had one brother and one sister.
* Ludwig entered the Graben Gymnasium, previously called the Imperial Royal State High School of Prague, in 1893.
* Around 1900 Max Berwald sold his bookshop in Prague and moved with his family to Munich.
* There Ludwig continued his education at the Luitpold Gymnasium, completing his school education in 1902.
* He entered the Royal Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich in the Fall of 1892, where he pursued his studies in mathematics and physics.
* After the award of the doctorate, Berwald was appointed as assistant to Heinrich Burkhardt.
* This should have presented Berwald with the opportunity to work on his habilitation thesis so that he could become a privatdozent in Munich, but sadly he had rather severe health problems.
* On 12 September 1915 Berwald married Hedwig Adler, the daughter of Friedericke and Emanuel Adler, who had also been born in Prague; she was eight years older than her husband.
* After that Berwald and his wife made many trips to Prague, and there he got to know two mathematics lecturers Gerhard Kowalewski and Georg Pick.
* With their support, Berwald became a lecturer at the German University in Prague.
* After Pick retired in 1929, Berwald became Head of the Mathematics Department.
* Berwald was tall and slender in statue.
* As a result of his early serious illness Berwald was very prone to colds.
* Berwald was an excellent pianist and also played chamber music with a certain well-ordered regularity that enabled him to study a broad range of musical literature together with his fellow musicians, among them Professor Pick who played the violin.
* One could make Berwald very happy if one turned the conversation to his Dalmatian trips - how he loved the hot sun of this stony country.
* Berwald's scientific work was mainly in the area of differential geometry.
* Many people working in Finsler geometry consider that Ludwig Berwald is the founder of Finsler geometry.
* Berwald and E Cartan developed a general theory of two-dimensional Finsler spaces.
* Berwald wrote a series of major papers On Finsler and Cartan geometries.
* On 22 October 1941, Berwald's scientific work came to a close.
* Hedwig Berwald died on 27 March 1942; the cause of death was given as blocked arteries.
* Ludwig Berwald died a few weeks later on 20 April; the cause of death was given as intestinal catarrh and heart failure.

Born 8 December 1883, Prague, Bohemia (now Czech Republic). Died 20 April 1942, Łódź, Poland.
