**Ludwig Berwald** was a Czech mathematician who made important contributions to differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the homogeneous expansion method for solving linear equations.
2. Developed the Thomae relation, which demonstrated the connection between elliptic integrals and potential theory.
3. Researched an approach to uniformizing algebraic equations, making them easier to solve.
4. Advocated for the use of differential equations in the field of differential geometry.
5. Formulated the characteristic projection theorem, an important theorem in PDE theory.
6. Found a solution to Poisson’s equation using the theory of integral equations.
7. Made contributions to Fourier analysis and its applications to the study of boundary problems.
8. Used the calculus of variations to solve mathematical problems related to economics.
9. Explored several complex variables and its applications to mathematical physics.
10. Discovered a version of the four-vertex theorem that has since been widely used.

Born 8 December 1883, Prague, Bohemia (now Czech Republic). Died 20 April 1942, Łódź, Poland.
