**Gotthold Eisenstein** worked on a variety of topics including quadratic and cubic forms, the reciprocity theorem for cubic residues, quadratic partition of prime numbers and reciprocity laws.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the law of quadratic reciprocity, which provided ways to solve certain types of polynomial equations. 
2. Proved a number of theorems related to prime numbers. 
3. Established a method for calculating the nth prime number and for many years his method served as the basis for algorithms for computing primes.
4. Conducted research into the theory of elliptic functions, and for this work was awarded the Copley medal in 1847. 
5. He introduced the Eisenstein series of modular forms.
6. Authored several books on Number Theory including his magnum opus, 'Gesammelte Werke'. 
7. Pioneered the operational calculus, an early form of mathematical analysis. 
8. Solved mathematical problems concerning permutations and combinations. 
9. Introduced the Complex Representation of Numbers, which is an early form of abstract algebra. 
10. Founded the Berlin Academy of Science and served as editor-in-chief of its journal, the 'Fortschritte der Mathematik'.

Born 16 April 1823, Berlin, Germany. Died 11 October 1852, Berlin, Germany.
