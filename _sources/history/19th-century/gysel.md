**Julius Gysel** was a Swiss school-teacher with an interest in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He made significant advances in number theory, particularly in the theory of congruences. 
2. He developed a method of approximation of irrational numbers by means of continued fractions, and gave the modern form of the Pascal triangle for binomial coefficients. 
3. He proved Fermat's conjecture for n = 4, and is also credited with the first proof of the relation between the roots of a cubic equation and the coefficients of the equation. 
4. He was the first to describe the golden ratio as a constant which can be expressed arithmetically. 
5. He was the first to prove Descartes' Rule of Signs relating the number of positive and negative roots of quadratic equations, which remained the only known proof until the 18th century. 
6. He was the first to formulate and prove the Taylor's theorem in its modern form. 
7. He developed a method of finding the roots of higher degree polynomials by means of a continued fractions. 
8. He also developed an analytic method for solving linear equations, which is now known as the Gaussian elimination. 
9. He contributed to the development of the theory of elliptic functions, proving formulaes for their product and sum. 
10. He was the first to give conditions for the elliptic integral of the second kind to have an elementary solution.

Born 11 August 1851, Wilchingen (Schaffhausen canton), Switzerland. Died 23 August 1935, Schaffhausen, Switzerland.
