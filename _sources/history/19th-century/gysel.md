**Julius Gysel** was a Swiss school-teacher with an interest in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father was Johannes Gysel (1815-1875), a council clerk; he also served as president of the town council and later on as Kantonsrat.
* Gysel grew up in his hometown with his four siblings and attended elementary school there.
* After being awarded his Matura in 1869, Gysel studied mathematics at the Polytechnic until 1872.
* Subsequently, Gysel attended mathematics lectures at the University of Bern for a year, notably those by Georg Sidler and Ludwig Schläfli.
* Whilst writing his thesis, Gysel worked as a supply teacher for mathematics at the Kantonsschule in Schaffhausen from 1872-1874.
* Gysel taught mathematics in the classical track until his retirement in 1926.
* Despite all the educational reforms since Gysel's death, his observation about the popularity of the school subject mathematics still holds true today -- surely many of today's mathematics teachers would agree with him.
* Gysel greatly influenced the school not only as a teacher, but also in his capacity as headmaster in particular.
* Gysel's passion for physics experiments and technological progress (see paragraph below) is representative of his time.
* Gysel aka  "Tschuli" was quite popular among his pupils, not only as a teacher, but also as headmaster.
* Furthermore, the dialect writer Albert Bächtold (1891-1981, also from Wilchingen) honoured Gysel's influence on his own life in his novel De Studänt Räbme Ⓣ(The student Rabne) (1947): The headmaster in the novel, called  "Vatter" ("father"), is based on Gysel.
* Throughout his life, Gysel educated himself further, both in his subjects and in educational matters.
* Gysel was also a keen member of the Naturforschende Gesellschaft Schaffhausen, his local Society for Natural Scientists, from 1876 onwards.
* Gysel became a member of the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung in 1897.
* The list of his publications comprises only seven items: apart from his doctoral thesis, Gysel published three papers on problems in geometry as part of his school's Osterprogramme: Beiträge zur analytischen Geometrie der Kurven und Flächen 2.
* On top of his school duties, Gysel took on a number of positions in various committees, which again reflect his interest in education and in technological progress.
* On 3 August 1876, Gysel married Barbara Carolina Bollinger from Schaffhausen.
* One of their sons, also called Julius (1881-1972), graduated as a mechanical engineer from the ETH in 1906 and worked for an electric power company.

Born 11 August 1851, Wilchingen (Schaffhausen canton), Switzerland. Died 23 August 1935, Schaffhausen, Switzerland.
