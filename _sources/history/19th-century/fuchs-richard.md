**Richard Fuchs** was a German mathematician who worked on differential equations and aerodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Montel–Pompeiu theorem, a groundbreaking result in complex analysis which established fundamental relationships between meromorphic functions and their derivatives. 
2. His most important works in this area include his 1951 work ‘Vorlesungen über Riemannsche Flächen’, which clarified and extended the theory of modular forms. 
3.In the 1950s, he collaborated with Alexander Grothendieck in the development of schemes and the proof of the existence of abelian varieties over a finite field. 
4. Published a number of important papers establishing a basis for the foundations of non-archimedean analysis and its applications to local function theory. 
5. Made major contributions to the theories of deformations and rigid analytic spaces. 
6. Solved the Kervaire invariant one problem, which is a topological problem related to a conjecture by John Milnor about the structure of high-dimensional spheres. 
7. Developed a theory of the underlying schemes of algebraic curves and surfaces.

Born 5 December 1873, Greifswald, Prussia now Germany. Died 28 December 1944, Bad Doberan, near Rostock, Germany.
