**Alfred Loewy** was a German mathematician who worked on linear groups, the algebraic theory of differential equations and actuarial mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed and popularized the concept of "Mean Value Theorem".
2. Established important results in the theory of elliptic and hyperelliptic functions.
3. Used complex calculus to prove the Little Fermat Theorem for polynomials with complex coefficients.
4. Proved the Lagrange inversion theorem.
5. Developed a qualitative theory of second order linear differential equations.
6. Developed existence and uniqueness theorems for systems of partial differential equations.
7. Developed Lie group theory.
8. Discovered a 36th solution to the Lagrange problem.
9. Developed fundamental results in the theory of group representations.
10. Constructed the theory of topological groups.

Born 20 June 1873, Rawitsch, Germany (now Rawicz, Poland). Died 25 January 1935, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.
