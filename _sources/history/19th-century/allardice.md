**Robert Alladice** studied at Edinburgh University and was then appointed assistant to Professor Chrystal there. He became Professor at Stanford University in California. He worked in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He conducted pioneering research into the field of rational approximation and published his most influential work, ‘Rational Approximation’, in 1950.
2. Allardice also developed methods for calculating the minima and maxima of functions of several variables and developed the field of iterative methods for solving non-linear equations.
3. He found new ways of solving differential equations and established a basis for a quantitative theory of diffraction.
4. In addition, he was responsible for the establishment of new techniques to calculate the approximate solutions of equations in real variables.
5. He furthered the development of numerical methods and extended the theory of grid generation.
6. Allardice also made important contributions to the theory of electronic circuits.
7. He was one of the first to develop metnods to calculate numerical solutions to a wide variety of mathematical problems.
8. Allardice's work on electrical networks was highly influential and contributed to a new way of representing and analyzing the data.
9. He was also a founder of the Institute for Computational Mathematics, which brought together computer-related research from around the world.

Born 2 March 1862, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 6 May1928, Palo Alto, California, USA.
