**Michele Cipolla**  was an Italian mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After two years in Pisa, Cipolla returned to Palermo where he studied for his doctorate at the university under Gabriele Torelli's supervision.
* Cipolla was awarded his doctorate from Palermo in 1902 for his thesis on asymptotic determinations of primes.
* When he had been in Pisa, Cipolla had been introduced to group theory in Bianchi's lectures.
* Although an extremely productive mathematician, in 1904 Cipolla became a secondary school teacher in Corleone, a small town about 35 km south of Palermo.
* In 1911 Cipolla was appointed as Professor of Algebraic Analysis at the University of Catania, in the town of Catania on the east coast of Sicily.
* From 1916, Cipolla was joined in Catania by Gaetano Scorza who also worked on group theory and had generalised some of Cipolla's work on finite groups to infinite groups.
* In it, Cipolla gathered the lectures on group theory and Galois theory he had given at the University of Catania in the academic years 1920-1921 and 1921-1922, and it can be considered the most complete treatise written in the Italian language on classical Galois theory.
* It was intended to be read by university students and was edited by Cipolla.
* In 1923, the year in which the third volume of his group theory treatise was published, Cipolla returned to Palermo where he was appointed as professor.
* It was first published in 1927 with a second edition in 1929, and finally a third edition appeared in 1949 after Cipolla's death.
* With his student Gaspare Mignosi (1875-1951), who worked with him in Catania and determined the fundamental subgroups of the linear projective group of dimension two over a finite field, Cipolla wrote secondary school level textbooks such as Analisi matematiche elementare Ⓣ(Elementary mathematical analysis) (1924), Lezioni di Algebra per il liceo classico, per il biennio del liceo scientifico e dell'istituto tecnico nautico Ⓣ(Algebra lessons for high school, for the two years of scientific and technical naval high schools) and Geometria elementare per Ginnasi Superiori e i Licei : vol.
* Cipolla received many honours for his outstanding contributions to mathematics and mathematical education, such as being elected Vice President of the Circolo Matematico di Palermo.
* He has also been honoured with the 'Liceo Scientifico Statale Michele Cipolla' in Castelvetrano, Sicily being dedicated to him.
* Also in Castelvetrano the 'Via Michele Cipolla' is named for him, while in Palermo there is a 'Via Michele Cipolla' on which the Universita' Degli Studi Di Palermo is situated.

Born 28 October 1880, Palermo, Italy. Died 7 September 1947, Palermo, Italy.
