**Michele Cipolla**  was an Italian mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the International School of Mathematics, a research center in Padua, Italy and served as its director.
2. Developed the concept of 'models of Euclidean space of non-uniform space curvatures.'
3. Proposed aspects of the non-Euclidean geometry.
4. Devised the "Cipolla lattice," a technique to solve certain linear algebraic equations quickly.
 5. Raised public awareness of mathematics, initiating and participating in numerous lectures, seminars and events.
6. Authored several books and articles related to mathematics and education, including the textbook Nonuniform Geometry. 
7. Won the prestigious Hofmann award from the International Mathematical Union.

Born 28 October 1880, Palermo, Italy. Died 7 September 1947, Palermo, Italy.
