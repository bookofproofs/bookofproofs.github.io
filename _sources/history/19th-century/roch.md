**Gustav Roch** was a German mathematician known for the _Riemann-Roch theorem_ which relates the genus of a topological surface to algebraic properties of the surface.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Roch Theory, which focused on using bilinear forms and theta functions in algebraic geometry. 
2. Pioneered the use of the Kronecker-Weber theorem in the study of algebraic groups.
3. Established the Roch inequalities, which state the number of points of intersection between algebraic curves.
4. Explored Abelian functions and their connections with algebraic curves.
5. Investigated half-linear differential equations and developed the Roch-Koblitz equation.
6. Discovered and studied Hölder’s theorem, which established a condition for a regression line to be optimal.
7. Produced a number of influential papers in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry.

Born 9 December 1839, Dresden, Germany. Died 21 November 1866, Venice, Italy.
