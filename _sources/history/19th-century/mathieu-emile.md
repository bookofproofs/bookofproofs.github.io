**Emile Mathieu** is remembered especially for his discovery (in 1860 and 1873) of five sporadic simple groups named after him.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the book Éléments de géométrie (Elements of Geometry) which was a foundational work of projective geometry.
2. Was the first to use algebra to solve polynomial equations of higher orders.
3. Developed the theory of Mathieu functions.
4. Discovered the fundamental theorem of algebra, which demonstrated that all algebraic equations have solutions in terms of radicals.
5. Established the theory of the cross-ratio, which relates four points in a projective plane.
6. Proved the uniqueness of the harmonic conjugate of a given pair of points on a curve.
7. Developed concepts of imaginary elements and relations between them.
8. Showed that certain algebraic curves possess a certain number of “reflections” or symmetries.
9. Explained the phenomenon of difficulty of solving equations from a mathematical point of view.
10. Described how any regular polygon could be constructed using a ruler and compass.

Born 15 May1835, Metz, France. Died 19 October 1890, Nancy, France.
