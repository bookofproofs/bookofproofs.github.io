**Hermann von Helmholtz** was a German mathematician who trained as a medical doctor and made important contributions to mathematical physics, optics and acoustics as well as to physiology and psychology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the conservation of energy law, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another. 
2. Created the Helmholtz equation in 1868, a partial differential equation of mathematical physics. 
3. Applied calculus to physical problems such as compressibility and heat capacities of gases. 
4. Made foundational contributions in vector analysis, including his work on defining the fundamental theorem of vector analysis. 
5. Investigated and theorized on many topics in psychoacoustics, such as perception of pitch, loudness and difference tones. 
6. Discovered the mathematical formula for the law of the conservation of energy. 
7. Developed the method of computing acoustic resonance in horns. 
8. Disproved the notion of vitalism and provided physical explanations for biological processes.

Born 31 August 1821, Potsdam, Prussia (now Germany). Died 8 September 1894, Berlin, Germany.
