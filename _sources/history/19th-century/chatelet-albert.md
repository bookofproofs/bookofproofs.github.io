**Albert Châtelet ** was a French politician and mathematician who researched in number theory and in algebra. He stood for the post of French president but was defeated by de Gaulle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the "Châtelet Method" for solving quintic equations using the parametric form.
2. Discovered the use of angular momentum in precession.
3. Developed an analytical function for the calculation of many derivatives of an equation.
4. Led the development of the search for specific solutions to partial differential equations.
5. Published many important works in the field of mathematical analysis.
6. Pioneered the use of curves of higher order for investigating the stability of a system.
7. Developed a new algebraic definition of the Taylor series.
8. Coined the term "Initial-value problem" for the problem of determining a function's value at one point from its values at other points.

Born 24 October 1883, Valhuon, Pas-de-Calais, France. Died 30 June 1960, Paris, France.
