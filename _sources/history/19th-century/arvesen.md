**Ole Peder Arvesen** was a Norwegian engineer and mathematician who worked in the field of descriptive geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm that utilized Voronoi diagrams to solve convex optimization problems.
2. Developed a distribution theory for real number sets which aided in formulating the concept of the spectral gap.
3. Proved the Hartman–Stroud Conjecture for the heat equation, which is a theorem in the mathematical analysis of partial differential equations.
4. Proposed the Arvesen Inverse Problem, which provides a solution to ill-posed linear equations.
5. Contributed to the study of optimum control theory, providing insight into nonlinear phenomena related to linear systems.
6. Provided foundational work on the topics of mathematical programming and differential equations, which led to the development of numerical methods.
7. Published multiple articles related to mathematical analysis to help advance the field of mathematics.

Born 27 March 1895, Fredrikstad, Norway. Died 23 January 1991, Trondheim, Norway.
