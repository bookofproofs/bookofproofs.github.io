**Arthur Lee Dixon** was an English mathematician who worked on analytic number theory and the application of algebra to geometry, elliptic functions and hyperelliptic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His mother was Ellen Cardew (born in Alford, Lincolnshire about 1842) and he was the younger brother of Alfred Cardew Dixon.
* Arthur was educated at Kingswood School in Bath which he attended from 1879 to 1885.
* After leaving Kingswood School Arthur Dixon entered Worcester College, Oxford, where he studied mathematics, graduating in 1889.
* Arthur Dixon won a prize fellowship to Merton College, Oxford, where he was appointed in 1891.
* Arthur and Catherine Dixon had one daughter and after Catherine's death in 1930, Dixon made his home with his daughter who by this time was married to F J Baden Fuller and living in Sandgate, Kent.
* Arthur Dixon always said that the biggest influences on his study of mathematics were Elliott, who inspired his particular line of research, and C L Dodgson whom he once met.
* In 1908 Dixon began a series of publications on algebraic eliminants, carrying the subject forward from the point where Cayley had left it.
* In the latter part of his career, Dixon published a series of around twelve joint papers with W L Ferrar on analytic number theory, summation formulae, Bessel functions and other topics in analysis.
* In 1912 Arthur Dixon was honoured by being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.
* His younger brother, Alfred Cardew Dixon, would hold this same office five years later.
* Arthur Dixon shared with Elliott, who had inspired him, an old-fashioned approach to mathematics.
* Dixon had many talents in addition to his mathematical ones.

Born 27 November 1867, Pickering, Yorkshire, England. Died 20 February 1955, Sandgate, Kent, England.
