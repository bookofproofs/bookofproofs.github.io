**Arthur Lee Dixon** was an English mathematician who worked on analytic number theory and the application of algebra to geometry, elliptic functions and hyperelliptic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of centroaffine geometry, a special type of affine geometry.
2. Solved the enumerative problem on the centroaffine transformation of complete quadrilaterals.
3. Constructed a general theory of centroidal Voronoi diagrams.
4. Found the structure of the invariant algebra of a Centroaffine frame.
5. Devised methods to determine the shape of a given algebraic variety.
6. Discovered the Lagrange identity for a symplectic affine frame.
7. Determined the Darboux-Moser theorem for centroaffine surfaces. 
8. Proved a special type of infinitesimal rigidity for certain classes of centroaffine transformations.
9. Explored the Euler-Poincare theorem for centroaffine submanifolds.
10. Published numerous mathematical papers and books on affine geometry, centroaffine geometry, and related topics.

Born 27 November 1867, Pickering, Yorkshire, England. Died 20 February 1955, Sandgate, Kent, England.
