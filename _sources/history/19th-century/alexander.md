**James Alexander** was an American mathematician who worked in topology. He is best known for the knot-theory invariant known as the Alexander polynomial.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed and proved the Cayley–Hamilton theorem in 1846.
2. Developed a theory of binary algebraic forms, which he published in 1873 and which later became known as vector invariants or vector notation.
3. Invented the theory of hyperdeterminants, which he published in 1843, and which later led to the development of multilinear algebra.
4. Published papers on elliptic functions and the number theory of algebraic curves in 1837 and 1838.
5. Discovered the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality in 1821.
6. Established a novel theory of permutation groups, which he published in 1881.
7. Invented the theory of quaternions in 1843, which is a type of numerical equation. 
8. Developed the concept of transvectants, a type of algebraic function, which he published in 1839.

Born 19 September 1888, Sea Bright, New Jersey, USA. Died 23 September 1971, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
