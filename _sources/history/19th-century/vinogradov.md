**Vinogradov** used trigonometric series to attack deep problems in analytic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He proved the Čebyšev inequality and introduced the Vinogradov mean value theorem. 
2. He proved the three-primes theorem and the Waring–Goldbach problem. 
3. He developed Vinogradov's integral, an oscillatory integral. 
4. He established the method of trigonometric sums, used in his attack on Goldbach's conjecture. 
5. He developed Vinogradov's A-value, a method related to the Riemann hypothesis. 
6. He helped to develop the theory of whole numbers and Diophantine equations. 
7. He established Vinogradov's system of definitions and axioms, the basis for modern additive number theory. 
8. He published works typically spanning several hundred pages. 
9. He applied Fourier analysis to the binomial coefficient and Lota's problem. 
10. He authored many books related to mathematics including “Elementary Number Theory”.

Born 14 September 1891, Milolyub, Velikie Luki, Pskov province, Russia. Died 20 March 1983, Moscow, Russia.
