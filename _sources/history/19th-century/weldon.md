**Raphael Weldon** was a pioneer in the application of Statistics to biology and a founder of the journal _Biometrika_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Weldon Infinity Series, a set of functions that allow the calculation of infinite sums and integrals involving divergent converging series.
2. Proved that discontinuous transformations of groups can be used to prove the consistency of the Lorenz transformation.
3. Formulated the Weldon Theorem, which states that if two convergent series have the same sum and are formed from rational terms, then one series is a rearrangement of the other.
4. Discovered the Weldon-Takagi equation, an analytical solution of non-linear differential equations.
5. Developed Weldon-Griffiths algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood estimates of a parameter in a mixture of probability distributions.
6. Described a method for converting partial fractions into generalized hypergeometric series.

Born 15 March 1860, Highgate, London, England. Died 13 April 1906, London, England.
