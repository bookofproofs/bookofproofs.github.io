**Thomas Bromwich** grew up in South Africa and then graduated from Cambridge. He was Professor of Mathematics in Galway before returning to Cambridge. He made important contributions in both pure and applied mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Thomas was born at Queen's Square, Wolverhampton, and he began his schooling in that town before his parents emigrated to South Africa.
* Bromwich's first research was on applied mathematics where was influenced by Stokes.
* T J I'A Bromwich's method for solving the source-free Maxwell equations for electromagnetic waves.
* was originally used by Bromwich in 1899, and subsequently independently discovered by H M Macdonald.
* Bromwich also made substantial contributions to pure mathematics.
* Bromwich also made useful contributions to quadratic and bilinear forms and many consider his algebraic work to be his finest.
* Bromwich did his best work before reaching the age of 33, perhaps suffering because of overwork after this time.
* The hard work which Bromwich put into his teaching certainly had a negative effect on his research, and perhaps, as Hardy suggests, on his happiness.
* He did make some slightly critical comments regarding Bromwich, however, describing him as "thinking vaguely" and "a little wanting in imagination".

Born 8 February 1875, Wolverhampton, England. Died 24 August 1929, Northampton, England.
