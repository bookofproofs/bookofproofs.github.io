**Thomas Bromwich** grew up in South Africa and then graduated from Cambridge. He was Professor of Mathematics in Galway before returning to Cambridge. He made important contributions in both pure and applied mathematics. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote a book entitled 'An Introduction to the Theory of Infinite Series' (1908) which was very influential in introducing and developing the theory of infinite series. 
2. Developed an algebraic method for determining the Taylor series of any given function.
3. Developed an algorithm for solving quadratic equations.
4. Formulated the Bromwich integral and Bromwich inversion theorem. 
5. Developed the inequality now known as the Bromwich inequality for a real-valued function of two real variables. 
6. Was one of the primary contributors to the development of potential theory. 
7. Published the book 'Fourier Series' in 1915 which discussed the integration of the partial differential equations. 
8. Investigated the convergence criteria of Fourier Series. 
9. Resolved the question of the uniform convergence of the infinite series. 
10. Proved an important result in Fourier-analytic number theory known as the Riemann-Bromwich theorem.

Born 8 February 1875, Wolverhampton, England. Died 24 August 1929, Northampton, England.
