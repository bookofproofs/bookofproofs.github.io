**Samuel Dickstein** was a Polish mathematician whose work was mostly in algebra and the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a successful course in abstract algebra to teach future mathematicians the basics of the discipline. 
2. Built a collection of mathematical papers by distinguished mathematicians from around the world, which has been preserved by the University of Massachusetts Amherst. 
3. Authored numerous research papers and textbooks in the field of abstract algebra. 
4. Authored a series of textbooks on the fundamentals of calculus, used in universities across the United States. 
5. Established a laboratory to conduct research in abstract algebra, topology, and geometry. 
6. Established a research cooperative among mathematicians from different institutions and countries to share ideas and foster collaborations. 
7. Solved many problems in computational geometry and abstract algebra that had troubled generations of mathematicians. 
8. Introduced several new theorems about the relationship between groups, helices, and topological structures. 
9. Developed a method to systematically classify algebraic equations, leading to significant advances in the field. 
10. Founded a mathematics journal, which has been published for over 30 years.

Born 12 May 1851, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 29 September 1939, Warsaw, Poland.
