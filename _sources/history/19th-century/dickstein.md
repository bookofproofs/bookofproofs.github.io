**Samuel Dickstein** was a Polish mathematician whose work was mostly in algebra and the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Poland did not formally exist at the time of Dickstein's birth and much of the pattern of his life was dominated by the aim of Poles to restore their country.
* In 1846, three years before Dickstein was born, there was an attempted revolution by Polish nationalists.
* During the following years when Dickstein was a young child Poles sought independence but were kept down by armed force.
* Some reforms were put in place in the Russian areas of Poland (which included Warsaw where Dickstein lived) but these only seemed to invoke anger among young patriotic Poles.
* For a year Dickstein, a youth aged 12, saw the Polish uprising being crushed.
* The victorious Russian occupiers then carried out executions, confiscations, and deportations, and one can only imagine how a young man like Dickstein might have felt knowing that Poles could not hope to rule their own country again in the foreseeable future.
* There was no Polish university for Dickstein to attend so, in 1866, he entered one of the only higher education establishments in Warsaw, the teacher's college.
* From 1870 to 1876 Dickstein attended this Russian university in Warsaw specialising in mathematics.
* With the education system controlled by the Russian rulers, Dickstein decided to do what he could to promote a Polish education and he directed his own private school for ten years beginning in 1878.
* Dickstein was one of the main instigators of publishing mathematical journals in Poland.
* It was not only with his role in publishing that Dickstein made a major contribution to Polish mathematics.
* In 1903 Dickstein was a founder of the Warsaw Scientific Society and he was important in the development of the Polish Mathematical Society.
* Dickstein was one of two mathematicians in this founding group of fourteen, and was elected as secretary of the group.
* A Mathematical Study was set up with Dickstein donating a fine library of mathematical texts.
* Dickstein taught in the newly established university, giving the first year lectures on algebra.
* Dickstein's work was mostly in algebra and the history of mathematics.
* Ulam, at age 23, met Dickstein, who was then in his eighties, at the International Mathematical Congress in Zürich in 1932.
* Dickstein's teacher had been a student of Cauchy in the early nineteenth century, and he still considered Poincaré, who died in 1912, a bright young man.
* Dickstein died in the Nazi bombing of Warsaw in 1939 and all his family died during the German occupation of Poland.

Born 12 May 1851, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 29 September 1939, Warsaw, Poland.
