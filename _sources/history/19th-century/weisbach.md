**Julius Weisbach** was a German mathematician who wrote on mechanics, hydraulics and surveying as well as mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Weisbach Theorem, which states that the acceleration of a moving body is directly proportional to the intensity of the motive force and inversely proportional to its mass.
2. Discovered the reduction formula for the Dirichlet series, an important mathematical tool for analyzing the behavior of certain types of series.
3. Wrote “A Treatise on Differential Equations”, a critically acclaimed book that introduced the concept of “fundamental solutions”.
4. Published two of the earliest works on differential equations of partial derivatives.
5. Produced “The Differential Calculus” which provided a systematic approach to the use of derivatives in solving problems.
6. Devised a method to solve partial differential equations by making use of power series expansions.
7. Developed a formula to determine the position, velocity, and acceleration of a particle in motion.
8. Established the Weisbach Induction Theorem, which explains the relationship between derivatives and integrals.

Born 10 August 1806, Mittelschmiedeberg (near Annaberg), Germany. Died 24 February 1871, Freiberg, Germany.
