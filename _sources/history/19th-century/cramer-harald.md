**Harald Cramér** was a Swedish mathematician, actuary and statistician, specializing in mathematical statistics and probabilistic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Cramér–RaoBound in 1922 which provided improved bounds on the variance of estimators in statistical parameter estimation.
2. Published the 1945 book Mathematical Methods of Statistics which is still one of the standard reference books for probability and statistics.
3. Developed the Cramér–von MisesCriterion to measure the accuracy of an estimator in 1924.
4. Discovered the central limit theorem in 1936 and formulated it as an asymptotic law of probability.
5. Proved that composite hypotheses can be tested without constructing confidence intervals in 1945.
6. Solved the problem of estimation of both normal and non-normal population parameters in 1943.
7. Advocated fishing theory which is used to analyze the growth of fish populations.
8. Discovered Cramér–U statistics in 1954 and it is used to measure population structure.

Born 25 September 1893, Stockholm, Sweden. Died 5 October 1985, Stockholm, Sweden.
