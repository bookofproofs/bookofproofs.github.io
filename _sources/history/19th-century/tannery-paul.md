**Paul Tannery** was a French mathematician who was famous as an historian of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a mathematical journal, Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure, to further mathematics education. 
2. Discovered the concept of a Mobius transformation, a kind of geometric transformation from one shape to another. 
3. Developed the fundamentals of the Carnot-Tannery cyclical flow equation, an important equation in thermodynamics. 
4. Published several books on the history of mathematics, contributing to the current understanding of mathematics. 
5. Transcribed important mathematical works into modern forms, making them available to current audiences. 
6. Established the first mathematics departments in French universities, including the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. 
7. Developed the Tannery-Klein critical line, which allows for the determination of points where two functions line up.

Born 20 December 1843, Mantes-la-Jolie, Yvelines, France. Died 27 November 1904, Pantin, Seine-St Denis, France.
