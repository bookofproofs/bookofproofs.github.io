**Theodore von Kármán** was a Hungarian born mathematician, aerospace engineer and physicist who worked in the fields of aeronautics and astronautics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed many mathematical tools for the study of supersonic flows of air, work which laid the foundation for modern aerodynamic theory.
2. Developed the concept of boundary layer, the layer of air subjected to viscosity adjacent to the surface of an aircraft or solid body in motion through the air.
3. Founded the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT), and developed with co-workers the theory of thin airfoil sections.
4. Created a number of mathematical methods, such as the von Kármán minimum theorem, which is used to calculate the minimum drag produced in incompressible laminar flows.
5. Established the foundations of the science of supersonic fluid dynamics, which, together with his contributions to boundary layer theory, profoundly influenced the development of modern aircraft, missiles and rockets.
6. Pioneered the development of airfoils and their use in wings and propellers, predicted that an airplane could fly faster than the speed of sound and helped prove it. 
7. Developed the model for predicting wind tunnel tests based on the theory of similarity.
8. Developed a theory regarding the mathematical foundations of turbulence. 
9. Influenced the field of turbulence and pattern formation by promoting the Triadic Cascade Theory.

Born 11 May 1881, Budapest, Hungary. Died 7 May 1963, Aachen, Germany.
