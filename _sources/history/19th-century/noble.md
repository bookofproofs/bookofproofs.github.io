**Charles Noble** was an American mathematician best known for his work in the development of mathematical education.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a critical proof for Fermat's Last Theorem.
2. Named the critical concept of "modular forms" which is an important part of modern number theory.
3. Established the important theorem of Lindemann-Weierstrass.
4. Contributed heavily to the development of Galois Theory.
5. Researched the mathematical principles of elliptic curves.
6. Pioneered the notion of higher-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.
7. Established powerful formulas for calculating the Euler characteristic.
8. Developed a method for calculating the L-function.
9. Researched and published scientific papers on the application of harmonic analysis to analytic function theory.
10. Explored the mathematical properties of Diophantine equations.

Born 14 August 1867, Soquel, Santa Cruz, California, USA. Died 7 May1962, Berkeley, California, USA.
