**Helmut Hasse** did fundamental work in algebra and number theory. He is e.g. known for [Hasse diagrams][bookofproofs$267].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Helmut Hasse laid the groundwork for the field of algebraic number theory, which is the study of algebraic extensions of the rational numbers.
2. He proved the Tsen-Lang theorem, which states that the only finite extension of an algebraic field is also an algebraic field.
3. He created the Hasse principle, which states that an equation with integer coefficients has a solution in the algebraic numbers if and only if it has a solution in the rational numbers.
4. He developed a general notion of an algebraic number field and laid the groundwork for the modern theory of local fields.
5. He proved the Artin-Schreier theorem, which states that any finite field extension of the field of prime numbers is isomorphic to the field of prime numbers in some degree.
6. He proved the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, which states that an equation with integer coefficients can have a solution in an algebraic number field if and only if it has a solution in a finite field.

Born 25 August 1898, Kassel, Germany. Died 26 December 1979, Ahrensburg (near Hamburg), Germany.
