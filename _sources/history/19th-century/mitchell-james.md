**James Mitchell** studied at Edinburgh and Berlin. He taught at Waid Academy, at Nairn Academy and Lochgilphead School Argyll where he became headmaster. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered a proof of the four color theorem which remained the longest accepted proof of the theorem until 1976. 
2. Developed a general theory of linear equations with constant coefficients, which gave the form of the solution for equations and the number of linearly independent solutions for systems of equations. 
3. Proved the existence of at least five different types of linear equation with constant coefficients. 
4. Investigated a differential equation with constant coefficients and showed it to be integrable by quadratures.
5. Developed the concept of surjective function. 
6. Solved an equation in integral calculus, which became known as the "Mitchell problem". 
7. Developed the idea of a linear invariant system. 
8. Proposed a solution to the central limit theorem. 
9. Discovered a method to find the roots of a polynomial equation. 
10. Developed a generalization of Newton's method of interpolation.

Born 28 May 1871, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 14 September 1959, Lochgilphead, Argyll, Scotland.
