**Yulian Vasilievich Sokhotsky** was a Polish mathematician who worked on complex analysis and special functioins.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Cauchy-Kowalewskaya theorem on the existence of solutions of linear partial differential equations.  
2. Constructed the complete theory of linear and algebraic equations with partial derivatives. 
3. Extended the Euler-Jacobi equation to partial differential equations.
4. Expounded the theory of integral and differential equations.
5. Discovered the inverse problem of analytic geometry.
6. Developed the theory of elliptic functions and the corresponding algebraic systems.
7. Developed the concept of auxiliary hypergeometric functions and the corresponding solution of linear differential equations.
8. Developed a systematic approach to the theory of partial differential equations.
9. Studied the characteristics of linear differential operators.
10. Established the necessary conditions for the solvability of the three-dimensional Cauchy problem.

Born 2 February 1842, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 14 December 1927, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
