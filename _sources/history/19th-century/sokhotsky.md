**Yulian Vasilievich Sokhotsky** was a Polish mathematician who worked on complex analysis and special functioins.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Sokhotsky was brought up in Warsaw where he attended Warsaw State Gymnasium for primary education from 1850.
* In this thesis Sokhotsky discussed the Cauchy integral and the theory of analytic functions, which he called "single-valued".
* Sokhotsky was appointed as an extraordinary professor after the award of his doctorate (essentially equivalent to the German habilitation) and then became an ordinary professor at the University of St Petersburg in 1883.
* Sokhotsky was elected vice-president of the Mathematical Society of St Petersburg in 1890 and succeeded V G Imshenetsky as president in 1892.
* Other topics which Sokhotsky studied included Zolotarev's theory of divisibility of algebraic numbers in The application of the principle of the greatest divisor to the theory of divisibility of algebraic numbers (1898).

Born 2 February 1842, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 14 December 1927, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
