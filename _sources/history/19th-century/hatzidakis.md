**Nikolaos Hatzidakis** was a Greek mathematician, poet and patriot. He worked in differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ioannis Hatzidakis, who often transcribed his name as Hazzidakis, was born in Crete, studied at Syros, and then, from 1863, at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
* It was while Ioannis and Penelope Hatzidakis were in Berlin that their son Nikolaos, the subject of this biography was born.
* Let us note that Ioannis Hatzidakis had a brother Georgios Nicolaou Hatzidakis (1843-1941) who became a linguist and Professor of Linguistics at the University of Athens.
* The school education of Nikolaos took place in Athens.
* Following the same pattern that his father had followed, Hatzidakis went to Paris for graduate studies.
* Among these volunteers was Hatzidakis and his uncle who had, as a young man, fought for the Greeks in 1866 in a similar uprising at the side of his own father (the grandfather of the subject of this biography).
* Hatzidakis left for Germany to continue his graduate studies, again following the same pattern as his father.
* Hatzidakis spent two years in Germany, 1898-1900.
* At this time Schwarz was lecturing on his collected works and Hatzidakis had for company at these lectures his fellow Greek, Constantin Carath√©odory.
* Hatzidakis, however, did not receive any diplomas from these universities.
* In 1913 Hatzidakis served as dean of the School, and in that capacity he proposed the establishment of a Mathematical Journal, in which he could present his work to those who were not members of the university community.
* Hatzidakis was the first professor at the University who achieved close contact with his students.
* Several important initiatives in the development of mathematics in Greece were undertaken by Hatzidakis in collaboration with two of his colleagues, Georgios Remoundos and Panagiotis Zervos.
* Hatzidakis served as the first President of the Society having this role from 1918 to 1925.
* In the first issues of the journal, Hatzidakis published some remarkable work.
* Hatzidakis was the person who, following on from the beginnings by his father, brought the study of differential geometry to Greece.
* Hatzidakis was not only interested in mathematics and, having a multifaceted and extremely competent mind, he systematically dealt with other disciplines such as linguistics, geography, and literature.
* He was given a deep understanding of linguistics by his father's brother, Georgios Hatzidakis, a famous linguist, with whom, however, he disagreed with on basic linguistic issues.
* Hatzidakis was also an excellent geographer.
* Hatzidakis inherited many qualities from his father, and amongst those being his genuine Cretan character.
* Hatzidakis was a member of various foreign mathematical societies including the German Mathematical Society, the Swiss Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Circle of Palermo.
* Although Hatzidakis spoke German and Italian fluently, there was no way he would socialise with the occupying forces and he starved to death in January 1942.
* Hatzidakis's children Sophia and Ioannis survived and inherited his large library, which consisted of about eight hundred volumes of foreign books and a great number of manuscripts with his own work.

Born 25 April 1872, Berlin, Germany. Died 25 January 1942, Athens, Greece.
