**Nikolaos Hatzidakis** was a Greek mathematician, poet and patriot. He worked in differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the open problem of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras.
2. Developed a theory of lattices in arbitrary forms.
3. Conducted groundbreaking research on the structure of rings of invariants of scalar linear differential equations and their Riemannâ€“Hilbert correspondence.
4. First to apply tools from algebraic geometry in invariant theory.
5. Demonstrated the existence of alternative equivalent descriptions of equations of nonlinear partial differential equations of second and third order.
6. Established criteria for the existence of a regular infinity of integrals of nonlinear integral equations.

Born 25 April 1872, Berlin, Germany. Died 25 January 1942, Athens, Greece.
