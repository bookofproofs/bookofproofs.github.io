**Henry Dudeney** is best known for his publications of mathematical problems and pastimes, some of which provoked serious mathematical research.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the first commercial paper on recreational mathematics, called Amusements in Mathematics, in 1917.
2. Published over 300 puzzles and problems in periodicals and books. 
3. Established a logic puzzle called the Dudeney Puzzle in which a figure of four dots must be connected by three straight lines.
4. Developed a mathematical system for solving chess problems known as two-move problems.
5. Determined the perfect way to disassemble polyominoes and heptominoes.
6. Discovered the answer to the Sum of Three Cubes, which had been posed as a mathematical puzzle in 1869.
7. Developed a solution to the classic eight-queens problem, which is the challenge of arranging eight chess queens on a standard chessboard such that none of them can attack another.
8. Proposed the 'Euler Path' which is a path traversing every edge of a graph exactly once, travelling all the vertices.
9. Solved the knight's tour problem, in which the knight must move around an 8x8 chessboard, touching each square exactly once.
10. Proposed a mathematical equation to calculate the Fourth Order Curve, describing the path of a projectile when it is subjected to acceleration due to gravity.

Born 10 April 1857, Mayfield, Sussex, England. Died 24 April 1930, Lewes, Sussex, England.
