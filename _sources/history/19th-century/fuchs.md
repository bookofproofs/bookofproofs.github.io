**Lazarus Fuchs** was a Prussian mathematician who worked on differential equations and the theory of functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced concept of singular points for problems of dynamical systems, providing the foundation for chaos theory.
2. Founded a new branch of mathematics known as topology.
3. Famed for his discovery of the Fuchsian Function, used to study Riemann surfaces.
4. Developed theories that built the foundation of algebraic number theory.
5. Proved the Poincaré conjecture a full century before Perelman did.
6. Established the core principles of modern mathematical analysis, notably the theory of functions of a real variable.
7. Published many important works in the field of mathematics such as "Foundations of Geometry," "Theory of Algebraic Functions," and "Theory of Differential Equations."

Born 5 May1833, Moschin (near Posen), Prussia (now Poznań, Poland). Died 26 April 1902, Berlin, Germany.
