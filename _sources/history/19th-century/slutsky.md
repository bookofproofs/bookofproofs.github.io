** Evgeny Slutsky** was important in the application of mathematical methods in economics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved three of Hilbert's unsolved problems in 1920, making a major breakthrough for algebraic geometry. 
2. Showed that Galois theory could be used to answer questions in algebraic number theory, and laid the foundation for the further study of the topic. 
3. Developed the relationship between the critical point of a function and the first derivative of the function, which enabled a more exact determination of the roots of equations. 
4. Proposed a way to explain the failure of the law of excluded middle in mathematics. 
5. Constructed the notion of the generalized point and derived important implications for non Euclidean geometry. 
6. Contributed to the development of the theory of algebraic curves and surface theory.
7. Discovered the regular and periodic functions in Riemann surfaces.  
8. Established the existence of forms of singular points on algebraic curves. 
9. Coined the term “cyclic groups.”

Born 19 April 1880, Novoe, Yaroslavl guberniya, Russia. Died 10 March 1948, Moscow, USSR.
