**John Airey** graduated from Cambridge and became Principal of the West Ham Technical Institute. He is best known for his work in producing tables of mathematical functions. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a technique for solving double integrals, now known as Airey's method.
2. He wrote the influential book 'Elementary Algebra for Schools', which served as a major reference for many years.
3. He wrote the first book about Newtonian Mechanics for schools and was a pioneer in the teaching of science in elementary and secondary schools.
4. He wrote a major article in the Royal Society's Proceedings entitled "On the Simplicity of the Motion of the Pendulum", where he explained the basics of pendulum motion.
5. He proposed a solution to the brachistochrone problem which used the spiral of Archimedes.
6. He made a significant contribution to solving the Sturm-Liouville problem, which required finding the sines and cosines of the differential equation.
7. He used Fourier's Series to express the solution of the vibrating string.
8. He proposed a series of mathematically driven vibration tests that eventually led to the development of the modern piano and other stringed instruments.

Born June 1868, Hunslet, Leeds, England. Died 16 September 1937, Llwynon, Newtown, Montgomeryshire, Wales.
