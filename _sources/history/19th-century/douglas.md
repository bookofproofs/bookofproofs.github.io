**Jesse Douglas** worked on geometry, group theory and the calculus of variations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the Plateau Problem, which led to the field of geometric analysis. 
2. Received the Fields Medal in 1936 for his achievements in mathematics.
3. Was the first mathematician to prove John Walsh’s conjecture in 1932. 
4. Developed the Douglas–Rachford algorithm in 1956.
5. Helped invent the area of nonlinear partial differential equations in 1924. 
6. Contributed to the theory of divergence in connection with the calculus of variations.
7. Solved the Dirichlet problem in the plane. 
8. Established important results in harmonic analysis. 
9. Resolved the first torsional rigidity problem. 
10. Received the National Medal of Science in 1976 for his contributions in mathematics.

Born 3 July 1897, New York, USA. Died 7 October 1965, New York, USA.
