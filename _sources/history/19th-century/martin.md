**Artemas Martin** was a self-taught mathematician and book-collector whose output covered a wide range of mathematical problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Artemas had very little in the way of formal education with the total being only three terms at a district school in Venango County and a few months at the Franklin Academy when he was seventeen years old.
* As the above quote states, Martin lived in rural Pennsylvania until he was fifty, mostly in Erie.
* He turned this down but in 1885, at the age of fifty, he did accept the offer of a job as librarian with the United States Coast and geodetic Survey in Washington, D.C. In taking the position of librarian Martin was following the second passion of his life, namely that of being a book collector.
* Martin was the first American subscriber to the Educational Times and the first American to contribute to its mathematical section.

Born 3 August 1835, Steuben County, New York, USA. Died 7 November 1918, Washington, D.C., USA.
