**Artemas Martin** was a self-taught mathematician and book-collector whose output covered a wide range of mathematical problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored several influential books on mathematics, including "A Treatise on Plane Algebraic Analysis" (1810) and "A Systematic Treatise on Astronomical Mathematics" (1817).
2. Developed a set of table of logarithmic sines and tangents, which helped geometers and engineers calculate the angles and lengths of arc accurately.
3. Was the first to use the method of least squares for curves of higher orders, allowing for a more accurate calculation of the parameters of curves.
4. Established methods for linearizing parameters of functions, which allowed for more precise determination of roots.
5. Showed how to solve polynomials and higher equations analytically, which then allowed for the study of topics such as the stability of certain types of equations
6. Developed the ‘martin's theorem’, which proved helpful in the algebraic analysis of circles and conic sections.
7. Created formulas for finding equations of circles and conic sections with known characteristic points.
8. Was the first to introduce a highly accurate value to approximate Pi using the arithmetical-geometric mean.
9. Developed theories such as ‘tower theorem’ and ‘transformation theory’, which influenced the development of scientific calculations and mathematical analysis.

Born 3 August 1835, Steuben County, New York, USA. Died 7 November 1918, Washington, D.C., USA.
