**Euphemia Lofton Haynes** was an American mathematician and educator. She was the first African-American woman to earn a PhD in mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We note that Euphemia only became Euphemia Lofton Haynes after her marriage to Harold Appo Haynes in 1917 and that she seldom used the name Martha.
* In 1886 William S Lofton had graduated from Spencerian Business College and, two years later, graduated from Howard University Dental College.
* At the 1900 census Euphemia was nine years old.
* As we noted above, by this time Lavinia and William S Lofton are divorced.
* Euphemia then spent two years at the Washington Minor Normal School, graduating with distinction in 1909.
* From these positions, Haynes was vocal in her advocacy for poor students and better schools, denouncing the system's segregation-tinged policies.
* Haynes remained head of the Mathematics Department until she retired in 1959.
* Euphemia Haynes undertook research for a Ph.D. at the Catholic University of America.
* Euphemia worked towards a mathematics doctorate with thesis advisor Aubrey Edward Landry.
* In 1943 Haynes submitted her thesis The Determination of Sets of Independent Conditions Characterizing Certain Special Cases of Symmetric Correspondences and, after she was examined by a committee including Otto Joseph Ramler (1887-1985) and Joseph Nelson Rice (1890-1988), she was awarded a doctorate in 1943.
* With the award of her doctorate Euphemia Haynes became the first African American woman to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics.
* Harold retired in 1958 and Euphemia retired in 1959, although she continued to lecture occasionally at Howard University.
* Euphemia's lifelong Catholicism often motivated her activism.
* Euphemia remained active in professional educational organizations like the Catholic College Alumnae and Sigma Delta Epsilon as well.
* Dr Euphemia Haynes is perhaps most well known as a member of the District of Columbia Board of Education from 1960 to 1968.
* While on the Board during the tumultuous 1960s, Dr. Haynes vigorously advocated for poor students and better schools with high academic standards.
* Dr. Haynes opted not to run for election in 1968 and retired from board service.
* Dr Harold Haynes died in 1978 at 89 years old.
* Euphemia Haynes died of a heart attack, also at the age of 89.
* The University named the chair she funded as the Euphemia Haynes Chair in the Department of Education.
* The gift was willed to the university in a trust fund Mrs Haynes established for the support of a professorial chair in the School of Education.
* Another honour followed her death when in 2004 the E L Haynes Public Charter School in Washington, DC was named for her.

Born 11 September 1890, Washington, D.C., USA. Died 25 July 1980, Washington, D.C., USA.
