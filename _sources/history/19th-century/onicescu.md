**Octav Onicescu** was a Romanian mathematician with research interests that included many areas such as probability, Riemannian manifolds, absolute differential calculus, functional analysis, algebra, and the topological theory of functions. He is considered as the founder of the Romanian school of probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Jacobi identity for vector fields on n-dimensional manifolds. 
2. Developed the mathematical theory of diffraction gratings.
3. Developed a rigorous theory of linear and nonlinear integral equations.
4. Established the base for the theory of minimum principles for operators.
5. Devised the concept of polarization submanifolds.
6. Developed the notion of multiple integral operators.
7. Established a geometry-operational calculus.
8. Introduced the notion of vector bundles.
9. Suggested the concept of a Morse family of parameter functions.
10. Contributed to the development of the theory of fibre bundles.

Born 20 August 1892, Boto»ôani, North Moldavia (now Romania). Died 19 August 1983, Bucharest, Romania.
