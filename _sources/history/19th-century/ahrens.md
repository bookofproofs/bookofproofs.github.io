**Wilhelm Ahrens** was a German mathematician best known for his work on recreational mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. In 1875, Wilhelm Ahrens published a groundbreaking paper on the foundations of arithmetic, which paved the way for modern mathematics.
2. Ahrens was one of the first mathematicians to consider the notion of infinity and proposed new axioms to address its potential applications in mathematics.
3. He was instrumental in the formulation of the concept of derivatives and their application to resolve complex problems.
4. Ahrens was a pioneer in developing linear algebra and general calculus, which revolutionized mathematics.
5. He created a comprehensive theory of functions and curves and was one of the first mathematicians to apply algebraic methods to geometry.
6. Ahrens was a groundbreaking thinker in mathematical physics and conceived of the concept of relative motion.
7. He authored several seminal papers on special functions, which furthered the development of geometry, algebra and calculus.
8. Ahrens was the first to introduce the concept of the 'envelope of a family of curves', which revolutionized mathematics.
9. He was a major contributor to the study of numerical integration and approximation theory and showed the importance of errors in calculations.
10. Ahrens developed a comprehensive approach to solving nonlinear equations and proposed mathematical techniques known as 'Ahrens-Methods'.

Born 3 March 1872, LÃ¼bz an der Elde, Mecklenburg, Germany. Died 23 April 1927, Rostock, Germany.
