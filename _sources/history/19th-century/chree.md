**Charles Chree** studied in Aberdeen and Cambridge. He became Superintendent of Kew Observatory and worked on terrestrial magnetism.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first comprehensive theory of ballistics.
2. Discovered the so-called modified Chree equations which govern the trajectory of objects in a gravity-free space.
3. Studied the behavior of a rotating mass, now known as the Chree problem.
4. Conducted the first calculation of the lateral deflection of projectiles.
5. Made pioneering contributions to the development of the theory of differential equations.
6. Showed that the roll of a body in a fluid can be calculated when combined with the normal law of motion.
7. Formulated a mathematical law for the determination of apparent times.
8. Developed a mathematical law for calculating the paths of particles in the absence of air resistance.
9. Pioneered methods for determining the motion of a body in rotational motion, now known as Chreeâ€™s law.
10. Developed a mathematical model for the motion of projectiles in a confined area.

Born 5 May1860, Lintrathen, Angus, Scotland. Died 12 August 1928, Worthing, Sussex, England.
