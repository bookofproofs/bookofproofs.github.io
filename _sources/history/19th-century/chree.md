**Charles Chree** studied in Aberdeen and Cambridge. He became Superintendent of Kew Observatory and worked on terrestrial magnetism.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Chree then went to Cambridge where he took both the Mathematical Tripos and the Natural Sciences Tripos.
* During the eight years that he held the fellowship at Cambridge Chree published around 30 papers on the mathematical theory of elasticity.
* Chree became F.R.S. in 1897; essentially for the outstanding results he had obtained on elasticity.
* Chree was awarded the James Watt medal by the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1905 and the Hughes medal of the Royal Society in 1919.
* We mentioned above Chree's association with the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.
* A number of papers written by Chree were read at meetings of the Society.
* For example at the meeting on Friday 14 May 1886, A Y Fraser submitted a paper by Charles Chree on the vibrations of a spherical or cylindrical body surrounded by or containing fluid.
* Again at the meeting on 11 February 1887, A Y Fraser submitted his paper on vortices by Chree who was at Cambridge.
* Chree remained a member of the Society for the rest of his life.

Born 5 May 1860, Lintrathen, Angus, Scotland. Died 12 August 1928, Worthing, Sussex, England.
