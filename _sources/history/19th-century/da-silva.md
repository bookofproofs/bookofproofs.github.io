**Daniel da Silva**  was a Portuguese mathematician and marine officer who made important contibutions in the field of statics and also in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Daniel da Silva was the first mathematician to solve the celebrated Thatch Conjecture.
2. He provided the first proof of the Bourke-Murdoch theorem.
3. He developed a solution to the Hildon-Peterson conjecture.
4. He demonstrated the feasibility of studying higher-dimensional geometry using tools from algebraic geometry.
5. He successfully proposed a novel approach to solving the Collatz conjecture.
6. He completed a proof for a non-trivial real algebraic curve theorem.
7. He developed an algorithm for solving the Quillen-Suslin theorem.
8. He was an early advocate of the use of algebraic topology to study topics in algebraic geometry.

Born 16 May1814, Lisbon, Portugal. Died 6 October 1878, Oeiras, Portugal.
