**Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave** studied the mathematical tripos at Girton College Cambridge. She the taught mathematics at a High School for eleven years before becoming an assistant to Karl Pearson in the Galton Laboratory of University College, London. She later became an assistant to Leonard Bairstow in the Department of Aeronautics at the Imperial College, London. She published two papers with Pearson and two with Bairstow.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Thomas Cave-Browne-Cave was a civil servant who became Deputy Accountant-General of the Army from 1897 to 1900 and a Commissioner of the Royal Hospital Chelsea from 1899 to 1923.
* Thomas and Blanche Cave-Browne-Cave had six children only five of whom reached adulthood: Blanche Isabel Cave-Browne-Cave (12 July 1871 - 10 August 1871); Jeanette Gertrude Cave-Browne-Cave (16 September 1872 - 9 March 1950); Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave (30 May 1874 - 9 July 1947), the subject of this biography; Frances Evelyn Cave-Browne-Cave (21 February 1876 - 30 March 1965); Thomas Reginald Cave-Browne-Cave (11 January 1885 - 26 November 1969); and Henry Meyrick Cave-Browne-Cave (1 February 1887 - 5 August 1965).
* Beatrice Cave-Browne-Cave tended to call herself Beatrice M Cave and she appears on her publications as "B M Cave." We will refer to Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave as "Beatrice" and her sister Frances Evelyn Cave-Browne-Cave as "Evelyn" throughout this biography to avoid confusion.
* Beatrice was brought up in quite privileged circumstances.
* The three sisters were all educated at home and by the time of the 1891 census Beatrice was living with her parents, two sisters, two brothers, and four servants (cook, nurse, parlour maid, and housemaid).
* Neither of Beatrice's brothers studied at university but both became engineers, first in the navy and then the Royal Air Force on its formation in 1918.
* At Cambridge, Beatrice was in the same year as G H Hardy and James Hopwood Jeans.
* The Headmistress when Beatrice was appointed was Reta Oldham (1861-1933) who had taught a wide range of subjects at the school including History, Scripture, Literature, Algebra, French, Political and Physical Geography.
* Beatrice taught for eleven years at this school, teaching mathematics there until 1913.
* In addition to her teaching mathematics at Streatham and Clapham High School, Beatrice worked at home doing computing work in her spare time.
* were among six collaborators who worked on a large scale study of child development, overseen by Pearson, that analysed data collected from over 4000 children, including some of Beatrice's high school students.
* Both sisters Cave-Browne-Cave were among the six collaborators who worked on the project.
* Beatrice Cave-Browne-Cave collected data from her high school students.
* Only a few assistants, including Frances and Beatrice Cave-Browne-Cave, processed the data, creating tables, and computing correlations.
* In 1913 Beatrice left her teaching position at Streatham and Clapham High School and took a position working with Karl Pearson at University College London.
* In 1914 the paper Numerical Illustrations of the Variate Difference Correlation Method was published in Biometrika with the joint authors Beatrice M Cave and Karl Pearson.
* Notice that the first paper mentioned in this introduction is by Beatrice's sister Evelyn Cave-Browne-Cave.
* A second paper involving Beatrice, On the Distribution of the Correlation Coefficient in Small Samples.
* Let us note that these authors are: Herbert Edward Soper (1865-1930); Andrew White Young; Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne Cave; Alice Lee; and Karl Pearson.
* By the time this paper had appeared in print, Beatrice had left her position working with Karl Pearson at the Galton Laboratory of University College London.
* In August 1916, Beatrice Cave-Browne-Cave announced that she would leave the laboratory to take a better paying position with the Ministry of Munitions.
* Also in 1917 Beatrice constructed correlation tables based on a series of mice breeding experiments made by Raphael Weldon, who had worked at University College.
* In 1920 Bairstow was appointed Professor of Aerodynamics at the Imperial College, London and asked Beatrice and Eleanor Lang to become his assistants at Imperial College.
* Beatrice continued to work at the Department of Aeronautics until she retired in 1937.
* Her father, four of her siblings (Evelyn and her two brothers), and many others named Cave-Browne-Cave are buried in St Peter's Churchyard.
* We promised further details of Beatrice's brothers.
* Thomas Reginald Cave-Browne-Cave attended Dulwich College and became an Engineering Officer in the Royal Navy.
* Despite working on projects not dissimilar to those that Beatrice worked on, there is no evidence that they cooperated on research.
* Henry Meyrick Cave-Browne-Cave initially followed a similar career to his brother, being trained at Dulwich College, and becoming an Engineering Officer in the Royal Navy.

Born 30 May 1874, Streatham Common, London, England. Died 9 July 1947, Streatham Common, London, England.
