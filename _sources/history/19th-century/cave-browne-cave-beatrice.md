**Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave** studied the mathematical tripos at Girton College Cambridge. She the taught mathematics at a High School for eleven years before becoming an assistant to Karl Pearson in the Galton Laboratory of University College, London. She later became an assistant to Leonard Bairstow in the Department of Aeronautics at the Imperial College, London. She published two papers with Pearson and two with Bairstow.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Thomas Cave-Browne-Cave was a civil servant who became Deputy Accountant-General of the Army from 1897 to 1900 and a Commissioner of the Royal Hospital Chelsea from 1899 to 1923.
* Beatrice was brought up in quite privileged circumstances.
* At Cambridge, Beatrice was in the same year as G H Hardy and James Hopwood Jeans.
* The Headmistress when Beatrice was appointed was Reta Oldham (1861-1933) who had taught a wide range of subjects at the school including History, Scripture, Literature, Algebra, French, Political and Physical Geography.
* Beatrice taught for eleven years at this school, teaching mathematics there until 1913.
* In addition to her teaching mathematics at Streatham and Clapham High School, Beatrice worked at home doing computing work in her spare time.
* Beatrice Cave-Browne-Cave collected data from her high school students.
* Only a few assistants, including Frances and Beatrice Cave-Browne-Cave, processed the data, creating tables, and computing correlations.
* In 1913 Beatrice left her teaching position at Streatham and Clapham High School and took a position working with Karl Pearson at University College London.
* In 1914 the paper Numerical Illustrations of the Variate Difference Correlation Method was published in Biometrika with the joint authors Beatrice M Cave and Karl Pearson.
* A second paper involving Beatrice, On the Distribution of the Correlation Coefficient in Small Samples.
* By the time this paper had appeared in print, Beatrice had left her position working with Karl Pearson at the Galton Laboratory of University College London.
* In August 1916, Beatrice Cave-Browne-Cave announced that she would leave the laboratory to take a better paying position with the Ministry of Munitions.
* Also in 1917 Beatrice constructed correlation tables based on a series of mice breeding experiments made by Raphael Weldon, who had worked at University College.
* In 1920 Bairstow was appointed Professor of Aerodynamics at the Imperial College, London and asked Beatrice and Eleanor Lang to become his assistants at Imperial College.
* Beatrice continued to work at the Department of Aeronautics until she retired in 1937.
* Thomas Reginald Cave-Browne-Cave attended Dulwich College and became an Engineering Officer in the Royal Navy.
* Despite working on projects not dissimilar to those that Beatrice worked on, there is no evidence that they cooperated on research.

Born 30 May 1874, Streatham Common, London, England. Died 9 July 1947, Streatham Common, London, England.
