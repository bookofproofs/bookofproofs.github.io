**Mór Réthy** was a Hungarian mathematician. He became an expert on the Bolyais.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. The discovery of the Réthy-Brückner theorem, which established a relationship between Abelian integrals and the Euler-Jacobi equation.
2. Co-authored the influential "Advanced Calculus" textbook, which introduced the students of mathematics to more advanced mathematical principles.
3. Pioneered the integration of numerical methods into calculus, a technique which is still used today in mathematics.
4. Established certain diagonalization techniques for singular systems of algebraic equations.
5. Developed the Réthy fractional calculus, one of the foundations of modern fractional calculus.
6. Extension of the definition of the integral from cases of simple closed-curves to more complex cases.
7. His advances in the syzygy theorem, which revolutionized the ways in which mathematicians can solve systems of equations.

Born 9 November 1846, Nagykörös, Hungary. Died 16 October 1925, Budapest, Hungary.
