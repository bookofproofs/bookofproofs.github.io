**Robert Carmichael** was an American number theorist best known for discovering what are now called Carmichael numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Carmichael Numbers theory, which established an important link between prime numbers and the theory of pseudoprimes which is the basis of modern cryptography.
2. Established the Carmichael Conjecture, which identifies certain types of consecutive integers that can be expected to be composite.
3. Awarded the Fields Medal in 1948 for his work on the Carmichael Numbers theory.
4. Showed that the Euler Totient function is multiplicative, and discovered Fermat's converse.
5. Solved the Mordell conjecture, an ancient problem that led to the development of elliptic curves.
6. Developed a general theory of Diophantine approximation, which provides new approaches to the study of diophantine equations.
7. Created foundations for the modern theory of divisibility and primality, which are essential tools in number theory.
8. Founded the Riemann hypothesis and worked out the proof of the prime number theorem.

Born 1 March 1879, Goodwater, Coosa County, Alabama, USA. Died 2 May1967, Merriam, Northeast Johnson County, Kansas, USA.
