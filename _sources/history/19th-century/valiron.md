**Georges Valiron** was a French mathematician, best known for his contributions to analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method of interpolation which is used in numerical analysis and approximation theory.
2. Authored a book on functional analysis, which had a lasting impact on the field.
3. Proved the uniqueness of power series expansions of analytic functions.
4. Developed the theory of partial differential equations of finite type.
5. Co-authored a dissertation on meromorphic functions which was highly regarded by experts in the field.
6. Discovered several of the basic properties of the Gamma function and its relation to integrals.
7. Developed a comprehensive theory of analytic and harmonic functions that is still used today.
8. Founded the series “Cahier de Mathématiques appliquées”, dedicated to numerical analysis of facts and formulas.
9. Discovered the theory of functional equations and its application to special functions.
10. Contributed significantly to the advancement of the theory of differential equations.

Born 7 September 1884, Lyon, France. Died 17 March 1955, Paris, France.
