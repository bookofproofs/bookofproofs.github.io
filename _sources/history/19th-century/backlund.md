**Victor Bäcklund** wasa Swedish physicist and mathematician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of Bäcklund transformations, which are transformations of a given set of differential equations into a new set of equations. 
2. Made important contributions to the development of the theory of elliptic functions, which he subsequently eleborated in his book “Theory of Elliptic Functions.” 
3. Co-authored the paper “On Some Characteristic Functions and their Zeros” alongside Harry Bateman.
4. Discovered the Liouville-Ostrograsky equation.
5. Developed a simplified formula for certain integrals when expressed as a contour integral. 
6. Proved that an infinite series can be expressed in terms of a double contour integral.
7. Established the author's theorem on the Bäcklund transformations. 
8. Co-developed the concept of hyperelliptic functions.

Born 11 January 1845, Väsby, Malmöhus County, Sweden. Died 23 February 1922, Lund, Sweden.
