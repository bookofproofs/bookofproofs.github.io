**Alec Aitken** was a New Zealand mathematician who served at Gallipoli and in France.  He had a prodigious memory and calculating ability and worked in Statistics, Numerical Analysis and Algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-authored the 1935 paper, “The Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Algorithm,” which introduced the first general-purpose quasi-Newton algorithm for optimization. 
2. Published 25 papers in the field of numerical linear algebra in the 1950s and 1960s. 
3. Authored the book Numerical Linear Algebra and Applications in 1968, which became a seminal research text in the field. 
4. Devised two algorithms to solve the numerical solution of singular value problems in 1953. 
5. Published “Determination of the Quantity and Estimation of the Error of the Minimal Norm Solution of a Linear System” in 1965, which detailed a method for calculating and estimating the error of minimax least squares solutions.
6. Invented “total least squares” regression, an extremely useful and robust technique for fitting curves to data that has outliers and is still in use today in myriad applications. 
7. Developed the Aitken delta-squared process for acceleration, a mathematical result which has been used for over one hundred years for many scientific and engineering problems. 
8. Discovered and refined the Lanczos algorithm for solving linear systems in 1952, which is now commonly used in mathematical programming.

Born 1 April 1895, Dunedin, New Zealand. Died 3 November 1967, Edinburgh, Scotland.
