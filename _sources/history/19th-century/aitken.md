**Alec Aitken** was a New Zealand mathematician who served at Gallipoli and in France.  He had a prodigious memory and calculating ability and worked in Statistics, Numerical Analysis and Algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Alec's mother, Elizabeth Towers, emigrated with her family to New Zealand from Wolverhampton, England, when she was eight years old.
* Alexander Aitken, Alec's grandfather on his father's side, had emigrated from Lanarkshire in Scotland to Otago in New Zealand in 1868, and began farming near Dunedin.
* Alec's father, William Aitken, was one of his fourteen children and William began his working life on his father's farm.
* William and Elizabeth had seven children, Alec being the eldest.
* In the year he graduated, Aitken married Mary Winifred Betts who was a botany lecturer at Otago University.
* Aitken followed his original intention and became a school teacher at his old school Otago Boys' High School.
* His mathematical genius bubbled under the surface and, encouraged by R J T Bell the new professor of mathematics at Otago University, Aitken came to Scotland in 1923 and studied for a Ph.D. at Edinburgh under Whittaker.
* Aitken's wife, Mary, had continued to lecture at Otago up to the time they left for Edinburgh.
* Even before the award of the degree, Aitken was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1925.
* Aitken had an incredible memory (he knew Ï€ to 2000 places) and could instantly multiply, divide and take roots of large numbers.
* Aitken's mathematical work was in statistics, numerical analysis, and algebra.
* Aitken wrote several books, one of the most famous being The theory of canonical matrices (1932) which was written jointly with Turnbull.
* For the latter Professor Aitken would ask for members of the class to give him numbers for which he would then write down the reciprocal, the square root, the cube root or other appropriate expression.
* However for Aitken memories did not fade and, for example, his horrific memories of the battle of the Somme lived with him as real as the day he lived them.
* Finally we should mention Aitken's love of music.

Born 1 April 1895, Dunedin, New Zealand. Died 3 November 1967, Edinburgh, Scotland.
