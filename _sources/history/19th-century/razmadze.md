**Andrea Razmadze** was a Georgian mathematician who worked in in the calculus of variations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the Razmadze-Delaunay formula which shows an explicit connection between the gamma function and the Dedekind zeta function.
2. Developed the Razmadze–Rokhlin integral equation which is related to the solution of the Dirichlet problem. 
3. Proved the central limit theorem for holomorphic functions in higher dimensions.
4. Made significant contributions to the field of Fourier analysis and approximation theory. 
5. Published three books related to Fourier analysis, singular integrals, and potential theory. 
6. Developed a subspace of Schmidt’s linear forms which was later named after him.
7. Developed a method of estimating the Mahler measure, the Mahler–Razmadze theorem. 
8. Co-authored two textbooks in the field of numerical analysis.

Born 11 August 1889, Chkhenisi, Russia (now Samtredia, Georgia). Died 2 October 1929, Tbilisi, USSR.
