**Johann Heinrich Graf** was a Swiss mathematician who worked mainly on the Bessel functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of the Bernoulli numbers and proved their existence.
2. Provided the first general proof of Taylor's theorem.
3. Proved the Binomial Theorem and derived the formula for the binomial coefficients.
4. Introduced the concept of the Stirling numbers of the second kind.
5. Developed the concept of telescoping series and provided a general formula for them.
6. Established the integral test for the convergence of a series.
7. Developed the "Graf formula" that describes the complex part of a real logarithmic integral.
8. Obtained an analytical expression for the partition function of an integer.
9. Found a closed expression for the sum of the powers of an alternating series.
10. Established a formula for the sum of the geometric series and provided a proof of Euler's theorem.

Born 16 August 1852, Töss, Zürich, Switzerland. Died 17 June 1918, Bern, Switzerland.
