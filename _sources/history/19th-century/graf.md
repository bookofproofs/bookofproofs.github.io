### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After having attended primary school in Töss and secondary school in Zürich, Graf studied at the private teachers' college Muristalden, close to Bern, from 1868-1871.
* Graf was awarded his doctorate for his thesis Beiträge zur Theorie der Riemann'schen Fläche Ⓣ(Contributions to the theory of the Riemann surface)  in 1877.
* Graf's main mathematical interests were in Bessel functions, gamma functions and spherical functions.
* Today he is best known for Graf addition theorems for Bessel functions and other such functions.
* Graf also took a keen interest in actuarial sciences; he published a number of papers on insurance funds and lectured on actuarial mathematics from 1902-1918 at the University of Bern.
* Graf also edited Schläfli's correspondence with Steiner, Arthur Cayley and Carl Borchardt.
* Throughout his life, Graf held a large number of administrative positions.
* For most of his professional life, Graf was a member of the Swiss and the Bernese Societies for Natural Scientists; he was the editor of the communications of the Bernese society from 1883-1910.
