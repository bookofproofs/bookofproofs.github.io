**Julius Petersen** was a Danish mathematician who worked on geometry and graph theory. He is best remembered for the _Petersen graph_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* From his early childhood Julius was friends with Hieronymous Georg Zeuthen who lived four houses away on the same street.
* Julius first attended a private school in Soro then, in 1849, he entered Soro Academy School.
* Most of the pupils at the school were boarders but the school also admitted some day pupils like Julius who lived in the town.
* His family were poor and although they had tried their best to give Julius a good education, by 1854 he had to leave school since his parents could no longer afford to keep him there.
* Petersen had an uncle who worked in Kolding, Jutland, and he went there to work as a grocery apprentice to his uncle.
* After about a year his uncle died and left some money to Petersen.
* He was considered a good teacher of mathematics, but school teaching did present a great problem to Petersen for he seemed incapable of controlling the pupils.
* Petersen was awarded his doctorate in 1871.
* Petersen corresponded with Sylow during 1870-71, mostly about this result.
* His friend and colleague at the University of Copenhagen was Zeuthen who was almost exactly the same age as Petersen.
* Petersen also taught at the Officers School of the Army from 1881 to 1887.
* Petersen was enthusiastic about such matters and joined a committee to support Georg Brandes but this was short lived.
* Petersen joined the National Economic Society and translated an economics text by Henry Fawcett into Danish.
* These days Petersen's theorem is always proven indirectly using major results such as Hall's theorem from 1935 and Tutte's theorem on 1-factors from 1947.
* Although the Petersen graph is usually the first time an undergraduate will today come across his name, this does not appear in this 1891 masterpiece.
* It is reasonable to ask why Petersen began working in graph theory.
* the work of Petersen and Zeuthen is regarded as being responsible for the emergence of Danish mathematics on the international scene towards the end of the 19th  century.
* In the last part of his career, from 1888 to 1909, Petersen worked on function theory, latin squares, and number theory.
* Petersen contributed to many areas other than mathematics, some of which we have mentioned above.
* Petersen was also a founder member of the Danish Mathematical Society, which came into existence in 1873, and he remained a very active member of the Society.

Born 16 June 1839, Soro, Denmark. Died 5 August 1910, Copenhagen, Denmark.
