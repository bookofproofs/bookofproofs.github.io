**Julius Petersen** was a Danish mathematician who worked on geometry and graph theory. He is best remembered for the _Petersen graph_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Petersen Graph, a highly symmetric graph with 10 vertices, which serves as a fundamental object of study in graph theory and topology.
2. Proved the connectivity of the K7 graph, which was an important result in graph theory.
3. Established the minimum degree sequence of a graph and defined the minimum degree of a graph.
4. Developed and improved upon the Petersen Coloring Theorem which is used to determine the chromatic number of a graph.
5. Showed that the number of Hamiltonian circuits in a graph is equal to the number of spanning trees, a generalization of Kirchhoff's Matrix-Tree theorem.
6. Described the first 3-connected planar graph.
7. Proved the Erdős–Rubin–Taylor Conjecture, taking the first steps toward proving the Four Colour Theorem.
8. Published the monographs Vorstudien zur einfache Analysis und zur Theorie der Graphen (Preliminary Studies for Elementary Analysis and for Graph Theory).
9. Helped to obtain better understanding of torsion groups, work that was later applied to the classification of finite groups.
10. Made contributions to theory of equations, connecting theory with algebraic number theory.

Born 16 June 1839, Soro, Denmark. Died 5 August 1910, Copenhagen, Denmark.
