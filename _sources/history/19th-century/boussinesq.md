**Joseph  Boussinesq**  was a French mathematician and physicist who made contributions to the theory of hydrodynamics, vibration, light, and heat.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical description of heat conduction that is now called the Boussinesq equations.
2. Demonstrated the usefulness of dimensional analysis for solving physical problems.
3. Constructed the first model that explains wave propagation in shallow water, which forms the basis of most wave models used today.
4. Proposed mathematical models to describe the evolution of ocean tides, which are still used today.
5. established the mathematical theory of solitons for nonlinear systems.
6. Developed an important mathematical tool in the field of hydrodynamics known as Boussinesq scaling.
7. Demonstrated that wave action can be represented using vector equations and identified the wave height-frequency relationship known as the Boussinesq Distribution.
8. Utilized the fluid mechanics principles to explain the phenomenon of wave-induced currents, sediment transport, and bottom alignment of sedimentary structures.
9. Provided the foundation for modern physical oceanography by introducing mathematical models of ocean circulation, waves, and tides.
10. Developed a more accurate description of vertical turbulent exchanges in shallow seas than previous models.

Born 13 March 1842, Saint-André de Sangonis, Hérault, France. Died 19 February 1929, Paris, France.
