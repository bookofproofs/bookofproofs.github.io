**Thomas Heath** wrote important works on the History of Mathematics: in particular on the mathematics of the ancient Greeks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Heath was then private secretary to various financial secretaries at the Treasury up to 1907 when he was appointed Assistant secretary to the Treasury.
* However Heath had two separate careers, one as a civil servant, the other as one of the leading world experts on the history of mathematics.
* Archimedes was published in 1897 but at this stage the important work called The Method had not been discovered, so Heath added a translation of this in an edition he brought out in 1912.
* In 1908 Heath's three volume work on Euclid appeared.
* Heath was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1912 and served for two terms on its council.
* One might think that having a career in the Civil Service and yet being a leading historian of mathematics would leave Heath little time for other hobbies but in fact this was not so.

Born 5 October 1861, Barnetby le Wold, Lincoln, England. Died 16 March 1940, Ashtead, Surrey, England.
