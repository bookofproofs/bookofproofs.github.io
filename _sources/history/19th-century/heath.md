**Thomas Heath** wrote important works on the History of Mathematics: in particular on the mathematics of the ancient Greeks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the four volumes of "Mathematics in Aristotle", which became the standard work on the mathematical thought of the ancient Greeks.
2. Published mathematical works on Euclidean Geometry and the application of mathematics to natural philosophy. 
3. Engaged in pioneering studies of the history of Greek mathematics and the relationships between Greek mathematics and its successors in the Middle Eastern and European world. 
4. Invested much of his early career developing mathematical techniques for integrating partial differential equations.
5. Mentored several of the major figures in mathematics of the day including Joseph Fourier, Adrien-Marie Legendre, and Carl Friedrich Gauss. 
6. Conducted two successful expeditions to remote areas of Greece to make archaeological and scientific surveys.
7. Published many seminal works on mathematics, including of the Calculus of Attraction, his Contributions to the Analytical Theory of Heat, and his Treatise on Algebra.

Born 5 October 1861, Barnetby le Wold, Lincoln, England. Died 16 March 1940, Ashtead, Surrey, England.
