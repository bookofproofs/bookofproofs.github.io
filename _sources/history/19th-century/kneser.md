**Adolf Kneser** was a German mathematician who wrote on integral equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established one of the foundations of modern algebraic geometry with his concept of complete ideals.
2. Developed the first algebraic characterizations of curves and surfaces in modern geometry.
3. Developed the branch of mathematics known as numerically equivalent functions, which deals with analysing and approximating functions.
4. Pioneered the modern foundations of algebraic number theory.
5. Discovered an important theorem known as the Noether-Kneser theorem.
6. Instituted a new theory of convergent sequences that is now known as Kneser's theorem.
7. Developed a better equivalent to Euclidean geometry known as projective geometry.
8. Demonstrated the freedom of certain fundamental geometric concepts, such as continuity and infinity.
9. Solved a long standing problem concerning the sum of kth powers of algebraic integers.
10. Advanced the theory of linear forms in logarithms, theorem proving and diophantine analysis.

Born 19 March 1862, Grüssow, Mecklenburg, Germany. Died 24 January 1930, Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland).
