**Adolf Kneser** was a German mathematician who wrote on integral equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Adolf was one of his parents four sons and his mother, after the death of her husband, moved from Grüssow to Rostock where the boys could be educated.
* Adolf's secondary schooling took place in Rostock, and after this was complete he entered the University there.
* His remarkable talents are easily illustrated for even at this very early stage in his education, Kneser published his first paper which was on the refraction of sound waves.
* We should remark, however, that Kneser's interests were surprisingly broad and during his university studies he attended lectures on history, literature and philosophy.
* Kneser submitted his habilitation thesis to the University of Marburg where he taught for a while, then he moved to Breslau (now Wrocław in Poland) where he also lectured.
* It was while he held this chair that Kneser married Laura Booth in 1894.
* The couple had four sons; Hellmuth Kneser was born while they lived in Dorpat.
* A grandson of Adolf, and son of Hellmuth, was Martin Kneser who became a professor of mathematics holding a chair at Göttingen.
* In 1900 Adolf Kneser was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the Bergakademie  (Academy of Mining) in Berlin.
* Adolf Kneser's early work was on algebraic functions and equations.
* Kneser brought the theory of the so-called second variation to a certain conclusion.
* But above all, the decisive advances towards the solution of the so-called Mayer Problem, recently introduced to the calculus of variations, are due to Kneser.
* In 1911 Kneser published his famous text, Die Integralgleichungen und ihre Anwendungen in der mathematischen Physik: Vorlesungen an der Universität zu Breslau Ⓣ(The integral equations and their applications in mathematical physics: lectures given at the University of Wroclaw).
* Kneser's work, however, was surprisingly broad and he continued to show an interest in philosophy and knowledge theory which he had from his student days.

Born 19 March 1862, Grüssow, Mecklenburg, Germany. Died 24 January 1930, Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland).
