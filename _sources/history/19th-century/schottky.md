**Friedrich Schottky** was a German mathematician who worked on elliptic, abelian, and theta functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the concept of quadratic Diophantine equations and a method of solving them.
2. Developed the Schottky-Klein prime number theorem.
3. Developed the theory of elliptic functions.
4. Developed the theory of algebraic numbers, including the introduction of Class Field Theory in 1912.
5. Proved the Van der Waerden conjecture on arithmetic progressions.
6. Founded the Schottky groups, which are now an important part of algebraic geometry.
7. Undertook pioneering research in number theory, as evidenced in his book Anwendung der Theorie der Riemann’schen Flachen auf Algebraische Functionen(Applications of Riemann’s Theory of Surfaces to Algebraic Functions).
8. Introduced the concepts of hyperbolic functions and the Schottky double-cycle theorems.
9. Collected and studied ancient Greek mathematical manuscripts, including works of classical Greek mathematicians such as Euclid, Apollonius, Ptolemy et al.
10. Discovered the Schottky-Klein riemannian invariant and the association of Dirichlet functions with prime numbers.

Born 24 July 1851, Breslau, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 12 August 1935, Berlin, Germany.
