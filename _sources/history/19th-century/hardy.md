**Hardy**'s interests covered many topics of pure mathematics:- Diophantine analysis, summation of divergent series, Fourier series, the Riemann zeta function and the distribution of primes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He collaborated with J.E. Littlewood to develop theories and theorems in number theory, analysis, and mathematical analysis, which include the Hardy-Littlewood circle method and the prime number theorem.
2. He developed the Littlewood-Offord theorem and established the Schur's theorem.
3. He formulated the Hardy–Ramanujan theorem in the theory of partitions.
4. He introduced and popularized the "Taxicab problem" in mathematics.
5. He introduced the Ramanujan prime.
6. He created the Hardy-Srinivasa Ramanujan Number Theory.
7. He wrote down the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which became an important part of population genetics.
8. He invented the method of ‘Error-free polynomials in lattice point problems.
9. He introduced the Hardy-Littlewood maximal theorem.
10. He provided answers to important problems such as Goldbach's Conjecture

Born 7 February 1877, Cranleigh, Surrey, England. Died 1 December 1947, Cambridge, England.
