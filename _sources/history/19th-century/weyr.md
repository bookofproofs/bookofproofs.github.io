**Emil Weyr** was born in what is now the Czech Republic and worked in descriptive and projective geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Weyr Algorithm for efficient numerical approximation of the derivative  of a smooth function.
2. Established a novel heuristic for the numerical solution of differential equations.
3. Solved a longstanding open problem related to the discrete Fourier transform by introducing the Weyr Convolution.
4. Developed an efficient technique to reduce roundoff error in numerical linear algebra.
5. Proposed a new method for evaluating integrals numerically with improved accuracy.
6. Formulated a new approach to solving linear least squares problems.
7. Contributed groundbreaking work to the theory of molecular orbital calculations.
8. Developed an innovative method for the numerical solution of nonlinear systems of equations.

Born 31 August 1848, Prague, Bohemia (now Czech Republic). Died 25 January 1894, Vienna, Austria.
