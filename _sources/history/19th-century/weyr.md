**Emil Weyr** was born in what is now the Czech Republic and worked in descriptive and projective geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* According to the parish records, Emil was born on 1 September 1848 and he was baptised in St Stephen's Church in the Upper New Town of Prague on 3 September.
* Emil entered the elementary school of Our Lady of the Snows in 1854 where he was taught by František Petter.
* Weyr was an excellent student and began publishing papers during his undergraduate studies.
* Weyr volunteered to do one year's military service, from March 1869 to January 1870.
* The physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach (1838-1916), had been appointed as professor of Experimental Physics at the Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in 1867 and he encouraged Weyr to habilitate at the Charles University.
* In the summer of 1870, Weyr began preparing to go to Paris having been awarded a state scholarship to fund his visit.
* Weyr quickly changed his plans and decided instead to visit Italy.
* The first two volumes had Emil as the main author while Eduard was the main contributor to the third volume.
* In April 1871 Emil Weyr set off on a sightseeing tour of Italy, visiting Padua, Bologna, Pisa, Florence, Rome, and Naples.
* In a reaction to his stay in Italy, Emil Weyr wrote 22 works in 1871 (13 German, 8 Italian, 1 Czech), 11 works in 1872 (6 German, 3 Czech, 2 Italian) and 11 works in 1873 (5 German, 4 Czech, 2 Italian).
* Weyr returned to Italy for another visit in April 1873.
* His main task on this trip was to have further discussions with Luigi Cremona since Weyr was translating Cremona's books.
* Among many works Emil Weyr published were Die Elemente der projectivischen Geometrie Ⓣ(Elements of projective geometry) and Über die Geometrie der alten Aegypter Ⓣ(On the geometry of the ancient Egyptians).
* Weyr, with great skill and ingenuity, became a great master of this method and produced many results using his approach.
* Together with the Austrian mathematician Gustav Ritter von Escherich (1849-1935), Emil Weyr founded the important mathematical journal Monatshefte für Mathematik und Physik in 1890.
* In 1891 Emil Weyr became one of the first 19 founder members of the Royal Czech Academy of Sciences.
* If among Austrian middle school teachers geometric knowledge and understanding of the methods of geometry are widely used, that is mostly due to Weyr.

Born 31 August 1848, Prague, Bohemia (now Czech Republic). Died 25 January 1894, Vienna, Austria.
