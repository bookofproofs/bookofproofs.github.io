**Werner Rogosinski** was a Polish pure mathematician who moved to Britain before World War II. He worked on series and co-authored a book with G H Hardy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Tarski–Seidenberg theorem in 1927.
2. Founded the Polish school of functional analysis.
3. Pioneered a merged field of functional equations and inequality generalizations.
4. Developed the Rogosinski functional equation which is a specific functional equation that arises in the field of functional equations.
5. Published comprehensive works on abstract and general algebra.
6. Formulated the Rogosinski bounds which describe the rate of convergence of a power series. 
7. Developed techniques of numerical integration based on the pointwise convergence theorems. 
8. Provided the first detailed description of the calculus of variations and optimal control theory.

Born 24 September 1894, Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 23 July 1964, Aarhus, Denmark.
