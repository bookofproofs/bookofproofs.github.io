**Thomas Hakon Grönwall** was a Swedish mathematician who applied mathematics to chemical and physical problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His parents were Carl Theodor Grönwall and Laura Elisabeth Billqvist.
* For this his friend was banned from the university for half a year and Grönwall, then a Ph.D. and an extraordinary student at KTH, was banned for the same period.
* Naturally enough, Grönwall thought this to be too much for too little and left Stockholm to study at the Charlottenberg Technical Institute in Berlin.
* Only a mathematician with Grönwall's gift for analysis and most uncommon grasp of the literature of chemistry and physics could have contributed the elegant solution which he gave.
* In our several years of close association, Grönwall was never too busy to instruct the writer or his collaborators in elementary and tedious details of mathematical technique.
* Grönwall's work contains classical analysis (Fourier series, Gibbs phenomenon, summability theory, Laplace and Legendre series), differential and integral equations, analytic number theory (transcendental numbers, divisor function, LLL-function of Dirichlet), complex function theory (Dirichlet LLL-series, conformal mappings, univalent functions), differential geometry, mathematical physics (problems of elasticity, ballistics, induction, potential theory, kinetic theory of gases, optics), nomography, atomic physics (wave mechanics of hydrogen and helium atom, lattice theory of crystals) and physical chemistry where he is especially known as a very important contributor.
* Such names as Grönwall's inequality or Grönwall's lemma, Grönwall's summability method and Grönwall's theorem are known in the mathematical literature.
* Grönwall is now mainly remembered for the Grönwall inequality.
* The Grönwall summation method of series appeared in 1932 as a generalization of de la Vallée Poussin and Cesáro summation methods (cf.
* Grönwall published 86 papers and communicated the results of 24 investigations to the Society, the details of which are still unpublished.

Born 16 January 1877, Dylta bruk, Sweden. Died 9 May 1932, New York, USA.
