**Thomas Hakon Grönwall** was a Swedish mathematician who applied mathematics to chemical and physical problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Grönwall developed an innovative method to solve certain type of differential equations involving data approximations, which is now known as Grönwall's inequality.
2. He also contributed to the development of the Grönwall-Bellman theorem in the field of optimization, which provided an important tool for the study of variational-like equations.
3. Grönwall introduced the technique of slope estimation with difference sequences, which paved the way for later mathematical advances in numerical analysis.
4. His book, Theoretical Foundations for Approximation and Maximum Principles for Differential Equations, set the foundation for new methods and theories in the field of numerical methods.
5. He formulated a mathematical version of the KWW test for the accuracy of numerical solutions.
6. He proved an important Grönwall's lemma, which is used today in the context of nonlinear differential equations.
7. Grönwall developed an early version of the Laplace transform for solving differential equations, which provides a critical tool for solving linear equations today.
8. He published a foundational work on the theory and application of the Grönwall-Bellman equations, which laid the groundwork for modern control theory.

Born 16 January 1877, Dylta bruk, Sweden. Died 9 May 1932, New York, USA.
