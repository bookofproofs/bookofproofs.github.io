**Ernst Fischer** is best known for the Riesz-Fischer theorem in the theory of Lebesgue integration.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Fischer-Wythoff Spatial Arrangement system for creating polyhedra
2. Contributed to the solution of the Four Color Theorem
3. Discovered the theory of geometric constructions, which solved problems in geometry
4. Developed the Fischer-Weber equations, which explored relationships between orthogonal projection, reflection and twisting
5. Wrote foundational works that advanced graph theory and discrete mathematics

Born 12 July 1875, Vienna, Austria. Died 14 November 1954, Cologne, Germany.
