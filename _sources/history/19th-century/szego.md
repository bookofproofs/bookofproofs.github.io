3. Authored several books and papers on analytic functions, integral equations, and numerical analysis.
4. Coined the concept of orthogonal polynomials.
5. Authored the influential book Orthogonal Polynomials in 1952.
6. Proved the Herglotz-Nevanlinna Representation Theorem.
7. Contributor to the establishment of the Szegő Asymptotic Formula.

Born 20 January 1895, Kunhegyes, Hungary. Died 7 August 1985, Palo Alto, California USA.
