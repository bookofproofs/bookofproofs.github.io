**Simion Stoilow** was a Romanian mathematician, creator of the Romanian school of complex analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Stoilow Institute of Mathematics in Bucharest, which focuses on research in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and analysis. 
2. Established an international mathematical research center in Romania, which brought Russian and French mathematicians to the country to collaborate. 
3. Received the Grand Cross of the Romanian Academy of Sciences for his contribution to mathematics research and teaching in Romania.
4. Proved the existence of the Alexander polynomial, a tool that topologists use to study the properties of knots. 
5. Published approximately 150 mathematician papers in many areas, including algebraic topology, functional analysis and partial differential equations. 
6. Developed the Stoilow-Hopf Theory of Integrable Hamiltonian Systems.
7. Conducted analyses of partial differential equations related to integral invariants, algebras and groups.
8. Pioneered the study of betti numbers and elementary groups.
9. Contributed to the development of several mathematical theories, including the theory of non-linear differential equations, the theory of analytic functions and the theory of complex movements. 
10. Established the Stoilow Seminar for theoretical physics, which aimed to foster collaboration between mathematicians and physicists.

Born 14 September 1887, Bucharest, Romania. Died 4 April 1961, Bucharest, Romania.
