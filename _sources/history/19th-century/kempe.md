**Alfred Kempe** published a false "proof" of the four colour theorem in 1879 which stood until Heawood showed the mistake 11 years later. The 'proof' is however still the basis for the computer aided proof discovered 100 years later.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the four color theorem (in 1879).
2. Resolved the Maxwell-Thomson problem, showing that the regular polyhedral shapes of which any two-dimensional section is closed, convex, and equal can only have three, four, or five sides.
3. Formulated a method of addressing the decision problem, using what is now known as Kempe chains.
4. Developed a crucial and wide-ranging series of results in graph theory and matroid theory (1878 and 1880).
5. Proved the Kempe-Heawood conjecture (1890).
6. Characterized the four-connected, triangulated planar graphs with no five-cycles (1890).
7. Showed that any n-dimensional, n-vertex convex polytope can be represented as the solution set of a system of linear equations, inequalities, and equalities (1890). 
8. Discovered an algorithm for determining a point in the convex hull of a set (1890).

Born 6 July 1849, Kensington, London, England. Died 21 April 1922, London, England.
