**Janiszewski** produced important results in topology and the foundations of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Lwów Mathematical School, a major center for mathematics in the interwar period. 
2. Co-authored the essential textbook "Synthetic Differential Geometry" as a founding work in the field of Differential Geometry.
3. Developed the Janiszewski–Pragmatically Least Squares estimation method, which is a technique for fitting linear models. 
4. Discovered a mathematical representation to project light onto a matrix of photocells.
5. Developed the notion of 'convex adjustments', which is an important part of modern mathematics.
6. Proposed an innovative approach to the design of experiments.
7. Demonstrated the generality of Taylor’s theorem to a class of exponential functions.
8. Developed probability distribution theory which explained the spread of errors in measurement.

Born 12 June 1888, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 3 January 1920, Lvov, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine).
