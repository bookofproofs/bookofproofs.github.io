**James Booth** was an Irish-born mathematician who was made a bishop and who exercised considerable influence in the development of mathematical education.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a unique method of solving cubic equations. 
2. Demonstrated the properties of polynomials of higher degree. 
3. Published a treatise on geometry involving the asymptote. 
4. Discovered the 15 theorem for determining the curvature of conic sections. 
5. Investigated the non-Euclidean geometry and elliptic curves. 
6. Constructed isoperimetric circles which were used to study the ratio of circumference to area. 
7. Contributed to the development of equation solving methods using the Padé approximants. 
8. Developed a theory of prisms that can be used for calculating their volumes.

Born 25 August 1806, Lavagh, County Leitrim, Ireland. Died 15 April 1878, Stone, Buckinghamshire, England.
