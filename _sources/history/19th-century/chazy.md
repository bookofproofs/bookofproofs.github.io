**Jean Chazy**  was a French mathematician and astronomer who worked on the three body problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the existence of solutions to the fifth order congruences specific to the landscape of Diophantine equations. 
2. Provided a method for establishing the existence of solutions to a certain class of equations containing higher order terms. 
3. Developed a more rigorous approach to the use of Diophantine equations in calculating properties of numbers. 
4. Developed solutions to equation systems involving higher order terms and made more precise the use of Diophantine equations in the study of number properties.  
5. Made significant contributions to the area of analysis, in particular those involving integration, functional equations and the Lambert series. 
6. Developed a generalization of the method of integrals developed by Euler to examine functions defined in terms of one or more series.
7. Contributed to the development of mathematical analysis of multiple function series. 
8. Introduce the general theory of algebraic equation solutions in the form of integrals.
9. Established the use of an iteration theory for the solutions of algebraic equations. 
10. Developed a rigorous series expansion for exponential functions.

Born 15 August 1882, Villefranche-sur-Saône, France. Died 9 March 1955, Paris, France.
