**Harlow Shapley** was an American astronomer who made important discoveries about the position of the sun in the galaxy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the size and shape of the Milky Way galaxy in 1921.
2. Advanced theories on the structure of globular star clusters and their importance to astronomy.
3. Coined the term "galactic astronomy" and was a pioneer in its study.
4. Was among the first to understand the importance of Cepheid variables for measuring distances in space.
5. Developed Shapley-Ames Catalog which was the first comprehensive catalog of galaxy magnitudes, diameters, and shapes in 1932.
6. Helped establish photometry as an observational technique and helped establish a methodology for measuring absolute brightness.
7. Published numerous papers on a wide range of topics including stellar composition, galactic structure, and stellar evolution.
8. Established mathematical concepts regarding individual stellar luminosity and interstellar absorption.

Born 2 November 1885, near Nashville, Missouri, USA. Died 20 October 1972, Boulder, Colorado, USA.
