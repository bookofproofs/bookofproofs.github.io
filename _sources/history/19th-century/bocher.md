**Maxime Bôcher** worked on differential equations, series, and algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Maxime's father, Ferdinand Bôcher, was professor of modern languages at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when Maxime was born and, in 1872, he became Professor of French at Harvard.
* Certainly Bôcher was born into a family with a strong academic background and he had a good quality education from his parents as well as from a number of public and private schools in Boston and Cambridge.
* Bôcher was awarded a Harvard Fellowship, a Harris Fellowship and a Parker Fellowship which allowed him to travel to Europe to undertake research.
* While Bôcher was in Göttingen he met Marie Niemann and they were married in July 1891 after Bôcher had submitted his doctoral thesis.
* The Bôchers had three children, Helen, Esther, and Frederick.
* Bôcher published around 100 papers on differential equations, series, and algebra.
* Bôcher was honoured by the American Mathematical Society when he was chosen to give the first series of Colloquium lectures in 1896.
* In 1912 Bôcher was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Cambridge, England.
* it is difficult to adequately appreciate Bôcher's influence on his time because so much of his work was devoted to perfecting and polishing material rather than to producing striking new results that would bear his name.

Born 28 August 1867, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Died 12 September 1918, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
