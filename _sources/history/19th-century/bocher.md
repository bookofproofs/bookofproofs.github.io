**Maxime Bôcher** worked on differential equations, series, and algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the concept of “Riemann sums” to the world of mathematics.
2. Authored the mathematics textbook Plane Analytic Geometry in 1907.
3. His research helped formulate the Bôcher Memorial Prize, a prestigious award bestowed each year by the American Mathematical Society to honor mathematicians who have made outstanding contributions to the field.
4. His insights into the mathematical works of Jean-Victor Poncelet ushered in a new understanding of the field of geometry, which is still used today.
5. Used the theory of Abelian functions to extend the theory of conformal transformations.
6. Developed a non-Euclidean geometry, which assumes that the fifth postulate of Euclidean geometry does not hold, allowing for different geometries to exist.
7. Published works on combinations, permutations, and analytic number theory.
8. Put forth a paper addressing the use of Riemann functions to resolve some of the fundamental problems faced in mathematical analysis.

Born 28 August 1867, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Died 12 September 1918, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
