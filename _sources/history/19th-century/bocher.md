**Maxime Bôcher** worked on differential equations, series, and algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Bôcher was awarded a Harvard Fellowship, a Harris Fellowship and a Parker Fellowship which allowed him to travel to Europe to undertake research.
* It required for its treatment not so much a specific knowledge of the theory of the potential, although Bôcher was thoroughly equipped on that side, even familiarity with the geometry of inversion, of which he made himself a master, but rather the power to carry through a piece of detailed analytic investigation with accuracy and skill ...
* Bôcher published around 100 papers on differential equations, series, and algebra.
* Bôcher was honoured by the American Mathematical Society when he was chosen to give the first series of Colloquium lectures in 1896.
* In 1912 Bôcher was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Cambridge, England.
* it is difficult to adequately appreciate Bôcher's influence on his time because so much of his work was devoted to perfecting and polishing material rather than to producing striking new results that would bear his name.
* In style and temperament Bôcher was a consummate artist ...

Born 28 August 1867, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Died 12 September 1918, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
