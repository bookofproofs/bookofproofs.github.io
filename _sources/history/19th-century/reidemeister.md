**Kurt Reidemeister** was a pioneer of knot theory and his work had a great influence on group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Kurt was certainly interested in mathematics when at the Gymnasium in Brunswick, but he had other broad interests, particularly in philosophy and in art history.
* Reidemeister graduated from the Brunswick Gymnasium in 1911 and entered the Albert-Ludwig University in Freiburg im Breisgau, one of the oldest universities in Germany founded in 1457.
* Reidemeister also attended lectures by the philosopher Heinrich Rickert (1863-1936) at Freiburg.
* As was the custom with German students of this period, Reidemeister attended several different universities, moving to Marburg and the Göttingen after his studies at Freiburg.
* However, Reidemeister did not become a Gymnasium teacher for, in October 1920, he went to Hamburg to take up the position of assistant to Erich Hecke.
* Against this background of hunger and poverty, Reidemeister studied algebraic number theory working on his doctorate advised by Hecke.
* Immediately he had written his doctoral thesis, Reidemeister became interested in geometry.
* The perspective and ideas that Blaschke presented, Reidemeister found absolutely fascinating and, quite unexpectedly, he completely changed the topics he was researching.
* Reidemeister gave a lecture on Spengler's book but he also wrote short stories and poems, publishing regularly in the leading Hamburg newspaper.
* On Hans Hahn's recommendation, despite having never habilitated, Reidemeister was appointed as associate professor of geometry at the University of Vienna in October 1923.
* It was Wirtinger who interested Reidemeister in knot theory, the topic for which he is best remembered today.
* In particular Wirtinger showed Reidemeister how to compute the fundamental group of a knot from its projection.
* In fact this move to Austria was very beneficial for Reidemeister since it allowed him to escape from the misery of hyper-inflation in Germany with the strikes and unrest which resulted.
* While in Vienna, Reidemeister came across the Tractatus by Wittgenstein and joined the Vienna Circle of Logical Positivists.
* Led by Reidemeister, the group of mathematicians at Vienna spent a year studying the deep ideas on logic and mathematics in the Tractatus.
* In 1925 Reidemeister was offered the chair in Königsberg which had been left vacant when Wilhelm Meyer retired, which he accepted.
* In 1930 the German Mathematical Congress met in Königsberg and Reidemeister organised the first international conference on the philosophy of mathematics to be a part of the larger Congress.
* Reidemeister worked on the foundations of geometry and he wrote an important book on knot theory Knoten und Gruppen Ⓣ(Knots and groups) (1926).
* In the first part Reidemeister discusses the foundations of algebra, and bases affine and projective geometries on them.
* Reidemeister devoted a whole mathematics lecture to explaining why the behaviour of these students was totally unsupportable and not compatible with rational thinking.
* The aging Reidemeister always had an attitude of being easily prone to moral outrage, an attitude which had its root here.
* Blaschke immediately tried to help his colleague and collected signatures on a petition seeking to reinstate Reidemeister.
* After being suspended from his chair, Reidemeister went to Rome where he continued to undertake research.
* Perhaps due to Blaschke's efforts, he was appointed to Kurt Hensel's chair in Marburg at what was considered a smaller and less prestigious university.
* In fact, as Professor Reidemeister describes in detail in the present treatise, combinatory topology turns out to be a well-defined partial domain of the theory of polyhedra - a fact well calculated to demonstrate the elementary character of the subject and to justify Professor Reidemeister in providing a new and systematic presentation of it.
* Reidemeister had an important influence on group theory, partly through his work on knots and groups, partly through his influence on Otto Schreier.
* After he went to Marburg, Reidemeister's interests became almost exclusively philosophy, the foundations of mathematics and the history of mathematics.
* Reidemeister spent the two years 1948-50 at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in the United States.
* In 1955 Reidemeister left Marburg when he was appointed to the University of Göttingen.

Born 13 October 1893, Brunswick, Germany. Died 8 July 1971, Göttingen, Germany.
