**Kurt Reidemeister** was a pioneer of knot theory and his work had a great influence on group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Reidemeister moves, a set of three moves which can be used to mathematically describe any change in a knot.
2. Created the concept of knot theory and laid the foundation for modern knot theory.
3. Established the importance of the Alexander polynomial, a knot invariant. 
4.Wrote the first book on Knotentheorie, introducing the concept to a wider audience.
5.Collaborated with Emmy Noether to explore the use of algebraic topology in knot theory.
6.Discoveried the “RRC theorem”, which provided the first solid evidence of the importance of knots and braids in mathematical topology.
7.Contributed to the creation of the Alexander-Conway polynomial, another knot invariant. 
8.Collaborated with fellow mathematicians to develop what is known as the "Kauffmann bracket." 
9.Provided early insights into the use of digital computers and computational topology, predating much of the modern research done in this field.

Born 13 October 1893, Brunswick, Germany. Died 8 July 1971, Göttingen, Germany.
