### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Upon his return to Switzerland, Weiler first worked as a mathematics lecturer at the Ryffel Institute in Stäfa (canton Zürich).
* Weiler also habilitated as Privatdozent at both the Polytechnic and the University of Zürich.
* At the beginning of the 20th  century Weiler supervised five doctoral students in total, but none of them became influential mathematicians.
* Weiler's research interests lay in Steiner geometry; in particular, he was interested in complexes and congruencies of rays.
* Weiler joined the organising committee of the first International Congress of Mathematicians in December 1896, but he did not have a specific position and is not mentioned in the committee minutes (except for the attendance records).
