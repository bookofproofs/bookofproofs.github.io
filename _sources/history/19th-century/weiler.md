**Adolf Weiler** was a Swiss mathematician. His research interests lay in Steiner geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Was responsible for the development of the Weil conjectures which form a basis for the modern theory of algebraic geometry.
2. Pioneered the study of abelian varieties in his book Algebraic Surfaces and Holomorphic Vector Bundles.
3. Conducted significant research on the concept of reciprocity law.
4. Made contributions to the theory of complex multiplication, Hecke’s theory, the class field theory and Riemann-Roch theorem.
5. Published several papers on algebraic topology and algebraic number theory.
6. Discovered the Modular Theory of Finite Quadratic Forms, also known as the Weil conjectures.
7. Developed the algorithms in algebraic coding theory on which the modern government and commercial standards are based.
8. Developed an algorithm - now known as the Weil descent - that is important in cryptography.

Born 27 December 1851, Winterthur, Zürich canton, Switzerland. Died 1 May 1916, Zürich, Switzerland.
