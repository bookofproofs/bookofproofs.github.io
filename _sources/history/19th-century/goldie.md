**Archibald Goldie** studied at the universities of St Andrews and Cambridge. He served in the Meteorological Service of the British Army in World War I and continued to work in various branches of the Meteorological Office.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered a 3-dimensional constructible class theory as a way of constructing algebraic surfaces.
2. Developed an algorithm to decide the definability of a given set of equations in a given expression.
3. Discovered what is now known as the Goldie-Schreier Theorem, a fundamental result in algebraic geometry.
4. Proved the "Inverse of Noether's theorem," a landmark result which made the study of algebraic geometry more tractable.
5. Developed a method for deciding when a polynomial equation has a solution in the real numbers. 
6. Developed a concept of constructing algebraic invariants from a given set of equations, a method which enabled him to give a unified proof of several classical theorems in algebraic geometry.
7. Solved the "Jacobian Conjecture" by showing that any number of polynomial equations can be solved by a single polynomial equation.
8. Established a fundamental technique of creating formal groups, whose structure was later used in solving difficult problems in algebraic geometry.

Born 7 July 1888, Armadale, West Lothian, Scotland. Died 24 January 1964, London, England.
