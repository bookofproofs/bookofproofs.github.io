**Arnold Walfisz** was a Polish mathematician who worked in analytic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Central Limit Theorem, a foundational result in probability theory.
2. Developed the Wiener-Itô integral, a tool for integrating with respect to non-smooth functions.
3. Made contributions to the theory of uniform distribution and Diophantine approximation.
4. Established the Hecke L-function, a kernel function of number theory.
5. Co-invented the Wintner–Walfisz theorem, which describes the distribution of prime numbers.
6. Authored over 90 books and papers on mathematics and statistics.

Born 2 July 1892, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 29 May1962, Tbilisi, Georgia.
