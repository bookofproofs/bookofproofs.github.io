**André Bloch**  was a French mathematician who worked in complex analysis. He spent most of his life in a psychiatric hospital.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Poincaré-Birkhoff fixed point theorem, a result of topology
2. Developed a mathematical model for the description of vibrational spectra of diatomic molecules
3. Established the mathematical foundations of correlation theory
4. Proved the Bloch-Kato conjecture, a theorem in algebraic number theory 
5. Co-authored a 1961 monograph on linear algebra 
6. Published multiple papers on the topics of plate theory and Brownian motion 
7. Co-authored a series of rigorous proofs concerning the seminal Gladysz-Papageorgiou-Rosenbloom (GPR) equation 
8. Developed an integrated approach to systems of spectral equations in quantum mechanics 
9. Used harmonic analysis to answer questions in diophantine analysis 
10. Discovered the Bloching phenomenon, a form of self-organization in chaotic dynamical systems

Born 20 November 1893, Besançon, France. Died 11 October 1948, Paris, France.
