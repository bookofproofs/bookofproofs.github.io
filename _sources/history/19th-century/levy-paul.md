**Paul Lévy** was a French mathematician who, after starting out as an expert on functional analysis, made important advances in probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved first major problem in probability theory, the "random walk in space" or the "random flight in space" in 1925.
2. Proved the existence of a function which satisfies a certain partial differential equation called the Lévy–Ciesielski theorem in 1939.
3. Discovered the Lévy distribution in 1925, which is a probability distribution used to describe the trajectory of a particle undergoing a diffusive random walk in one dimension.
4. Developed the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent random variables is normally distributed.
5. Pioneered the theory of point processes and set about calculating the probability of finding random points in a given region.
6. Made several important contributions to the analytical theory of probability and developed the analytical approach to it.
7. Discovered the key idea of Lévy processes and the concept of additive random functions.

Born 15 September 1886, Paris, France. Died 15 December 1971, Paris, France.
