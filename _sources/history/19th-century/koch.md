**Helge von Koch** is best known for the fractal _Koch curve_.





### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first iteration of the Koch Snowflake fractal in 1904.
2. Published the first paper in 1906 on the exact solution of Laplace’s equation in the plane with given boundary values.
3. Developed the mathematics of stochastic processes and further developed measure theory.
4. Founded the field of topological dimension theory, specializing in the areas of distance geometry and fine topology.
5. Proved the impossibility of trisecting an angle using only a compass and a straightedge in 1909. 
6. Generalized the idea of fractals in 1904 by introducing the von Koch curve, which is found in nature.
7. Contributed greatly to the development of modern analysis, including the study of functions of a real variable and related topics.
8. Developed the “Koch Ant” fractal in 1904 and introduced the concept of curve length and surface area.

Born 25 January 1870, Stockholm, Sweden. Died 11 March 1924, Danderyd, Stockholm, Sweden.
