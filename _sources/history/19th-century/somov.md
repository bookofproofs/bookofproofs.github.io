**Osip  Somov**  was a Russian mathematician who was the first in Russia to deal with the solution of kinematic problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Somov-Egorov theorem on the approximation of the solutions of certain second-order linear differential equations.
2. Discovered the Somov-Frenkel theory relating solutions of certain linear differential equations,to solutions of certain associated integral equations.
3. Solved several problems in the theory of integral equations.
4. Developed methods of studying linear differential equations containing small parameters.
5. Studied and applied the boundary element method in problems of mathematics and engineering.
6. Developed "Generalized Exponentiated Log-Normal Distribution" which is used in probability theory and the normalization of analytic functions.
7. Contributed to the theory of N-body problems in the field of Celestial Mechanics.
8. Made important contributions to the theory of Uniformly Approximable Functions and the theory of Painlevé equations.

Born 1 June 1815, Otrada, Moscow gubernia (now oblast), Russia. Died 26 April 1876, St Petersburg, Russia.
