**Osip  Somov**  was a Russian mathematician who was the first in Russia to deal with the solution of kinematic problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Osip attended secondary school in Moscow and then entered Moscow University to study mathematics and physics in the famous Faculty of Physics and Mathematics.
* In 1841 Somov was invited to teach at the University of St Petersburg, and he accepted this invitation and spent the rest of his life living in St Petersburg.
* Somov was elected as an associate of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1857, becoming an academician in 1862 on the death of Mikhail Ostrogradski.
* Somov was the first in Russia to develop a geometrical approach to theoretical mechanics.
* Other topics Somov studied included elliptic functions and their application to mechanics.
* The first in Russia to deal with the solution of kinematic problems, Somov included a chapter on this topic in his textbook on theoretical mechanics.
* Somov's theory of higher-order accelerations of a point, and of an unchanging system of points, was a significant contribution.
* Somov had a son Pavel Osipovich Somov who was born in 1852 and who went on to become a famous mathematician.
* Pavel Somov created the Russian school of the theory of mechanics of machines.

Born 1 June 1815, Otrada, Moscow gubernia (now oblast), Russia. Died 26 April 1876, St Petersburg, Russia.
