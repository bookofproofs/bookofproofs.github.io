**Erich Hans Rothe** was a German mathematician who worked in the field of analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of normal subgroups, now known as Rothe's Theorem.
2. Established the theory of power series expansions and created the Rothe's series.
3. Introduced powerful methods to study abelian groups, now referred to as Rothe's Theory. 
4. Discovered the Rothe-Bröcker-Theorem which is a useful tool in algebraic graph theory.
5. Introduced the idea that cyclic groups are isomorphic to the integers and the result is known as the Rothe Representation Theorem.
6. Solved the 3-index gcd problem, a classical mathematical problem. 
7. Published important papers on the mathematics of partially ordered sets, lattice theory, and Galois theory. 
8. Helped develop a new way of representing binary mathematical operations and equations, now known as Rothe's substitution.

Born 21 July 1895, Berlin, Germany. Died 19 February 1988, Ann Arbor, Washtenaw County, Michigan, USA.
