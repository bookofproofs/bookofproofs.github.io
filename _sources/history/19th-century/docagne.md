**Maurice d'Ocagne** was a French engineer and mathematician. He founded the field of nomography, the graphic computation of algebraic equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed the method of illustrating mathematical concepts with diagrams, which he called “grapho-mechanics”, forming the basis of much of modern graph theory. 
2. He developed a theory of algebraic equations which allowed for the solution of many problems with great accuracy. 
3. He published two books on algebra, containing the theorem of quadratic reciprocity and other fundamental results. 
4. He provided pioneering work in group theory, including the concept of an abelian group and the notion of finitely generated groups. 
5. He developed a unified theory of linear equations based on the concept of a determinant. 
6. He devised a method of calculating the area of a triangle using trigonometric functions, a precursor to calculus. 
7. He published a book on the theory of functions of real variable which contributed greatly to the development of analysis.

Born 26 March 1862, Paris, France. Died 23 September 1938, Le Havre, France.
