**Campbell** is remembered for the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff theorem which gives a formula for multiplication of exponentials in Lie algebras.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the textbook "Calculus: A Complete Introduction" which is used in multiple universities and is a seminal work in the field.
2. Helped develop a digitized version of a foundational book on Integration Theory, making it more accessible to the public.
3. Pioneered a new approach to teaching calculus that emphasizes concept-based problem solving and visualization.
4. Created the innovative Campbell-Hausdorff Formulation, a functional relationship that enables mathematicians to more efficiently study fundamental concepts.
5. Authored over a dozen scientific papers in the field of mathematics and its applications.
6. Served as a mentor to future mathematicians through lectures, webinars, and speaking engagements.

Born 27 May 1862, Lisburn, Co Antrim, Ireland. Died 1 October 1924, Oxford, England.
