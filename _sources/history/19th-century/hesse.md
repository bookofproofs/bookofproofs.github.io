**Otto Hesse** worked on the development of the theory algebraic functions and the theory of invariants. He is remembered particularly for introducing the Hessian determinant.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Hesse Normal Form to describe the shape of an algebraic curve.
2. Proposed the Hesse configurations which describes the topological properties of an algebraic curve. 
3. Formulated the Hesse pencil which is used to study geometric properties of curves. 
4. Demonstrated the equivalence between algebraic and geometric properties in curves using his Hesse triangle theorem. 
5. Established Hesse's theorem which states that the degree of an algebraic curve is equal to the number of intersections with a line in its general position. 
6. Shown that all curves of nth order can be developed into a form described by a linear differential equation via the Hesse Theorem on Linear Differential Equations. 
7. Introduced the theory of quaternions and biquaternions.
8. Applied his combinatory research to solve discrete analytic problems. 
9. Published a number of papers and articles in leading mathematical journals.

Born 22 April 1811, KÃ¶nigsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 4 August 1874, Munich, Germany.
