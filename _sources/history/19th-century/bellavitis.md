**Giusto Bellavitis** was an Italian mathematician who worked on a large range of mathematical topics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of analysis situs (or topology), enabling the study of relationships between properties of geometric figures and their curves and surfaces. 
2. Wrote the first Italian textbook on analysis situs, summarizing his research on the topic. 
3. Was among the first to apply algebraic methods to geometry and to recognize the importance of functions as fundamental elements in mathematical investigations. 
4. Established the first Italian school of higher mathematics and wrote a series of mathematics texts for this education. 
5. Was among the earliest mathematicians to apply the ideas of calculus to a wide range of scientific and technical questions. 
6. Developed a theory of linear art, which served as the basis for the development of perspective and the basis for later work on axiomatic geometry.

Born 22 November 1803, Bassano, Vicenza (now Italy). Died 6 November 1880, Tezze (near Bassano) Italy.
