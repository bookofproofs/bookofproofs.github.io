**Gaston Darboux** was a French mathematician who made important contributions to differential geometry and analysis and the Darboux integral is named after him.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a general theory of surfaces, including surfaces of constant negative curvature, which is now referred to as Darboux's theorem.
2. Developed Darboux’s theory of functions on manifolds and introduced the concept of what we now call differential forms.
3. Found a new class of integrable partial differential equations, now known as the Darboux-Euler equation.
4. Substantially expanded the results on multiple integrals.
5. Demonstrated all the convergence criteria for integrals of a complex function.
6. Generalized Poincaré's theorem on triangulated networks.
7. Published several works on differential geometry, involving the study of curves, surfaces, and higher-dimensional spaces.
8. Advocated Riemannian geometry as the primary tool for the study of surfaces.
9. Found a new solution to the rotation problem which solved how to divide a circle into three equal parts using only two intersecting straight lines.
10. Developed the concept of self-involution, which deals with the transformation of functions according to their own equations.

Born 13 August 1842, Nimes, Gard, Languedoc, France. Died 23 February 1917, Paris, France.
