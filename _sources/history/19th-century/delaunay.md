**Charles-Eugène Delaunay** was a French mathematician and astronomer whose theory of lunar motion advanced the development of planetary-motion theories.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Delaunay Triangulation algorithm for computed surfaces in 3-dimensional space.
2. Devised new methods for solving cubic equations.
3. Formulated a distinctive approach to the problem of the three-body problem.
4. First to use the term “stabillograph” to describe the instrument used to measure the magnitude of vibrations. 
5. Pioneered ways to measure the motion of rigid bodies.
6. Developed an algebraic construction of a general conic as the locus of the intersections of a variable quadric surface with a fixed plane.
7. Generated solutions to differential equations.
8. Employed mechanical instruments in determining orbits of planets.
9. Discovered an integration algorithm for the n-body problem.
10. Proved the existence of periodic solutions of differential equations.

Born 9 April 1816, Lusigny-sur-Barse, France. Died 5 August 1872, At sea (near Cherbourg, France).
