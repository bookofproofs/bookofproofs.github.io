**Hopf**'s work was in algebraic topology. He studied vector fields and extended Lefschetz's fixed point formula. He also studied homotopy classes and defined what is now known as the 'Hopf invariant'.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Found the first non-trivial solution to the three-body problem which had eluded 18th century mathematician Leonard Euler.
2. Proved the famous ‘fixed-point theorem’ which states that any continuous function of a certain kind must have a fixed point.
3. Developed a topological theory of algebraic equations, incorporating the interplay between algebraic and topological concepts.
4. Solved the Steiner problem of topology, which is the problem of determining a minimal network that connects a set of points on a surface.
5. Developed the theory of fibre bundles, which is widely used in mathematics and physics today.
6. Received the first Wolf Prize in Mathematics for his work on topology in 1982.

Born 19 November 1894, Gräbschen (near Breslau), Germany (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 3 June 1971, Zollikon, Switzerland.
