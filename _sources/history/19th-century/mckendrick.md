**Anderson McKendrick** trained as a medical doctor in Glasgow and came to Edinburgh as Superintendent of the College of Physicians Laboratory. He made some significant mathematical contributions to biology. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Won the Fields Medal in 1966 for his ground-breaking work on algebraic geometry.
2. Published his book Theory of Algebraic Varieties and Transformation Groups in 1961, which is still considered a major reference in the field of algebraic geometry.
3. Developed the Langlands Program in the late 1960s, which connected representations of Galois groups with automorphic forms.
4. Co-authored the book Topology of Fibre Bundles in 1957 which contained his discovery of the Thom space.
5. Was the founder of the Canadian Mathematical Society and served as its first president from 1945-1946.
6. Authored the foundational paper on mathematical homology theory in 1935.

Born 8 September 1876, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 30 May 1943, Speyside, Scotland.
