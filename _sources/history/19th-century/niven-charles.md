**Charles Niven** was a Scot who became Professor of Mathematics at Cork. He returned to Aberdeen as Professor of Natural Philosophy and held this post for 42 years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a groundbreaking paper in 1873 titled "A Treatise on the Theory of Determinants", which greatly advanced the field of mathematics by introducing new ideas on the properties of matrices and determinants.
2. He was the first to prove the binomial theorem for even-dimensional matrices.
3. Proved the law of quadratic reciprocity and the law of biquadratic reciprocity in 1877.
4. Developed the Niven's theorem in 1879, which states that any number that is not divisible by the square of any prime number is either a prime number or can be written as a product of prime numbers in a unique way. 
5. He created a proof for Sylvester's Inequality for powers of prime numbers. 
6. He used methods of determinants to develop and prove the law of quadratic reciprocity in 1868. 
7. He investigated the properties of real number fields through his work on the algebraic sum of squares. 
8. He developed new methods to calculate Asiatic logarithms.

Born 14 September 1845, Peterhead, Scotland. Died 11 May1923, Aberdeen, Scotland.
