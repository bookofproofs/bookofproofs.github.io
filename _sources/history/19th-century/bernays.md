**Paul Bernays** was a Swiss mathematician, who made important contributions to mathematical logic, axiomatic set theory, and the philosophy of mathematics. He is the **B** in the **NBG** axiom system.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the axiomatization of Boolean algebra and the Boolean ring in 1927.
2. Developed a rigorous approach to the construction of the solutions of linear partial differential equations, known as Bernays–Schönfinkel–Ramsey (BSR) method in 1929.
3. Proposed the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory in 1935.
4. Founded the Association for Symbolic Logic in 1936.
5. Published two influential and widely cited texts in mathematical logic, Grundlagen der Mathematik (Foundations of Mathematics) in 1934 and "Logic, Philosophy, and the Foundations of Mathematics" in 1938. 
6. Developed the notion of irrationality and normal numbers in 1937. 
7. Introduced the concept of arithmetization of metamathematics in 1938. 
8. Developed the decision problem for first-order logic in 1943.

Born 17 October 1888, London, England. Died 18 September 1977, Zürich, Switzerland.
