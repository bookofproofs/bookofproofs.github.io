**Duncan Gregory** was a Scottish mathematician who was one of the first to investigate modern ideas of abstract algebra. He was a great-great-grandson of James Gregory

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His mother was Isabella McLeod and she was left to bring up the family after Duncan's father died when he was seven years old.
* Duncan was educated by his mother until he was ten years old then, after this, by a private tutor.
* He showed great promise at school and, during the winter of 1827, Gregory was sent to an academy in Geneva where his mathematical talents were obvious to the teachers.
* On his return from Geneva, Gregory became an undergraduate at Edinburgh University where he began to study advanced mathematical topics and he also conducted experiments with polarised light.
* In October 1833, at the age of 20, Gregory entered Trinity College, Cambridge, receiving his B.A. in 1837, being ranked fifth wrangler, and his M.A. in 1841.
* At this time the Cambridge Mathematical Journal was beginning publication and Gregory became its first editor.
* Many of the papers in the early parts of the Journal are written by Gregory himself.
* Gregory declined a chair in Toronto in 1841 due to ill health.
* His work in this area is described in the paper On the real nature of symbolic algebra which Gregory published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
* In this work Gregory built on the foundations of Peacock but went far further towards modern algebra.
* Gregory, in his turn, had a major influence on Boole and it was through his influence that Boole set out on his innovative research.
* Two other important works by Duncan Gregory are Examples of the Processes of the Differential and Integral Calculus and A Treatise on the Application of Analysis to Solid Geometry.

Born 13 April 1813, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 23 February 1844, Edinburgh, Scotland.
