**Luigi Menabrea** was a French-born soldier and engineer who made contributions to elasticity theory and became prime-minister of Italy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the first work in Italian on Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, introducing the world to the concept of automata and early computer science.
2. Appointed as a professor of higher mathematics and physics at the Military Academy of Modena.
3. Wrote important papers on topics of theoretical and practical mathematics such as the theory of analytic functions.
4. Served as the Savoyant professor of mathematical physics at the University of Turin.
5. Proposed many analytical methods based on complex analytical structures.
6. Conducted extensive studies in the field of analytic functions and their singularities.
7. Postulated theorems on the theory of differential equations and curves.
8. Encouraged interest in the limit theory of Cauchy and the elementary theory of mathematical analysis.
9. Pioneered the use of elliptic functions for solving Dirichlet problems.
10. Contributed significantly to Abel’s theorem on solving integrals.

Born 4 September 1809, Chambéry, Savoy, France. Died 24 May1896, St Cassin (near Chambéry), France.
