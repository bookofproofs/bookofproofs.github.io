**Josef Stefan** was an Austrian physicist, mathematician, and poet.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Stefan–Boltzmann law - a physical law stating that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body in thermal equilibrium is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's absolute temperature.
2. Created the Stefan–Maxwell equations - a set of equations that describe the transport of momentum, heat, and species in a fluid.
3. Introducted the Stefan Problem - an initial value problem of the diffusion equation studying the movement of a solidifying substance in a semi-infinite medium.
4. Formulated the modern treatment of the Carnot–Clapeyron equation that describes how vapor pressure depends on vapor temperature.
5. Published several groundbreaking works on the theory of heat and on the theory of dielectrics. 
6. Developed the Stefan–Godunov method - a numerical solution of problems in hydrodynamics which use approximations to construct difference equations.

Born 24 March 1835, St Peter (near Klagenfurt), Austria. Died 7 January 1893, Vienna, Austria.
