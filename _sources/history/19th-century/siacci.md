**Francesco Siacci** was an Italian mathematician whose most important work was in application of mechanics to artillery.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However this was a period of instability in Italian affairs and Siacci was deeply involved with the political events of the time.
* The position of Rome presented problems and, for Siacci based in Rome, this was not the place to be.
* Since Siacci was already an excellent mathematician it was felt that he could make the best contribution to the army at the Military Academy in Turin.
* Siacci took part in this campaign against the Austrians but was quickly sent back to teach ballistics at the Military Academy in Turin before the campaign ended.
* It was not a successful military campaign for the Italians and it was perhaps fortunate for Siacci that he returned to an academic post.
* Siacci taught mechanics at the University of Turin from 1871.
* In 1872 Siacci was promoted to Professor of Ballistics at the Military Academy and he continued to hold this post until his army career ended in 1892 by which time he had reached the rank of major general.
* In 1893 Siacci was rewarded for his support for Italy by being appointed to the office of Senator in Rome.
* Turin was too long a journey from Rome to make it possible for Siacci to act as a Senator and hold his professorship in Turin.
* This was agreed: Siacci was made an Honorary Professor at Turin where Volterra was invited to fill his position, and Siacci taught at Naples for the rest of his life.

Born 20 April 1839, Rome (now Italy). Died 31 May 1907, Naples, Italy.
