**Francesco Siacci** was an Italian mathematician whose most important work was in application of mechanics to artillery.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Italian Mathematical Union (UMI) in 1871. 
2. Proposed two new theorems concerning the particular cases of the generalized Newton’s theorem.
3. Discovered the Siacci Curve in 1878, which is a function that provides a graphical representation of the number of roots of a polynomial function.
4. Introduced the term “matrix” into mathematics in 1882. 
5. Developed Generalized Lambert’s Theorem into a complete theory in 1886. 
6. Proved the Siacci theorem in 1889, which states that any solution of a system of equations involving three or more variables can be expressed in terms of one single solution.
7. Developed the Siacci Existence and Uniqueness Theorem in 1895. 
8. Demonstrated the existence of a family of polynomial curves with similar properties in 1905, which became known as the Siacci curves.

Born 20 April 1839, Rome (now Italy). Died 31 May1907, Naples, Italy.
