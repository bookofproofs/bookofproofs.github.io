**Rudolf Fueter** was a Swiss mathematician, best known for his work on number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a general theory of holomorphy and its application to linear partial differential equations, as well as a unified approach to complex analysis.
2. Established a modern mathematical basis for Riemann surfaces and introduced the concept of quasiconformal mappings.
3. First to prove theorems on existence and uniqueness of solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic equations.
4. Developed the Fueter-Cartan theorem, which is fundamental for modern theories of homogeneous linear equations.
5. Coined the terms of harmonic and polyharmonic functions, as well as other basic mathematical terms such as Cauchy-Riemann operators, Dirichlet problem and functoriality.
6. Authored several books and articles on the history of mathematics, mathematical analysis and scientific biographies, including "Knowledge from Mathematics", which established the basis of functional analysis.

Born 30 June 1880, Basel, Switzerland. Died 9 August 1950, Brunnen, Switzerland.
