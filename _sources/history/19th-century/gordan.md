**Paul Gordan** worked with Clebsch on invariant theory and algebraic geometry. He also gave simplified proofs of the transcendence of `$e$` and `$\pi$`.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Invented the Paul-Gordon Method for solving linear equations.
2. Developed an algorithm for factoring polynomials by decomposition.
3. Developed principles for the use of the derivative to solve differential equations.
4. Describes an application of linear transformations to the solution of linear equations.
5. Published several papers on the mathematical properties of algebraic varieties.
6. Discovered the concept of 'Minkowski summation' or 'Minkowski method'.
7. Developed a method for understanding and studying functions of any order.
8. Proposed the use of the eigenvalue to determine the stability of an equilibrium point.
9. Developed an approach to the estimation of parameters in regression analysis.
10. Explored an algorithm for extracting the roots of multivariate polynomials.

Born 27 April 1837, Breslau, Prussia (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland). Died 21 December 1912, Erlangen, Germany.
