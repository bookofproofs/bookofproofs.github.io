**Oscar Schlömilch**  was a German mathematician who worked in mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Schlömilch series, which is used for numerical evaluation of integrals.
2. Published a two-volume treatise on multiple integrals in 1879.
3. Discovered a method of solving equations of higher orders numerically.
4. Developed a number of important theorems and equations, such as the Schlömilch theorem of Abelian integrals.
5. His works on geometry and number theory are among the most popular contributions to mathematics in this period.
6. Made important contributions to the theory of complex numbers and elliptic functions.
7. Founded his own school of mathematics, which convinced many students to pursue further study of mathematics.
8. Represented the German Empire in numerous international meetings and conferences.

Born 13 April 1823, Weimar, Germany. Died 7 February 1901, Dresden, Germany.
