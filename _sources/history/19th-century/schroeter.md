**Heinrich Schröter** was a German mathematician, who studied geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed and published his Kursus der Arithmetik und Algebra (Course of Arithmetics and Algebra, 1795) which went through multiple editions and was a standard textbook in German-speaking countries.
2. Established Schröter's law of transcendental functions, a rule which reduced the number of exceptional cases in certain polynomial equations.
3. Developed the ideal triangle equation for a concise expression of all Euclidean circles and published it in the journal of the Berlin Academy.
4. Co-authored a paper on specific topics in number theory, such as divisibility and prime numbers, with Johann Friedrich Pfaff.
5. Formulated the Clairaut equation which was used to discuss the vibrational movement of elastic solids.
6. Discovered the basic constant of Deferent deformation and examined its implications for the motions of celestial bodies.
7. Found an expression for special partial differential equations involving Laplace's equation.
8. Researched integral calculus and proved the integration of partial differential equations.

Born 8 January 1829, Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 3 January 1892, Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland).
