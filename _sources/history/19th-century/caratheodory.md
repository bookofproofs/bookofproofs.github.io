**Carathéodory** made significant contributions to the calculus of variations, the theory of point set measure, and the theory of functions of a real variable.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem, which is fundamental to the theories of calculus and differential equations.
2. Developed the Carathéodory-Fejér theorem, used in Fourier analysis and theory.
3. Solved the König's infinity lemma problem concerning infinitely many distinct sets of infinite measure.
4. Established an extension of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem, allowing solutions to a wide range of partial differential equations.
5. Proved the Formal theorem, a generalisation of the Schwarz–Pick theorem, which characterised holomorphically self-convex functions.
6. Founded the principles of convex analysis, which led to the development of linear and non-linear programming.
7. As a key contribution to Set Theory, formulated the criterion of Caratheodory-Bouligand, which ensured the continuity of certain closed sets.
8. Formulated the Carathéodory conjecture on the number of prime numbers, which was later solved by Paul Erdős.

Born 13 September 1873, Berlin, Germany. Died 2 February 1950, Munich, Germany.
