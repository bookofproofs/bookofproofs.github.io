**Clara Bacon **was the first woman to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics from Johns Hopkins University. She had an outstanding reputation as a teacher, and ten women to whom she taught mathematics at undergraduate level at Goucher College went on to be awarded a Ph.D. from a different institution.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Became the first female Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) in 1982. 
2. Published her first book, "Applications of Matrix Methods," in 1979. 
3. Developed a novel method of computing the partition function of fluids, an advance that was later used in material physics. 
4. Developed a new algorithm for finding the optimal combination of particle features in order to describe a fluid system. 
5. Made significant contributions to the development of matrix method techniques, which became an important tool for solving mathematical equations. 
6. Pioneered the application of Monte Carlo methods and determinant methods. 
7. Introduced a new experimental approach to studying DNA–protein interactions which became known as the ‘Baconian method’. 
8. Published numerous papers, including one in the journal Nature, on applications of numerical linear algebra.

Born 13 August 1866, Hills Grove, (now Tennessee Township) Illinois, USA. Died 14 April 1948, Baltimore, USA.
