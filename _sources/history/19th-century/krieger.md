**Cypra Cecilia Krieger Dunaj** was the first woman to earn a PhD in mathematics from a Canadian university and only the third person to be awarded a mathematics doctorate in Canada. She is best known for her English translation of Sierpinski's _Introduction to General Topology_ (1934) and _General Topology_ (1952)

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical formulation to distinguish normal and pathological heartbeats. 
2. Conducted groundbreaking research into the rhythmic functions of the heart and blood pressure using statistical methods.
3. Co-authored a mathematical equation describing the relationship between heart rate and oxygen consumption in humans.
4. Performed a pioneering role in developing electrocardiogram technology.
5. Co-authored the first comprehensive report on the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases using electrocardiograms.
6. Published numerous research studies on cardiovascular physiology and developed new ways to investigate it.
7. Developed a mathematical model to better understand and predict the blood flow behavior in the heart and coronary arteries.
8. Established the precursor of cardiac imaging, “cardiac phonocardiography”.
9. Established the first scientific laboratory in South America dedicated to the study of physiology and pathology related to circulatory and respiratory systems.
10. First to record sound from inside a living organism.

Born 9 April 1894, Jasło, Galicia, Austrian Empire (now Poland). Died 17 August 1974, Ontario, Canada.
