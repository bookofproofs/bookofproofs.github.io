**Karl Pearson** was an English mathematician and biostatistician. He introduced the idea of correlation and applied statistics to biological problems of heredity and evolution. With Francis Galton, he was a supporter of eugenics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Pearson chi-squared statistic, which is used to measure the distance between observed and expected values.
2. Established the Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient, which measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables.
3. Developed the Pearson's Guide Test, which is used to assess the validity of statistical distributions.
4. Invented bi-variate analysis to quantify variability and correlation between two measurements or sets of data.
5. Pioneered the method of least squares, which is used for the fitting of linear equations to data points.
6. His work on the concept of the standard deviation, known as ‘the root-mean-square’, laid the foundations for modern statistical analysis.
7. Published the firstever frequency-based textbooks on statistics, The Grammar of Science and Natural Inheritance.
8. Developed Pearson's coefficient of skewness which is used to measure the degree of symmetry of a given distribution.

Born 27 March 1857, London, England. Died 27 April 1936, Coldharbour, Surrey, England.
