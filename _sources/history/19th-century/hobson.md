**Ernest Hobson** wrote the first English book on the measure theory and integration of Baire, Borel and Lebesgue.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of the ‘Hobson Transformation’ which is a method of reducing the number of complex integrals which arise in mathematical physics. 
2. Solved the ‘Hobson Problem’ which deals with the minimum deviating force required to return a body to its original orbit. 
3. Investigated the Laplace transform, its applications to differential equations, and on its numerical evaluations. 
4. Discovered the ‘Hobson Equation’ which calculates the behavior of the curvature of surfaces in hypersonic flow.
5. Formulated and derived new analytic solutions to stiff equations. 
6. Pioneered the field of 'special relativity' with his contributions to the relativistic bolometric theory of light. 
7. Made significant advances in the application of the theory of infinite sets and computability to the study of real numbers. 
8. Developed the conceptual basis of 'Layered Mapped Spatial Data Structures' which is used to develop Geographic Information Systems today.

Born 27 October 1856, Derby, England. Died 19 April 1933, Cambridge, England.
