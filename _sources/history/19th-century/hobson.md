**Ernest Hobson** wrote the first English book on the measure theory and integration of Baire, Borel and Lebesgue.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Hobson then won a mathematics scholarship to Christ's College, Cambridge, entering in 1874.
* Hobson was the first appointment to the Stokes lectureship.
* Probably mainly due to this particularly influential work, Hobson was elected Sadleirian professor at Cambridge in 1910.
* The leisure which Hobson enjoyed after his election to the Sadleirian Professorship enabled him to devote himself to its complete rewriting, and the second edition (1922-25) was double the size of the first.
* Hobson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1893, serving as a member of its council, and being awarded the Society's Royal Medal in 1907.
* To many Hobson is better known for the Gifford lectures he gave on The domain of natural science at the University of Aberdeen in 1921-22 than for his mathematical contribution.

Born 27 October 1856, Derby, England. Died 19 April 1933, Cambridge, England.
