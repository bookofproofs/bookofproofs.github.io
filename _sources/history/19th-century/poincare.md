**Henri Poincaré** can be said to have been the originator of algebraic topology and of the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a broad range of theories in mathematics, including celestial mechanics, topology, differential equations, and partial differential equations. 
2. Contributed to the evolution of mathematical analysis and the theory of algebraic equations. 
3. Formulated a new branch of mathematical physics known as diffraction theory. 
4. Published important works on Fuchsian equations, Riemann surfaces and automorphic functions. 
5. Proved the theorems of Algebraic Topology. 
6. First to use dynamical systems to study the behaviour of orbits in space.  
7. First to study chaotic systems and formulated the first mathematical approach to chaos theory. 
8. First to establish a new mathematical field known as 'geometric topology.' 
9. Established the Poincaré conjecture and Poincaré-Bendixson theorem related to dynamical systems.

Born 29 April 1854, Nancy, Lorraine, France. Died 17 July 1912, Paris, France.
