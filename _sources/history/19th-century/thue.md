**Thue** studied Diophantine equations, showing that, for example, `$y^3-2x^2=1$` cannot be satisfied by infinitely many pairs of integers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a new method of using an infinite series involving the power of prime numbers to attack the Diophantine equations. 
2. He determined necessary and sufficient conditions for a sequence of numbers to be realizable as differences of successive sets of exponents in a single algebraic equation.
3. He was the first to prove that some equations cannot be solved by radicals.
4. He discovered Thue's theorem, which establishes the decidability of certain kinds of Diophantine equations.
5. He proved the highly influential theorem of partition regularity, a theorem describing how partition structures can exhibit regularities when expressed through generating functions. 
6. He also published work on abelian groups and on arithmetical functions.

Born 19 February 1863, TÃ¶nsberg, Norway. Died 7 March 1922, Oslo, Norway.
