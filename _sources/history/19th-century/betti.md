**Enrico Betti** is noted for his contributions to algebra and topology. Betti also did important work in theoretical physics, in particular in potential theory and elasticity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Betti was the first to state and prove the Betti theorem, which showed how two different right angles intersect.
2. He used algebraic methods to solve geometric problems, paving the way for the development of differential geometry.
3. Betti established the first scientific school of pre-eminent Italian mathematicians that included Corrado Segre, Ulisse Dini and Vito Volterra. 
4. He founded the Italian Mathematical Union and the Italian Mathematical Association.
5. Betti was a prolific researcher, authoring more than 130 papers.
6. He extended Cauchyâ€™s integral theorem by generalizing its conditions.
7. He developed the basic notion of coverings, now known as Betti coverings, which is fundamental to algebraic topology.
8. He was the first to generalize Weierstrass-function.
9. Betti invented a system of representing graphs and networks, known as the Betti-Carnot Graphs.
10. Betti laid the foundation for the theory of ordered projective space, and provided conditions for the existence of relative invariants in differential systems.

Born 21 October 1823, Pistoia, Tuscany (now Italy). Died 11 August 1892, Soiana, Pisa, Italy.
