**Karl Dörge** was a German mathematician whose specialties were real functions, probabilities and analytic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Friedrich Dörge was born in Eickendorf near Haldensleben on 16 May 1864.
* Karl spent the first five years of his life in Müllerdorf.
* In 1905 the family moved to Seyda, a village in the district of Wittenberg, where again Dörge's father Friedrich was the local pastor.
* Until he was thirteen years old, Karl was educated by private tutors.
* From his father, Karl learnt religion, mathematics, history and German.
* Dörge followed this route, enlisted for the army and he passed the Notabitur in Torgau in 1915.
* In 1919, now nearly twenty years old, Dörge was able to continue his education which had been disrupted by the war.
* Dörge's years of study at university had been difficult one since Germany went through a period of hyperinflation which made life close to impossible.
* Dörge habilitated at the University of Cologne in 1926.
* In 1932 Dörge was promoted to extraordinary professor at the University of Cologne.
* This did not directly affect Dörge but, of course, the large impact on mathematics throughout Germany had an indirect impact on everyone.
* (He committed suicide on 26 January 1942 when it was clear he was about to be sent to a concentration camp.) On 26 February 1936 the University of Bonn submitted the following names for the Hausdorff succession to the Ministry of Education: Ernst Kähler, Konrad Knopp and Karl Dörge.
* Dörge remained in Cologne and, perhaps as a consequence of being recommended for a full chair in Bonn, he was appointed to a full chair at Cologne later in 1936.
* Dörge continued working on algebra and number theory.
* In 1938 Dörge's father, by this time 74 years old, came to live with his son at his home in Lindenthal on the west side of Cologne.
* Friedrich Dörge spent the last five years of his life living with his son and died on 28 May 1943.
* Dörge published a number of books.
* Klaus Wagner (31 March 1910 - 6 February 2000) was Dörge's most famous student.
* He received his Ph.D. from the University of Cologne in 1937 advised by Dörge, and taught at Cologne for many years becoming head of the Cologne graph theory school.
* Later in his career Dörge studied universal algebra.
* We should add one further fact about Dörge, namely his passion for art.
* Dörge's copy was made in 1600 while the original now hangs in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte in Naples.

Born 5 November 1899, Müllerdorf, near Halle, Saxony, Germany. Died 16 June 1975, Bensberg, Germany.
