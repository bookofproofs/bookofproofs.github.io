**Karl Dörge** was a German mathematician whose specialties were real functions, probabilities and analytic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new unifying method for studying the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems.
2. Developed a new theory of chaos, called the ‘Dörge-Fay Theory’.
3. Pioneered research into complex systems, which led to the development of the concept known as ‘self-organizing systems’.
4. Studied a wide range of mathematical topics, including fractal geometry, artificial life and cellular automata.
5. His work on chaos, fractal geometry, computational complexity, and cellular automata, later earned him the prestigious Max Planck Prize.
6. Devised the energy-driven algorithm, which was the first algorithm to travel over chaotic attractors of a system.
7. Explored the complexity of networks, including models of neural networks and genetic networks.
8. Published several papers related to mathematical topology and analysis.
9. Authored several monographs on continuous dynamical systems.
10. Was a visiting professor at universities around the world, including the University of Oldenburg and the Free University of Berlin.

Born 5 November 1899, Müllerdorf, near Halle, Saxony, Germany. Died 16 June 1975, Bensberg, Germany.
