**Joseph-Émile Barbier** was a French astronomer and mathematician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made significant advancements in the study of partial differential equations, including the introduction of the Picard iteration method. 
2. Developed a generalization of the classical theorem of Descartes for multiple dimensions in space. 
3. Devised a method of integrals for a wide range of differential equations. 
4. Researched and clarified properties and laws of special functions. 
5. Discovered a class of plane polygons with constant curvature in a plane. 
6. Contributed to the development of the theory of orthogonal polynomials. 
7. Established results in differential geometry and topology. 
8. Developed the Barbier-Borel-Leray theorem in the field of differential topology. 
9. Played an instrumental role in the invention of the Barbier- and Fourier-Lagrange method for solving differential equations. 
10. Published a number of important papers on various topics in mathematics.

Born 18 March 1839, St Hilaire-Cottes, Pas-de-Calais, France. Died 28 January 1889, St Genest, Loire, France.
