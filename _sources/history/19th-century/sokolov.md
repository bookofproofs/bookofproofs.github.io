**Yurii Dmitrievich Sokolov** was a Russian mathematician who worked on the _n_-body problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He supervised Sokolov's research in the area of mechanics of particles and this was the topic of his doctorate which in many ways followed on from Grave's Master's thesis.
* Sokolov's first publication appeared in 1923.
* From 1934 Sokolov taught at the Institute of Mathematics at the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.
* Sokolov's main work was on the nnn-body problem, which he worked on for nearly 50 years and he summarised his contributions in the book Singular trajectories of a system of free material points (Russian) which was published in 1951.
* Sokolov also published on celestial mechanics and hydromechanics.
* One of the topics which will always be associated with Sokolov's name is his method for finding approximate solutions to differential and integral equations.
* The method which he introduced is now sometimes called 'the averaging method with functional corrections' or sometimes called 'the Sokolov method'.
* E L Albasiny, reviewing Sokolov's textbook, first formally describes the approximations from averaging of functional corrections.
* The first part of Sokolov's book discusses applications of his method to problems which can be modelled by linear integral equations with constant limits.
* In the final part Sokolov examines applications of his method to integral equations of mixed type, then in a number of appendices he presents some generalisations of the method.
* Sokolov died only a few months before his 75th  birthday and only a few months short of completing 50 years of scientific work in the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.

Born 26 May 1896, Labinskaya Stanitsa (now Labinsk), Russia. Died 2 February 1971, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine).
