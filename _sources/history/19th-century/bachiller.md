**Tomás Bachiller** was a Chinese-born Spanish mathematician who worked in topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Produced theorems outlining methods for solving the cubic equation, (published in the book, El descubrimiento de las inecuaciones) 
2. Researched analytical and graphical solutions for the general equation of the second degree 
3. Researched and presented various methods for approximating algebra and geometric numbers 
4. Created two alternative formulas for calculating the value of pi 
5. Developed an interactive tool for teaching mathematics 
6. Discovered series of solutions to certain families of equations of the second and third degree 
7. Established a mathematical notation system for methodically expressing equations 
8. Authored two books – Damiel el sastre, and El descubrimiento de las inecuaciones – featuring original solutions to mathematical problems

Born 10 November 1899, Hong Kong (now China). Died 9 July 1980, Madrid, Spain.
