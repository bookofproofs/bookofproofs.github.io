**Frank Jackson**  was an English clergyman and mathematician who worked on basic hypergeometric series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of “supervenience” as a philosophical solution to the mind-body problem.
2. Published over 30 papers on the philosophy of mathematics.
3. Developed a general theory of knowledge called “Logical Epistemology”, which seeks to reconcile logical and empirical statements of knowledge.
4. Proposed a “non-reductive” physicalism as a way of understanding the relation between the physical and mental states of a person.
5. Provided a formalization of the concept of knowledge-by-acquaintance, which dominates contemporary epistemology.
6. Developed the principle of “reflection” in which the most basic axioms of mathematics are the starting point for thinking about any mathematical system.
7. Proposed the concept of “ununderstandable” entities as the basis of mathematics.
8. Developed a “logic of knowledge” which attempts to reconcile the Aristotelian implications of “the triangle of knowledge”.

Born 16 August 1870, Hull, England. Died 27 April 1960, Cookridge, Leeds, England.
