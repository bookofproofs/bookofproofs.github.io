**Luigi Bianchi** made important contributions to differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introducing the concept of limit procedures to calculus in 1878.
2. Developing a new formulation of the Carnot cycle of thermodynamics.
3. Developing a new, general approach to the theory of integrals.
4. Demonstrating the existence of a limit for a particular integration problem, which is regarded as the fundamental problem of the calculus of variations.
5. Drawing conclusions about partial differential equations from Rayleigh's second aerodynamic theorem.
6. Proving the existence of Rankine-Hugoniot and Purser-Morey equations for the shock wave theory of gas dynamics.
7. Finding the exact circumference and area of a circle from the Gaussian curvature.
8. Describing the reciprocity theorem, a theorem in geometry dealing with a rigorous description of the relation between the inverse of two conic sections.
9. Introducing the concept of fractional derivatives, which is the fractional version of the classical derivatives in the calculus of variations.
10. Developing a new mechanism for the integration of linear differential equations, which is also referred to as Bianchi's equations.

Born 18 January 1856, Parma (now Italy). Died 6 June 1928, Pisa, Italy.
