**Heinrich Jung** was a German mathematician who worked on algebraic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Heinrich studied mathematics, physics and chemistry at the University of Marburg and at the University of Berlin from 1895 to 1899.
* His teachers included the following mathematicians: Friedrich Schottky who had moved to Marburg from Zürich in 1892; Kurt  Hensel who taught Jung at Berlin but later moved to Marburg; Lazarus Fuchs who had moved to Berlin from Heidelberg in 1884; Georg Frobenius who moved from Zürich to Berlin in 1892; and Hermann A Schwarz who moved from Göttingen to Berlin in 1892.
* Jung was also taught in Berlin by the theoretical physicist Max Planck who moved from Kiel to Berlin in 1888.
* Mathematics was Jung's main interest and, from this star-studded collection of teachers, it was Hensel in Berlin and Schottky in Marburg who were the greatest influence on him.
* It was Schottky who became Jung's doctoral thesis advisor, and he was awarded his doctorate in 1899 from for his thesis Über die kleinste Kugel, die eine räumliche Figur einschliesst Ⓣ(On the smallest sphere that encloses a solid figure) which was published in Crelle's journal.
* As well as being awarded his doctorate in 1899, Jung passed the state examinations to allow him to teach in a gymnasium in the same year.
* Jung remained at Marburg until 1908 when he was appointed as a professor in Kiel.
* Most of Jung's work involved looking at algebraic functions.
* Jung published some important books: Einführung in die Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen einer Veränderlichen Ⓣ(Introduction to the theory of algebraic functions of one variable) (de Gruyter, Berlin and Leipzig, 1923), Algebraische Flächen Ⓣ(Algebraic Surfaces) (Helwingsche Verlagsbuchhandlung, Hannover, 1925), Einführung in die Zahlentheorie Ⓣ(Introduction to Number Theory) (Jänicke, Leipzig, 1935), Einführung in die Theorie der quadratischen Zahlkörper Ⓣ(Introduction to the theory of quadratic number fields) (Jänicke, Leipzig, 1936), Matrizen und Determinanten Ⓣ(Matrices and Determinants) (Jänicke, Leipzig, 1948), and his final publication, which incorporated much that had appeared in his research papers over the years, Einführung in die Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen zweier Veränderlicher Ⓣ(Introduction to the theory of algebraic functions of two variables) (Akademie-Verlag, Berlin, 1951).
* It will help to give a flavour of Jung's work if we look more closely at his final book.

Born 4 May 1876, Essen, Germany. Died 12 March 1953, Halle, Germany.
