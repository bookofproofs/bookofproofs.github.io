**Eduard Study** was a German mathematician who became a leader in the geometry of complex numbers.  He also worked on invariant theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Won the prestigious Göttingen Prize in mathematics in 1889.
2. Developed the Study integral, a version of the modern day Riemann integral.
3. Gained fame as a defender of Cantor's set theory.
4.Developed the Study coefficient, an early example of linear algebra.
5. Authored several works on mathematics including the set theory treatise "Grundzüge der Mengenlehre" and the "Vorlesungen über Differential- und Integralrechnung".
6. Partnered with Hilbert on the book "Theory of Algebraic Invariants".
7. Contributed to the development of topology.

Born 23 March 1862, Coburg, Germany. Died 6 January 1930, Bonn, Germany.
