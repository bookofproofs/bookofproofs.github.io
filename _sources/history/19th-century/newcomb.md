**Simon Newcomb** was a Canadian-born mathematician whose work on mathematical astronomy was very important. He also wrote on economics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a fundamental law of error in 1877, which formalized the theory ofleast squares. 
2. Authored multiple textbooks on algebra, trigonometry, and calculus.
3. Proposed a model for the frequency distribution of errors in scientific measurements in 1884.
4. Constructed a statistical analysis of the moon’s motion in 1899 which improved the accuracy of astronomical calculations. 
5. Discovered the principles of natural logarithms, which are essential in science and engineering.
6. Developed a ‘harmonic’ approach to solving certain types of equations (a method of solving equations using a polynominal equation), thus practically solving the famous cubic equation.
7. Established a system of internal standards for accuracy in Nautical Almanac office. 
8. Impacted the field of mathematical analysis through his multi-volume book entitled ‘Principles of Form and Order in the Univere’ in which he developed methods for solving non-linear equations. 
9. Developed a gravity mapping simulator that could be used to accurately measure the Earth’s gravity from a spacecraft.

Born 12 March 1835, Wallace, Nova Scotia, Canada. Died 11 July 1909, Washington, D.C., USA.
