**Ernesto Pascal** was an Italian mathematician best known for a wide range of textbooks that he produced.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He wrote a text book on trigonometry that greatly influenced the field of mathematics in his time and beyond. 
2. He showed that any quadrilateral could be divided into triangles in two distinct ways. 
3. He proved Pascal’s Theorem, a theorem in plane geometry.
4. He published a major mathematical treatise on "arithmetic and geometry".
5. He created a mechanical calculator on which he was able to calculate square roots, probabilities and divisors.
6. He demonstrated that a circle divided into equal parts has an angle number fixed for each part.
7. He developed a method for calculating the area of a curved surface by dividing it into a series of small rectangles.
8. He designed an octagonal wheel for measuring angles in a precise manner. 
9. He was the first mathematician to introduce irrational numbers into algebraic equations.
10. He demonstrated that the arithmetical triangle, known as Pascal’s Triangle, had numerous mathematical applications.

Born 7 February 1865, Naples, Italy. Died 25 January 1940, Naples, Italy.
