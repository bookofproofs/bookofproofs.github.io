**Paul Stäckel**  was a German mathematician who worked on differential geometry, number theory and non-Euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Stäckel–Brodie method for solving differential equations, which improved upon the Runge–Kutta method.
2. Developed the P-algorithm as a method of intermediate calculations in solving problems of analytical dynamics. 
3. Contributed to the development of Actuarial Mathematics, by creating tables based on probability theory for life insurance companies.
4. Advocated for the use of hyper-spherical coordinates used in modern computational physics. 
5. Developed the theory of analytical mechanics that focused on improving the understanding of stability. 
6. Discovered the Stäckel transform in geodesy which led to improvements in mapping and surveying techniques.  
7. Developed the Stäckel matrix algebra which are useful in cosmic ray research and many other applied sciences. 
8. Proposed what is now referred to as the Stäckel density theorem related to geodesy. 
9. Published numerous works, including the multi-volume "Analytical Mechanics of Geodetic Movements", in which he further advanced the mathematics of geodesy.

Born 20 August 1862, Berlin, Prussia (now Germany). Died 12 December 1919, Heidelberg, Germany.
