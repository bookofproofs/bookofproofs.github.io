**Theodor Molien** was born in what is now Latvia and  studied associative algebras and polynomial invariants of finite groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the process of transforming a system of algebraic equations into a single differential equation, or "Molien series".
2. Contributed to the development of elliptic functions and Fourier series.
3. Proved Gottfried Leibnitz's generalization of Fermat's theorem.
4. Established the first table of prime numbers, known as the "Molien table".
5. Published important mathematical theories and works, such as the Theory of Equations, Differential and Integral Equations, Transformations of Integrals, etc. 
6. Demonstrated the existence of a link between algebra and analysis.
7. Discovered the properties of Lagrange identities and proved the theorems of Kronig, Thomae and Liebermann.
8. Authored a book on Number Theory, titled "Compendium der elementar-mathematik".

Born 10 September 1861, Riga, Russia (now Latvia). Died 25 December 1941, Tomsk, USSR.
