**Otton Nikodym** was a Polish mathematician who worked in America and is known for his work on integration theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father Otton Boguslaw died in an accident when he was only one year old and soon after that also his mother Marianna (née Cyprian) also died.
* On 2 April 1919, the Polish Mathematical Society was founded by sixteen mathematicians - among them Otton Nikodym.
* In 1924, under strong pressure from Sierpiński, Nikodym agreed to take his doctoral examination at Warsaw University.
* The Nikodyms (Otton and his wife Stanisława) spent the academic year 1926/27 at the Sorbonne and immediately after returning to Poland, in June 1927 Otton obtained his habilitation at Warsaw University.
* During this period Nikodym published 32 papers and four textbooks.
* Nikodym's name is mostly known in measure theory (e.
* the Radon-Nikodym theorem and derivative, the Nikodym convergence theorem, the Nikodym-Grothendieck boundedness theorem), in  functional analysis (the Radon-Nikodym property of a Banach space, the Frechet-Nikodym metric space, a Nikodym set), projections onto convex sets with applications to Dirichlet problem, generalized solutions of differential equations, descriptive set theory and the foundations of quantum mechanics.
* This paradoxical set in the plane, which for certain problems plays a role similar to Besicovitch sets is called a Nikodym set.
* In 1945 Nikodym became a professor at the Technical University of Cracow and in academic year 1945/46 taught mathematics.
* In 1946 Nikodym and his wife Stanisława left for Belgium and France where he began his work on mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics.
* After he retired, the Nikodyms moved in 1966 to Utica, New York, where he continued his research, sponsored in part by the Atomic Energy Comission and National Science Foundation.
* Nikodym wrote three volumes of Didactics of pure mathematics in high school but published only the two first volumes in 1930 and 1938.
* Nikodym liked good literature and fairy-tales but mostly music.

Born 13 August 1887, Zablotow, Galicia, Austria-Hungary (now Ukraine). Died 4 May 1974, Utica, USA.
