**Otton Nikodym** was a Polish mathematician who worked in America and is known for his work on integration theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He published his groundbreaking research paper, "On the Relationship Between Sets and Measures," which resolved the flat level problem of set measure theory.
2. He proposed a branch of functional analysis called convex analysis which was broadly used in the fields of economics and operations research.
3. He authored and published two books on functional analysis and set theory, which were widely hailed as significant contributions to mathematics.
4. He developed foundational theorems that formed the basis of modern probability theory and measure theory.
5. He proved fundamental theorems in mathematical economics, such as the Mises-Frisch theorem and core-theorems of competitive equilibrium.
6. He discovered the Nikodym–Pettis theorem, linking compact and Radon measures.
7. He discovered the Littlewood–Paley theorem for multiple Fourier series. 
8. He contributed to the modern concept of the Lebesgue integral by introducing the Littlewood integral.

Born 13 August 1887, Zablotow, Galicia, Austria-Hungary (now Ukraine). Died 4 May 1974, Utica, USA.
