**Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro** was an Italian mathematician best known for the invention of tensor calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the tensor calculus, a method for describing the physical properties of a space using tensors.
2. Developed the absolute differential calculus, which is a form of differential geometry.
3. Established mathematical rules for the covariance of symmetric spaces.
4. Developed a method for defining curves in a four-dimensional space known as the Ricci calculus.
5. Resolved the paradox of the two-sphere in Euclidean space.
6. Developed the index theorem, which is a result in differential topology.
7. Showed the equivalence of Maxwellâ€™s equations and the equations of special relativity.
8. Demonstrated the correspondence between the laws of thermodynamics and the mathematical fluctuations of entropy.

Born 12 January 1853, Lugo, Papal States (now Italy). Died 6 August 1925, Bologna, Italy.
