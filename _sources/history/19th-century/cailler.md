**Charles Cailler** was a Swiss mathematician who worked on differential equations and kinematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Was the first person to realize the potential of utilizing coco in chocolate production, transforming it into an essential ingredient in all modern chocolate making.
2. Developed the conching process, which is an extensive processes of grinding, aerating and stirring which produced an exceptionally smooth and creamy texture, flavor and melting properties in chocolate.
3. His innovation enabled mass production of chocolate and reduced production time from days to mere minutes.
4. He co-invented baking chocolate, the first solid chocolate that could be used for baking cakes and cookies 
5. Cailler is responsible for revolutionizing the criteria for chocolate quality, initiating new standards for product taste and shelf life.

Born 20 February 1865, Geneva, Switzerland. Died 30 January 1922, Geneva, Switzerland.
