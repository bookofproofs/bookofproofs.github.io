**Leslie Ellis **was a brilliant man with broad interests and abilities who suffered from ill health all his short life. Senior Wrangler in the Mathematical tripos at Cambridge in 1840, he became a fellow of Trinity College and was interested in areas of mathematics which involved philosophical ideas.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Francis and Mary Ellis were married on 12 October 1803 at St Mary the Virgin, Bathwick, Somerset.
* On official documents, Francis Ellis gives his occupation as "esquire" meaning he was of independent means.
* Francis and Mary Ellis had six children: Everina Frances Ellis (born 4 December 1806); Henry William Ellis (born 9 May 1808); Penelope Sarah Ellis (born 11 March 1811); Francis Ellis (born 23 January 1813); Mary Jane Ellis (born 5 August 1815); and Robert Leslie Ellis, the subject of this biography, born 25 August 1817 and baptised in St Mary's Chapel, Walcot, St Swithin, Somerset on 17 September 1817.
* We note here that Robert Leslie Ellis was known by his friends as 'Leslie Ellis' and wrote papers under the name 'R Leslie Ellis'.
* Leslie Ellis was home educated by his father and two tutors, one for mathematics and the other for classics.
* He resigned his fellowship before Ellis began studying with him but later, in 1836, Challis became director of the Cambridge Observatory and Plumian Professor of Astronomy.
* A year studying with Challis would have been a wonderful experience for Ellis but sadly his health collapsed and, after six weeks residence at Papworth Everard, he had to return home.
* Ellis matriculated at Trinity College in the Michaelmas Term (October) 1836 and began his study of the mathematical tripos.
* Of course the poor health from which Ellis continued to suffer must have had a marked influence on how he behaved.
* And, despite his head start, Ellis did indeed suffer appallingly as an undergraduate, especially during his final year of hard coaching with Hopkins.
* Ellis longed for the Tripos to be over.
* Not only was Ellis Senior Wrangler, but he was also First Smith's prizeman and, soon after that, he was elected a fellow of Trinity College.
* In 1841 his brother Henry William Ellis died, in the following year his father died, then on 27 August 1843 his brother Francis Ellis died.
* The result of the death of his father and elder brothers was that Leslie Ellis now inherited the bulk of the family fortune.
* Ellis was most interested in areas of mathematics which involved philosophical ideas.
* While holding his fellowship, Ellis edited two volumes of the Cambridge Mathematical Journal.
* Also in 1845, the British Association asked Ellis to write a report on recent progress in analysis.
* Although it contains no new results, Ellis's convenient account must have been of great value to the British mathematical community, still struggling to catch up with continental scholars.
* Ellis's fellowship at Trinity College ended in 1849 and, hoping to improve his health, he travelled to the south of France and north Italy.
* Ellis always retained an affectionate remembrance of him.
* Above all his sense of honour and propriety was perfect; nothing shabby or mean could exist in the same place with Leslie Ellis.

Born 25 August 1817, Bath, England. Died 12 May 1859, Trumpington, England.
