**Pavel Urysohn** was a Ukranian mathematician who proved important results in general topology and dimension theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed to topology, the mathematical study of the properties of shapes and their relations to each other.
2. Coined the terms “compact” and “connected” in topology, which are widely used today.
3. Discovered and mathematically studied the Urysohn metrization theorem, which states that every second countable regular space is metrizable.
4. Helped develop the Urysohn lemma, which states that, given any two disjoint closed sets in a normal topological space, there exists a continuous function that is equal to one on one set and equal to zero on the other.
5. Developed the theory of the Urysohn universal metric space, a complete metric space which contains all separable metric spaces as subspaces.
6. Demonstrated how a large class of abstract topological spaces and their continuous maps could be classified according to considerations of a particular metric space.

Born 3 February 1898, Odessa, Ukraine. Died 17 August 1924, Batz-sur-Mer, France.
