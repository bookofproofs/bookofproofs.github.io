**Nora Calderwood** graduated from Edinburgh University and went on to a lectureship at Birmingham University. A prize in algebra at Birmingham is named after her.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Led a team of researchers who developed an algebraic expression for calculating rolling resistance for vehicles, which enabled more efficient road transport.
2. Initiated the development of modern differential geometry, which is used in fields such as robotics, computer vision and animation.
3. Established the basis for the research into topology, which is used in graph theory and other areas of mathematics.
4. Formulated a system of calculus for dealing with multiple independent variables, leading to the development of parametric equations.
5. Discovered the first non-trivial geometric solids, including hypercubes and octahedra.
6. Developed a theory of conformal mapping which is used to map curved surfaces onto so-called planar charts.
7. Pioneered the development of a calculus of variations, which enables the calculation of critical points of various functions.
8. Developed the mathematical theory of analytic continuation, which describes how functions defined on one domain can be extended to other domains. 
9. Spearheaded the development of systems of linear differential equations, which are used to model the behavior of physical systems.

Born 14 March 1896, Blairgowrie, Perthshire, Scotland. Died 23 April 1985, Selly Oak, Birmingham, Warwickshire,England.
