**Dimitri Egorov** was a Russian mathematician who worked in differential geometry and mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Egorov Frattini theorem in the early 1900s, which is important in studying extremal problems in combinatorial algebra.
2. Established the theory of maximal and prime ideals in rings of continuous functions in the late 1900s.
3. Discovered the Notion of Almost Periodic Functions, characterizing them in terms of Fourier Transforms.
4. Developed the first evidence for the Cauchy Integral Theorem for singularities and branches.
5. Published papers on the theory of linear partial differential equations and the mathematical foundations of probability.
6. Led research in trigonometric series, which led to the establishment of the modern field of almost periodic functions.
7. Proved the Kohlrausch–Dedekind theorem, which is an important theorem in number theory.
8. Established the theory of linear partial differential equations with multiple parameters.
9. Demonstrated the solvability of several higher order linear partial differential equations.
10. Founded the theory of integral equations and published works on the calculus of variations.

Born 2 December 1869, Moscow, Russia. Died 10 September 1931, Kazan, USSR.
