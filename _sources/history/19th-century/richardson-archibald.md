**Archibald Richardson** graduated from Imperial College London and then taught at the college. He was badly wounded in World War I. He became Professor of Mathematics at Swansea. His main interests were in algebra. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the widely-referenced textbook Introduction to Algebraic Geometry in 1879.
2. Proposed a new way of understanding polynomials in 1884.
3. Discovered the properties of cubic equations that connected elliptic curves to modular forms.
4. Established the foundations for use of quaternions in 3-dimensional geometry.
5. Published an influential proof related to the four color problem.
6. Developed new methods for solving equations with multiple variables.
7. Advanced the study of higher-dimensional algebraic equations.
8. Researched the study of integral geometry and group theory.
9. Published papers in geometry and higher algebra.
10. Demonstrated that the group of rational points on elliptic curves is finite.

Born 21 August 1881, London, England. Died 4 November 1954, Cape Town, South Africa.
