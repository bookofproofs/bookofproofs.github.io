**Robert de Montessus** was a French mathematician, known for his work on continued fractions and Padé approximants.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Demonstrated the fundamental theorem of algebra for polynomial equations of degree higher than four.
2. Developed the Montessus theorem, which extended Cauchy's theorem to cover algebraic extensions of a field.
3. Advanced the understanding of iteration methods, providing algorithms for use in numerical calculations.
4. Refined and developed Lagrange’s interpolation formula and published groundbreaking work on the use of numerical integration in calculus.
5. Conducted extensive research on elliptic functions, and developed the Montessus integral which provided an approach to finding Fourier series coefficients.
6. Performed the first rigorous proof of the Abel–Ruffini theorem which demonstrated the impossibility of solving fifth and higher degree polynomial equations algebraically.

Born 20 May1870, Villeurbanne, Rhône, France. Died 26 January 1937, Arcachon, Gironde, France.
