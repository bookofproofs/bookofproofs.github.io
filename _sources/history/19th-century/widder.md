**David Widder** was an American mathematician who worked on integral transforms and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* David Henry Widder, born in Montsera, Pennsylvania, was a railway mail clerk who died of myocarditis in Harrisburg.
* We note at this point that Freda B Widder graduated from the Central High School, Harrisburg, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.
* In this school he sat beside a student called Rusty who said that Harvard was the best university so Widder applied to Harvard, took the entrance examination, and was accepted to begin his studies in September 1916.
* Back at Harvard, Widder took courses on complex variable from William Caspar Graustein (1888-1941) who, like Widder, had been at the Aberdeen Proving Ground.
* Edward B Van Vleck from the University of Wisconsin was visiting Harvard for a term and also taught Widder who graduated in 1920.
* After his year abroad, Widder returned to Harvard for the beginning of the 1921-22 academic year.
* Widder was awarded his Ph.D. in 1924 for his thesis Theorems of mean value and trigonometric interpolation.
* After the award of his Ph.D., Widder was appointed to Bryn Mawr College where the head of mathematics was Anna Pell.
* At this time Widder was appointed so succeed her as head of mathematics.
* In 1930 Widder moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, when he was given a joint appointment to Radcliffe College and Harvard University.
* Ada Comstock negotiated a new relationship between Radcliffe College and Harvard University in the 1940s and eventually Widder became a full professor at Harvard.
* Widder, in collaboration with Arthur Coble and Joseph Miller Thomas, became a founding managing editor of the Duke Mathematical Journal in 1935.
* Widder's book The Laplace Transform was published in 1941.
* Let us note at this point that David C Widder studied Mechanical Engineering at Northeastern University and Edith Widder studied biology at Tufts University.
* Widder attended many conferences, helped to organise some and made research visits.
* In addition to The Laplace transform (1941) which we mentioned above, Widder wrote several other important books.

Born 25 March 1898, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 8 July 1990, Arlington, Massachusetts, USA.
