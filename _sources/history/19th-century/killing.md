**Wilhelm Killing** was a German mathematician who introduced Lie algebras independently of Lie in his study of non-euclidean geometry. His classification of the simple Lie algebras was one of the finest achievements in the whole of mathematical research.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wilhelm Killing developed the “Killing-Cartan” classification of semisimple Lie algebras, laying the foundation for modern Lie theory. 
2. He contributed to algebraic geometry by giving equations for a double conic that is the intersection of two quadrics. 
3. Killing published a prize-winning work in 1880 entitled “Analysis Situs” which is widely regarded as a classic. 
4. He was a major contributor to the development of projective geometry. 
5. Wilhelm Killing was the first to determine the invariants of a cubic surface. 
6. He was the first to classify the three-dimensional Euclidean space. 
7. Killing discovered what would later be called the Euler-Killing vector equation. 
8. He was noted for his investigations of the curved spaces of constant curvature and their invariant properties.

Born 10 May 1847, Burbach (near Siegen), Westphalia, Germany. Died 11 February 1923, Münster, Germany.
