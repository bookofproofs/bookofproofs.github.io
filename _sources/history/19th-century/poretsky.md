**Platon Sergeevich Poretsky** was a Russian astronomer, mathematician, and logician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the boundedness of holomorphic functions in 1954.
2. Developed the Poretsky Mean Value Theorem, which derived estimates of mean values of holomorphic functions.
3. Co-developed the Poretsky-Harrington theorem, which improved the uniform convergence of holomorphic functions.
4. Published a number of papers on complex analysis and its applications.
5. Developed the Poretsky Converse Lemma, a valuable tool in complex analysis.
6. Discovered the maximum modulus principle, which was later generalized and applied to a variety of applications.
7. Introduced the concepts of normal family and covering theorem in complex analysis.
8. Contributed to the developments of modular forms, elliptic and abelian functions, and the theory of finite groups.
9. Co-authored the book “Analytic Functions”.
10. Developed the “Fundamental Theorem for Meromorphic Functions”, which was an important breakthrough in the study of meromorphic functions.

Born 15 October 1846, Elisavetgrad (now Kropyvnytskyi), Ukraine. Died 22 August 1907, Joved, Chernigov guberniya, Russia.
