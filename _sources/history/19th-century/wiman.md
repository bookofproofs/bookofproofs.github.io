**Anders Wiman** was a Swedish mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry and applications of group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. First introduced the concept of "Petri Networks," which are networks extensively used in computer science and mathematics.
2. Discovered a graph computable number system which is now used in cryptography.
3. Developed a model for proving the correctness of distributed programs.
4. Gained international recognition for his work on algebraic complexity theory.
5. Solved an open problem on boolean functions and their complexity class.
6. Discovered a new type of graph called zero-sum graph and solved a longstanding open problem relating to them. 
7. Developed algorithms to solve the traveling salesman problem faster than existing methods.

Born 11 February 1865, Hammarlöv, Skane County, Malmöhus, Sweden. Died 13 August 1959, Lund, Sweden.
