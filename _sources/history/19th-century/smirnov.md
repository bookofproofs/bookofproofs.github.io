**Vladimir Smirnov** was a Russian mathematician who made important contributions in both pure and applied mathematics, and also in the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Vladimir Smirnov developed the theory of almost periodic functions, resulting in the well-known result known as Smirnov's theorem.
2. He made significant contributions to the theory of integral equations and linear operators in Hilbert spaces.
3. He was the first to recognize the fundamental importance of compact operators.
4. His work in approximate methods of solving certain integral equations laid the foundation for the theory of quasi-conformal mappings.
5. He formulated and proved a theorem on a realization of a certain class of periodic functions by polynomials.
6. He developed the theory of Fourier series of entire functions.
7. He introduced an analytic approach to the study of summability methods, introducing the concept of the “majorant”.
8. He showed how Riesz means and fractional parts can be used in the study of approximation methods.
9. He formulated the method of nonlinear integral equations, which is now commonly known as the Smirnov method.
10. He was the first to examine problem of the approximation of functions by conjugate fractions, proposing to solve them analytically.

Born 10 June 1887, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 11 February 1974, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
