**Élie Cartan** worked on continuous groups, Lie algebras, differential equations and geometry. His work achieves a synthesis between these areas. He is one of the most important mathematicians of the first half of the 20C.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of non-Euclidean geometry.
2. Introduced the notion of exterior algebra and the theory of spinors.
3. Established the Cartan-Kähler Theory of Equations. 
4. Founded the theory of modules of exterior differential forms. 
5. Had a major part in the development of modern algebraic topology. 
6. Provided a new approach to the study of the theory of Lie groups. 
7. Discovered the method of equivalent systems used in the calculus of variations. 
8. Showed that Lie's concept of an algebraic group could correspond to a group of linear transformations. 
9. Pioneered the process of giving an abstract definition for 3D and 4D tensors and gave an axiomatic definition for abstract 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional manifolds. 
10. Developed the concept of absolute parallelism in Riemannian geometry.

Born 9 April 1869, Dolomieu (near Chambéry), Savoie, Rhône-Alpes, France. Died 6 May1951, Paris, France.
