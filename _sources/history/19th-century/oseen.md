**Wilhelm Oseen** was a Swedish mathematician who worked in fluid dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the “Oseen Transformation”: an analytic method for solving linear partial differential equations. 
2. Authored several books including "The Theory of Hydrodynamic Phenomena" and "The Foundations of Physical Geodesy". 
3. Established a new field of vector analysis and applied it to solve problems in physics, mechanics, elasticity theory and heat conduction. 
4. Solved the Navier-Stokes equations which describe fluid flow. 
5. Established the Oseen-Frank theory which transformed the theoretical understanding of liquid crystals.
6. Developed a three-dimensional analysis tool in elasticity theory, known as the Oseen-Zurcher theorem. 
7. Devised the Oseen equation to describe the behavior of a fluid-filled domain. 
8. Established the concept of a physical ‘tensor quantity’ and created a mathematical framework for its use.

Born 17 April 1879, Lund, Sweden. Died 7 November 1944, Engelbrekts, Stockholm County, Sweden.
