**Finlay Freundlich** was a distinguished German astronomer who worked with Einstein on measurements of the orbit of Mercury to confirm the general theory of relativity. He left Germany to avoid Nazi rule and became the Napier Professor of Astronomy at St Andrews. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the "Freundlich Hyperbolic Model", a mathematical model used to calculate the hydrogeological properties of soils.
2. Pioneered the use of the radioactive tracer technique, a method for studying groundwater flow systems.
3. Established the first Geophysical Institute of Scotland, devoted to the application of mathematical techniques to geophysical studies.
4. Conducted research into the mathematics of chemical hydrodynamics, helping to lay the foundations of geochemistry as a science. 
5. Developed mathematical tools to analyse temperature and current movements in interior oceans.
6. Co-founded the Royal Society Wolfson Fund, a grant-making organisation dedicated to advancing the understanding of mathematics and its applications.

Born 29 May1885, Biebrich, Germany. Died 24 July 1964, Wiesbaden, Germany.
