**Theodor Angheluță** was a Romanian mathematician who made important contributions to Function Theory, to Differential and Integral Equations, and to Functional and Algebraic Equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* From 1910, Theodor Angheluță was a student at the Sorbonne in Paris, working mainly on the guidance of Émile Picard.
* Theodor Angheluță was appointed associate professor in the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Bucharest in 1919.
* On 16 June 1922 Angheluță defended his Ph.D. thesis On a general class of trigonometric polynomials and the approximation of a continuous function at the University of Bucharest.
* After the award of his doctorate, in 1923 Angheluță was appointed as a full professor of Algebra in the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Cluj.
* Angheluță was fully involved in the intense work of organizing mathematical education at the University.
* Professor Theodor Angheluță was the dean of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Cluj between 1931 and 1932.
* All of them began operating in November 1940 and at this time Angheluță taught at Timișoara.
* Angheluță retired on 1 September 1947, but then, at the end of 1950, he was appointed again as a full professor at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at the Victor Babeș University of Cluj.
* From 1 October 1955 to September 1962, Professor Theodor Angheluță was a full professor in the Mathematics Department of the Technical Institute of Cluj.
* Theodor Angheluță made important contributions to Function Theory, to Differential and Integral Equations, and to Functional and Algebraic Equations.
* A special kind of functional equation is today named after him, namely the 'Angheluță type functional equation'.
* We note that this represents only small selection from the papers that Angheluță published.
* Theodor Angheluță died at Cluj in May 1964.

Born 28 April 1882, Adam, Tutova county, Romania. Died 30 May 1964, Cluj, Romania.
