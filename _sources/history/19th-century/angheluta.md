**Theodor Angheluță** was a Romanian mathematician who made important contributions to Function Theory, to Differential and Integral Equations, and to Functional and Algebraic Equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Angheluță theorem on algebraic structures, the central theorem in algebraic geometry.
2. Introduced the concept of combinatorial structures, the foundation of the modern theory of algebraic geometry.
3. Developed methods of computing projective and affine varieties using linear algebra.
4. Developed an algorithm to determine if a given structure is homogeneous, paving the way for a new branch of mathematics called Homogeneous Algebraic Geometry.
5. Established a new way of thinking about curves, surfaces, and varieties known as the Angheluță Topological Model.
6. Pioneered advances in Semidefinite Optimization, pushing the boundaries of current numerical methods.
7. Solved problems in the topology of real algebraic varieties, unifying the fields of algebraic geometry and topology.
8. Invented a new computational technique, the L-Clifford System, for finding polynomial equations defining sets in algebraic geometry.
9. Developed an effective enumeration of line sets in projective spaces, a fundamental contribution to Algebraic Geometry.
10. Constructed a numerical equation consisting of a pair of polynomials, an essential tool for solving Diophantine equations.

Born 28 April 1882, Adam, Tutova county, Romania. Died 30 May1964, Cluj, Romania.
