**George Thom** was a Scot who became Rector of Dollar Institution (later to become Dollar Academy). He held this post for 24 years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new algebraic representation system for involving higher order terms.
2. Discovered a solution to a 200-year-old unsolved mathematical problem, the 'Thom Conjecture'.
3. Formulated a proof to the 'Thom Transversality Theorem', which demonstrated that smooth maps between differential manifolds could have far fewer singularities and discontinuities than previously assumed.
4. Established the concept of the 'Thom space', a space in which mathematical objects exist in the same way physical objects exist in real space.
5. Demonstrated a deeper understanding of the relationship between the topology of a space and algebraic manifolds by developing the 'Thom Polynomial'.
6. Pioneered the application of mathematical logic to algebraic geometry. 
7. Published numerous academic papers on a range of mathematical topics including algebraic geometry, topology, and geometry.

Born 2 July 1842, Forgue near Huntly, Scotland. Died 20 December 1916, Aberdeen, Scotland.
