**Carl Bjerknes** was a Norwegian mathematician and physicist who worked in pure mathematics as well as hydrodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1844 Bjerknes entered the University of Christiania (now Oslo), where he studied mining.
* The oldest school of mines in the world, founded 1757, was in the town and Bjerknes worked there from 1848 until 1852.
* For two years, from 1852 to 1854, Bjerknes taught mathematics in a school but an award of a scholarship enabled him to study mathematics at Göttingen and Paris in 1856-57.
* Dirichlet lectured to Carl Bjerknes in Göttingen on hydrodynamics and Bjerknes became so interested in that topic that he spent the rest of his life researching in that area.
* They had two other sons, Carl who became a sailor and died in a tropical cyclone, and Ernst who became an engineer.
* In particular one of their grandsons Jacob Bjerknes, Vilhelm Bjerknes's son, also achieved great fame as a scientist.
* Despite the difficulties under which he worked, Bjerknes produced outstanding results and was promoted to Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of Christiania in 1866.
* Let us examine a little this work which assumed such a dominant role in Bjerknes' life.
* Bjerknes discovered analogies between the way bodies could move through a frictionless fluid and certain electromagnetic effects.
* The treatise was entitled Hydrodynamic action at a distance according to C A Bjerknes's theory.

Born 24 October 1825, Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. Died 20 March 1903, Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway.
