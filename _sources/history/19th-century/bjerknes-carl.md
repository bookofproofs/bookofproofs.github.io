**Carl Bjerknes** was a Norwegian mathematician and physicist who worked in pure mathematics as well as hydrodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Carl's parents both came from poor farming backgrounds but, since Carl's father was the youngest son, he had no farm to inherit so he went to Copenhagen to qualify as a veterinary surgeon.
* Elen Holmen, Carl's mother, came from Drammen (about 30 km from Sandsvär) where her father was also a farmer.
* In 1825, when Carl was twelve years old, his father died and Carl's mother was left to bring up their three children with very little income.
* In 1844 Bjerknes entered the University of Christiania (now Oslo), where he studied mining.
* The oldest school of mines in the world, founded 1757, was in the town and Bjerknes worked there from 1848 until 1852.
* For two years, from 1852 to 1854, Bjerknes taught mathematics in a school but an award of a scholarship enabled him to study mathematics at Göttingen and Paris in 1856-57.
* Dirichlet lectured to Carl Bjerknes in Göttingen on hydrodynamics and Bjerknes became so interested in that topic that he spent the rest of his life researching in that area.
* In 1859, after returning from his foreign travels, Bjerknes had married Aletta Koren whose father was a minister in the Church in West Norway.
* Their son Vilhelm Bjerknes was born in 1862 and he played an important role in his father's work both as an assistant to his father when he was young, then later writing up his father's hydrodynamical work for publication.
* They had two other sons, Carl who became a sailor and died in a tropical cyclone, and Ernst who became an engineer.
* Perhaps it is worth mentioning just how talented a family Carl and Aletta Bjerknes had.
* In particular one of their grandsons Jacob Bjerknes, Vilhelm Bjerknes's son, also achieved great fame as a scientist.
* Despite the difficulties under which he worked, Bjerknes produced outstanding results and was promoted to Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of Christiania in 1866.
* By the time that Vilhelm was old enough to assist his father, Bjerknes had become something of a recluse living in a world of his own, totally dominated by his hydrodynamic research.
* Let us examine a little this work which assumed such a dominant role in Bjerknes' life.
* Bjerknes discovered analogies between the way bodies could move through a frictionless fluid and certain electromagnetic effects.
* We mentioned above that it was Vilhelm Bjerknes who wrote up his father's hydrodynamical work for publication.
* The treatise was entitled Hydrodynamic action at a distance according to C A Bjerknes's theory.

Born 24 October 1825, Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. Died 20 March 1903, Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway.
