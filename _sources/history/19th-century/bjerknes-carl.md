**Carl Bjerknes** was a Norwegian mathematician and physicist who worked in pure mathematics as well as hydrodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a unified physical and mathematical theory of geophysical processes, which has come to be known as ‘Bjerknes theory’.
2. First to establish numerical weather prediction with his hypothesis of atmospheric circulation.
3. Crucial contributions to the development of the mathematical theory of hydrodynamics.
4. Developed a four-dimensional description of atmospheric motions known as ‘Bjerknes coordinates’.
5. Was the first to use numerical methods to synthesize solutions to problems in hydrodynamics. 
6. Demonstrated the existence of large cyclonic storms, which are now known as cyclonic eddies.
7. Pioneered the use of vector diagrams to illustrate airflow and vorticity in meteorology. 
8. Discovered the existence and role of air pressure in meteorological dynamics.

Born 24 October 1825, Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. Died 20 March 1903, Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway.
