**Aleksandr Nekrasov** was a Russian mathematician who applied mathematics to hydromechanics and aeromechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the paper "The Theory of Difference Equations With Unbounded Delay" which contributed to the field of analysis and optimization of discrete decision structure.
2. Developed a method of constructing solutions to equations with unbounded delays.
3. Developed analogs of the classical results of vectorial analysis and of the results of the theory of functions of a complex variable, for equations with delays.
4. Constructed the solutions to singular integral equations in the theory of approximation of functions. 
5. Proved the existence of a new type of equation with delay, called the integral-delay equation, and constructed its solution. 
6. Introduced a new qualitative method for solving boundary value problems in partial differential equations with delays. 
7. Provided definitive solutions to various problems in the theory of summability of multiple Fourier series. 
8. Established a theory of conditions for Fredholm equations of the first kind with delays. 
9. Developed criteria for the solvability of equations with bounded delays, and criteria for their solvability. 
10. Established a theory of the decay of solutions to equations with retarded arguments and constructed its solutions.

Born 9 December 1883, Moscow, Russia. Died 21 May1957, Moscow, Russia.
