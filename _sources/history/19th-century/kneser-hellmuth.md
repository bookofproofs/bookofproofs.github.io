**Hellmuth Kneser** was a Estonian-born German mathematician best known for his work in group theory and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Hellmuth entered the University of Breslau in 1916 where his father was the Professor of Mathematics.
* Schmidt's lectures at Breslau were to prove an important influence on Hellmuth Kneser's mathematical development.
* From Breslau Kneser went to Göttingen to undertake research.
* After the award of his doctorate Kneser remained at Göttingen.
* His first student was Baer and, at Göttingen, Kneser supervised Baer's doctoral thesis on the classification of curves on surfaces.
* Kneser did not remain long at Göttingen for, in 1925, he succeeded Radon to a chair in Greifswald.
* Kneser spent twelve years at Greifswald before he accepted the chair at Tübingen in 1937.
* When Süss died in 1958 it was Kneser who took over the scientific leadership of the Oberwolfach Institute.
* Describing the areas of mathematics on which Kneser worked is difficult since his work was so wide ranging throughout mathematics.
* Kneser published on sums of squares in fields, on groups, on non-Euclidean geometry, on Harald Bohr's almost periodic functions, on iteration of analytic functions, on the differential geometry of manifolds, on local uniformisation and boundary values.
* After Kneser moved to Tübingen the emphasis in his work changed.
* Hellmuth Kneser was the son of Adolf Kneser.
* Martin Kneser, another mathematician, is Hellmuth Kneser's son.

Born 16 April 1898, Dorpat, Russian Empire (now Tartu, Estonia). Died 23 August 1973, Tübingen, Germany.
