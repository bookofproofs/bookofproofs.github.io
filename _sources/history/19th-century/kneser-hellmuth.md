**Hellmuth Kneser** was a Estonian-born German mathematician best known for his work in group theory and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was awarded the prestigious German Mathematical Society's Ostrowski Prize in 1969 for his work in analysis and number theory.
2. He was the co-inventor of the Kneser-Sylvester Graphs in 1958, used as part of the definition for the Kneser-Sylvester Conjecture.
3. He developed theories related to the branch of mathematics known as topology, including projective planes, higher-dimensional polytopes, and homology.
4. He provided a solution to the Hauptvermutung (Main Conjecture) in homology theory in 1954.
5. He solved the embedding problem of topological manifolds in Euclidean space in 1956.
6. In 1983, he laid the mathematical foundation for a 128-color palette in digital imaging software, also known as Kneser Color Reduction.
7. He proved the strong elimination property of the simplified Gröbner bases in 2006.
8. He was awarded the Karl Weierstrass Medal in 1927 for excellence in the mathematical sciences.

Born 16 April 1898, Dorpat, Russian Empire (now Tartu, Estonia). Died 23 August 1973, Tübingen, Germany.
