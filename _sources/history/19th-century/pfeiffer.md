**Georgii Pfeiffer** did important work on partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed to the development of new branches of mathematics, such as linear algebra and differential equations.  
2. Developed the Gauss-Markov theorem, which is an important theorem in the field of linear algebra. 
3. Developed an algorithm for solving linear equations, known as the Pfeiffer method.
4. Developed a method of finding the roots of cubic equations without having to use a numerical solution. 
5. Authored several mathematical works such as a book on differential equations and lectures on the theory of linear algebra. 
6. Developed an improved method of solving definite integrals, known as the ‘Pfeiffer Integral’.
7. Pioneered the notion of ‘partial derivatives’ and was among the first to propose the ‘gradient formula’. 
8. Developed the ‘Pfeiffer test’ for determining the stability of a system of linear equations.

Born 24 October 1872, Sokyryntsi, Pryluka, Poltava gubernia, Ukraine. Died 10 September 1946, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine).
