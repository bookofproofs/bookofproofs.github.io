**Louis de Broglie** was a French mathematician best known for his description of the dual particle-wave properties of the electron.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Schrödinger equation, a fundamental equation of quantum theory. 
2. Formulated the theory of wave mechanics, a mathematical description of the behavior of particles at the atomic level. 
3. Proposed the de Broglie hypothesis, which explains how electrons can exhibit wave-like behavior. 
4. Won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929 for his work on the wave nature of matter. 
5. Discovered the wave-like equations that govern the behavior of waves in non-uniform media, leading to the development of the theory of “wave group”. 
6. Co-developed the mathematical theory of “wave scattering”, which is commonly used to explain the interactions between particles and radiation. 
7. Developed the concept of “quantum potential”, an additional force beyond physical laws that acts on a quantum system. 
8. Pioneered the development of the theory of “quantum tunnelling”, which explains how particles can pass through barriers normally considered as impenetrable. 
9. Established the concept of “spin-orbit coupling” which links the spin of an electron to its orbital motion. 
10. Proposed the “exclusion principle” which explains the behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules.

Born 15 August 1892, Dieppe, France. Died 19 March 1987, Paris, France.
