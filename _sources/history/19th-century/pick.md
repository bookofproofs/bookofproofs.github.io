**Georg Pick** was an Austrian mathematician best known for his formula on the area of a polygon in a lattice of points.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Georg Pick introduced the concept of the Pick matrix, which provides a generalization of the Toeplitz matrix. 
2. He developed the Pick interpolation problem, a univariate interpolation problem, for which he proved an existence and uniqueness theorem.
3. He formulated a series of theorems now known as the Pick–Nevanlinna theory.
4. Pick wrote two monographs: Eine Extremalaufgabe aus der Theorie der Funktionen mehrerer komplexer Veränderlichen und ihre Anwendung auf ein Gebiet der Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen and Theorie und Anwendungen der unendlichwertigen Potenzreihen.
5. He is credited with the statement and proof of the Weierstrass–Pick Theorem.
6. He pioneered a theory of equations with a finite number of transcendental elements.
7. He proved an existence and uniqueness theorem for the Pick Interpolation Problem.
8. Pickalso expanded the traditional scope of linear algebra with his research of nonlinear equations and his introduction of determinantal forms.

Born 10 August 1859, Vienna , Austria. Died 26 July 1942, Theresienstadt, Bohemia, now Czech Republic.
