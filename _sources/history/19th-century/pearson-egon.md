**Egon Pearson** was an English statistician who worked on statistical hypothesis testing. He was the son of Karl Pearson.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the chi-squared test, a statistical technique used to test the significance of an effect or observation. 
2. Spearheaded the development of maximum likelihood estimation, a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model. 
3. Researched the application of probability theory to physical and biological phenomena.
4. Researched and developed the concept of standard errors and p-values, now commonly used in the scientific community. 
5. Pioneered the use of hypothesis testing, a form of inference based on probability theory. 
6. Established the Fisher–Pry feature selection method, which uses statistical tests to determine the relevance of a feature to a chosen model.
7. Made innovations in the field of factor analysis, a statistical technique used to identify the underlying structure of a given dataset. 
8. Instrumental in the development of sufficiency, a concept in probability theory that states the information needed to make a statistically valid inference.

Born 11 August 1895, Hampstead (near London), England. Died 12 June 1980, Midhurst, Sussex, England.
