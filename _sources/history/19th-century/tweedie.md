* Charles was a pupil at George Watson's College, Edinburgh and while there he was awarded a Sibbald Bursary to study at the University of Edinburgh.
* Tweedie decided to study mathematics abroad and went to the leading centre for mathematics in the world at that time, namely the University of Göttingen, in 1891.
* An obituary of Tweedie, written by E M Horsburgh, appeared in the Mathematical Gazette.
