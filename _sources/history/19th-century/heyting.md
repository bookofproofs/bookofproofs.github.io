**Arend Heyting** is important in the development of intuitionistic logic and algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Arend Heyting developed the mathematical logic called intuitionistic logic in the 1930s, which has been essential for the development of theory of computation.
2. He was an early investigator of semantics for intuitionistic mathematics and formalized Heyting algebras, mathematical structures used in studying Heyting's logic.
3. His contributions to the study of intuitionistic mathematics earned him the 1958 Ackermann Award.
4. Heyting was a co-founder of the School of Intuitionism, alongside Luitzen Brouwer and Nicholas de Bruijn.
5. He published important work on the theory of topological vector spaces.
6. He published works on the intuitionistic formalization of analysis.
7. He developed the Heyting Arithmetic, an intuitionistic first-order arithmetic whose language formula can capture truth in arithmetic.
8. Heyting had a major role in setting the foundations of algebraic geometry. 
9. He published mathematical works in the field of geometry and algebraic geometry.
10. He was honored with the Do-Lor Watenpaugh Medal in 1969 for his contributions to mathematics.

Born 9 May 1898, Amsterdam, Netherlands. Died 9 July 1980, Lugano, Switzerland.
