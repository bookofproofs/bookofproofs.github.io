**Niels Nielsen** was a Danish mathematician who worked on special functions and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed several methods in calculus and complex analysis, such as the Nielsen theorem, Jacobi's Inversion theorem, and the Nielsen solution of the Riemann problem.
2. Research contributions to topology and number theory, including the theory of K3 surfaces, Nielsen's minimal surface, and the Nielsenâ€“Konig theorem.
3. Pioneering works in advanced landscapes of mathematics such as and category theory, homotopy theory, algebraic topology and group theory.
4. Established the Nielsen graph, a powerful concept and tool in mathematics, which is sometimes referred to as the Nielsen parameterized graph or the Nielsen dual graph.
5. Discovery of several new mathematical theorems, such as the Nielsen parity theorem and Nielsen's lemma.
6. Famous for the Nielsen number, the Nielsen partial order, and the Nielsen coincidence rank.
7. Expansion of complex analysis and its application to various real-life problems.
8. Known for his two monumental treatises Der Eindeutige Analytische Funktionen and Vorlesungen uber die Combinatorische Topologie.

Born 2 December 1865, Orslev, Denmark. Died 16 September 1931, Copenhagen, Denmark.
