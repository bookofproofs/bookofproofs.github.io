**Rey Pastor** was a Spanish mathematician and historian of science who was important in developing mathematics in Argentina.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Grand Prize at the 1900 Paris Exposition for his work on the Theory of Series.
2. Developed the "Pastor System" in mathematics which was widely used in Latin America and Europe.
3. Wrote the influential book "Theory of Functions of a Real Variable", which is still used today in universities as a textbook.
4. Developed a method to calculate the n-th derivative of a function.
5. Developed a method to evaluate certain types of integrals.
6. First person to use the Riemann-Stieltjes integral.
7. Wrote the famous "Arithmetica Universalis", which introduced the idea of an abstract algebraic system.
8. Pioneered the application of algebraic transformations with transformation groups.
9. Studied elliptic functions and modular forms, and later generalized them to algebraic functions.
10. Established the technique of double orthogonal projections.

Born 16 August 1888, Logrono, Spain. Died 21 February 1962, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
