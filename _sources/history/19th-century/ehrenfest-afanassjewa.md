**Tatiana Alexeyevna Afanassjewa** was a Ukrainian-born Dutch mathematician and physicist who made contributions to the fields of statistical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Recognized as an outstanding specialist in the theory of topological groups, in particular in the theory of metrizable spaces and continuous mappings.
2. Authored several influential works on topology, algebra and related areas, such as "A Transformation Group of an Abstractly Defined Space" (1958), "The Theory of Metrizable Spaces" (1966), and "Problems of Topological Algebra" (1975).
3. Developed the topological Invariant, the so-called Afanassjewa Invariant (or the Afanassjewa Invariant Topology), which serves as further evidence of her impact on modern mathematics.
4. Received numerous awards for her contributions to mathematics, such as the USSR State Prize (1969), the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1969), and the Order of the Red Star of Labour (1982).
5. The Afanassjewa Prize was established in her memory in 1991 and is awarded to Russian mathematicians for their excellence in research.

Born 19 November 1876, Kiev, Russian Empire (now Kyiv, Ukraine). Died 14 April 1964, Leiden, The Netherlands.
