**William Metzler** was a Canadian mathematician who published papers on the theory of matrices and determinants.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He was awarded a Ph.D. by Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts in 1892 for his thesis On the Roots of Matrices written with William Story and Henry Taber as advisors.
* Metzler was appointed to Syracuse University, New York, where he became a professor in 1895.
* William Henry Metzler, for instance, had found a proof of a conjecture about the relation between the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix and the determinants of some of its minors.
* We list a few of Metzler's papers: Homogeneous strains (1893); On certain aggregates of determinant minors (1901); On the rank of a matrix (1913); On the expression of certain minors of the lth compound of a determinant as a function of the elements of a single line of the mth compound (1913); Some relations between compound determinants (1925); On an expression of a minor of order two of the Mth compound of a determinant A in terms of minors of A of order higher than M (1925); On certain determinant relations (1926).
* In June 1918 Metzler joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society and remained a member of the Society throughout his career.

Born 18 September 1863, Odessa, Ontario, Canada. Died 18 April 1943, Syracuse, New York, USA.
