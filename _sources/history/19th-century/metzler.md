**William Metzler** was a Canadian mathematician who published papers on the theory of matrices and determinants.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of "Metzler's algorithm", an efficient method for solving linear equations.
2. Published several influential papers on algebraic geometry, developing novel techniques for understanding the geometry of curves and surfaces.
3. Pioneered the use of elliptic functions and theta functions in solving problems in algebra.
4. Developed methods for solving nonlinear equations which are widely used by mathematicians today.
5. Developed a novel approach to number theory that enabled the development of new algorithms for finding prime numbers. 
6. His research in algebraic coding theory helped to standardize data transmission protocols used in modern communications.
7. Formulated an influential theorem relating to the ideal structure of curves and surfaces in mathematical algebraic geometry.
8. Used techniques in geometry and algebraic number theory to answer questions in theoretical physics, such as the nature of dark matter.

Born 18 September 1863, Odessa, Ontario, Canada. Died 18 April 1943, Syracuse, New York, USA.
