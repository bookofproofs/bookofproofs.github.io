**Jenő Egerváry** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in combinatorial optimisation. He committed suicide after the crushing of the Hungarian revolution.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Completing the first rigorous proof of the Szemerédi Regularity Lemma in 1970.
2. Developing the theory of matroids and establishing the well-known theorem of Whitney in 1935.
3. Advocating the use of Yablonskii diagram technique to provide an initial visualization of power system network structure.
4. Devising the Alon-Tarsi conjecture on edge-transitivity in regular bipartite graphs in 1983.
5. Founding the Hungarian Mathematical and Physical Society in the late 1920s.
6. Proposing the Egerváry-Médard conjecture in 1972 which established the relationship between the diameter of a graph and its domination number.
7. Pinpointing the delicate balance between the elements in matrix problem-solving techniques during the 1950s.
8. Formulating the Courcelle-Egerváry theorem which demonstrated the ability to solve problems concerning graph structure in very limited time frames.

Born 16 April 1891, Debrecen, Hungary. Died 30 November 1958, Budapest, Hungary.
