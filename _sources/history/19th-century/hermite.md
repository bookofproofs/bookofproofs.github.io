**Charles Hermite**'s work in the theory of functions includes the application of elliptic functions to the quintic equation. He published the first proof that `$e$` is a transcendental number.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved in 1858 that e is transcendental, meaning not equal to a root of any polynomial equation with rational coefficients.
2. Published the theory of Hermite interpolation in 1859.
3. Was the first to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra in 1873.
4. Published a paper on the theory of automorphic functions in 1873.
5. Established the foundations of the theory of algebraic numbers in 1888.
6. Developed a new method of calculating vertical motion and published his findings in 1891.
7. Was the first to prove the Prime Number Theorem in 1896.

Born 24 December 1822, Dieuze, Lorraine, France. Died 14 January 1901, Paris, France.
