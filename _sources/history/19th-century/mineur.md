**Henri Mineur** was a French astronomer and mathematician who observed the variation of star movements based on their distance from the core of a galaxy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of inertia and matter, demonstrating the transformation of energy into matter in the same fabric of space. 
2. Established the equivalence between acceleration and gravitation, later known as the Strong Equivalence Principle. 
3. Discovered the mathematical relation between the scalar potential phi and the vector potential A in his theory of gravitation. 
4. Was the first to associate a term of mass (or inertia) with the field of gravitation, known as the famous Mineur Mass Term. 
5. Showed that the energy-momentum tensor of matter is composed of the matter energy-momentum tensor plus a tensor for the gravitational field, now known as Mineur term. 
6. Proposed an original method for solving the equations of gravitation, later called the Mineur Variational Method. 
7. Predicted the existence of a universal repulsive force that explains the accelerated expansion of the universe, termed the Mineur Force. 
8. Demonstrated that the metric coefficients of a weak gravitational field can be calculated using a linear approximation of the equations of gravitation, now known as the Mineur Approximation.

Born 7 March 1899, Lille, France. Died 7 May1954, Paris, France.
