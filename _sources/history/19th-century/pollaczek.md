**Leo Félix Pollaczek** was an Austrian-French engineer and mathematician who worked in number theory, mathematical analysis, mathematical physics and probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to define and solve the first Erlang B Formula for blocking probabilities in queues with an infinite number of servers.
2. He was the first to derive the Erlang C Formula for computing the delay in queues with an infinite number of servers. 
3. He developed an approach to integrate the Erlang formulas into the performance evaluation of packet switching networks.
4. He devised formulas for analyzing the quality of the service in queueing systems and the performance of switches in telephone exchanges. 
5. He developed the Pollaczek-Khinchin Formula for computing the spectral density of the workload in traffic analysis. 
6. He developed the Pollaczek–Khinchin theorem for computing cumulative distribution functions of the workload in traffic analysis. 
7. He was the first to define and solve the Total Time Delay Problem, a queuing theory problem in telephone traffic. 
8. He developed Pollaczek's formula for waiting time in queues with a finite number of servers.

Born 1 December 1892, Vienna, Austria. Died 29 April 1981, Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, France.
