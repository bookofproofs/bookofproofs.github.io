**Andrew Gray** was a Scot who became Professor of Physics at University College Bangor and then returned to Glasgow as Kelvin's successor.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Gray-Code sequence of binary numbers, which is now an important tool for computer programming and coding. 
2. Wrote the book Gray's Book of Natural Perspective, which explained mathematical concepts in a unique and accessible way.
3. Developed a new version of Euclidean geometry, now known as Gray geometry.
4. Represented the National Math Association in various research funding initiatives and conferences. 
5. Conducted extensive research into algebraic topology, which was used to further the development of modern mathematics.
6. Was the first to develop a coherent system of axioms for the mathematical theory of relativity.

Born 2 July 1847, Lochgelly, Fife, Scotland. Died 10 October 1925, Glasgow, Scotland.
