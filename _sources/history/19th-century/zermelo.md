**Ernst Zermelo** was a German mathematician who did pioneering work on the foundations of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the axiom of choice, an extension of the Principle of Comprehension (Zermelo's Axiom) to infinite sets of elements.
2. Founded the modern and widely accepted set theory system.
3. Developed a proof of the independence of the axiom of choice and the well-ordering theorem.
4. Developed the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, which lead to the formulation of the Zermelo-Fraenkel-Choice set theory (ZFC.)
5. The Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory became the standard foundation of modern mathematics.
6. Established a general symmetry model (now known as Zermelo-Fraenkel geometries). 
7. Provided an ordering method for the apportionment problem (a variation of the "horse-voting" technique known as Zermelo's method).
8. Introduced the modern definitions of cardinality and ordinality.

Born 27 July 1871, Berlin, Germany. Died 21 May1953, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.
