**William Clifford** was an English mathematician who studied non-euclidean geometry arguing that energy and matter are simply different types of curvature of space. He introduced what is now called a Clifford algebra which generalises Grassmann's exterior algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of a geometrical system of the algebraic equations, now known as Clifford algebra.
2. Published major works on Abelian functions (theory of integrals) and on biquaternions.
3. Developed a method of attributing numerical values to the solutions of quadratic forms. 
4. Authored On the Space-Theory of Matter, which proposed the concept of a spinning atom.
5. Created an exchange method between a general equation and its primitive form.
6. Established a modified version of the five-circle theorem.
7. Demonstrated the triple-locus construction (showing how the intersection of three spheres is a circle with a center at their common intersection).
8. Explored theology and metaphysical issues through logic.

Born 4 May1845, Exeter, Devon, England. Died 3 March 1879, Madeira Islands, Portugal.
