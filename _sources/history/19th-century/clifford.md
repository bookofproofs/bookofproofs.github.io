**Clifford** was an English mathematician who studied non-euclidean geometry arguing that energy and matter are simply different types of curvature of space. He introduced what is now called a Clifford algebra which generalises Grassmann's exterior algebra.

Born 4 May 1845 Exeter, Devon, England. Died 3 March 1879 Madeira Islands, Portugal.
