**Sof'ja Aleksandrovna Janovskaja** was a Polish-born mathematician who worked on the philosophy of mathematics and logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the four square theorem, which states that all integers can be expressed as the sum of at most four integer squares.
2. Contributed to the fundamentals of hyperbolic geometry, by examining the models for smooth surfaces of revolution. 
3. Advanced the theory of Schottky groups and automorphic functions. 
4. Developed a generalized version of the Fermat Last Theorem in number theory. 
5. Published numerous papers in the areas of number theory, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. 
6. Constructed a lattice in five-dimensional space. 
7. Discovered methods for solving special cases of the invariant equation of a definite quadratic form. 
8. Developed new methods for constructing perfect analogues of abelian fields.

Born 31 January 1896, Pruzhany, Russian Empire (now Belarus). Died 24 October 1966, Moscow, USSR.
