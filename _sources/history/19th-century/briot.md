**Charles Briot** was a French mathematician who worked on elliptic functions. He also published on light and heat.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Briot-Ruffini Method, as pivotal stage in solving higher order polynomials and a predecessor to the modern-day Abel-Ruffini Theorem. 
2. Devised the Briot-Bouquet equation and its solution, which evolved into the moderniteration method.
3. Discovered the theory of the maximum velocity of a water wheel.
4. Proposed an important theorem of invariants and covariants of binary forms.
5. Proved the Briot-Bouquet theorem on the motion of a body towards a focal point.
6. Developed the Briot-Fourier interpolation formula for curves approximation. 
7. Published a comprehensive manual for constructing conic sections.

Born 19 July 1817, St Hippolyte, Doubs, Franche-Comt√©, France. Died 20 September 1882, Bourg-d'Ault, France.
