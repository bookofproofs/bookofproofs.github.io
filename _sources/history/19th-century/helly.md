**Helly** worked on functional analysis and proved the Hahn-Banach theorem in 1912 fifteen years before Hahn published essentially the same proof and 20 years before Banach gave his new setting.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved one of the most famous theorems in mathematical analysis, the Helly Selection Theorem. 
2. Developed the fixed point theorem that is now known as the Fan-Browder Theorem. 
3. Developed Helly's theorem in convex geometry, which states that if a finite family of convex sets has the property that each subfamily of a certain size has a non-empty intersection, then the entire family has a non-empty intersection. 
4. Established a basic theorem in Banach space theory, showing that every bounded sequence of linear operators in a Banach space has a strongly convergent subsequence. 
5. Formulated the foundations for modern vector optimization. 
6. Developed the notion of vector lattices and applied them to minimization problems.

Born 1 June 1884, Vienna, Austria. Died 28 November 1943, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
