**Jakob Amsler-Laffon**  was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, engineer and inventor.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method of proving the quadratic reciprocity law for number fields.
2. Helped popularize the metric system in Switzerland. 
3. Introduced an iterative method to solve Î» (lambda)-types of equations. 
4. Developed a form of the analysis of configurations with two imaginary elements. 
5. Found the equation of continuous dependence of the roots of an equation on its coefficients. 
6. Proved that invariants of binary quintics are rational integers. 
7. Co-discovered the Pell-Fermat theorem. 
8. Solved several open problems in algebraic number theory.

Born 16 November 1823, Stalden bei Brugg, Switzerland. Died 3 January 1912, Schaffhausen, Switzerland.
