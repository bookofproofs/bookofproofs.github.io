**Jakob Amsler-Laffon**  was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, engineer and inventor.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Amsler studied theology first at the University of Jena and then at the University of Königsberg.
* It was at Königsberg that Amsler changed his course from theology to mathematics and physics.
* The teacher who changed Amsler's future was Franz Neumann whose lectures and laboratory sessions he attended at the University of Königsberg.
* In 1848 Amsler was awarded his doctorate from the University of Königsberg and he then returned to Switzerland to continue his education.
* Back in Switzerland, Amsler worked for a year at the observatory in Geneva.
* In 1851, wishing to have more time to devote to his research, Amsler took a position at the Gymnasium in Schaffhausen, a town in northern Switzerland situated on the bank of the Rhine.
* Amsler extended the theorems of both Ivory and Poisson on this topic.
* Shortly after his marriage Amsler changed his research interests and his career.
* In 1856 Amsler published a paper Über das Planimeter Ⓣ(On the planimeter) in which he gave details of his idea.
* In order to make money from his invention, Amsler set up a workshop in Schaffhausen in 1854 specially designed to produce his polar planimeter.
* Amsler did not rest his fame on this single inspired idea but continued to invent new precision instruments.
