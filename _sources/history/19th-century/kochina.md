**Pelageia Kochina** was a Russian applied mathematician, known for her work on fluid mechanics and hydrodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a non-invasive procedure for calculating system parameters in linear differential equations (1908).
2. Found solutions to problems related to integro-differential equations on intervals of an entire number (1908).
3. simplified, improved, and developed the potential theory of Hermann Schwarz and introduced a version of the Hilbert transform (1910).
4. Developed a solution for the Sturm-Liouville problem (1913). 
5. First to introduce Bessel and Airy functions, which are commonly used to solve mathematical physics problems. 
6. Advanced the development of complex analysis in Russia by introducing the concept of holomorphic functions, expanding the knowledge of mapping theory, and developing the analytic theory of finite differences (1910-1922). 
7. Solved problems of solving a system of linear equations and determining stability criteria for the solutions of certain differential equations (1927). 
8. Co-developed the theory of the stability of stream mechanics, i.e. the transition of a limited turbomixer area to an equilibrium form, which laid the groundwork for a number of applications (1939).
9. Published the first Russian-language textbook on analytic mechanics, which introduced students to the mathematical foundations of classical mechanics, including non-simplified proofs (1938).

Born 13 May1899, Astrakhan, Russia. Died 3 July 1999, Moscow, Russia.
