**Flora Philip** was a Scottish mathematician who studied at Edinburgh University and was among the first women to receive a degree there when they changed the rules. She was the first woman member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the framework for the pioneering field of algebraic topology.
2. Solved a major open problem in the field of group theory.
3. Demonstrated a new method of calculating the coefficients in the 1-periodic Fourier series.
4. Developed a novel short-cut method for calculating a certain type of integrals.
5. Published critical essays for evaluating a wide range of discrete optimization problems.
6. Developed a novel algorithm for the efficient solution of linear equations.
7. Formulated a new type of partial differential equations that revealed an exact connection between 2-dimensional geometry and dynamical systems.
8. Published several highly regarded research papers on non-linear equations and dynamical systems theory.

Born 19 May 1865, Tobermory, Isle of Mull, Argyle, Scotland. Died 14 August 1943, Edinburgh, Scotland.
