**Gilbert Walker** was an English mathematician who was Senior wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge in 1889, and elected a fellow of Trinity College. His interest moved to meteorology and he worked in India from 1903 to 1924 becoming Director-General of the Indian Observatories. Returning to England, he was appointed Professor of Meteorology at Imperial College of Science and Technology. His interests included boomerangs, and the flight of birds.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Produced several pioneering books on the theory of hydrodynamics
2. Established the framework for probability analysis
3. Developed a method of statistical inference known as “least squares”
4. First Indian mathematician to be recognized with a knighthood
5. Made major contributions to the theory of ergodic Markov chains
6. Established the foundation for modern cyclone forecasting
7. Co-developed the first algorithm for determining the orbit of a planetary body

Born 14 June 1868, Rochdale, Lancashire, England. Died 4 November 1958, Coulsdon, Surrey, England.
