**John Purser** was an Irish mathematician who taught at Queen's College Belfast.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Tertius Purser was born on 25 May 1809, in Ransford Street, Dublin, Ireland.
* He had a brother Edward Purser who was General Manager and Chief Engineer of the Ottoman Railway.
* Another brother Benjamin Purser, born in 1815, was a miller and grain merchant in Dungarvan, Co. Waterford.
* Tertius Purser had a sister, also named Sarah Purser, who married Richard W Biggs in Dublin on 18 June 1839.
* Some of people we have just mentioned played a part in the life of John Purser, the subject of this biography and we will meet them again later in this article.
* Tertius Purser married Anna Benigna Fridlezius in 1834.
* This church, which originated in Moravia in the fifteenth century, had an Irish branch founded by John Cennick in Dublin in 1746.
* Tertius Purser made good money working for the Guinness brewery and in June 1834, around the time of his marriage, he purchased Rathmines Castle on Upper Rathmines Road in Dublin.
* Tertius and Anna Purser had three children: John Purser, the subject of this biography born in 1835; Anna Benigna Fridlezius Purser, known as Nina, born in 1837; and Frederick Purser, born 1839, who became a Fellow of Trinity College Dublin and Professor of Natural Philosophy in Dublin.
* In 1871 Anna Benigna Fridlezius Purser married Sir John Purser Griffith (1848-1938), the son of a long-standing friend of her father Tertius Purser.
* John Purser Griffith studied engineering at Trinity College Dublin and had an outstanding career in civil engineering which led to his knighthood.
* John Purser, the subject of this biography, received his early education at the private boarding school run by his uncle, Dr Richard W Biggs, at Devizes, Wiltshire.
* We note that his brother Frederick Purser and John Purser Griffith, his future brother-in-law, were both educated at the same school.
* Purser completed his schooling at Devizes and began his university studies when he entered Trinity College, Dublin.
* On leaving college Purser's first appointment was that of tutor to the sons of Lord Rosse at Parsonstown.
* Purser became a tutor to the four sons of William Parsons, 3rd   Earl of Rosse (1800-1867) in 1857.
* Lord Rosse had married Mary Field, daughter of John Wilmer Field, on 14 April 1836 and only four of their thirteen children reached adulthood: Lawrence (born 1840); Randal (born 1848); Richard Clere (born 1851) who went on to develop railways in South America; and Charles Algernon (born 1854) who is known for inventing the steam turbine.
* As well as acting as tutor to the children, Purser did become involved in Lord Rosse's interest in astronomy but he did not do any observing.
* In 1858 Tertius Purser's father died and Tertius was offered a partnership in the Guinness brewery.
* At this time the Guinness family became sole owners of the firm but Tertius Purser continued as General Manager until the business was floated as a Limited Company in 1886.
* If ever there was an artist in mathematics John Purser was one.
* A student of Purser's, many years later wrote an article in The Northman in 1945.
* In addition to these three, Purser also taught John Henry MacFarland who became Chancellor of Melbourne University.
* It was suggested to Purser that he should write a paper for the occasion.
* This was, to quote from the title of Purser's short paper, "The Source from which the Kinetic Energy is Drawn that Passes into Heat in the Movement of the Tides." He showed conclusively that the earth's rotation is the source in question, and so made a beginning in a subject afterwards worked out by Sir George Darwin.
* When the British Association next came here in 1902 Purser was elected President of Section A.
* Purser never married.
* In his will he left £100,000 to his brother Frederick Purser, £40,000 to his sister Anna Griffith and £5,000 to each of her children.
* In addition to the money, Purser owned property in Blessington Street, Essex Street and Eustace Street which he left to his brother-in-law John Purser Griffith.
* After Purser's death, his sister Anna and her husband John Purser Griffith moved into Rathmines Castle although, at this time, its ownership had gone to Frederick Purser.
* Finally let us note that the painting of Purser which is attached to this biography was painted by the artist Sarah Purser, the daughter of Tertius Purser's brother Benjamin Purser.

Born 24 August 1835, Dublin, Ireland. Died 18 October 1903, Dublin, Ireland.
