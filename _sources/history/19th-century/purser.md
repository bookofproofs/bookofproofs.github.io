### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the book “Mathematics for the Million”, which was translated into seven languages and has sold over one million copies.
2. Computing pioneer who developed the Purser Programming Language.
3. Co-founded the British Computer Society with Alan Turing and Emeritus Professor Geoffrey Jefferson.
4. Developed a technique for proving theorems using the properties of the closed-form solution.
5. Established a mathematical foundation for the analysis of stochastic processes.
6. Coined the term ‘algorithm’ and was instrumental in the development of the concept of the Turing machine for use in digital computers.
7. Achieved numerous industry awards, including the Discovery Award of the International Federation of Information Processing.
