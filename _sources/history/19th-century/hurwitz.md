**Hurwitz** studied the genus of the Riemann surface and worked on how class number relations could be derived from modular equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Hurwitz formula, also known as the automorphism theorem, which describes the conditions under which equations have solutions. 
2. Proved the ‘Noether-Hurwitz Theorem’, which establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite group to be the automorphism group of a field.
3. Proved the theorem of finite generality, which states that a rational function with a finite number of singular points, each of which is a root of unity, is always an algebraic function of finite degree. 
4. Developed modern theories of linear algebra, topology, and algebraic functions. 
5. Explored the concept of algebraic number theory. 
6. His work on elliptic functions provided the mathematical foundations for the work of many prominent mathematicians, such as Felix Klein and Henri Poincaré. 
7. Published important contributions to the theory of algebraic equations involving multiple variables.
8. Developed the basic structure of field theory, whose concepts are notably applied to computational, human-computer and abstract algebra fields. 
9. Developed the Hurwitz theorem, which provides a theory for the decomposition of an algebraic function into its partial components. 
10. Developed the proof of his famous existence theorem, which characterizes the solution set of an algebraic equation.

Born 26 March 1859, Hildesheim, Lower Saxony, Germany. Died 18 November 1919, Zürich, Switzerland.
