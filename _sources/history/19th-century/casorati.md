**Felice Casorati** is best remembered for the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem characterising the behaviour of a function near an essential singularity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Casorati–Davenport theorem, which provides a criterion for a system to be invertible.
2. Identified the necessary conditions for a multivariate polynomial to possess a certain group of symmetries.
3. Developed the theory of quasi-conformal regularity and the first examples of quasi-conformal automorphs.
4. Developed a new approach to the theory of holomorphic functions of several variables, such as the notion of maximal monomials and the convergence of multiple series.
5. Developed a new technique for the calculation of partial derivatives of holomorphic functions, now known as Casorati derivatives.
6. Made contributions to the mathematical foundations of general relativity and quantum mechanics.
7. Developed a theorem on which basis the topological structure of surfaces and the logic of the mapping of elementary functions can be studied.
8. Developed a series of papers on the theory of complex differential equations and their applications to the study of algebraic varieties.

Born 17 December 1835, Pavia (now Italy). Died 11 September 1890, Casteggio, Italy.
