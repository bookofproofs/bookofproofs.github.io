**William Chauvenet** was an American professor of mathematics, astronomy, navigation and surveying who was instrumental in the establishment of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method of differentiation that enabled him to apply calculus to irregularly shaped curves.
2. Discovered a flaw in the famous Poncelet’s theorem and proposed a counterexample to it.
3. Wrote a foundational paper introducing the concept of mathematical analysis that reorganized previous works by Leibniz, Euler, and Lagrange.
4. Developed a mathematical method of deducing the laws of optics from the wave theory of light.
5. Used the concept of a limit to rigorously prove the motion of a point in rectilinear motion.
6. Pioneered the use of vectors in analytical geometry.
7. Authored the book “A Manual of Spherical and Practical Astronomy”.
8. Established the American Journal of Mathematics and served as its first editor.

Born 24 May1820, Milford, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 13 December 1870, St Paul, Minnesota, USA.
