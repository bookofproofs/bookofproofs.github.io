**André-Louis Cholesky** was a French military officer and mathematician who devised a clever method of dealing with geodesic measurements.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Cholesky decomposition, a powerful tool for the numerical solution of linear equations.
2. His work on the Cholesky decomposition helped shape the field of linear algebra.
3. Developed numerical methods for solving boundary value problems.
4. Authored two textbooks on linear equations and linear algebra.
5. Developed the Cholesky-Banachiewicz algorithm for solving tridiagonal systems of linear equations.
6. Demonstrated the existence of sets of mutually orthogonal Latin squares.
7. His research in number theory contributed to a better understanding of prime numbers and Diophantine equations.

Born 15 October 1875, Montguyon, Charentes Maritime, France. Died 31 August 1918, North France.
