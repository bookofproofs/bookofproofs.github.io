**Francis Upton** was an American physicist and mathematician who worked with Thomas Edison in the development of incandescent light bulbs, electric generators, and electric power distribution.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Helped develop calculations for steam engine efficiency, which helped improve the efficiency of the engine and enabled further mechanical innovation. 
2. Instrumental in the invention of the differential analyzer, a mechanical analog computer. 
3. With the help of Vannevar Bush, he developed a method called the Upton Method to solve numerical integration by the automatic integration of differential equations.
4. Developed of a method called the “Upton Simplex Method” that would solve difficult symmetric simultaneous linear equations. 
5. Developed of the mathematical principles of self-excitation in electric circuits. 
6. Co-authored the seminal text “Mathematical Instruments and Printing” alongside E Sears and H S Ingalls.

Born 26 July 1852, Peabody, Massachusetts, USA. Died 10 March 1921, Orange, New Jersey, USA.
