**Georg Hamel** was a German mathematician who worked in mechanics, the foundations of mathematics and function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Created the mathematical formula for calculating the power of an internal combustion engine, which has been widely used since its original publication in 1896.
2. His work on the theory of thermodynamics expanded the understanding of the mathematics behind the process of thermal energy conversion and introduced the notion of entropy as a way to quantify states of thermal equilibrium.
3. Developed an abstract algebraical approach to improve the foundation of calculus.
4. Co-founded the mathematical journal Zentralblatt für Mathematik, which became the leading publication in mathematics.
5. Co-developed a top-down approach to teaching calculus and was the first to propose a comprehensive system of calculus instruction.
6. Authored numerous mathematics textbooks, including Transfinite Zahlen, which introduced the concept of transfinite numbers and was one of the first books to discuss transfinite set theory.
7. Contributed to the development of fluid dynamics, having published a series of papers on the principles of hydrodynamics.
8. Pioneered the use of probability theory and statistical methods in mathematical analysis.

Born 12 September 1877, Düren, Rhineland, Germany. Died 4 October 1954, Landshut, Germany.
