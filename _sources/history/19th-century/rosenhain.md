**Johann  Rosenhain** was a German mathematician who introduced theta characteristics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for solving linear equations which are now known as Cramer's Rule.
2. Demonstrated the principle of virtual work for elastic bodies, as well as for rigid bodies.
3. Proved the uniqueness of a system of linear equations with only one solution.
4. Discovered the principle of the constant coefficient for equations of several variables.
5. Developed a mathematical theory of the distribution of mechanical energy in systems of vibrations.
6. Discovered the dependence between the roots of a linear equation and its coefficients.
7. Discovered the form of the solutions of integral equations in terms of Legendre polynomials.
8. Found important applications of integrating factor in solving differential equations. 
9. Established the method of least squares for approximating solutions of polynomial equations.
10. Brought the study of skew surfaces to a new level by determining their shapes in terms of differential equations.

Born 10 June 1816, KÃ¶nigsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 14 May 1887, Berlin, Germany.
