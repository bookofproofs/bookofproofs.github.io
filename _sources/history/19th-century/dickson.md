**Dickson** is known for his contributions to number theory and group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made key contributions to the mathematical study of groups and fields, and was credited with showing that solvable groups of prime power order are able to divide into several simpler groups. 
2. Developed the first set of eight simply described groups of finite linear transformations, now known as the Dickson groups.
3. Developed a proof of the Jordan–Hölder theorem, which established that the composition series of a solvable group were unique. 
4. Developed the theory of Fitting invariants in 1902, which is the starting point for the classification of finite solvable groups. 
5. Co-edited the first volume of Robert Burns' Geometrical Works.
6. Established the Dickson polynomials, which are used in finite field theory and for investigating properties of the Galois group of a polynomial. 
7. Developed the Wedderburn–Artin theorem, which states that for any finite division algebra, the center of such an algebra is a field.

Born 22 January 1874, Independence, Iowa, USA. Died 17 January 1954, Harlingen, Texas, USA.
