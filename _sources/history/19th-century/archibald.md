**Raymond C Archibald** studied in Canada, at Harvard and at Strasbourg. He spent most of his career at Brown University in Rhode Island. His main interests were in the History of Mathematics. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the concept of duality in quadratic forms and developed its applications in algebraic geometry.
2. Pioneered work on certain singularities in algebraic geometry.
3. Developed a formula for the volume of a hypersphere in n-dimensional Euclidean space.
4. Overhauled the study of real representation theory of finite reflection groups.
5. Found a construction for distinguishing ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’ cubic forms, later known as Archibald’s theorem.
6. Published two books: ‘Topics in the Geometry of n-Dimensions’ (1931) and ‘Introduction to Diophantine Approximation’ (1942).

Born 7 October 1875, Stewiacke, Colchester County, Nova Scotia, Canada. Died 26 July 1955, Sackville, New Brunswick, Canada.
