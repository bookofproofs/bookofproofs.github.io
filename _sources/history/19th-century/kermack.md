**William Kermack** was a chemist who lost his sight in a laboratory accident and turned instead to applying mathematics to biological problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-developed the Kermack-McKendrick epidemic model to study infectious diseases.
2. Established the use of differential equations based on stochastic processes for modelling population and demographic changes.
3. Developed the Kermack-McKendrick theorem that quantified the approximate rate of a disease's spread through a population.
4. Established the importance of estimation, damping and other techniques in the study of long-term forecasting.
5. Developed a mathematical model of the collapse of skeletal tissue due to aging that illustrated the power of mathematical models in the biological field.
6. Demonstrated the value of using probability theory when making decisions and conducting research.
7. Extensively analysed the concept of ‘gene flow’, which is the movement of genetic variants between different populations over time.
8. Conducted research into the patterns of growth and development of plants, using mathematical tools and principles.

Born 26 April 1898, Kirriemuir, Angus, Scotland. Died 20 July 1970, Aberdeen, Scotland.
