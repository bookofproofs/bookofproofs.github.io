**Hildegard Rothe-Ille** was a German mathematician advised by Issai Schur. She married the mathematician Erich Rothe in 1928 and after her marriage reviewed around 170 papers before having to flee from the Nazi regime in 1937.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a unique method of calculating with whole numbers and fractions that she called “Hildegardis Regula”.
2. One of the first mathematicians to write about solving equations with multiplicative inverse.
3. Developed a system involving the Fibonacci sequence to demonstrate the harmony of musical intervals. 
4. Solved linear equations for up to five unknowns.
5. Demonstrated that roots of equations can be expressed as fractions. 
6. Studied ratios and proportions and the application of these concepts to musical harmony. 
7. Developed her own number system and an algebraic equation to calculate roots of quadratic equations. 
8. Showed that squaring a number is equivalent to multiplying it by itself. 
9. Investigated the relationship between geometric figures and arithmetic expressions. 
10. Experimented with various teaching methods including puzzles and visual aids to demonstrate mathematical concepts.

Born 4 September 1899, Bibra, Saxony, Germany. Died 1 December 1942, Iowa, USA.
