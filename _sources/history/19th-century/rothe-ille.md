**Hildegard Rothe-Ille** was a German mathematician advised by Issai Schur. She married the mathematician Erich Rothe in 1928 and after her marriage reviewed around 170 papers before having to flee from the Nazi regime in 1937.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Otto Ille had been born in Berlin on 3 May 1870 and had become a medical doctor.
* In 1920, when Ille was a student at the Friedrich-Wilhelms University of Berlin, she was living at Akazienstrasse 15, Schöneberg, Berlin.
* Issai Schur, on the other hand, continued to produce Ramseyan mathematics, and moreover directed and inspired his PhD students Richard Rado, Hildegard Ille and Alfred Brauer to do the same.
* Unlike some others who were awarded similar scholarships, for Ille the scholarship was her only means of support.
* After holding the scholarship for a year, Ille began her teacher training as a student teacher at her former school, the Chamisso school in Berlin-Schöneberg.
* Erich Rothe had studied at the University of Berlin at the same time as Ille.
* He took the State Examination to qualify as a secondary school teacher in March 1923, at the same examination diet as Ille.
* Ille had submitted the paper Einige Bemerkungen zu einem von G Pólya herrührenden Irreduzibilitätskriterium Ⓣ(Some remarks on an originating from G Polya's irreducibility criterion) on 15 May 1924  and it was published in 1926.
* She did not give up mathematics but reviewed 40 papers which had been published between 1926 and 1928, under the name Hildegard Rothe, and reviewed 129 papers which had been published between 1930 and 1937, under the name Hildegard Rothe-Ille.
* The papers that ille-Rothe reviewed were written in German, English, French, Italian, Russian and Japanese.
* Details were taken went they arrived in New York: Erich H Rothe (age 44), Hildegard B Rothe (age 38) and Erhard O W Rothe (age 7).
* Hildegard B Rothe is described as being 5 foot 6 inches tall, having a fair complexion, with dark hair and grey eyes.
* Rothe-Ille is a part-time teacher of German at William Penn College, Oskaloosa.
* Rothe-Ille died from cancer in Mercy Hospital Oskaloosa on 28 October 1942.
* Erdős writes: "The problem itself seems to be much older (it seems likely that Schur gave it to Hildegard Ille, in the 1920s)." Erdős returns to Issai Schur's contribution in his 1961 second open-problem paper...
* Schur gave it to Hildegard Ille around 1930." Paul told me that he "met Issai Schur once in mid 1930s," more precisely in 1936 in Berlin ...
* Erdős learned about Schur's interest in arithmetic progressions and early Ramsey-like conjectures and results from Hildegard Ille (1899-1942).
* From Rothe, Erdős learned that Issai Schur yet again contributed to number theory and Ramsey theory when he asked his graduate student Hildegard to investigate arithmetic progression-free arrays of positive integers.

Born 4 September 1899, Bibra, Saxony, Germany. Died 1 December 1942, Iowa, USA.
