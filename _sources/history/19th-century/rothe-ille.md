**Hildegard Rothe-Ille** was a German mathematician advised by Issai Schur. She married the mathematician Erich Rothe in 1928 and after her marriage reviewed around 170 papers before having to flee from the Nazi regime in 1937.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Otto Ille had been born in Berlin on 3 May 1870 and had become a medical doctor.
* Their only child Hildegard Ille, the subject of this biography, was born in Bibra on 4 September 1899.
* Her father, Otto, died in Halle on 30 April 1900 so Hildegard never knew her father.
* In 1920, when Ille was a student at the Friedrich-Wilhelms University of Berlin, she was living at Akazienstrasse 15, Schöneberg, Berlin.
* Issai Schur, on the other hand, continued to produce Ramseyan mathematics, and moreover directed and inspired his PhD students Richard Rado, Hildegard Ille and Alfred Brauer to do the same.
* Unlike some others who were awarded similar scholarships, for Ille the scholarship was her only means of support.
* After holding the scholarship for a year, Ille began her teacher training as a student teacher at her former school, the Chamisso school in Berlin-Schöneberg.
* Erich Rothe had studied at the University of Berlin at the same time as Ille.
* He took the State Examination to qualify as a secondary school teacher in March 1923, at the same examination diet as Ille.
* After Erich and Hildegard Rothe married on 20 March 1928, they had a son, Erhard William Rothe, who was born in Breslau on 15 April 1931.
* Ille had submitted the paper Einige Bemerkungen zu einem von G Pólya herrührenden Irreduzibilitätskriterium Ⓣ(Some remarks on an originating from G Polya's irreducibility criterion) on 15 May 1924  and it was published in 1926.
* She did not give up mathematics but reviewed 40 papers which had been published between 1926 and 1928, under the name Hildegard Rothe, and reviewed 129 papers which had been published between 1930 and 1937, under the name Hildegard Rothe-Ille.
* The papers that ille-Rothe reviewed were written in German, English, French, Italian, Russian and Japanese.
* Rothe-Ille and her son Erhard remained in Zurich for a year, then in the summer vacation of 1938, Erich Rothe returned to Europe to meet up with his family and returned with them to the United States.
* Details were taken went they arrived in New York: Erich H Rothe (age 44), Hildegard B Rothe (age 38) and Erhard O W Rothe (age 7).
* Hildegard B Rothe is described as being 5 foot 6 inches tall, having a fair complexion, with dark hair and grey eyes.
* Rothe-Ille is a part-time teacher of German at William Penn College, Oskaloosa.
* Rothe-Ille died from cancer in Mercy Hospital Oskaloosa on 28 October 1942.
* Erdős learned about Schur's interest in arithmetic progressions and early Ramsey-like conjectures and results from Hildegard Ille (1899-1942).
* Erich Rothe was Paul Erdős's source of reliable information on problems and conjectures in number theory that Issai Schur shared with Rothe's wife Hildegard (Ille) Rothe.
* From Rothe, Erdős learned that Issai Schur yet again contributed to number theory and Ramsey theory when he asked his graduate student Hildegard to investigate arithmetic progression-free arrays of positive integers.

Born 4 September 1899, Bibra, Saxony, Germany. Died 1 December 1942, Iowa, USA.
