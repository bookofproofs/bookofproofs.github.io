**Carl Størmer** was a Norwegian mathematician and astrophysicist. In mathematics, he is known for his work in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Mouton-Størmer Theory of the origin of magnetism. 
2. Proved a number of theorems in the field of complex analysis, including the ‘Størmer's theorem’ on linearization of absolutely convergent Fourier series. 
3. Applied the method of vector calculus to the space problems of geomagnetism and aurora variation. 
4. Established mathematical foundations for the calculation of space curves in terms of analytic functions. 
5. Formulated equations which led to the solution of the three-body problem in dynamical astronomy. 
6. Led to the establishment of numerous institutions, such as the Norwegian Sea Ice Service. 
7. Published extensive treatment of ‘Irregularities in the Motion of the Moon’. 
8. Determined the shape of the earth to be a slightly flattened sphere. 
9. Founded an Institute for Mathematical and Physical Geomagnetism. 
10. Published numerous papers in the field of geometry, hydrodynamics and the currents of the North Atlantic Ocean.

Born 3 September 1874, Skien, Norway. Died 13 August 1957, Oslo, Norway.
