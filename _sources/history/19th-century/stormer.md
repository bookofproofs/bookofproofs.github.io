**Carl Størmer** was a Norwegian mathematician and astrophysicist. In mathematics, he is known for his work in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Størmer entered the University of Christiana (as Oslo was then called) in 1892.
* It is unusual for anyone to publish a paper in the year they enter university as an undergraduate, but this is exactly what Størmer did with a paper on the summation of trigonometric series.
* Yet another work which came out in 1902 was a posthumous paper of Sophus Lie, edited by Størmer and Guldberg.
* It was a post that Størmer held until 1946 yet, although he did continue to publish the occasional pure mathematics paper during this period, his interests were diverted by a different topic.
* Birkeland, one of Størmer's colleagues, had put forward a theory in 1896 that auroras were caused by electrons emitted by the sun which interacted with the earth's magnetic field.
* A summary of all of this work appeared in Størmer's book The polar aurora  published in 1955.
* Certainly Størmer was not the first to photograph an aurora.
* Størmer was honoured in many ways: he was elected to several Scandinavian academies, the Royal Society of London and the Paris Academy of Sciences.

Born 3 September 1874, Skien, Norway. Died 13 August 1957, Oslo, Norway.
