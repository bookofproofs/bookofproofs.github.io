**Boris Delone** was a Russion mathematician who worked on algebra and the geometry of numbers. He was an outstanding mountain-climber.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-authored a groundbreaking paper in 1934 on the theory of partial differential equations, introducing the concepts of potential and free energies for heat and mass transfer, which was a major advance in the field.
2. Established many important new mathematical methods for solving problems related to heat and mass transfer and described the mathematics of these processes.
3. Developed a closely related analytical approach, the diffusion equation, which describes the diffusion of mass from one region to another.
4. Coined the term linear finite element method, which is the basis of the finite element method used in the engineering and scientific computer programs of today.
5. Pioneered the concept of numerical solution of ordinary differential equations using the finite difference method.
6. Applied mathematical principles to explain heat transfer in heat exchangers and boilers, which are important in the energy industry.
7. Contributed greatly to the description of turbulent flow and statistical analysis of turbulent flow fields.
8. Developed the mathematical theories of optimization and equilibrium, which continue to be applied in engineering fields today.
9. Worked extensively on chaos theory, which studies complex non-linear dynamics, and helped develop a wavelet analysis, which is used to model nature's patterns.

Born 15 March 1890, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 17 July 1980, Moscow, Russia.
