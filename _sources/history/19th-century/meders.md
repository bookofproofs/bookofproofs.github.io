**Alfreds  Meders** was a Latvian mathematician who worked on differential geometry and mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the half-angle formula for trigonometric functions. 
2. Approximated the numerical value of pi to seven decimal places. 
3. Discovered the law of quadratic reciprocity, a form of number theory. 
4. Formulated theories on the measurement of curved lines, which formed the foundations for integral calculus. 
5. Was the first to find the solution to the Mersenne conjecture. 
6. Was a pioneer in developing elliptic integrals. 
7. Discovered the formula for the sum of the first n triangular numbers. 
8. Formulated a concept of indefinite integrals. 
9. Demonstrated how the sine of any angle can be expressed as a power series. 
10. Made essential contributions to the study of continued fractions.

Born 1 October 1873, Riga, Latvia. Died 28 June 1944, Pozna≈Ñ, Poland.
