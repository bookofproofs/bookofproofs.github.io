**Aleksandr Lyapunov** was a Russian mathematician best known for his development of the stability theory of a dynamical system. He also made contributions to mathematical physics and probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Mikhail Vasilievich was an astronomer who worked at Kazan University until two years before Aleksandr Mikhailovich was born, when the family moved to Yaroslavl on his appointment as director of the Demidovski Lyceum there.
* Sofia Aleksandrovna and Mikhail Vasilievich had talented children for, in addition to the subject of this biography, they had two boys one of whom (Sergei) became a composer and the other (Boris) became a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences through his expertise in Slavic languages.
* Aleksandr Mikhailovich began his education at home, then later one of his uncles R M Sechenov prepared him for entering the Gymnasium.
* Lyapunov was not the only one being coached by Sechenov who was teaching his own daughter Natalia Rafailovna Sechenov at the same time.
* In fact Natalia and Aleksandr married many years later when he was 29 years old.
* Some years after the death of Lyapunov's father, Sofia Aleksandrovna moved to Nizhny Novgorod (named Gorky from 1932 to 1990) in 1870 with her children and Lyapunov entered the Gymnasium in that city.
* Lyapunov graduated in 1880 and remained at St Petersburg to undertake research.
* Although Lyapunov's Master's thesis did not answer this question, the work of the thesis was motivated by it.
* The problem posed by Chebyshev concerning the existence of figures of equilibrium, in addition to ellipsoidal ones, of a rotating fluid under sufficiently small variations of angular velocity of revolution was first solved by Lyapunov in a first approximation.
* Lyapunov established that with variation in the angular velocity of revolution Maclaurin ellipsoids pass into Jacobi ellipsoids.
* In 1901 Lyapunov was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences in St Petersburg and in the following year became an academician in applied mathematics of the Academy.
* In 1917 Lyapunov left St Petersburg to take up a post at the university in Odessa, on the Black Sea coast.
* Natalia Rafailovna suffered from a form of tuberculosis and Lyapunov was greatly disturbed to watch her health fail.
* On 31 October 1918 Lyapunov's wife died and later that day Lyapunov shot himself.
* We have described Lyapunov's main work which was on the theory of rotating liquids.
* For example on 6 June 1957 Sobolev gave the lecture On the works of A M Lyapunov on potential theory in Moscow to a joint session of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences, the divisions of technical and physical sciences of the Academy of Sciences, the Moscow University, the Moscow Mathematical Society, the Institute of Mechanics of the Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of Automatics and Telemechanics of the Academy of Sciences.

Born 6 June 1857, Yaroslavl, Russia. Died 3 November 1918, Odessa, Russia.
