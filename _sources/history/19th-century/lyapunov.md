**Aleksandr Lyapunov** was a Russian mathematician best known for his development of the stability theory of a dynamical system. He also made contributions to mathematical physics and probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the famous Lyapunov stability theory for a dynamical system.
2. Introduced the concept of and developed the field of Lyapunov functions.
3. Discovered the basic exponential stability theorem.
4. Derived a method for solving second-order differential equations.
5. Created the field of Lyapunov stability theory.
6. Constructed the first Lyapunov functions with applications in mechanics.
7. Established the relationship between linear and nonlinear stability.
8. Developed a theorem to determine the stability of dynamical systems.
9. Developed a new method of solving equations of motion with small variables.
10. Established a criterion for the existence of limit cycles in nonlinear systems.

Born 6 June 1857, Yaroslavl, Russia. Died 3 November 1918, Odessa, Russia.
