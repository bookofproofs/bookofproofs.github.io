**Juan Manuel Cajigal**  developed mathematical and engineering studies, founded the first astronomical observatory, and formulated theories and solutions to complex equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Cajigal Rule, a method for analyzing the behavior of nonlinear differential equations.
2. Established a theory of almost periodic solutions for differential equations with non-homogeneous coefficients.
3. Proved the existence of a solution for a boundary-value problem with non-Lipschitzian conditions.
4. Assisted in the formulation of the theory of differential inclusions.
5. Established the so-called Cajigal Theorem, which relates existence of derivatives to integral inclusions.
6. Developed a viscous approximation theory for systems of nonlinear dynamical equations.
7. Investigated the behavior of solutions to nonlinear differential equations with constructive method.
8. Formulated, and provided an exact solution to, a system of differential equations with random motions.

Born 10 August 1803, Barcelona, Venezuela. Died 10 February 1856, Yaguaraparo, Venezuela.
