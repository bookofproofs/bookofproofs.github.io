**Raphaël Salem** was a Greek mathematician who is best known for his methods of applying probability to Fourier series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father, Emmanuel Salem, was a well known lawyer who dealt with international problems while his mother was Fortunée Salem.
* Raphaël was brought up in a truly international atmosphere for he lived in the Ottoman Empire, in a Jewish family who followed the Spanish traditions of their ancestors but spoke Italian and French at home.
* When Salem was 15 years old, his family moved to France and set up home in Paris.
* Salem attended the Lycée Condorcet for two years and then entered the Law Faculty of the University of Paris.
* It is not entirely clear how much the choice of law was that of Salem or that of his father.
* Certainly Salem's father wished his son to follow in his footsteps, and another factor here is that Salem always had a great respect for his father.
* Of course there were few better places in the world to study mathematics than Paris, and Salem was soon taking mathematics courses with Hadamard.
* Now, having made the change away from law to science and engineering one might have expected Salem to seek a profession using these qualifications, but in fact he went into banking.
* It was around this time, with a deteriorating political situation, that Salem finally made the decision to change career and become a mathematician.
* Denjoy was certainly a factor in this decision, for he well realised Salem's potential as a mathematician and tried to persuade him to take a doctorate in mathematics.
* Salem collaborated with this brilliant young Polish mathematician and of the mathematics papers he wrote while working for the bank, the one he wrote with Marcinkiewicz was his only joint work.
* Salem was called up for military work and attached to the Deuxième Bureau of the General Staff of the French Army.
* As part of his military duties, Salem was sent to England to assist the Head of the Franco-British Coordination Committee but he was demobilised in June 1940.
* Salem left England in the autumn of 1940 and emigrated to the United States where he settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
* It was very fortunate for Salem that he had obtained his doctorate in mathematics in the previous year from the University of Paris.
* We should also note that Salem introduced the idea of a random measure into harmonic analysis.
* Returning to details of Salem's life we should emphasise how difficult the war years were for him.
* Salem's older son however, survived the war.
* Salem was rapidly promoted at MIT where he became an assistant professor in 1945, and an associate professor in 1946.
* However, happy as he was in the United States, once the war had ended and his country was again free, Salem longed to return to France.

Born 7 November 1898, Saloniki, Ottoman Empire (now Thessaloniki, Greece). Died 20 June 1963, Paris, France.
