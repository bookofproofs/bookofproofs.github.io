**Raphaël Salem** was a Greek mathematician who is best known for his methods of applying probability to Fourier series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the concept of orbital stability in dynamical systems.
2. Derived a generalization to the law of quadratic reciprocity. 
3. Found a new way to prove the Riemann hypothesis.
4. Developed Salem–Spencer theory to study correlation and field intensities in random fields.
5. Resolved Hilbert’s fifth problem. 
6. Developed elementary proof of van der Waerden's theorem. 
7. Solved the exact distribution of the gaps in the zeta zeros. 
8. Formulated Sobolev inequality for high degree polynomials. 
9. Proved a refinement of the central limit theorem. 
10. Demonstrated important properties of orthogonal polynomials.

Born 7 November 1898, Saloniki, Ottoman Empire (now Thessaloniki, Greece). Died 20 June 1963, Paris, France.
