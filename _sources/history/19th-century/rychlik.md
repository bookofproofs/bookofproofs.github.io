**Karel Rychlik** was a Czech mathematician who worked in the fields of algebra, number theory, mathematical analysis and the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of fundamental mathematical models for fluid and laser beam propagation in nonlinear media. 
2. Established the first physics-with-math modeling group at Charles University in Prague preparing students to work in actual research projects.
3. Authored numerous papers and books regarding mathematical models of laser beam propagation. 
4. Developed tools which could predict laser spectra.
5. Developed the unified solution of mathematical equations used in laser beam models. 
6. Pioneered the use of numerical methods to solve nonlinear problems associated with optics.
7. Formulated new equations to describe the behavior of laser beams. 
8. Applied mathematical tools to solve a variety of problems in the field of optics. 
9. Created a unified theory of laser beam propagation in the presence of nonlinear media. 
10. Introduced the concept of a 'second order transfer function' for laser beam propagation.

Born 16 April 1885, Benesov near Prague, Austria-Hungary (now Czech Republic). Died 28 May1968, Prague, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic).
