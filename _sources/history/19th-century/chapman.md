**Sydney Chapman** was a British mathematician and geophysicist who worked  on gas dynamics, geomagnetism and the ionosphere.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Chapman-Kolmogorov Equation which is an important equation for non-linear processes.
2. Discovered the random walk theory in the 1930s.
3. Developed a theory for magnetic storms that accounts for travels in the Earth's magnetosphere.
4. Developed an analytical theory for aurora borealis which explains the mechanics of particle motions in the Earth's atmosphere.
5. Discovered the Dichotomy Paradox relating to the fluid mechanics in the atmosphere.
6. Authored the book "Mathematics of non-linear processes", which laid the foundations for studies of non-linear dynamics.
7. Developed the foundations for studying solar-terrestrial interactions using mathematical models.
8. Authored Solar-Terrestrial Physics, a foundational text in the field.

Born 29 January 1888, Eccles (near Manchester), England. Died 16 June 1970, Boulder, Colorado, USA.
