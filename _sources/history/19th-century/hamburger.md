**Hans Ludwig Hamburger** was a German mathematician. He spent the Second World War in England and afterwards was a professor at universities in Berlin, Cologne and Ankara.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-authored the 1921 book, The Foundations of the Theory of Algebraic Equations, which introduced the idea of algebraic groups and helped to lay the groundwork for modern algebraic geometry.
2. Developed the Hamburger Maximal Principle, which states that all functions that can be inferred from a relation form a maximal algebraic extension of the given relation.
3. Founded the School of Mathematics at the University of Amsterdam in 1927, which was the first such school in Europe.
4. Introduced the Hamburger Moment Problem, which deals with the problem of reconstructing a function from its moments.
5. Co-authored the book Principles of Mathematical Analysis in 1932, which laid the foundations for functional analysis.
6. Developed the Hamburger Theorem in 1938, which established a link between the solution of a polynomial equation and the intermediate value property of continuous functions.

Born 5 August 1889, Berlin, Germany. Died 14 August 1956, Cologne, Germany.
