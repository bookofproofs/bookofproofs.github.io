**John Carruthers Beattie** graduated from Edinburgh University and studied at Munich, Vienna, Berlin and Glasgow. He became Professor of Applied Mathematics and Experimental Physics at the University of Cape Town and was later Vice Chancellor and Principal of the University. He was knighted in 1920.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His mother was Elspeth Beattie (born in St Mungo, Dumfriesshire about 1834).
* Carruthers Beattie attended St John's Boarding School in Workington for seven years, then spent a year at Moray House in Edinburgh before beginning his university education.
* In 1897 Beattie went to South Africa on being appointed Professor of Applied Mathematics and Experimental Physics at the University of Cape Town.
* On 2 July 1927 Beattie was awarded an honorary LL.D. by the University of Edinburgh.
* Sir Carruthers's great services to the Dominion have been recognised by the Knighthood conferred upon him, and his alma mater is proud to laureate a son whose name is written so large in the academic history of South Africa; her only regret is that distance and pressure of affairs prevent his presence at today's ceremony.
* Beattie was a member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, joining in November 1891.
* John Carruthers Beattie was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 1 March 1897, his proposers being Sir W Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Peter Guthrie Tait, Alexander Crum Brown, Cargill Gilston Knott.

Born 21 November 1866, Waterbeck, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. Died 10 September 1946, Capetown, South Africa.
