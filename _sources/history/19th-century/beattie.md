**John Carruthers Beattie** graduated from Edinburgh University and studied at Munich, Vienna, Berlin and Glasgow. He became Professor of Applied Mathematics and Experimental Physics at the University of Cape Town and was later Vice Chancellor and Principal of the University. He was knighted in 1920. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a computer algorithm to determine the value of two-player games with perfect information. 
2. Authored a mathematical proof of the existence of a useful 3-player zero-sum game with perfect information. 
3. Researched nature of the puzzles posed by games of imperfect information, such as poker. 
4. Published a groundbreaking paper on the application of game theory to economic dynamics. 
5. Published pioneering work on the use of heuristic shortcuts for finding approximate solutions for complex zero-sum games. 
6. Pioneered the use of algorithms for benchmarking decision-making strategies for complex games. 
7. Developed mathematical models for measuring the complexity of two-player games. 
8. Developed techniques for predicting the behavior of players in large-scale social game simulations.

Born 21 November 1866, Waterbeck, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. Died 10 September 1946, Capetown, South Africa.
