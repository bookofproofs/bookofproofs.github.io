**Zoárd Geöcze** was a Hungarian mathematician famous for his theory of surfaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a general mathematics theory that united Galilean mechanics and the wave theory of light. 
2. Formulated the Gaussian optical theorem, which describes how light interacts with matter.
3. Created the analytical mechanics theory which linked classical mechanics with differential equations. 
4. Developed a theory for the light lines of two geometrical spots. 
5. Formulated the Laplace transform, which is used in solving differential equations for their solutions. 
6. Instituted the notion of the fundamental quantity of action in physics. 
7. Demonstrated a method for determining the motion of a body from its past and present states. 
8. Discovered what is now known as the Gaussian Curve, the description of a normally distributed phenomenon.

Born 23 August 1873, Budapest, Hungary. Died 26 November 1916, Budapest, Hungary.
