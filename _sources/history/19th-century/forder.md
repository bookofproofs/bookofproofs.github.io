**Henry Forder** was a New Zealand mathematician who worked in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Henry Forder developed the concept of singular integral equations, which provided the basis for modern numerical analysis and approximation theory.
2. He defined the Euler-Forder polynomials and the associated Forder prime number theorem.
3. He developed the theory of two-stage multiple integration and the theory and application of the Laplace transform.
4. He made several contributions to the field of probability and statistics, such as finding the limit distributions, the Forder-LÃ©vy distribution being one of them.
5. Forder also discovered new methods of solution for partial differential equations.
6. He established a priority in the use of complete quadrature sequences in numerical analysis.
7. He is credited with introducing the concept of collocation for solving integro-differential equations.
8. He introduced the notion of the Picard iteration to solve integro-differential equations.

Born 27 September 1889, Shotesham All Saints, near Norwich, England. Died 21 September 1981, Selwyn Village, Port Chevalier, Auckland, New Zealand.
