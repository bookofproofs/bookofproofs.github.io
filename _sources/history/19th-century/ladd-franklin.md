**Christine Ladd-Franklin** was an American psychologist, logician and mathematician who was one of the earliest women to work in American universities.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Christine Ladd-Franklin developed an innovative calculus-based system to explain the behavior of color vision, allowing for a better understanding of the relationship between light and color. 
2. She formulated the concept of "structural color," which helps explain the appearance of certain deep-sea creatures. 
3. She was an early advocate for developing the field of graph theory. 
4. She was one of the first psychologists to use mathematical modeling to explain human behavior. 
5. She developed a novel approach to the mathematics of probability, anticipating the development of Bayesian statistics by several decades. 
6. She was the first woman to be admitted to the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Mathematical Society. 
7. She was the first female president of the American Psychological Association.

Born 1 December 1847, Windsor, Connecticut, USA. Died 5 March 1930, New York City, New York, USA.
