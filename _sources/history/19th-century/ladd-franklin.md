**Christine Ladd-Franklin** was an American psychologist, logician and mathematician who was one of the earliest women to work in American universities.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ladd-Franklin wrote up the results of her studies in a paper which was published in the first volume of the American Journal of Psychology in 1887.
* Muller went even further and often repeated for her lectures which he had given yet Ladd-Franklin was not permitted to attend.
* Ladd-Franklin developed her own theory of colour vision while working in Germany and in 1892 she visited England and presented it to an International Congress of Psychology in London.
* Back in the United States, Fabian Franklin resumed his teaching at Johns Hopkins and Ladd-Franklin asked to be allowed to lecture at the University.
* She was never admitted to these meetings, but times were slowly changing and, in 1926, Johns Hopkins University awarded Ladd-Franklin a Ph.D. for the dissertation she had completed in 1882.

Born 1 December 1847, Windsor, Connecticut, USA. Died 5 March 1930, New York City, New York, USA.
