**Edward Titchmarsh** was an English mathematician best known for his work in analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the Isoperimetric Inequality, which has been described as “the most remarkable inequality in mathematics”.
2. Authored the book The Theory of Functions, which has become a renowned textbook in the field of mathematics.
3. Demonstrated the Titchmarsh convolution theorem, a highly influential result in Fourier analysis.
4. Established mathematical foundations in singularity theory and its application to differential equations.
5. Discovered Titchmarsh’s theorem, as well as several other theorems in function theory.
6. Approximated integrals using his famous “alternating process” method.
7. Proposed the concept of Dirichlet eigenvalues for semi-infinite linear systems.

Born 1 June 1899, Newbury, Berkshire, England. Died 18 January 1963, Oxford, England.
