**Jan Łukasiewicz**, who was born in what is now Ukraine, was an important mathematical logician. He introduced the so-called _Polish notation_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However, by the time Łukasiewicz was born in Lemberg, Austria had named the region the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and given it a large degree of administrative autonomy.
* Jan's mother, Leopoldine Holtzer, was the daughter of an Austrian civil servant and both Leopoldine and Luke were Roman Catholics.
* Łukasiewicz was interested in mathematics at school and he entered the University of Lemberg where he studied mathematics and philosophy.
* Wishing to lecture in universities, Łukasiewicz continued to study for his habilitation, submitting his thesis to the University of Lemberg in 1906.
* Once he had been awarded his habilitation, Łukasiewicz began to lecture at a Privatdozent.
* Soon large changes in Poland would present new opportunities to Łukasiewicz.
* Łukasiewicz was invited to the new University of Warsaw when it reopened in 1915.
* Łukasiewicz was Polish Minister of Education in 1919 and a professor at Warsaw University from 1920 to 1939.
* During this period between the wars Łukasiewicz was twice rector of Warsaw University.
* During this time Łukasiewicz and Lesniewski founded the Warsaw School of Logic.
* viewing mathematical logic as an instrument of enquiry into the foundations of mathematics and the methodology of empirical science, Łukasiewicz succeeded in making it a required subject for mathematics and science students in Polish universities.
* Łukasiewicz had married Regina Barwinska and they suffered great hardships during World War II.
* The suffering of Łukasiewicz is graphically illustrated in this autobiography.
* Łukasiewicz and his wife fled from Poland and in 1946 they were in exile in Belgium when he was offered a chair by the University of Dublin in Ireland.
* Łukasiewicz introduced the 'Polish notation' which allowed expressions to be written unambiguously without the use of brackets and his studies were to form the basis for Tarski's work.
* In November 2022, Łukasiewicz's remains were transferred from Dublin to Warsaw and buried in Warsaw's Old Powązki Cemetery.

Born 21 December 1878, Lemberg, Austrian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 13 February 1956, Dublin, Ireland.
