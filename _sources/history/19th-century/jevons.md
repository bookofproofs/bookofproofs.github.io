**Stanley Jevons** was an English mathematician, economist and logician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the marginal utility theory of economics, showing how people make rational choices despite limited funds and resources.
2. Published "The Theory of Political Economy" in 1871, a work that helped to establish economics as a scientific subject.
3. Published "Logic" in 1864, introducing a new and original system of logic, defining basic terms and rules.
4. Formulated and solved the "Jevons rules" in 1865, showing how to compare series of numbers of unequal duration, a predecessor of calculus.
5. Published a revolutionary mathematical equation in 1865 known as "Jevons' Law", which determined the rate of imports into a country based on its population size.
6. Developed the "Logical Machine" in 1869, a machine he used to graph algebraic equations.
7. Established the important economic concept known as "diminishing marginal utility" in 1871, which stated that the value of a good or commodity was inversely related to its availability.

Born 1 September 1835, Liverpool, England. Died 13 August 1882, Hastings, England.
