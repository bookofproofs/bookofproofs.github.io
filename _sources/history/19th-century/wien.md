**Wilhelm Wien** was a German physicist who won the Nobel prize for discovering the proton.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the thermionic emission law (Wien's law) which states the relationship between the temperature of a blackbody and its emission spectrum.
2. Developed the concept of thermodynamic work.
3. Helped to develop new theories of radiation, such as the Rayleigh-Jeans Law and the Planck Radiation Law.
4. Successfully solved a major problem in mathematics -- the calculation of Bessel functions -- by means of an improved method. 
5. Achieved an important breakthrough in the understanding of electricity conduction in solids by discovering Minority Carriers in modern Electronics.
6. Established the fundamental concepts of the Zeeman effect and thereby extended classical wave-optics to apply to the field of modern spin-optics.
7. Developed an absolute temperature scale based on an updating of the ideal gas law.

Born 13 January 1864, Gaffken, near Fischhausen, East Prussia (now Primorsk Kaliningrad Oblast Russia). Died 30 August 1928, Munich, Germany.
