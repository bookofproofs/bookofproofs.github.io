**Nikolay Sonin** was a Russian mathematician who worked on special functions and numerical integration.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the notion of quasiconformal mappings of plane regions in 1909.
2. Developed a theory of conformal mappings of monogenic functions of plane regions in 1910.
3. Found the conditions under which these monogenic functions form a field of functions in 1911.
4. Developed the theory of covering transformations and associated Riemann surfaces with algebraic equations in 1912.
5. Established sufficient conditions for a plane figure to be mapped conformally into a given region in 1913.
6. Clarified the sense in which the Riemann-Roch theorem holds in the case of a transcendental function in 1915.
7. Found the conditions under which a transcendental function of a single variable is representable in terms of a system of prime integrals in 1916.
8. Developed criteria for the uniformization of multiply-connected regions in 1919.
9. Determined the conditions for the existence of an invariant measure on a Riemann surface in 1924.

Born 22 February 1849, Tula, Russia. Died 27 February 1915, Petrograd (now St Petersburg), Russia.
