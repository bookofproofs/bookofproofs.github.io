**Karl Schwarzschild** was a German physicist and astronomer who investigated the mathematics which eventually led to the prediction of the existence of black holes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed Schwarzschild coordinates in 1916, which provided a mathematical formulation of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. 
2. He made several mathematical calculations related to the stability, gravitational lensing, and celestial mechanics of black holes.
3. He demonstrated mathematically the deflection of light as predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity.
4. He proposed the first solution of Einsteinâ€™s field equations in 1915, which are still known as the Schwarzschild solution. 
5. He was the first to calculate the gravitational redshift of a photon based on the principles of general relativity.
6. He formed the Schwarzschild metric, which extended Newton's gravitational theories to include time dilation and the curvature of space-time. 
7. He was the first to accurately calculate the size of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. 
8. He also made contributions to the mathematical foundations of theory of stellar structure and evolution.

Born 9 October 1873, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Died 11 May1916, Potsdam, Germany.
