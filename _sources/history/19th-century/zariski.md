**Zariski**'s work was on foundations of algebraic geometry using algebraic methods. He worked on the theory of normal varieties, local uniformisation and the reduction of singularities of algebraic varieties.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Zariski topology to study the geometry of algebraic sets.
2. Founded the branch of commutative algebra that enables the application of modern algebraic methods to the problems of algebraic geometry.
3. Substantially advanced the resolution of singularities in algebraic varieties and the Riemann-Roch theorem.
4. Explained the concept of local rings and proved that two dimensions are the only dimensions in which regular local rings exist.
5. Solved the 14th problem of Hilbert, which provided the foundations for the theory of algebraic surfaces and the theory of divisors.
6. Wrote important papers on the birational classification of algebraic surfaces and on arithmetic surfaces.
7. Proved Scherk's conjecture, which related the existence and number of singular points of a real algebraic surface to the number of its connected components.
8. Collaborated with Abhyankar on the famous Inverse Galois Problem.
9. Discovered the Zariski-Lipman conjectures, one of the most prolific open problems in mathematics.

Born 24 April 1899, Kobrin, Russian Empire (now Belarus). Died 4 July 1986, Brookline, Massachusetts, USA.
