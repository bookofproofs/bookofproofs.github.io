**Lee Glaisher** was an English mathematician and astronomer who wrote over 400 articles on astronomy, special functions, calculation of numerical tables, number theory and the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations, now known as the Glaisher–Whitbread Method. 
2. Authored a treatise on elliptic functions which mapped the development of elliptic functions in the nineteenth century. 
3. Established the theory of hypergeometric series. 
4. Used algebraic methods to solve Diophantine equations. 
5. Proved that the number of divisors of any natural number greater than one is finite. 
6. Provided the first rigorous proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity. 
7. Established upper and lower bounds for the number of prime numbers less than a given positive integer. 
8. Applied Kummer’s congruences to the proofs of Fermat’s last theorem and the prime number theorem. 
9. Wrote an influential book on the History and Theory of Numbers, which summarizes the knowledge of 19th century number theorists.

Born 5 November 1848, Lewisham, Kent, England. Died 7 December 1928, Cambridge, England.
