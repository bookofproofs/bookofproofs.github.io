**Rudolf Sturm**  was a German mathematician who worked in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed new approaches to algebraic geometry with his main work being "Lehrbuch der Algebraischen Geometrie" (Textbook of Algebraic Geometry). 
2. He contributed to the defining of basic notions in algebraic geometry, such as the dimension of an algebraic curve. 
3. Established a school for the teaching of algebraic geometry in Graz. 
4. Developed theory of finitely-generated abelian groups and the generalization of cyclotomic fields. 
5. Made breakthroughs in the formalization of the geometric language of algebraic varieties. 
6. Identified the structures of algebraic curves as mathematical objects. 
7. Contributed to the development of the theory of Riemann surfaces. 
8. Developed the technique of scissor-congruence to classify algebraic surfaces.

Born 6 January 1841, Breslau, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 12 April 1919, Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland).
