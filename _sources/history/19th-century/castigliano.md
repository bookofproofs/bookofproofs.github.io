**Alberto Castigliano** was an Italian mathematician and physicist who may be credited with the discovery of the principle of least work.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After four years in Terni, in Umbria, Castigliano moved north again, this time to become a student at the Polytechnic of Turin.
* After graduating from the Polytechnic of Turin, Castigliano was employed by the Northern Italian Railways.
* In his dissertation there appears a theorem which is now named after Castigliano.
* Castigliano's results contain the principle of least work as a special case and this was to lead to a dispute with Menabrea in which Castigliano came off less well than he had hoped.
* Certainly when Menabrea attempted another proof of his principle in 1875 he used Castigliano's results but his only reference to Castigliano was in a footnote.
* Castigliano did not find this satisfactory and objected to the lack of recognition given to him by Menabrea.
* Cremona chaired a special meeting of the Accademia dei Lincei which was asked to judge whether Menabrea had indeed acted unfairly towards Castigliano.

Born 9 November 1847, Asti, Piemonte (now Italy). Died 25 October 1884, Milan, Italy.
