**Alberto Castigliano** was an Italian mathematician and physicist who may be credited with the discovery of the principle of least work.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Castigliano's Theorem which is used to calculate the elastic deflections of a loaded structure.
2. Established the Castigliano's Principle, which provides the basis of various theories in applied mathematics.
3. Pioneered the development of theories in elasticity, strain theory and vibrations.
4. Discovered an original method for numerical inversion of Laplace transforms.
5. Developed the method of Castigliano's equations which allows the calculation of the derivatives of displacement and strain fields of an elastically deformed system.
6. Advanced theories of beam deflection and sloping beams.
7. Developed the concept of strain energy, which is widely used in structures subject to loading and dynamic analysis.

Born 9 November 1847, Asti, Piemonte (now Italy). Died 25 October 1884, Milan, Italy.
