* While taking his degree course Todhunter also worked as a mathematics teacher at a large school in Wimbledon.
* Todhunter progressed from fellow to principal mathematical lecturer at St John's College where he resisted all attempts to reduce the central role of Euclid in mathematics courses.

* Todhunter had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1862.
* In 1874 Todhunter was elected as an honorary fellow of St John's College but he was taken ill in 1880 and, from that time on, his health deteriorated.
