**Isaac Todhunter** is best known for his textbooks and his writing on the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published an updated version of [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621] in 1856.
2. Founded the Royal Mathematical School in north London.
3. Published A Treatise on the Differential Calculus in 1862.
4. Developed Tau-theory that uses the derivative of theta to calculate angles in circles.
5. Developed a parametric curve methodology which uses the concepts of curvilinear coordinates to study the geometries of curved lines.
6. Developed semaphore code which allowed the transmission of messages over a long distance.
7. Published his most famous work A Treatise on the Integral Calculus in 1863.

Born 23 November 1820, Rye, Sussex, England. Died 1 March 1884, Cambridge, England.
