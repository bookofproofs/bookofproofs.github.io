* While taking his degree course Todhunter also worked as a mathematics teacher at a large school in Wimbledon.
* One of his pupils was Leslie Stephen, the father of the author Virginia Woolf, who studied mathematics at Cambridge with Todhunter as his tutor.
* Todhunter married Louisa Anna Maria Davies.
* Todhunter progressed from fellow to principal mathematical lecturer at St John's College where he resisted all attempts to reduce the central role of Euclid in mathematics courses.
* In 1864 Todhunter resigned his fellowship at St John's College, which he was forced to do as he wished to marry.
* Todhunter had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1862.
