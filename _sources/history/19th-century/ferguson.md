### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a paper in 1838 outlining the foundations of conical sections.
2. Wrote articles for the Cambridge Mathematical Journal discussing the concept of algebraic functions and the resultant theorems.
3. Developed applications of linear equations to geometry, probability theory and celestial mechanics.
4. Invented a system of rational reciprocation curved lines.
5. Established a new study of cycloids and higher plane curves.
6. Devised a system of logarithms to base 10.
7. Set steps forward in the development of elliptic integrals.

Born 8 July 1829, Airdrie, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Died 31 December 1912, Edinburgh, Scotland.
