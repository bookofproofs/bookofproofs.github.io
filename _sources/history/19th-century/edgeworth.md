**Francis Edgeworth** was an Irish-born statistician who examined correlation and methods of estimating correlation coefficients in a series of papers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Richard Lovell Edgeworth had an estate at Edgeworthstown, northwest of Dublin, and it was on this estate that Edgeworth was born.
* Francis Ysidro Edgeworth was originally named Ysidro Francis Edgeworth but transposed his forenames.
* At this stage in his life Edgeworth had no particular interest in mathematics.
* One important influence from this period was Jevons who was a friend and near-neighbour of Edgeworth.
* The surprising part is that somewhere in this varied career Edgeworth studied mathematics.
* In fact most of his work could be said to be applications of mathematical psychics which Edgeworth saw as analogous to mathematical physics.
* Edgeworth published Methods of Statistics in 1885 which presented an exposition of the application and interpretation of significance tests for the comparison of means.
* In 1891 Edgeworth left London to take up the Drummond Chair of Political Economy at Oxford.
* Another event of significance in 1891 was that the Economic Journal began publication with Edgeworth as its first editor.
* This journal was the publication of the Royal Economic Society which had been set up in 1890 with Edgeworth appointed as secretary to the Society.
* In 1892 Edgeworth examined correlation and methods of estimating correlation coefficients in a series of papers.
* Edgeworth's work was to influence Pearson although bad feeling developed between the two and later Pearson was to deny Edgeworth's influence.
* Whenever you see that k call to mind dear old Edgeworth.

Born 8 February 1845, Edgeworthstown, County Longford, Ireland. Died 13 February 1926, Oxford, England.
