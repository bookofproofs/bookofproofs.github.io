**Francis Edgeworth** was an Irish-born statistician who examined correlation and methods of estimating correlation coefficients in a series of papers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Edgeworth box model to represent a two-person exchange economy in 1881.
2. Pioneered the study of mathematical economics in the late nineteenth century.
3. Constructed graphical representation for statistical data, often referred to as the Edgeworth diagram.
4. Proposed the use of least squares as a method to fit regression lines to data and published methods using the method.
5. Established the theory of index numbers, which became the synonym for measures of price and quantity movement.
6. Formulated a law of diminishing marginal utility in 1893, which influenced contemporary economists.
7. Introduced the concept of indifference curves and proposed a qualitative definition of equilibrium in the series of papers he wrote in 1881.
8. Advanced the analytical treatment of probability and applied mathematics to social statistics.
9. Developed and proposed new forms of taxation such as the ‘Edgeworth Tax-Liability’ in 1888.
10. Unveiled a new quantity theory of money that applied monetary and statistical analysis to economic models of inflation.

Born 8 February 1845, Edgeworthstown, County Longford, Ireland. Died 13 February 1926, Oxford, England.
