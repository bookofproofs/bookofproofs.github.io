**Gottlob Frege** was a German mathematician who was one of the founders of modern symbolic logic putting forward the view that mathematics is reducible to logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the two-dimensional notation system which is the foundation of modern mathematical logic. 
2. Formulated the mathematical language which was the first step towards the development of predicate calculus. 
3. Formulated and established the modern definition of a mathematical function. 
4. Established the basic framework of mathematics on the notion of sets, which became later known as the set-theoretical foundation of mathematics. 
5. Developed the concept of the “Begriffsschrift” (Concept Script) which was the basis for modern symbolic logic. 
6. Developed and propounded the principle of mathematical induction. 
7. Developed the formal system of the “Grundgesetze der Arithmetik” (Basic Laws of Arithmetic).
8. Devised the concept of formal number theory. 
9. Published his seminal work “Grundgesetze der Arithmetik”. 
10. Invented the notion of quantified variables.

Born 8 November 1848, Wismar, Mecklenburg-Schwerin (now Germany). Died 26 July 1925, Bad Kleinen, Germany.
