**Harold Jeffreys** was an English mathematician, statistician, geophysicist, and astronomer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical theory of the Earth and its structure (1929/30).
2. Formulated a theory of gravitation, an alternative to Einstein's general relativity (1946).
3. Showed that Bayes' theorem could be applied to probability problems (1939).
4. Developed a method for predicting the tides (1924).
5. Discovered what has become the Jeffreysâ€“Hampson equation (1923).
6. Developed a mathematical model for forecasting earthquakes (1935).
7. Proposed using the inverse probability method for solving problems in inverse problems in various fields (1932).
8. Authored the book Theory of Probability (1939).

Born 22 April 1891, Fatfield (near Durham), England. Died 18 March 1989, Cambridge, England.
