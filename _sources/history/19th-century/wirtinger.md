**Wilhelm Wirtinger** was an Austrian mathematician who worked in complex analysis, geometry, algebra, number theory, Lie groups and knot theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Wirtinger's inequality in differential geometry.
2. Established the field of singularity theory by introducing the concept of a regular systems of singular points
3. Published leading works on algebraic geometry and algebraic functions 
4. Contributed to complex analysis notably with several theorems on conformal mappings 
5. Advanced Riemannian geometry by introducing the concept of positive definite quadratic forms 
6. Widely published works on the theory of elliptic functions 
7. Published notable works on the theory of θ-functions and theta constants
8. Proved the invariance and transformation properties of Beltrami differential equations 
9. Developed the Wirtinger calculus for solving certain boundary value problems 
10. Published his most notable work in number theory, Vorlesungen über Idealtheorie (Lectures on the theory of ideals)

Born 15 July 1865, Ybbs an der Donau, Melk, Niederösterreich, Austria. Died 15 January 1945, Ybbs an der Donau, Melk, Niederösterreich, Austria.
