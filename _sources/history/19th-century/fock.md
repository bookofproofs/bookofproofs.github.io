**Vladimir Fock** was a Russian physicist who worked in quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Fock space, an abstract mathematical tool for describing quantum systems.
2. Established the concept of positronium, which is a bound state of an electron and a positron.
3. Explored the connection between quantum mechanics and special relativity.
4. Introduced the concept of second quantization, which extends the classical concept of particle-like objects to quantum mechanics.
5. Developed the adiabatic theorem, which describes the behavior of a quantum system that is slowly subjected to external perturbation.
6. Discovered the Thomas-Fermi theory, which is used to describe the state of a many-electron system.
7. Contributed to the development of Hartree-Fock theory, which is used to calculate the ground state of a many-electron system.
8. Proposed a nuclear-renormalization theory of the atom, an early step in the development of quantum chemistry.

Born 22 December 1898, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 27 December 1974, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
