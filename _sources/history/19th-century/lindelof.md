**Ernst Lindelöf** was a Finnish mathematician who worked on topology and partial differential equations. He also wrote on the history of Scandinavian mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established one of the earliest methods of constructing invariant theory.
2. Developed the concept of continuous functions on real numbers. 
3. He was the first to prove the Possibility of four colors in Theorem of coloring problem.
4. Developed what is now known as the Cartesian product of two sets. 
5. He proposed a proof of the Prime Number Theorem. 
6. Pioneered in the establishment of modern point set topology.
7. Provided an early definition of a set of points in terms of neighborhood. 
8. He gave a method for describing the boundaries of open and closed sets.
9. Introduced the notion of compactness for the first time. 
10. He is credited for developing the concept of Cantor's diagonal argument which is used in the proof of the Baire category theorem.

Born 7 March 1870, Helsingfors, Russian Empire (now Helsinki, Finland). Died 4 June 1946, Helsinki, Finland.
