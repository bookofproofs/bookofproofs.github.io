**Ernst Lindelöf** was a Finnish mathematician who worked on topology and partial differential equations. He also wrote on the history of Scandinavian mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* At the time that time Lindelöf's father was appointed professor of mathematics at the university, the main building of the university on Senate Square had recently been completed.
* By the time that Lindelöf went to study mathematics at Helsingfors University in 1887 his father was no longer the professor there.
* Lindelöf spent the year 1891 in Stockholm, and the years 1893-94 in Paris returning to Helsingfors where he graduated in 1895.
* Lindelöf remained as professor of mathematics in Helsinki until he retired in 1938.
* Lindelöf supported his new country undertaking his university duties with great enthusiasm.
* Lindelöf's first work in 1890 was on the existence of solutions for differential equations.
* Later in his life Lindelöf gave up research to devote himself to teaching and writing his excellent textbooks.
* Another important role which Lindelöf played in Finland was the encouragement of the study of the history of mathematics in that country.

Born 7 March 1870, Helsingfors, Russian Empire (now Helsinki, Finland). Died 4 June 1946, Helsinki, Finland.
