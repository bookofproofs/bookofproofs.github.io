**Edward Blades** graduated from Edinburgh University. He held posts at Moray House Training College, at Heriot Watt College and at George Watson's Ladies' College, all in Edinburgh. He became Director of Education for West Lothian. After he retired he made contributions to Army Education. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Edward Blades contributed to the development of tools and techniques used in areas as diverse as linear algebra and number theory. 
2. He discovered a new loop theorem, now known as the Blades Loop Theorem, which states that a square lattice can pass through itself.
3. He solved several difficult problems related to isomorphisms and constructions in the finite field theory. 
4. He devised Rankin's Trick, which is a method for computing with matrices that is used in computer algebra and numerical analysis. 
5. He solved the problem of finding the best rational approximation to a given real number.
6. He developed algorithms for efficiently computing polynomial equation solutions.

Born 6 March 1875, Armadale, West Lothian, Scotland. Died 1953, Edinburgh, Scotland.
