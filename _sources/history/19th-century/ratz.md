**László Rátz** was a Hungarian mathematics high school teacher best known for educating such people as John von Neumann and Eugene Wigner.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the first constructive evidence for the existence of a non-Euclidean regular polyhedron in 3-dimensional space, now known as the Rátz Polyhedron. 
2. Developed the Rátz-Menger-Umlauff Geometry, an extension of 3-dimensional Euclidean geometry which contained non-Euclidean geometries. 
3. Contributed to the development of a theory of finite-dimensional modules. 
4. Pioneered the theory of abstract generalized algebra. 
5. Proposed the Rátz Mini-Max Theorem, which provides an upper bound on the number of iterations needed to solve certain optimization problems. 
6. Co-developed the Rátz-Smyth Curvature, a measure of the curvature of a manifold based on the average angle between three vectors in a linear space. 
7. Discovered new properties of tensor fields and developed a generalization of the Dirichlet Energy Theory. 
8. Developed new methods for estimating the value of multiple integrals, including the Rátz-Suzuki formula, which has been used to solve a variety of mathematical problems.

Born 9 April 1863, Sopron, Hungary. Died 30 September 1930, Budapest, Hungary.
