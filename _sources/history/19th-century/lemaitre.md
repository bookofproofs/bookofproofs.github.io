**Georges Henri Joseph Édouard Lemaître** was a Belgian mathematician and astronomer who worked on the theory of an expanding universe.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. First published the idea of the Big Bang Theory, proposing that the universe began from a single primordial atom
2. Developed one of the first comprehensive mathematical models of the expanding universe
3. Proposed a novel solution to Albert Einstein's equations of general relativity, known as the Lemaître-Tolman (L-T) model, which described the behavior of the universe over time
4. Pioneered the development of the modern field of cosmology and was the first to identify that the universe is expanding
5. Proposed the Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (L-R-W) metric, which serves as the basis for all subsequent models of the expanding universe
6. Developed a hypothesis of the universe's continuous creation from a “primeval atom”, and proposed that all of the universe's matter had emerged from this single point at the beginning of time

Born 17 July 1894, Charleroi, Belgium. Died 20 June 1966, Charleroi, Belgium.
