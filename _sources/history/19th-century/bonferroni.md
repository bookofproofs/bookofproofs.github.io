**Carlo Emilio Bonferroni** was an Italian mathematician who worked on probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Bonferroni inequality, which is used to analyze certain systems of simultaneous statistical hypotheses.
2. Proved the central limit theorem for Boolean algebra
3. Demonstrated how to quantify the degree of correlation between two variables
4. Coined the term ‘multiple comparison’ and proposed methods for controlling the increased probability of committing a Type I error
5. Demonstrated the effectiveness of the Bonferroni correction, which adjusts the significance level in multiple hypothesis tests
6. Established the Bonferroni t-statistic and related it to the Student t-test
7. Applied the Bonferroni correction to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in order to control the mode of Type I errors

Born 28 January 1892, Bergamo, Italy. Died 18 August 1960, Florence, Italy.
