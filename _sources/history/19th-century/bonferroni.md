**Carlo Emilio Bonferroni** was an Italian mathematician who worked on probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Bonferroni entered the University of Turin where he studied for his laurea under Giuseppe Peano and Corrado Segre.
* After the award of his doctorate, Bonferroni spent a year studying abroad at the University of Vienna and at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule in Zürich.
* Then in 1923, Bonferroni took up the chair of financial mathematics at the Financial Mathematics and Economics Institute in Bari.
* It was a highly appropriate conference for Bonferroni to attend since, for the first time, a section was introduced covering Statistics, Mathematical Economy, Calculus of Probability, and Actuarial Science.
* Carlo Benedetti became Bonferroni's student after World War II.
* Bonferroni said to me, "Hurry and take up a career in statistics because when mathematicians become aware of the possibility which it offers them, there will not be any more opportunities for people like you".
* In the 1936 paper Bonferroni sets up his inequalities.
* As we mentioned above, Bonferroni attended this conference and his work on the 'Bonferroni inequalities' may have been prompted by hearing Cantelli's lecture.
* It is worth noting, however, that Bonferroni's inequalities gained fame following the publication of Maurice Fréchet's 1940 book Les probabilités associées a un système d'événements compatibles et dépendants.
* To indicate the interest in this area we note that an generalisation of Bonferroni's inequalities by S Holm in the paper A simple sequentially rejective multiple test procedure published in the Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 6 (1979), 65-70, has received around 2000 citations.
* Bonferroni kept up his passion for music all his life and when he was younger he was an enthusiastic climber of glaciers.
* Bonferroni was honoured by election to the Hungarian Statistical Society.

Born 28 January 1892, Bergamo, Italy. Died 18 August 1960, Florence, Italy.
