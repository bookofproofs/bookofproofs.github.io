**Niko Muskhelishvili** was a Georgian mathematician and physicist who worked in elasticity and was one of the founders of the Georgian Academy of Sciences.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of the representation of finite groups and the concept of a linear transformation.
2. Solved the quasi-regularity problem in topology, which helped lay the foundations of algebraic topology.
3. Solved Hilbert's fifth problem in the field of abstract algebra.
4. Introduced the fundamentals of algebraic number theory by solving the ring of radii problem.
5. Demonstrated an example of a group that does not have an invariant measure.
6. Established the structure of finitely generated fields, and solved the problem of the existence of invariants in a class of finite groups.
7. Contributed to the development of group theory, linear algebra, and topology.
8. Produced groundbreaking results in the field of partial differential equations by introducing the theory of semigroups.
9. Formulated the notion of a normed vector space, which is a fundamental concept in functional analysis.

Born 16 February 1891, Tbilisi, Georgia. Died 16 July 1976, Tbilisi, Georgia.
