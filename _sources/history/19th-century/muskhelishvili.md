**Niko Muskhelishvili** was a Georgian mathematician and physicist who worked in elasticity and was one of the founders of the Georgian Academy of Sciences.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Muskhelishvili speaks about his father with great warmth and affection and in dedicating his 'Course of Theoretical Mechanics" (1926) to him he describes him as his first great teacher.
* Muskhelishvili's mother, too, was a person of culture as well as charm.
* Muskhelishvili's mother, mentioned in the above quote, was Daria Saginashvili who taught languages.
* Among his teachers at university was the Professor of Mechanics Aleksei Nikolaevich Krylov who was so impressed with the young Muskhelishvili that he said to a colleague, "Mark the name Muskhelishvili; it is one you will hear often in the future!" Muskhelishvili graduated with a first degree in 1914 and continued his studies at St Petersburg in the Department of Mechanics, preparing for a professorship.
* Muskhelishvili soon was making important contributions to this area.
* Muskhelishvili then pursued systematic investigations on this subject and published a series of articles devoted to various boundary problems of the plane theory of elasticity and to other problems of mathematical physics.
* Before these papers were published, Muskhelishvili was working as an assistant at the St Petersburg Electrotechnical Institute where he was appointed in 1915.
* Georgia's independence was recognized by the Allies in January 1920 and there was a request to Muskhelishvili to return to his native country and help set up the state educational system.
* On the staff at Tbilisi State University when Muskhelishvili was appointed in 1920 was the Georgian mathematician George Nikoladze (1888-1931) whom he had known while working in St Petersburg.
* We will give some details of Nikoladze and his family since Muskhelishvili married his sister Tamara.
* In 1922 Muskhelishvili published his first monograph, choosing to write it in French, the important book Applications des intégrales analogues à celles de Cauchy á quelques problèmes de la physique mathématique Ⓣ(Applications of integrals similar to those of Cauchy to some problems of mathematical physics).
* In the same year that this monograph was published, Muskhelishvili became a professor at Tbilisi State University.
* We have already seen some of the areas that Muskhelishvili worked on in the early part of his career, particularly on plane problems of the theory of elasticity.
* In the works of Muskhelishvili formulae were obtained expressing the solution of Hilbert's boundary problem for a plane when there are a finite number of discontinuities along a broken curve.
* Many honours were given to Muskhelishvili for his outstanding achievements.
* Muskhelishvili received five Orders of Lenin in the years 1941, 1952, 1961, 1966 and 1975.
* Muskhelishvili retired when he reached the age of 80.

Born 16 February 1891, Tbilisi, Georgia. Died 16 July 1976, Tbilisi, Georgia.
