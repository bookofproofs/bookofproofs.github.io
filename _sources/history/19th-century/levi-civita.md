**Tullio Levi-Civita** was an Italian mathematician who is best known for his work on the absolute differential calculus and the theory of tensors. He had problems later in his life with the rise of Fascism in Italy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He discovered the absolute differential calculus and the Levi-Civita symbol. 
2. He formulated the Levi-Civita regularization of the three-body problem in celestial mechanics.
3. Introduced the concept of absolute parallelism, later called the Levi-Civita connection. 
4. He was the first to define spinors in geometric terms and introduced them in General Relativity in 1917. 
5. He developed the mathematical framework for General Relativity. 
6. His book The Absolute Differential Calculus served as a major foundation for the field of tensor calculus. 
7. Pioneered the study of conformal transformations and the use of gyroscopic coordinates. 
8. He determined the Lagrangian solutions for motion in a gravitational field.
9. Developed the device known as the Levi-Civita canonical transformation which provided the foundation for modern numerical analysis. 
10. Solved the 21 case of Hilbert's 3rd problem of the foundations of geometry.

Born 29 March 1873, Padua, Veneto, Italy. Died 29 December 1941, Rome, Italy.
