**George Salmon** made many discoveries about ruled surfaces and other surfaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a modified form of the Newton-Cotes quadrature formula (also known as Salmon's rule) to simplify the integration of polynomials.
2. Created an easier-to-use version of Maclaurinâ€™s series formula.
3. Introduced a primer on the principles of Euclidean geometry.
4. Extended the domain of negatively-indexed binomial coefficients.
5. Generalized the law of sines for the solution of three-dimensional problems in trigonometry.
6. Developed the n-dimensional analytic geometry.
7. Authored the three-volume higher education text "A Treatise on Conic Sections" which developed the use of geometric algebra as its basis.
8. Made significant advances in using projective geometry to solve cubic equations.

Born 25 September 1819, Dublin, Ireland. Died 22 January 1904, Dublin, Ireland.
