1. Published two papers in integration theory in 1841 and 1843.
2. First to prove a generalization of the Fourier integral theorem.
3. Solved an algebraic equation with a degree of nine.
4. Advanced the theory of algebraic equations.
5. Researched geometric and transcendental subjects including Abelian integrals.
6. Developed the theory of linear substitutions.
7. Proved a new theorem involving continued fractions.
8. Contributed a foundational work laying out the theory of quadratic forms.
9. Discovered the differential invariants related to linear substitutions.

Born 18 February 1844, Mannheim, Germany. Died 14 September 1910, Munich, Germany.
