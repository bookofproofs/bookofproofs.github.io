**Joseph Langley Burchnall** was an English mathematician who worked in the theory of differential operators.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Irish Mathematical Society in 1921.
2. Developed the Burchnall-Chaundy theory of linear transformations in the 1920s that enabled the development of an algebraic representation for linear differential equations.
3. Published the book Linear Differential Operators in 1924 which detailed the theory of linear transformations he had developed.
4. Invented the Burchnall Operators in 1929 as an extension of his linear transformation theory. 
5. Won the Sylvester Medal from the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1933 for pioneering mathematical research.
6. Collaborated with W. L. Irwin in studying a class of once-twisted periodic functions between 1942 and 1945. 
7. Published the book General Theory in 1958 which looked at the algebraic representations of linear differential equations.

Born 8 December 1892, Whichford, near Chipping Norton, Warwickshire, England. Died 29 April 1975, Southwold, Suffolk, England.
