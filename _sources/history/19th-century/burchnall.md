**Joseph Langley Burchnall** was an English mathematician who worked in the theory of differential operators.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Joseph was educated at Boston Grammar School, supported by a Holland County Council Scholarship, where he won the Parry Gold Medal in 1908.
* It is not entirely clear that an academic career was Burchnall's first choice for, later in life, he told a friend that he would have liked to have joined the Civil Service but thought that with his disability life in London would be too difficult.
* He played a large part in the discussions on reconstitution, and although the Durham Council's recommendations were not all implemented, it was due to Burchnall and a small group of others that the Durham Colleges emerged from this chastening period with so much of their character intact.
* Almost half of Burchnall's mathematical papers were written with T W Chaundy, with whom he collaborated for 20 years.
* This called for wise planning and control and Professor Burchnall was a leading figure at all stages.
* Burchnall retired in 1959 and, although he continued his interest in mathematics in his retirement, he wrote no further research papers.

Born 8 December 1892, Whichford, near Chipping Norton, Warwickshire, England. Died 29 April 1975, Southwold, Suffolk, England.
