**Oscar Chisini** was an Italian mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The young Oscar received a classical education, first in Ravenna and then in Bologna.
* Later, enrolled as an engineering student at the University of Bologna, Oscar Chisini met Federigo Enriques in a meeting that was to change his life.
* The four volumes of this monograph, started in 1915 and finished in 1934, were conceived in what Chisini called a peripatetic way, that is walking under the porches of Bologna with Enriques possibly stopping to write on the flooring with the tip of his umbrella.
* The Great War marked a break in Chisini's academic career, as he volunteered in the alpine artillery.
* As an algebraic geometry researcher, Oscar Chisini is to be considered part of the so-called Italian school, featuring among others Luigi Cremona, Corrado Segre, Guido Castelnuovo, Francesco Severi, Beniamino Segre and, of course, Federigo Enriques.
* Overall, Chisini expressed a dynamic vision of science in which history and mistakes are to play a prominent role.

Born 14 March 1889, Bergamo, Italy. Died 10 April 1967, Milan, Italy.
