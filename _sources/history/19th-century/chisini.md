**Oscar Chisini** was an Italian mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Chisini-Volterra Theorem as a primary tool in the study of partial differential equations, which relates the existence of solutions to the nature of the boundary conditions.
2. Discovered the polynomial approximation algorithm, which revolutionized the field of numerical analysis and opened the door to sophisticated computer simulations.
3. Developed a theory of probability based on combinatorial analysis, which became a foundation for the study of game theory.
4. Introduced concepts of infinitesimals and calculus, which allowed mathematicians to think of physical quantities as being continuous rather than discrete.
5. Created a new kind of topology, which improved the understanding of edges and continuity in mathematical structures.
6. Demonstrated nonlinearity as a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which made many difficult scientific problems solvable.
7. Elucidated the fundamental properties of solitons, which opened new avenues for understanding wave propagation.
8. Developed new invariants that allowed for the complete characterization of functions and other mathematical objects.

Born 14 March 1889, Bergamo, Italy. Died 10 April 1967, Milan, Italy.
