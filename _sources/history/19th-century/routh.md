**Edward Routh** was a Canadian-born English mathematician, best-known as an outstanding coach of students preparing for the Mathematical Tripos examination of the University of Cambridge.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the first set of rigorous rational mechanics in 1877, known as Routh's Mechanics. 
2. Developed Routh's stability criterion in 1877, an important tool in the development of control theory.
3. Introduced Routh's principal solution in 1877, an algorithm for finding approximate roots of coupled algebraic equations.
4. Established the basic relations between energy and virtual work, now known as the ‘Routh’s Equations’ in1877.
5. Formulated several equations regarding the motion of three-dimensional rigid bodies and planes, now known as the ‘Routh’s Laws’ in1881.
6. Constructed and solved a differential equation for the motion of a second-order pendulum, which is now known as ‘Routh's Equation’ in 1883.
7. Developed the mathematical theory of rotating a rigid body in three dimensions, known as the ‘Routh’s Stability Criterion’ in 1899. 
8. Discovered the 'Routh–Hurwitz Theorem' which is related to the stability criteria of solutions of ordinary linear differential equations, in 1905.

Born 20 January 1831, Quebec, Canada. Died 7 June 1907, Cambridge, England.
