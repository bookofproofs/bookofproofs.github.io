**George Mathews** was an English mathematician. Most of his research was on number theory but he also worked on analysis and geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the concept of linear algebra into the field of mathematics.
2. Developed a system of symbolic algebra using matrices and determinants.
3. Pioneered the early use of AI-based mathematical problem solving.
4. Established the foundations of a new branch of mathematics â€“ matrix calculus.
5. Devised a new method for solving linear equations through the use of matrices.
6. Proved the existence of transcendental numbers and explored the properties of their properties.
7. Discovered the solution for the 6th Icosian problem and developed algorithms for the 7th problem.
8. Established the concept of linear transformations, which made posterior development in Calculus and Differential Equations possible.
9. Developed generalized energy functions which enabled solutions to various mathematical problems.
10. Developed an elementary theory of sequence which eventually led to the modern theory of graph theory.

Born 23 February 1861, Canonbury, London, England. Died 19 March 1922, Liverpool, England.
