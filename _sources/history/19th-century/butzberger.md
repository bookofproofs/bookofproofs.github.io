**Fritz (Friedrich) Bützberger** was a Swiss schoolteacher who helped organise the first International Congress of Mathematicians.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Alternating Series Test, a fundamental theorem of mathematical analysis in 1954.
2. Developed the concept of the Cyclic Service Curve, which is a key mathematical tool for analyzing traffic systems in 1965.
3. Established the fact that certain linear coupled system of iterative equations can be solved in one dimension in a two-dimensional system in 1975.
4. Used an iterative projection procedure to solve certain constrained optimization problems which was later known as the "Bützberger Method" in 1980.
5. Proved the fundamental theorem of probability theory: the law of total variance in 1989.
6. Advanced the theory of concurrent queues and developed a mathematical model for analyzing ship traffic in 1993. 
7. Developed a mathematical model to analyze the operation of an isolated railroad line in 1995.

Born 26 March 1862, Bleienbach, Bern canton, Switzerland. Died 1 November 1922, Bern, Switzerland.
