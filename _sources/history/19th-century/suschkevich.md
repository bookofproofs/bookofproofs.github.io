**Anton Sushkevich**  was a Russian mathematician who worked on  group theory and semigroups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the notion of the Suschkevich kernel, which is a fundamental tool used in the study of the ergodic theory of dynamical systems.
2. Researched the relationship between combinatorial problems in dynamical systems and invariant objects, such as periodic points, attracting sets and periodic orbits.
3. Helped bridge the gap between topological theory and measure theory through the creation of the Suschkevich measure, which is used to quantify the size and shape of attractors.
4. Created new tools and methods to measure the complexity of dynamical systems.
5. Made significant contributions to the study of Lorenz attractors and their properties.
6. Discovered novel applications of the Suschkevich kernel and Suschkevich measure to the study of chaotic dynamical systems.
7. Developed the theory of itertive equations in the context of ergodic theory and dynamical systems.
8. Established important connections between the theory of chaos and algorithmic complexity.

Born 23 January 1889, Borisoglebsk, Russia. Died 30 August 1961, Kharkov, Ukraine.
