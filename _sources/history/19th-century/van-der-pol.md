**Balthasar van der Pol** was a Dutch physicist famous for the non-linear _van der Pol equation_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the van der Pol oscillator mathematics that allows for the study of non-linear phenomena. 
2. Developed a mathematical method to calculate the amplitude and reliability of radio signals used in long-distance communication.
3. Proposed the concept of resonance in electrical circuits, describing it as a 'diverging factor' between the applied alternating current and the induced current.
4. Demonstrated the validity of the Huygens' principle with a series of experiments, showing that radiation from a point source would disperse uniformly in all directions with diminishing intensity.
5. Published numerous papers and books on the mathematical aspects of electrical engineering.
6. Developed an analytical solution to the double-layer capacity problem in electrical and electronic systems.
7. Advanced the theory of electrical systems and demonstrated their stability under varying conditions.
8. Formulated mathematic models for the behavior of electrical circuits with capacitors and inductors, giving insight into synchronization and response.
9. Pioneered a mathematical approach to analyzing the behavior of complex mechanical systems and predicting their motion in a stable state.
10. Suggested new methods for studying and solving differential equations, later known as the Lie-van der Pol system.

Born 27 January 1889, Utrecht, The Netherlands. Died 6 October 1959, Wassenaar, The Netherlands.
