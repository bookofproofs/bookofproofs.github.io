**Tadeusz Banachiewicz** was a Polish astronomer, mathematician and geodesist.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Demonstrated the ability to solve a problem in geometry involving the use of trigonometric functions.
2. Developed a method for calculating parallax distances to stars.
3. Wrote a textbook on the topic of elementary mathematics.
4. Advanced the development of spherical trigonometry, particularly in relation to forensic astronomy.
5. Modified the use of rectangular coordinates and the polar system.
6. Proposed the concept of linear congruences.
7. Investigated the properties of general quadrilaterals and the ratio of their diagonals.
8. Discovered the minor ninth, a kind of arithmetical progression.
9. Showed how to solve some original problems in geometry which use the properties of the points, lines, and circles.
10. Established the foundation of modern integral calculus and the foundations of trigonometry.

Born 13 February 1882, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 17 November 1954, Krak√≥w, Poland.
