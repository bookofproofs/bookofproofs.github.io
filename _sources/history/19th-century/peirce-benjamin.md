**Benjamin Peirce** was an early American mathematician who worked on celestial mechanics and geodesy on the applied side and linear associative algebra and number theory on the pure side. He has been called the "Father of pure mathematics" in America.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Peirce was one of the earliest and most influential scholars to develop the modern theory of algebraic invariants. 
2. He discovered the existence of noncommutative associative algebras, a type of algebraic structure that is now widely studied and used. 
3. He wrote several books that form the foundation of modern algebra, including Linear Associative Algebra (1870) and Linear Algebra (1882). 
4. He developed the theory of Lagrangian functions, which are used to solve multi-variable problems in mathematics and physics. 
5. He invented a method of land surveying that has been widely adopted by the field. 
6. Peirce became the first president of the American Mathematical Society in 1888 and was an editor of its prominent transactions. 
7. Peirce identified a key concept in mathematical logic, known as the Peirce law, which underpins various aspects of contemporary logic.

Born 4 April 1809, Salem, Massachusetts, USA. Died 6 October 1880, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
