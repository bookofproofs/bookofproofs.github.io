**Georgy Voronoy** was a Ukranian mathematician best known for the _Voronoi diagram_ which is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to a finite set of points.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Voronoi diagrams, which are now used as an important means of analyzing spatial data in scientific fields such as mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering and quantitative geography.
2. Introduced methods for representing and solving quadratic forms that are now used in computational mathematics. 
3. Proposed the generalization of arithmetic operations on the field of real numbers and invented a new arithmetic with the help of binary operations.
4. Discovered and investigated the properties of convex polyhedra, which are used in operations research and computer graphics. 
5. Developed quadratic interpolation, which is a method of interpolation between values of a 2D dataset.
6. Discovered and developed a transformation of a conic section into a series of circles, which is used in the design of exact smoothing curves. 
7. Discovered the absolute enumeration of plane trees, which is an algorithm used to count the number of non-isomorphic plane trees. 
8. Proposed the calculation of the area of a surface of revolution, which he demonstrated by computing the surface area of a cycloid.

Born 28 April 1868, Zhuravka, Poltava guberniya, Russia (now Ukraine). Died 20 November 1908, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland).
