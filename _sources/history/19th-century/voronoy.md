**Georgy Voronoy** was a Ukranian mathematician best known for the _Voronoi diagram_ which is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to a finite set of points.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Georgy completed his high school education at the gymnasium in Priluki, graduating in 1885.
* Voronoy did not have a particularly easy time at university.
* Voronoy had to tutor mathematics, often for rather small fees, and, taking such work very seriously and putting much effort into it, he found giving lessons exhausting.
* After graduating from St Petersburg in 1889, writing a dissertation on Bernoulli numbers, Voronoy decided to remain there and work for his teaching qualification.
* Voronoy lectured at Warsaw University, being appointed professor of pure mathematics there in 1894.
* Voronoy then discussed Jacobi's generalisation, after which he went on to look at generalisations due to Poincar√© and Hurwitz.
* Both Voronoy's master's thesis and his doctoral thesis were of such high quality that they were awarded the Bunyakovsky prize by the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences.
* Later Voronoy worked on the theory of numbers, in particular he worked on algebraic numbers and the geometry of numbers.
* In considering tessellations, Voronoy introduced what are today called Voronoi diagrams or Voronoi tessellations.
* In 1904 Voronoy attended the Third International Congress of Mathematicians at Heidelberg.

Born 28 April 1868, Zhuravka, Poltava guberniya, Russia (now Ukraine). Died 20 November 1908, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland).
