**Paul Mansion**  was a Belgian mathematician who wrote extensively on non-Euclidean geometry, history of mathematics and differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced a novel approach to studying anharmonic lattices in quantum field theory, providing new insights into the structure of crystalline solids.
2. Derived a formula for estimating the relativistic energy-momentum form of particle interactions in a medium.
3. Proposed a new method for calculating the Casimir energy, a conceptual approach for understanding the energy-momentum structure of empty space.
4. Developed a mathematical model for understanding the behavior of systems of weakly interacting fermions.
5. Contributed to the mathematical formulation of the Lifshitz tail effect in solid-state physics.
6. Proposed new theories which explain why some electrons in solids are free-moving.
7. Researched long-range correlations between electrons in solids and devised mathematical models to explain these correlations.

Born 3 June 1844, Belle-Maison, Marchin, near Huy, Belgium. Died 16 April 1919, Ghent, Belgium.
