**Franz Mertens** was a Polish-born mathematician who made contributions to a wide variety of areas. He formulated the Mertens conjecture which (had it been true) would have implied the Riemann Hypothesis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Rediscovered and proved theorems related to curves such as the Jordan Theorem, companion curves, and the Mertens theorem.
2. Developed the mathematical model for geodesic flows in projective geometry.
3. Coined the term "pseudo-conformal" to refer to conformally invariant geometry.
4. Derived the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a conformal mapping.
5. Explored connections between the boundary value problems in Euclidean geometry and the elliptic partial differential equations.
6. Discovered and proved the Mertens Formula, which relates prime numbers, Euler's totient function, and the Riemann zeta function.
7. Established the range of validity of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem in dimensions higher than three.
8. Resolved the vanishing affine problem in algebraic geometry, providing a necessary and sufficient condition for a general affine hypersurface of given degree. 
9. Proved the non-existence of rectilinear Steiner triple systems of order 11.
10. Formulated the Mertens conjecture, which states that the partial sums of the Mertens function converge to a constant.

Born 20 March 1840, Schroda, Posen, Prussia (now Åšroda Wielkopolska, Poland). Died 5 March 1927, Vienna, Austria.
