**Hermann Schubert** was a German mathematiciaan who worked on parts of algebraic geometry that involve a finite number of solutions. This is called _Enumerative Geometry_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Worked on the development of an improved definition of line integrals.
2. Developed a system of linear differential equations which could be used to define curves.
3. Demonstrated the existence of the single-valued potential function and defined the concept of univalent functions.
4. Represented the concept of double integrals and paved the way to further developments in mathematical analysis.
5. Introduced the concept of the analytical hierarchy which allowed the classification of non-linear differential equations. 
6. Developed a method for solving non-linear differential equations using the analytical hierarchy.
7. Developed an analytical evaluation of certain indefinite integrals.

Born 22 May1848, Potsdam,Prussia (now Germany). Died 20 July 1911, Hamburg, Germany.
