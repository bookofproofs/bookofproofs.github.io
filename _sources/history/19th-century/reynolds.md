**Osborne Reynolds** was an Irish mathematician and physicist best known for introducing the Reynolds number classifying fluid flow.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In fact it was a family with a tradition of the Church and three generations of Osborne's father's family had been the rector of Debach-with-Boulge.
* Osborne Reynolds' mother was  Jane Bryce (born about 1815).
* Osborne was born in Belfast when his father was Principal of the Collegiate School there, but began his schooling at Dedham when his father was headmaster of the school in that Essex town.
* Reynolds, after gaining experience in the engineering firm, studied mathematics at Cambridge, graduating in 1867 as Seventh Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos (ranked seventh in the list of First Class students).
* As an undergraduate Reynolds had attended some of the same classes as Rayleigh who was one year ahead of him.
* As his father had before him, Reynolds was elected to a scholarship at Queens' College.
* Osborne Reynolds married Charlotte Jemima Chadwick (the daughter of Charles Chadwick, born about 1844) in Leeds on 22 July 1868.
* They had a son, also named Osborne (born in Rusholme, Lancashire in September 1869).
* Osborne Reynolds later married Annie Charlotte Wilkinson (born about 1860) in Leeds in 1882.
* In 1868 Reynolds became the first professor of engineering in Manchester (and the second in England).
* Reynolds applied for the position and, despite his youth and inexperience, was awarded the post.
* After 1873 Reynolds concentrated mainly on fluid dynamics and it was in this area that his contributions were of world leading importance.
* The 'Reynolds number' (as it is now called) used in modelling fluid flow which is named after him appears in this work.
* Reynolds became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1877 and, 11 years later, won their Royal Medal.
* By the beginning of the 1900s Reynolds health began to fail and he retired in 1905.
* Not only is Reynolds important in terms of his research, but he is also important for the applied mathematics course he set up at Manchester.
* Engineering education was new to English universities at that time, and Reynolds had definite ideas about its proper form.

Born 23 August 1842, Belfast, Ireland. Died 21 February 1912, Watchet, Somerset, England.
