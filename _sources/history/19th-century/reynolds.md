**Osborne Reynolds** was an Irish mathematician and physicist best known for introducing the Reynolds number classifying fluid flow.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of Reynolds number, which is widely used in the study of fluid flow and aerodynamics.
2. Developed the equations of motion describing the flow of non-Newtonian fluids, such as paint and syrup.
3. Established the application of dimensional analysis to engineering problems.
4. Made notable advances in the mathematics of turbulence, leading to a better understanding of its complex effects.
5. Pioneered the use of laboratory experiments in the study of hydrodynamics.
6. Discovered the concept of eddy viscosity, which is still used in computational fluid dynamics.
7. Developed the incompressible hydrodynamic equations for two-dimensional flow.
8. Introduced forced convection in fluid mechanics as an additional field of study.

Born 23 August 1842, Belfast, Ireland. Died 21 February 1912, Watchet, Somerset, England.
