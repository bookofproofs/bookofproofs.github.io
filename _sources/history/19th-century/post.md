**Emil Post** was a Polish-born American mathematician and logician who is best known for his work on polyadic groups, recursively enumerable sets, and degrees of unsolvability, as well as for his contribution to the unsolvability of problems in combinatorial mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published his seminal paper, Finite Combinatory Processes, which introduced the concept of computable functions in his doctoral dissertation.
2. Discovered the Post Correspondence Problem, which showed that a solution to a problem may not necessarily exist.
3. Developed the notion of hypercomputation, formulating the idea that a function could take an infinite number of steps to complete.
4. Proved that a restricted version of the halting problem is undecidable.
5. Formulated what is now known as Post's theorem, the finite variant of the Church–Turing thesis.
6. Established the concept of computable numbers, meaning any real number whose decimal expansion is calculable by a finite algorithm.
7. Explored the role of recursive functions in unsolvable problems.
8. Developed the idea of a tag system, which served as the basis of the first general purpose computer programming language.

Born 11 February 1897, Augustów, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 21 April 1954, New York, USA.
