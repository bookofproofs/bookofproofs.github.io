## Description 
About 10,000 years ago, the ice age went to an end as a major event for mankind. Many nomads decided to settle. In this time, different forms of craftsmanship developed, among others pottery, carpentry, or weaving. People began to trade with their products. 

Important inventions were made, for instance, the art to produce bronze as an alloy of copper (80-90%) and tin. All these developments created the need to express amounts and forms. These were the beginnings of mathematics.
