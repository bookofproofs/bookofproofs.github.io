**Gabriel Lamé** worked on a wide variety of different topics. His work on differential geometry and contributions to Fermat's Last Theorem are important. He proved the theorem for _n_ = 7.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Lamé theorem, which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the equation of the curvilinear coordinates of three-dimensional differential geometry to have a single-valued solution. 
2. Published the Traité des fonctions elliptiques (1829), an influential book on elliptic integrals which was an important part of the theory of Abelian functions. 
3. Proposed the idea of Lamé functions, which are parabolic cylinder functions used to solve linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients. 
4. Founded the first serious school of mathematical physics in France and published his only textbook, the Géométrie Delliptique (1837). 
5. Discovered the curvature properties of surfaces in elliptic and parabolic coordinates. 
6. Developed the Lamé parameters, which are important in solving certain types of differential equations. 
7. Formulated a useful version of Green's theorem. 
8. Proved Lagrange's planetary equation. 
9. Established a version of the law of continuity. 
10. Discovered the polar geodesic theorem.

Born 22 July 1795, Tours, France. Died 1 May1870, Paris, France.
