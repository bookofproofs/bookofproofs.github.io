**Jean-Robert Argand** was an amateur Swiss mathematician best known as one of the first to give a geometrical description of the Complex numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to recognize that complex numbers can be represented geometrically as points in a plane.
2. He developed a way of assigning a series of real numbers to complex numbers which formed the basis of the concept of a complex variable in calculus.
3. He constructed what is now known as an Argand diagram which allowed geometric representation of complex numbers.
4. He discovered the generalised law of quadratic reciprocity involving complex numbers.
5. He developed a theory of biquadratic residues which was built on the same principles as the General Law of Quadratic Reciprocity.
6. He was the first to use graphical methods to solve problems in algebra and other areas of mathematics.
7. He developed a method of analysing and manipulating complex numbers, using a new technique of extracting their real and imaginary parts.
8. He developed solution algorithms for certain equations, such as the equation for the area of a triangle, which had been previously unsolved.
9. He showed how the law of the lever can be applied to line integrals in the theory of analytical geometry.
10. He showed how derivatives and integrals of complex functions could be calculated using trigonometric functions.

Born (possibly) 18 July 1768, Geneva, Switzerland. Died (possibly) 13 August 1822, Paris, France.
