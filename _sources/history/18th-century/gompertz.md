**Benjamin Gompertz**  was an English self-educated mathematician and actuary, who is best known for his "law of mortality".

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Gompertz Law of Human Mortality, which explores the concept of mortality rates related to age with a mathematical model. 
2. Proposed a solution to the mathematical equation known as the “Gompertz curve” which explains the changing mortality rate with age. 
3. Wrote “Law of Human Life”, a book which showed the mathematical theory behind mortality rates, and used actuarial science to advance the understanding of life insurance and annuities.
4. Pioneered the use of calculus to calculate life expectancy.
5. Investigated the power of compound interest, credited by many to be an early form of compound interest. 
6. Developed a method to approximate the value of pi.
7. Formulated an equation to predict the growth of populations.

Born 5 March 1779, London, England. Died 14 July 1865, London, England.
