**Amélie Harlay** was a French astronomer who published navigational tables and catalogues of stars.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved an open problem in combinatorics, proving the cross-intersecting lemma and providing a bijective proof of its weakened version. 
2. Developed an algorithm to unify scrambled Rubik's Cubes, an accomplishment for which she received the 2013 European Science Prize for Youth.
3. Contributed to the mathematical understanding of graphings, triangulations, and making inferences from datasets.
4. Formulated a new formula for graph theory which resulted in around 200 journal publications.
5. Wrote several research papers on complex theoretical problems and has shared her insights with mathematicians in conferences around the world.
6. Was invited to speak at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2014.
7. Delivered a keynote speech at the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 2016.
8. Became the youngest person ever to win the ICM Emmy Noether Lecture in 2018.

Born 1768, Paris, France. Died 8 November 1832, Paris, France.
