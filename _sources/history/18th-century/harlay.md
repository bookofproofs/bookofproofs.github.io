**Amélie Harlay** was a French astronomer who published navigational tables and catalogues of stars.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* She was the daughter of Jean François Harlay (born 1730) and Anne Elisabeth Cany (born 1744) who were both teachers in Paris.
* Jérôme Lalande referred to Michel and Amélie as his nephew and niece.
* Before she married Michel, Amélie Harlay was also being taught astronomy techniques by Lalande, who quickly realised that Amélie was talented in learning mathematical techniques.
* Amélie and Michel were collaborating before their marriage; Michel was an expert observer and Amélie undertook large amounts of computational work which she was able to do with great accuracy and speed.
* In 1789, the year after Amélie married Michel Lefrançois, he became the director of the observatory of the École Militaire, succeeding Jérôme Lalande in that role.
* Amélie reduced the observations that her husband was making and the work she put into that task was quite outstanding, for example in one year she reduced 12000 observations, each single reduction requiring around 36 computations.
* Despite the remarkable amount of work contributed by Amélie, she was not listed as an author on any of the publications to which she contributed, even those which consisted mostly of tables she had calculated.
* Amélie and Michel Lefrançais de Lalande had four children.
* Amélie helped by teaching astronomical techniques to Dominique Cassini's son and helped him to make his first observations at the Collège de France.
* The tables were originally meant to be completed by a male colleague, Nicolas Maurice Chompré, but his work proved too slow on account of other obligations, and so Amélie created the horary tables.
* Despite her creation of the majority of this book, Amélie is not named on the title page.
* When Jérôme received an award for the book, he dedicated it to Amélie, hoping to provide her with a modicum of credit.
* Amélie Lefrançais de Lalande's work was also incorporated into Connaissance des temps Ⓣ(Knowledge of the times) which Lalande edited from 1794 until his death in 1807.
* We explained above that Amélie was fortunate since Lalande was a supporter of women astronomers.
* When we wrote our first biography of Amélie Harlay in 2008, we hoped to be able to find more information and improve our biography at a future date.
* We have now (2021) rewritten our biography, corrected it in line with the latest research, added many more references, and given further details of Amélie Harlay's life and work.
* Finally we note that Amélie's husband Michel Lefrançais was elected to the Bureau des Longitudes in 1795, to the Astronomy Section of the Academy of Sciences in 1801, and was made an officer of the Légion d'Honneur.
* As a woman, Amélie Lefrançais could not receive any such honours.

Born 1768, Paris, France. Died 8 November 1832, Paris, France.
