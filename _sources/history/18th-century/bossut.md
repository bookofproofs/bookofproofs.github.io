**Charles Bossut** was a French mathematician who was famed for his textbooks which were widely used throughout France.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Was the first to describe the application of probability theory to the calculus of variation.
2. Developed a mathematical explanation for the behavior of an elastic body subjected to an external force.
3. Discovered the principe of Virtual Work, which would be used as the basis of much of the mathematical study of structure and motion.
4. Discovered the theorem of parallel axes, providing a description of rotational inertia.
5. Found the mathematical relations necessary to calculate movements in the earth’s gravitational field.
6. Made significant contributions to the mathematical theories of vibrations and heat conduction.
7. Was the first to introduce the concept of determinants and first to develop a consistent algebraic notation for them.

Born 11 August 1730, Tartaras (near Rive de Gier), Rhône-et-Loire, France. Died 14 January 1814, Paris, France.
