**Charles Whish** was an English civil servant who worked for the East India Company. He was the first to bring to the notice of the western mathematical scholarship the achievements of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed rules of vector analysis which established vector operations as a systematic method of mathematical analysis. 
2. Developed the theory of discontinuous functions, leading to the development of Fourier's Series. 
3. Developed a theory on multiple integrals, making the application of calculus for solving impossibly complicated problems possible. 
4. Brought together the new innovations of mathematical analysis, unifying them into a single system and making complex complex multi-dimensional integrals accessible. 
5. Published a treatise on indefinite integrals which modified the principles of linear functions. 
6. Researched the theory of integral equations and developed powerful algorithms for their solution.
7. Discovered and elaborated upon the concept of linear differential equations, culminating in a publication of "The Theory of Differential Equations."
8. Discovered congruence properties of curves, providing a path for discoveries in mathematical geometry of the nineteenth century. 
9. Developed several theorems and gave a fundamental contribution to the mathematical concept of the calculus of variations. 
10. Explored the mathematical concept of the law of continuity and provided a powerful theory related to the boundaries of integrals.

Born 9 January 1795, Marylebone, London, England. Died 14 April 1833, Cuddapah, India.
