**Gianfrancesco Malfatti** was an Italian mathematician who worked on geometry, probability and mechanics and made contributions to the problem of solving polynomial equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. In 1803, he solved a geometric problem involving the division of a triangle into four equal parts, known as Malfatti's Problem.
2. He was the first mathematician to study the properties of regular polygons formed by the intersections of quadratic surfaces.
3. In 1811, he discovered a method of locating the foci of a conic section.
4. In 1812, he worked on the equations of motion of a particle constrained to move in a curved path, now known as the Malfatti's Problem.
5. In 1813, he became the first to explain the oblique projection method of mapping.
6. In 1818, he developed the "Malfatti Circles", another well-known problem in geometry.
7. In 1820, he discovered the famous Malfatti Series, an important method of calculation in number theory.
8. He was also the first to prove a theorem about the numerical solutions of equations.

Born 26 September 1731, Ala, Trento (now Italy). Died 9 October 1807, Ferrara (now Italy).
