**Johann(III) Bernoulli** wrote a number of works on astronomy and probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Bernoulli differential equation, a form of the second-order linear homogeneous differential equation and the first-order differential equation which bears his name.
2. Founded the calculus of variation, a branch of mathematics which applies the methods of calculus to determine the extreme values of a given function.
3. Proposed the generalized law of Newtonian gravitation, known as the Bernoulli's theorem. 
4. Established the law of large numbers and was soon after followed by Chebyshev's empirical law of probabilistic distribution, which became a key element of statistical theory.
5. Co-developed the calculus of finite differences and proposed an early form of Taylor's theorem.
6. Formulated the Eulerâ€“Bernoulli equation in 1750, a beam equation which describes the relationship between bending of a beam and its deflection. 
7. Worked on the theory of electricity, creating mathematical models for particle flow.
8. Proved the convergence of Newton's method for finding roots and solving equations.

Born 4 November 1744, Basel, Switzerland. Died 13 July 1807, Berlin, Germany.
