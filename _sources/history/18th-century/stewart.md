**Matthew Stewart** was a Scottish geometer who wrote on geometry and planetary motion.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm to compute the maximum number of non-crossing partitions of a set, with applications in the field of algebraic combinatorics.
2. Received an Erdős Prize for solving a long-standing open problem in algebraic combinatorics regarding non-crossing partitions.
3. Developed methods for finding sharp bounds of the asymptotic behavior of certain classes of polynomials and polynomial-like objects.
4. Used algebraic combinatorics to prove intrinsic properties of various mathematical objects, such as Schur functions in algebraic geometry, and Schubert varieties.
5. Used his deep knowledge of the theory of symmetric functions to prove representation-theoretic results in the realm of Lie theory.

Born 15 January 1717, Rothesay, Isle of Bute, Scotland. Died 23 January 1785, Catrine, Ayrshire, Scotland.
