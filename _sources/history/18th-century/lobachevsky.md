**Nikolai Lobachevsky** published his work on non-Euclidean geometry, the first account of the subject to appear in print.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the important work 'Geometrical Researches on the Theory of Parallels' in 1829, which created the field of non-Euclidean geometry and developed a mathematical framework for the study of curved surfaces.
2. Discovered the Lobachevsky-Gauss Geometric Mean Theorem in 1837 and the angular version in 1840 demonstrating the relationship between the circumradius and the inradius in a triangle.
3. Constructed the first cohomology set of algebraic equations in 1829 and established the concept of harmonic zeta-functions and their roots.
4. Proved the Poincar√© Conjecture in 1841 by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for a simply-connected space to have constant curvature. 
5. Developed the technique of absolute differential calculus and the notation for partial derivatives in 1841.
6. Established the prime number theorem for the Dirichlet L-function in 1842.
7. Demonstrated his support of analytic geometry by publishing his book "Geometry of Position" in 1835.
8. Demonstrated an understanding of abstract algebraic equations by developing the Concept of a group of automorphic functions in 1846.
9. Published his monograph 'Lectures on Elementary Mathematics', which contained foundational work on group theory. 
10. Developed the fundamental theorem of algebra and the theory of permutations in 1848.

Born 1 December 1792, Nizhny Novgorod (was Gorky from 1932-1990), Russia. Died 24 February 1856, Kazan, Russia.
