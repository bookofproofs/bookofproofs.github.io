**John Landen** was an English amateur mathematician who wrote on mechanics, summation of series and elliptic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* John trained to become a surveyor and practised that occupation in Peterborough from 1740 to 1762.
* Landen was never a professional mathematician and his interest in mathematics was for him a leisure activity.
* Lacroix discussed this work in Traité Du calcul différentiel where he stated that Landen was the first to present calculus in a purely algebraic setting.
* Landen's work appeared as A Short Discourse Concerning the Residual Analysis published in 1758 and, in a more complete form, in Residual analysis which was published in 1764.
* His ideas on this topic were later taken up by Lagrange although he describes Landen's contribution as an unsophisticated early attempt.
* Landen investigated the dilogarithm in 1760, about the same time as Euler, and introduced the trilogarithm.
* Landen wrote on dynamics, summation of series and an important transformation giving a relation between elliptic functions.
* Naturally, Landen's language is that of his time, in terms of fluents and fluxions, and his arguments are not rigorous in the modern sense.
* Applications of this result appeared in Landen's Mathematical memoirs of 1780.

Born 23 January 1719, Peakirk (near Peterborough), England. Died 15 January 1790, Milton (near Peterborough), England.
