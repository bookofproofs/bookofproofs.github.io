**John Landen** was an English amateur mathematician who wrote on mechanics, summation of series and elliptic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of a 'Landen transformation' which is a complex analysis technique used to solve algebraic equations.
2. Published a memoir in 1768 entitled "Institutiones calculi differentialis" which was the first work in differential calculus.
3. Was a pioneering figure in the area of analytical geometry, introducing the use of rectangular coordinates and the method of generating curves from equations.
4. Devised a new method for determining the next term of a converging series by using an infinite product, as well as several other series transformations. 
5. Pioneered the use of graphs to express changing data, such as in his book “New Analysis of the Figure of the Earth” in which he demonstrated the accuracy of his methods.
6. Pioneered the use of the 'number sequence' method to solve algebraic equations.
7. Contributed significantly to the development of the calculus of variations.
8. Developed a method of determining a numerical approximation to the area of a curve above the x-axis.

Born 23 January 1719, Peakirk (near Peterborough), England. Died 15 January 1790, Milton (near Peterborough), England.
