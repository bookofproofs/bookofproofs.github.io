**Jules Bienaymé** worked on statistics and probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However, he did not use the name, always using the name Jules.
* We note that his father used the spelling Bienaimé as did Jules until 1812 when he changed the spelling to Bienaymé.
* They had two children; Irenée Jules (the subject of this biography) was born at the rue de la Loi (now called rue de Richelieu) and his brother Charles Philippe Aimé was born on 4 February 1800.
* Jules attended the Lycée impérial at Bruges and the city had happy memories for him.
* In 1811 the Bienaimé family returned to Paris where Jules attended the Lycée Louis-le-Grand.
* Both brothers changed the spelling of their name to Bienaymé early in 1812.
* After taking part in the defence of Paris in 1814, Jules Bienaymé entered the École Polytechnique in the following year.
* Also in 1816 Jean Charles Bienaimé died and, as Jules became responsible for the family, he took a job at the Ministry of Finances.
* In 1819 Bienaymé, wanting to make a career in science rather than administration, became a lecturer in mathematics at the military academy of St Cyr.
* There do seem to be more reasons why he left and one seems related to Siméon Denis Poisson, who had chosen him for the post, for from that time on Bienaymé became openly hostile to him.
* In the late 1820s, rather remarkably, the Bienaymé brothers married two sisters.
* Jules married Frangoise Gabrielle Clemence Harmand and his brother Charles Philippe Aimé married Jeanne Justine Lucie Harmand.
* Their wives were daughters of the Philippe Nicolas Harmand who was a family friend and had signed Jules' birth certificate.
* They had long known each other for the Bienaymé and Harmand families had shared the same house in Paris for a while.
* Jules and his wife had two sons and three daughters, The children, in order of birth, were: Lilia Nathalie Françoise Laure, Lucie Gabrielle Léonie (born 4 September 1831), Arthur François Alphonse (born 13 January 1834), Louis Irenée Alexis (born 8 April 1836), and Adrienne Clementine Laure (born 19 June 1840).
* After the revolution of 1848 Bienaymé was forced to retire from the Ministry of Finances for political reasons as the new regime installed their own people in top posts.
* In 1852 Bienaymé was elected to the Paris Academy of Sciences and for the next 23 years he was the referee for the statistics prize.
* In fact Bienaymé only published 23 articles during his life and half of these were published in obscure places such as the L'Institut.
* Bienaymé supported Laplace on this issue.
* In fact Bienaymé supported Laplace in general since it was Laplace's Théorie analytique des probabilités Ⓣ(Analytic theory of probabilities) (1812) that was the biggest influence on Bienaymé's scientific thinking throughout his life.
* An excellent linguist, Bienaymé translated Pafnuty Chebyshev's work from Russian into French.
* In fact Bienaymé was a friend of Chebyshev (they first met in October 1852), and also of other important mathematicians such as Adolphe Quetelet, Antoine Cournot and Gabriel Lamé.
* In fact Quetelet and Bienaymé were born in the same year and corresponded regularly between 1846 (the year in which they first met) and 1871.
* On the other side, there were a number of mathematicians who Bienaymé seems particularly keen to criticise, such as Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Siméon Poisson and Joseph Bertrand.
* Bienaymé was quite wrong in his criticism of Poisson but in general he was years ahead of his time in the depth of his statistical ideas.
* Bienaymé published the Bienaymé-Chebyshev inequality, which was used to give a very simple and precise demonstration of the generalised law of large numbers, in his important paper Considérations à l'appui de la découverte de Laplace sur la loi de probabilité dans la méthode des moindres carrés Ⓣ(Considerations to support the discovery of Laplace on the probability distribution in the least squares method) (1853).
* Possibly the Inequality was regarded by Bienaymé as a minor result compared with his main themes of linear least squares and Laplacian defence.
* Bienaymé also worked on independent binomial trials and his most important contribution was his statement of the criticality theorem for simple branching processes which he gave in 1845 - eventual extinction of a family name has probability one if and only if the mean number of male children is one or less.

Born 28 August 1796, Paris, France. Died 19 October 1878, Paris, France.
