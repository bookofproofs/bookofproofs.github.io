**Jules Bienaymé** worked on statistics and probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Bienaymé-Chebyshev Inequality, which gives a precise lower bound to the probability that the sum of independent random variables exceed a given threshold. 
2. Established the first known criterion for determining whether a given sequence of numbers is harmonic or not. 
3. Was one of the first to discover the uniqueness of the normal distribution.
4. Developed a theorem which links the variance of a probability distribution and its mean. 
5. Developed a means for testing the randomness of a sequence. 
6. Introduced the concept of a Chebyshev's Constant and calculated its value. 
7. Developed the Central Limit Theorem, a fundamental theorem of probability theory. 
8. Established a theorem which could be used to estimate the expectation by dividing the sum of products of a random variable and its probability. 
9. Developed the Bienaymé-Galton-Watson theorem which describes the distribution of sizes of populations under certain conditions. 
10. Developed an algorithm for determining the lowest cost methods for distribution of commodities between multiple points.

Born 28 August 1796, Paris, France. Died 19 October 1878, Paris, France.
