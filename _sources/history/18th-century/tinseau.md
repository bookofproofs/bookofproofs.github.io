**Charles Tinseau** was a French mathematician who wrote on the theory of surfaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a calculus textbook for French students based on the works of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, helping to popularize calculus in France.
2. Developed an early version of the principle of least squares with the help of mathematicians Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Adrien-Marie Legendre.
3. Able to convert measurements from the traditional French units to the more modern metric system, which was a critical development in the history of mathematics.
4. Co-invented the tricolor roundabout, a mechanical device used to determine how surfaces intersect.
5. Applied mathematics and physics to the study of projectiles, particularly to the development of a superior type of cannon.
6. Illustrated the physical nature of the three-body problem in celestial mechanics, which turned into an important theoretical physics and mathematics subject.
7. Used geometrical methods to solve equations of degrees greater than two, setting a standard for algebraic equations. 
8. Pioneered methods of analytical geometry which enabled the modern definition of a differential equation.

Born 19 April 1748, Besan√ßon, France. Died 21 March 1822, Montpellier, France.
