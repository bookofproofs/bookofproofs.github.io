**Samuel Vince** came from a working class family but, with the support of several priests, was able to study the mathematical tripos at Cambridge and he was Senior Wrangler in 1775. He wrote many works on mathematics, physics and astronomy. He was Plumian professor of astronomy and experimental philosophy at Cambridge for 25 years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Samuel Vince developed a system of conic sections with two variable equations in 1793. 
2. He discovered a criterion which could determine if a cubic equation had a solution. 
3. He developed a method to solve equations with fractional coefficients. 
4. He invented a method for solving equations of arbitrary order. 
5. He formulated the binomial theorem in a general form and solved cubic equations using the method of Lagrange. 
6. He successfully demonstrated the eccentricities of cometary orbits. 
7. He developed new theories of integration that provided greater accuracy of measurement. 
8. He developed an algebraic representation of geometry for curves of the second and third order. 
9. He demonstrated the divergence of consecutive harmonic means, a demonstration of an infinite series. 
10. He developed an iterative method for calculating the roots of cubic and quartic equations.

Born 6 April 1749, Fressingfield, Suffolk, England. Died 28 November 1821, Ramsgate, Kent, England.
