**C V Mourey** was a French mathematician who is known solely from one work in which he introduces the ideas of complex numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Central Limit Theorem of Probability Theory, generalizing the theorem which Gauss had shown to be true in the special case of the normal distribution.
2. Developed an important method of calculating the expectation and variance of a linear combination of random variables.
3. Discovered a mathematical equivalent to the traditional Fourier Series, leading to what is known as the Fourier Series Of A Random Variable.
4. Developed a general theory of correlation and regression which includes both linear and nonlinear regression.
5. Proved the Law of Iterated Logarithm, which has immense importance in the theory of probability.
6. Formulated a new interpretation of probability theory which reconciles both the classical and the modern view of probability.
7. Discovered Lyapunov's theorem which explains the local stability of linear systems.
8. Researched and published many important papers on probability, statistics, and mathematical economics.
9. Contributed to the development of mathematical models used in economic planning and analysis.
10. Developed differential equations used in the field of mathematical physics.

Born possibly 1791, Valay, Haute-SÃ¢one, France. Died possibly 1830, Paris, France.
