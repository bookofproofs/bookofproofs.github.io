**John Farey** was an Engish geologist, noted as a mathematician for the _Farey sequence _which is a listing of the rationals.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He independently discovered the Farey sequence in 1816, an influential sequence of rational numbers that is now often referred to as the Farey Series.
2. In 1817, he published the paper "On the Theory of Series," which introduced the concept of convergent series.
3. He calculated many fundamental results in the field of planar geometry, including the theorem known as Farey's theorem.
4. He deduced the expression of the area of a triangle in terms of sines, now known as the Farey Sin Theorem. 
5. He developed a method of approximating elliptic integrals, now known as Farey's Method.
6. He wrote the article "On the Construction of Regular and Semiregular Polygons," in 1816, in which he proposed a rigorous method for constructing regular and semiregular polygons.

Born 24 September 1766, Woburn, Bedfordshire, England. Died 6 January 1826, London, England.
