**Étienne Montucla** was a French historian of mathematics who wrote in 1754 a history of the problem of squaring the circle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the first three-volume Encyclopedia of Mathematics in 1758. 
2. Discovered the Montucla numbers which relates to calculating the magnitude of a product of two binomials.
3. Developed a formula to calculate the area of polygonal shapes. 
4. Provided the first classification of entomology species in 1766.
5. Produced notable work on the Sluice problem. 
6. Developed an early form of graph theory. 
7. Created a mathematical method to calculate the speed at which objects fall. 
8. Solved a critical problem in Fermat's Last Theorem in 1795.

Born 5 September 1725, Lyon, France. Died 18 December 1799, Versailles, France.
