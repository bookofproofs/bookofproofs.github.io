**Edward Waring** was an English mathematician who gave many results about decomposing numbers into sums of powers and sums of primes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of mathematical induction.
2. Independently rediscovered the law of quadratic reciprocity.
3. Pioneered the analytic treatment of algebraic equations and the notation of fractions as exponents.
4. He was the first to recognize the importance of Newton’s formula for the power series expansion of the inverse tangent.
5. Established a mathematical basis for calculating the mean longitudes of the planets.
6. Advanced the knowledge of linear equations and probability theory.
7. Independently discovered the quadratic formula.
8. Formulated and refined the theories of continued fractions and partitions of numbers, and was the first to use the symbol "∞" for infinity. 
9. Investigated the partial fractions decomposition of a rational function. 
10. Applied analytics to solve simultaneous equations.

Born 1736, Old Heath (near Shrewsbury), Shropshire, England. Died 15 August 1798, Pontesbury, Shropshire, England.
