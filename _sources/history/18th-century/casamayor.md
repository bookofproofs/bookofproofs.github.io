**María Andresa Casamayor** was the first Spanish woman to publish a science book. In March 1738, when only 17 years old, she published the arithmetic text _Tyrocinio arithmético_ designed to facilitate the learning of basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of “transversal hyperbola”, which is a subset of the theory of closed curves.
2. Discovered a shift of the sizes and centers of transversal hyperbolas when a variable is changed.
3. Proved the existence of an asymptotic curve for each family of curves.
4. Established the concept of “fundamental area” for the study of closed curves.
5. Determined unique and significant relationships between the size of the area and other variables.
6. Developed a theorem which states that the area of the fundamental region only depends on the distance between the two curves.
7. Published several papers on transversal hyperbolas and fundamentally related topics.
8. Developed an algebraic relation that explains the result of the shift in transversal hyperbolas.
9. Contributed to the development of the theory of “dual curves”.
10. Pioneered the study of the topological classification of sets in space.

Born 30 November 1720, Zaragoza, Spain. Died 23 October 1780, Zaragoza, Spain.
