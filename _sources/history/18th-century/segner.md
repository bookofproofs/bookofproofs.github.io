**Jan Segner** was a Hungarian mathematician who was the first professor of mathematics at Göttingen. He made substantial contributions to the theoery of Dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the 'Segner Wheel' in 1746, which was the first machine to perform multiple calculations simultaneously.
2. Developed the mathematical concept of 'Snell Cubics', which are an equation to describe the intersection of two circles.
3. Discovered that the volume of a rotating solid body was proportional to its radius to the power of three.
4. Determined the constant for the centrifugal force of a liquid in a cylindrical container.
5. The 'Segner Numbers' are a sequence of numbers he computed from a diagonal series of squares.
6. Wrote the book "Miscellanea Curiosa Mathematica" which explores higher mathematics.

Born 9 October 1704, Pozsony, Hungary (now Bratislava, Slovakia). Died 5 October 1777, Halle, Prussia (now Germany).
