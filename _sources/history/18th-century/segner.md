**Jan Segner** was a Hungarian mathematician who was the first professor of mathematics at Göttingen. He made substantial contributions to the theoery of Dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* There is genuine reason for both German and Hungarian versions, for Segner was from a family of German origins, and although he spent about 25 years of his life in Hungary he spent most of his career in Germany.
* Segner attended school at Pozsony's Lyceum where he showed special talents for medicine and mathematics.
* Segner's was therefore the first to fill what was to become one of the foremost chairs of mathematics in the world.
* In 1743 Segner was put in charge of the construction of the university observatory which was finished in 1751.
* While at Göttingen Segner discovered that every solid body has three axes of symmetry.
* In 1751 Segner introduced the concept of the surface tension of liquids and made an unsuccessful attempt to give a mathematical description of capillary action.

Born 9 October 1704, Pozsony, Hungary (now Bratislava, Slovakia). Died 5 October 1777, Halle, Prussia (now Germany).
