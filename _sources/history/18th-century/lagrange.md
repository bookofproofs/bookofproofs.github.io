**Joseph-Louis Lagrange** was an Italian-born French mathematician who excelled in all fields of analysis and number theory and analytical and celestial mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Lagrangian method, a powerful tool for solving variational problems.
2. Set the foundation of calculus of variations by introducing the calculus of variations of a single integral.
3. Played a prominent role in the formulation of modern classical mechanics.
4. Devised the Langrange multiplier method for constrained optimization.
5. Formulated a closed expression for the solution of polynomials of the fourth and higher orders.
6. Developed a novel approach called the method of finite differences.
7. Developed the Eulerâ€“Lagrange equation, which helps to determine the motion/equilibrium of dynamical systems.
8. Used the ideas of calculus of variations to analyze the motion of a fluid.
9. Developed a new framework of analytical mechanics.
10. Made important contributions in the field of algebra.

Born 25 January 1736, Turin, Sardinia-Piedmont (now Italy). Died 10 April 1813, Paris, France.
