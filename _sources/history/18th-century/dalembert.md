**Jean d'Alembert** was a a French mathematician who was a pioneer in the study of differential equations and their use of in physics. He studied the equilibrium and motion of fluids.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the wave equation for a vibrating string in 1747.
2. Wrote Traité de dynamique (1743) which contains his principle of virtual work.
3. Was the first to apply calculus of variations to problems in physics, astronomy, and engineering.
4. Proposed the hypothesis that the pressure exerted by a column of liquid is constant across all levels.
5. Developed the method of infinite series and was the first to recognize that each new increment tends toward a limit, now known as the limiting value theorem.
6. Was one of the first mathematicians to conceive of differential equations and his work in this field set the stage for the development of calculus.
7. His Essai d'une nouvelle théorie de la rotation des corps (1747-1760) was the first work to be able to clearly explain rotation in terms of geometric concepts.
8. Developed the theory of probability and game theory.
9. Contributed extensively to the fields of mechanics, hydrodynamics, analysis, mechanics, and astronomy.
10. Perfected and generalized the notion of the limit of functions and the derivatives.

Born 17 November 1717, Paris, France. Died 29 October 1783, Paris, France.
