**Ruan Yuan** was a Chinese scholar who wrote biographies of astronomers and mathematicians.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He made significant contributions to the development of theories related to mathematics, such as the binomial theorem, the theory of circles, the theory of conics, and the theory of equations.
2. He wrote the influential treatise "Jin Yong Te Zi" which was a comprehensive work on the theory of circles.
3. He was the first Chinese person to attempt to calculate the Square Root of 2.
4. He further developed work on the calculation of pi and its use in trigonometry.
5. He was the founder of the mathematical society Fushu Xuehui, which was said to have been the first of its kind in China.
6. He assisted the scholars of Emperor Daoguang in their development of the Imperial Calendar, including but not limited to calculation of lunar eclipses.
7. He edited and expanded an existing work by Cao Shaoqin on computation of the Volume of a Sphere and Cylinder.
8. He was the first person to use the Law of Excluded Middle in a Chinese mathematical reference.

Born 21 February 1764, Yangzhou, Jiangsu province, China. Died 27 November 1849, Yangzhou, Jiangsu province, China.
