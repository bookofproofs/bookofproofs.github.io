**Patrick d'Arcy** was an Irish mathematician and soldier who studied in France and made original contributions to dynamics. He is best known for his part in the discovery of the _principle of angular momentum_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the treatise “The Theory of Mechanics” which was a comprehensive exposition of the core principles of mechanics.
2. Developed the concept of virtual velocity, which improved upon Isaac Newton’s concept of dynamics. 
3. Contributed to the development of Lagrangian mechanics and the principle of least action. 
4. Utilized fundamental insights from integral calculus to further Newtonian mechanics.
5. Demonstrated strong skills in the areas of geometry and analytical mechanics.
6. Established a general mathematical theory of wave motion.
7. Researched dynamics for liquids and gases, extending the wave theory of Pierre-Simon Laplace.
8. Explained how light travelling through properties of space and time can modify the view of how the universe works.

Born 27 September 1725, Kiltullagh near Athenry, County Galway, Ireland. Died 18 October 1779, Paris, France.
