**Gabriel Cramer** worked on analysis and determinants. He is best known for his formula for solving simultaneous equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the mathematical concept of Cramer's Rule, a method to solve systems of linear equations.
2. Founded a mathematical society in Switzerland, which supervised the teaching of mathematics and influenced the course of mathematical instruction in the country.
3. Published the first comprehensive book on number theory, entitled Introduction to Algebra.
4. Developed the Cramer-Euler method, a technique for solving polynomial equations.
5. Discovered the fundamental laws of elliptic integrals.
6. Solved the quintic equation, a significant advance in algebra.
7. Developed a unified theory of integration and investigated application of the calculus of variations.
8. Discovered a classical result in geometry, known as Cramer’s Theorem.

Born 31 July 1704, Geneva, Switzerland. Died 4 January 1752, Bagnols-sur-Cèze, France.
