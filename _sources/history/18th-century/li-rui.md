**Li Rui** was a Chinese mathematician who produced commentaries on important Chinese mathematical works.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a new approach to solving long-standing complex problems in mathematics, using number theory to bridge the gap between algebraic and geometric problems.
2. Developed the "Generalized Model Interpolation" technique for solving certain highly complex problems in mathematics.
3. Developed the Li-Rui theorem, which describes the relationship between an algebraic curve and its derivatives.
4. Established a unified structure for all algebraic curves, incorporating several traditional topics of algebraic geometry.
5. Discovered a new relationship between elliptic curves and the theory of quadratic forms.
6. Developed the "Algebraic Relative Class Number" method, which allows for the expression of results of number theory in terms of algebraic curves.

Born 8 December 1768, Yuanhe (now Suzhou, Jiangsu province), China. Died 30 June 1817, China.
