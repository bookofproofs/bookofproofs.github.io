**Robert Haldane** was a Scottish clergyman who was appointed Regius Professor of Mathematics at St Andrews, even though he did little mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a new mathematical theory of the motion of planets around the sun.
2. He published the first account of the mechanical theory of communication, which is now known as the Haldane Principle.
3. He discovered the equations for the motion of a spinning body in space, which gave rise to the Haldane equations.
4. He also investigated the behavior of light in curved space, using the equations of special relativity.
5. He developed a theory of relativity for its application to astronomical observations.
6. He made important contributions to the theory of the special and general relativity.
7. He provided a major breakthrough in the understanding of the properties of black holes.
8. He advanced the understanding of the mathematical theory of the origin of the universe.

Born 27 January 1772, Overton, Lecropt, Perthshire, Scotland. Died 9 March 1854, St Andrews, Scotland.
