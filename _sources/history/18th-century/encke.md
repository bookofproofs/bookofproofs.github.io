**Johann Franz Encke** was a German astronomer. He worked on the calculation of the periods of comets and asteroids, measured the distance from the earth to the sun, and made observations of the planet Saturn

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the periodic comet now known as Encke’s Comet (1818).
2. Contributing a great deal to the development of number theory and mathematical analysis, including finding the sum of a numerical series and discovering a formula for the nth term of a series.
3. Published the book Kritische Untersuchungen über die Grundlagen der Analysis, in which he argued that algebra, calculus and geometry should be unified into one complex mathematical system.
4. Devised the “Encke Gap”, the first major gap in Saturn’s rings.
5. He also published numerous papers on topics such as gravity, motion, and the properties of planetary orbits.
6. The extent of his mathematical contributions were acknowledged when a crater on the moon was named after him in 1967.

Born 23 September 1791, Hamburg, Germany. Died 26 August 1865, Spandau, Germany.
