**Olinthus Gregory**  was an English mathematician, author and editor. He was one of the founders of the Royal Astronomical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Gregory's series, a special infinite series which converges to π.
2. Appointed a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh in 1747.
3. Published the first mathematical book written in English on geometry, mechanics, and optics.
4. Invented the combination of a cylinder with an inverted cone, known now as the Gregory-Chebyshev form.
5. Founded the first mathematical journal published in Britain.
6. Developed a method for approximating function roots which became known as the 'Gregory-Newton Forward Interpolation.'
7. Discovered the concept of doubly periodic functions in complex analysis.
8. Co-invented the Taylor series method and laid the foundations for the Calculus of Finite Differences.
9. Founded the Lunar Society of Birmingham, a prominent group of scientific and industrial innovators.
10. Developed a system of spherical trigonometry, which was the basis of John Landen's work on the ‘Great Theorem’.

Born 29 January 1774, Yaxley, Huntingdonshire (now Cambridgeshire), England. Died 2 February 1841, Woolwich, near London, England.
