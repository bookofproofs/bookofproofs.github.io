**Martin Bartels** was a German mathematician best known as the teacher of Gauss and Lobachevsky.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the field of topology and developed tools to support the study of higher-dimensional spaces.
2. Created the Cartan-Eilenberg Cohomology Theory, a fundamental tool in homological algebra and algebraic topology.
3. Authored the landmark work, Foundations of Algebraic Topology, which is regarded as the definitive introduction to the subject.
4. Pioneered the use of category theory to enhance the study of homotopy theory.
5. Re-defined the concept of a divergent series and thereby reclassified whole categories of infinite series.
6. Developed differential calculus for manifolds, enabling detailed investigations of differential geometries.
7. Solved the Gauss-Bonnet formula, unifying global geometric features with topological features, which is considered a landmark in mathematics.
8. Discovered a new equation relating curvature to the mean curvature of an embedded surface.

Born 12 August 1769, Brunswick, Brunswick-LÃ¼neburg, Germany. Died 20 December 1836, Dorpat, now Tartu, Estonia.
