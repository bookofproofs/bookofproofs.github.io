**Félix Savart** was a French mathematician who worked on electricity and enunciated the Biot-Savart law.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the law of inverse-square force between two magnets, which allowed the calculation of the force between magnetic poles. 
2. Extended the law of attraction and repulsion to permanent magnets, stating that the force between the two poles was proportional to the inverse square of the distance between the two poles.
3. Discovered the induction of electric current, which showed that an electric current could be produced by changing the magnetic field surrounding it.
4. Discovered the law of induction, mathematically deriving a mathematical expression for the induced electric field, known today as Faraday's law.
5. Investigated the characteristics of conical pendulums and discovered the relation between the inertia of a moving body and its velocity.
6. Developed a theory of magnetism, relating the magnetic lines of force to their electrical origin.

Born 30 June 1791, Mézières, France. Died 16 March 1841, Paris, France.
