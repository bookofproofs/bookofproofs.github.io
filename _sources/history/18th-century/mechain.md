**Pierre Méchain** undertook surveys to produce maps and also worked in astronomy where he is particularly famed as a discoverer of comets.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He accurately calculated several trigonometric functions in his work on fractional parts of degrees.
2. He used his new tables of sines and tangents to calculate the size of the Earth by accurately measuring two arcs from Dunkirk to Barcelona in 1792.
3. He was the first person to measure the length of an arc of a meridian (now known as the Méchain–Delambre meridian arc) in order to establish the size and shape of the Earth.
4. He acquired important skills in ballistics and was given the assignment of constructing a survey of Spain's northern coastline, a task he fulfilled with precision.
5. He was appointed as a member of the Bureau des Longitudes in 1793.
6. He used advanced mathematical equations in order to calculate the orbits of comets.
7. He was responsible for calculating the duration and intensity of eclipses.
8. He measured the parallax of stars, thereby leading to the determination of distances of stars.
9. He was a pioneer in determining exact units of measurement.
10. He developed the Meridian Arc method in order to calculate the circumference of the Earth.

Born 16 August 1744, Laon, France. Died 20 September 1804, Castellón de la Plana, Spain.
