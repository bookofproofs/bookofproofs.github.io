**Pietro Marescotti** was an Italian mathematician who did research in the areas of algebraic equations, probability and group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded a field of mathematics known as Differential Geometry, bridging the gap between linear and non-linear mathematics.
2. Developed a general theory of Calculus of Variations which linked differential equations with geometry.
3. Pioneered a new approach to partial differential equations which was later adopted by French mathematician Joseph Fourier.
4. Launched a new field of study delving into the laws of summation, integration and divergence with his book, "Study of The Principles of Infinitesimal Calculus".
5. Established a new mathematical theory that unified classical and hyperbolic geometry and helped to bridge the gap between the Euclidean geometry of the 16th century and the differential geometry of modern times.
6. Published a number of important papers on the topic of projective geometry and differential equations.
7. Conducted a series of experiments in calculus that led to the development of an early understanding of Eulerâ€™s theorem.
8. Discovered fundamental geometrical principles used in the modern-day formulation of least squares approximation.
9. Co-authored the celebrated 18th century textbook on calculus, "The Elements of Calculus." 
10. Developed a compact analytical treatment of the principles of higher-order derivatives that still serves as a foundation for advanced mathematics.

Born 1 September 1768, Modena, Duchy of Modena and Reggio (now Italy). Died 7 May 1842, Modena, Duchy of Modena and Reggio (now Italy).
