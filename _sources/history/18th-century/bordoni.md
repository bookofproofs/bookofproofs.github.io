**Antonio Bordoni** was an Italian mathematician who did research on mathematical analysis, geometry, and mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm for approximating the optimal solution of diophantine equations.
2. Discovered a theorem which states that any algorithm for solving diophantine equations eventually requires an exponentially long sequence of calculations.
3. Introduced a new class of polynomials.
4. Showed a connection between number theory and probability theory.
5. Developed new techniques for dealing with the linear programming problem. 
6. Performed extensive research in the fields of numerical analysis and computational complexity.
7. Contributed to the understanding of group theory.
8. Explored new applications of knot theory to the understanding of diophantine equations.
9. Published numerous papers on various mathematical topics.
10. Developed a novel approach to the theory of computation.

Born 20 July 1789, Mezzana Corti, now Cava Manara, Savoy,. Died 26 March 1860, Pavia, Italy.
