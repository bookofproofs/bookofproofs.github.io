**Antonio Bordoni** was an Italian mathematician who did research on mathematical analysis, geometry, and mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* At the time Bordoni was born the town belonged to Savoy.
* During his time at the military school Bordoni published a number of mathematical works including: 
  * "Memorie matematiche: 1, sopra le trasformazioni delle equazioni: Sopra l'integrazione delle equazioni a differenze finite e parziali delle funzioni a piu variabili" Ⓣ(Mathematical Memoirs: 1, the transformation of the equation: On the integration of equations in finite differences and partial of the more variable functions) (1808); 
  * "Nuovo rapporto tra la teoria del centro di gravita e quella della composizione delle forze" Ⓣ(New relationship between the theory of the centre of gravity and the composition of forces) (1810); 
  * "Memoria matematica dedicata al sig. dottor Vincenzo Brunacci ..." (1810)
  * "Sopra l'equilibrio di un poligono qualunque" Ⓣ (1814); 
  * "Nuovi teoremi di meccanica elementare" Ⓣ (1815); 
  * "Dell'ombra del toro, dell'ovolo dello spaccato di una volta emisferica e della scozia" Ⓣ (1815); and 
  * "De' contorni delle ombre ordinarie" Ⓣ (1816).
* At Pavia, Bordoni joined the other Chairs in Mathematics, namely Marchesi in Architecture, Lotteri in Preliminary Calculus, and Gratognini in Mechanics, Statics, Hydrodynamics, Hydraulics (Applied Mathematics).
* Bordoni began to study differential geometry as early as the 1820s.
* When Bordoni was appointed to the University of Pavia, Mathematics was part of the Faculty of Philosophy.
* In 1854 Bordoni was elected Director of Mathematical Studies and, in 1859, he tried again to make major changes to the structure of Mathematics, in particular emphasising the further development of advanced courses in Civil Engineering.
* In February 1860, Bordoni was appointed as a senator but died one month later.
* He was also honoured more than twenty years after his death when the Istituto Tecnico Bordoni, established in Pavia in 1861, was named after Bordoni in 1882.
* Among Bordoni's students at Pavia were Felice Casorati, who became his assistant after graduating in 1856.
* Brioschi was appointed professor of applied mathematics at the University of Pavia in 1852, becoming Bordoni's colleague.
* Luigi Cremona was also taught by Bordoni when a student of Civil Engineering at Pavia beginning in 1849.

Born 20 July 1789, Mezzana Corti, now Cava Manara, Savoy,. Died 26 March 1860, Pavia, Italy.
