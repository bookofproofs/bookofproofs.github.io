**Félix Savary** worked on electromagnetism and electrodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Savary also served as librarian at the Bureau des Longitudes from 1823 to 1829.
* Savary also developed a theorem (named after him) on the curvature of a roulette, the curve traced out by a point on a fixed curve which rolls on a second curve.
* The star x Ursae Majoris is a double star and Savary demonstrated that the two stars move in elliptical orbits with the centre of gravity at the focus of the ellipses.
* Priority in that field, however, must go to Savary, who gave, in Connaissance des Temps for 1830 (which according to its title page was published in 1827), a description of a method of calculating orbits for double stars.
* In fact, Sir John Herschel, whose orbit was, on his own admission, not nearly such a good match, complained with good reason that Savary had cheated - not Sir John's word: that is my précis of the gentlemanly circumlocution that occupies nearly a whole page (his paragraph 64) - by choosing to solve data that were only approximately the observed ones!

Born 4 October 1797, Paris, France. Died 15 July 1841, Estagel (near Perpignan), Franc.
