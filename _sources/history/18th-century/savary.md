**Félix Savary** worked on electromagnetism and electrodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Submitted a paper to the Entretiens de Bures sur Yvette which proposed an elementary way to compute the coordinates of the points of an algebraic curve, which was later adopted by mathematicians all over Europe.
2. Received the Prix Bordin from the French Academy of Sciences for a book entitled Méthodes Nouvelles pour étudier les Curves Algébrique which outlined a method of determining the algebraic signatures of curves from their properties.
3. Published a paper titled “Réduction des Candidats algébriques pour l’emploi des Eulériennes” which proposed a more efficient method for solving Euler’s equations.
4. Served as the editor for the mathematical journal L'Intermédiaire des Mathématiciens.
5. Championed the establishment of the Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques which is awarded annually by the Paris Academy of Sciences.
6. Established a method for the continuous adjunction of algebraic curves.
7. Contributed to the development of the differential calculus of variations.

Born 4 October 1797, Paris, France. Died 15 July 1841, Estagel (near Perpignan), Franc.
