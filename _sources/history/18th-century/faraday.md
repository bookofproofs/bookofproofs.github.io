**Michael Faraday** was an English physicist whose discoveries in electricity had an enormous influence on the development of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Development of the concept of potential difference, or voltage, in electricity.
2. Invention of the electric motor, which demonstrated the intimate connection between electricity and magnetism.
3. Discovery of electromagnetic induction, which revolutionized the study of electricity and magnetism.
4. Investigation and description of single phosphate grains as well as their behavior under the influence of electric field.
5. Invention of the Faraday cage, which could carry out experiments without interference from external electric currents.
6. Analysis of the laws of electrolysisâ€”providing insights into the relationship between the mass, charge, and electrical conductance of certain substances.
7. Discovery of the strong magneto-optic effect, which is highly important in modern magnetic recording and data storage technologies.
8. Proposal of Faraday's law of induction, which provided new insights into the behavior of circuits under an applied voltage.

Born 22 September 1791, Newington Butts, Surrey (now London) England. Died 25 August 1867, Hampton Court, Middlesex, England.
