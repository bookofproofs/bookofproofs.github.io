3. Played a significant role in introducing modern mathematics to Japan.
4. Co-wrote Japan's very first calculus textbook.
5. Introduced the term "elliptic integral" to the western mathematical community.
6. Home-reared a group of mathematicians who went on to make tremendous contributions in the Japanese mathematical research community.
7. Pioneer of the construction of infinitesimal calculus in Japan.
8. Developed literal expressions for Abelian integrals.
9. One of the first to introduce Leibniz's differential calculus to Japan.
