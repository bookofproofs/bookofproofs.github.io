**Naonobu Ajima** was a Japanese mathematician and astronomer who developed a theory of integration.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ajima was over thirty years of age before he began his studies with Yamaji.
* While studying with him, Ajima wrote books on astronomy and helped his teacher to compile an almanac.
* It was only after Yamaji's death that Ajima began to write works on mathematics.
* The book had a preface written in 1799, one year after Ajima's death, by Kasawa Makoto, one of his students.
* Kasawa was a fine mathematician and he succeeded Ajima as a master of the Seki school.
* He was certainly not Ajima's only star pupil for there were also excellent mathematicians such as Masatoda Baba and Hiroyasu Sakabe who continued the tradition of the Seki school.
* Ajima's work went towards geometry despite the strong algebraic numerical tradition in the Seki school.
* Ajima refined the method subdividing the chord of an arc into equal small segments, so producing a method similar to that of the definite integral.
* Immediately after developing this method of integration, Ajima developed a method for computing volumes by double integration.
* This book introduced logarithms into Japan and it is clear that Ajima had read the work since he uses some of the same notation in his own work on logarithms.
* Let us look at two particular problems solved by Ajima.
* Although his solution was unpublished, nevertheless Ajima became famous for his work on this problem.
* Ajima's remarkable achievement was to reduce this to an equation of degree 10.
* A year after this fine achievement, Ajima was promoted to hold the position of "gun bugyou" or "country magistrate".
* It is today called the Malfatti Problem since it was posed in 1803 by Gian Francesco Malfatti, but Ajima's contributions were made around 30 years earlier.
* It is precisely the problem of maximising the area of the three mutually tangent circles that Ajima solved in Fukyu sampo.
* This, of course, is not relevant to Ajima's problem which is only posed in terms of maximising the area of three non-overlapping mutually tangent circles.
* After Ajima's death, he was buried in the Jorin-jo Temple, Mita, Tokyo, and his grave can still be visited today.

Born 1732, Shiba, Edo (now Tokyo), Japan. Died 14 November 1798, Shiba, Edo, Japan.
