**Gaspard de Prony** was a French mathematician who produced mathematical tables and texts on mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method in 1795 for the numerical solution of engineering problems, involving solving nonlinear differential equations analytically.
2. Developed a process for constructing logarithmic, trigonometric, and polynomial tables for a wide range of domains.
3. Created designs for steam-powered mechanical calculators.
4. Founded the Groupe Speciale d'Analyse des Travaux, an organization to enable efficient production of mathematical tables.
5. Demonstrated that algebraic curves of order higher than four can be expressed as a combination of as few as four curves.
6. First to discover, in 1799, the notion of injective functions and total persistence of algebraic functions.
7. First to introduce, in 1810, the mathematical theory of projective geometry, including the idea of duality and the theory of cross-ratios.
8. Developed the theory of finite differences in 1787 and 1817, which would later be developed into numerical analysis.
9. Pioneered the use of finite-difference methods for differential equations in 1788.
10. Developed the Cauchy integral theorem, in 1808.

Born 22 July 1755, Chamelet, Beaujolais, France. Died 29 July 1839, Paris, France.
