**Augustin-Louis Cauchy** pioneered the study of analysis, both real and complex, and the theory of permutation groups. He also researched in convergence and divergence of infinite series, differential equations, determinants, probability and mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed several ideas in the field of mathematical analysis, including the notion of a limit of a sequence and the method of residues for integration of complex functions. 
2. Provided a foundation for the theory of real-valued functions and furthered the calculus of variations. 
3. Intiated the modern era of linear algebra through his work on determinants and the theory of matrixes.
4. Proscribed a method of finding the roots of equations by approximating them as limits and provided the basic principles of calculus of several variables.
5. Established the theory of elasticity and proved a variety of theorems, including the Cauchy-Buniakowski inequality and Cauchy's theorem on power series. 
6. Founded a branch of integral calculus called the theory of analytic functions and developed its general theory.
7. Formulated a number of important theorems, including Cauchy's integral formula, Cauchy's theorem and Cauchy's convergence criterion. 
8. Established the fundamental theorem of algebra and developed the theory of complex analytic functions.

Born 21 August 1789, Paris, France. Died 23 May 1857, Sceaux (near Paris), France.
