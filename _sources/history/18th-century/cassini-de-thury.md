**César-François Cassini de Thury** or **Cassini III** was a French geodesist who produced the first reliable maps of France.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1) He accurately mapped the Earth's meridians, thus establishing the study of modern geography.
2) He produced the first well-documented surveys of France and the first map of the sky acted as a stepping stone for further advancements in astrophysics.
3) He calculated Mars’s period of rotation, which was later used to measure Mars’s orbit and help determine its distance from Earth.
4) He developed new methods of measuring longitudes through astronomical observations of Jupiter and the Moon.
5) He devised a method of computing the circumference of the Earth using triangulation.
6) He developed an early form of calculus to solve problems related to astronomy and navigation.
7) He was the first to properly quantify the flattening of the Earth at the poles.
8) He identified the use of trigonometric measurement for trilateration and polar coordinates, which opened new doors for cartography.

Born 17 June 1714, Thury, near Clermont, Oise, France. Died 4 September 1784, Paris, France.
