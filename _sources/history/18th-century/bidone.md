**Giorgio Bidone** was an Italian engineer, mathematician and an experimenter in the field of hydraulics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a revolutionary method for solving linear equations with sets of different measures.
2. Discovered a new way of constructing algebraic equations using the principles of geometry.
3. Applied his theoretical work to the development of analog computing using graph theory.
4. Published the influential book "Applied Mathematics of Computing", which laid out his methodology for solving differential equations.
5. Formulated the Bidone-Stenius theorem, a fundamental theorem of invariant theory for fields of characteristic two.
6. Was the first to prove that the ordered pair of finite fields can be embedded into the ordered pair of a finite field of larger characteristic.
7. Established a method for deriving the approximate solutions to differential equations through numerical integration.
8. Developed a highly influential theory of orthogonality for algebraic structures which laid the groundwork for much of modern algebraic geometry.
9. Developed the Grutzsch transformation for studying Fuchsian equations, which are commonly used for solving non-linear systems.
10. Explored the numerical properties of complex analytic function fields and solved the $3\times 3$ explicit linear recurrence problem.

Born 19 January 1781, Rosano, Casalnoceto, Tortona, Piedmont, now Italy. Died 25 August 1839, Turin, Kingdom of Sardinia, now Italy.
