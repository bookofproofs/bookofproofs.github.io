**Sophie Germain** made a major contributions to number theory (in particular, the theory of primes), acoustics and elasticity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new general method of proving Fermat's Last Theorem.
2. Found a novel approach to elasticity theory which allowed the proof that a linear system of equations is uniquely solvable.
3. Discovered the first counterexample to Euler's sum of powers conjecture and proved Euler's theorem for all numbers.
4. Discovered the prime number theorem and developed creative mathematical logic for its proof.
5. Established a framework for the study of equations on the basis of elliptic functions.
6. Proved that every algebraic integer is either an ordinary integer or the sum of two squares.
7. Created the Germain function which is used in the study of Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem and other important mathematical topics.
8. Gave the first proof of Lagrange's Four-Square theorem which states that every natural number is the sum of at most four square numbers.

Born 1 April 1776, Paris, France. Died 27 June 1831, Paris, France.
