**Caroline Herschel** recorded the observations and did the calculations on the data of her astronomer brother William.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* She was sister of William Herschel and the aunt of John Herschel.
* Caroline's father Isaac was an oboist in the Hanovarian Foot Guards and rose to become the bandmaster.
* His interests in music, philosophy and astronomy led to lively conversations in their home but Caroline's mother disapproved of learning in general and although she reluctantly accepted that her four sons should have some education, she strongly opposed her daughters doing anything other than the household chores.
* Caroline Herschel's four brothers were all brought up to be musicians while Caroline showed an enthusiasm for knowledge which her father tried to satisfy despite all her mother's efforts to ensure that she did nothing but household tasks.
* Caroline could never have thought in her wildest dreams that one day she would make a major contribution to the study of comets.
* William escaped to England, where he became a music teacher, and Caroline was left under the control of her mother who sent her to learn to knit and otherwise kept her fully occupied with household chores.
* In 1760 Isaac returned home in poor health and Caroline essentially lived the life of a servant until he died in 1767.
* The death of her father seems to have made Caroline realise that she had to take some control of her own life and she took lessons in dressmaking and studied to qualify as a governess.
* In 1766 William became an organist in Bath and, in 1772, Caroline joined him there.
* Caroline had always been very close to her brother William and, after arriving in Bath, she trained as a singer receiving lessons from her brother.
* William taught Caroline more than musical skills.
* Now he began to teach Caroline English and mathematics while he himself became more and more involved with astronomy.
* In addition to her singing, Caroline helped William with his musical activities and looked after him while he spent many hours with his new hobby of constructing telescopes.
* Slowly Caroline turned more and more towards helping William with his astronomical activities while he continued to teach her algebra, geometry and trigonometry.
* In particular Caroline studied spherical trigonometry which would be important for reducing astronomical observations.
* Almost inevitably Caroline's role changed from looking after William to helping him with his scientific activities which soon occupied every available moment.
* Giving up their musical activities the Herschels moved to Datchet in August 1782 where they remained until June 1785 when they moved again, this time into Clay Hall, near Windsor.
* It was certainly not without many regrets that Caroline abandoned music and began to take an active part in astronomy.
* Caroline found much less time than she expected to make her own observations as she became fully involved helping William with his astronomical projects.
* By day Caroline would work on the results obtained by William while observing on the previous night.
* In fact only when William was away from home was Caroline able to spend much time with her own program of research.
* In April 1786 William and Caroline moved to a new home they called Observatory House which was in Slough and there, on 1 August 1786, Caroline discovered her first comet which was described by some as the "first lady's comet".
* This discovery brought Caroline a certain degree of fame and articles were written about her.
* Caroline kept a diary into which she had recorded her thoughts, in particular she had recorded her great distress at the change in relationship with her brother and she also recorded her bitterness towards his wife.
* However, as the relationship between the two ladies improved, Caroline regretted her bitter comments against Mary and she destroyed every page of her diary over this time in her life.
* In total Caroline discovered eight comets between 1786 and 1797 and she then embarked on a new project of cross-referencing and correcting the star catalogue which had been produced by Flamsteed.
* In 1798 Caroline submitted to the Royal Society an Index to Flamsteed's Observations of the Fixed Stars together with a list of 560 stars which had been omitted.
* This period of 25 years was not one which lacked interest for Caroline.
* She became involved with the education of John Herschel, William and Mary Herschel's son who was born in 1792.
* John Herschel spent long periods with his aunt during the vacations and was greatly influenced by Caroline.
* Caroline continued to assist William with his observations but her status had greatly improved from the housekeeper she had been in her young days.
* Caroline returned to Hanover after William's death in 1822.
* All her energies had been directed towards helping her brother in his astronomical work during his lifetime but now she turned to help his son John Herschel.
* Although Caroline regretted spending her last 25 years in Hanover there were many compensations.
* Caroline Herschel received many honours for her scientific achievements.
* A minor planet was named Lucretia in 1889 in Caroline Lucretia Herschel's honour, a fitting tribute to one who had contributed so much, yet had so little personal ambition that she disliked praise directed towards her lest it detract from her brother William.

Born 16 March 1750, Hannover, Hanover (now Germany). Died 9 January 1848, Hannover, Hanover (now Germany).
