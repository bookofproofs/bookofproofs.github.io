**Jacques Binet** worked on the foundations of matrix theory. He discovered the familiar rule for matrix multiplication.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the Binet-Simon system, a method of measuring intelligence, in 1905. 
2. Developed a theory of “mechanical observation” which extended the work of Charles Darwin and the idea of natural selection. 
3. Established the foundation of mathematical genetics and studied the hereditary basis of human differences. 
4. Discovered a formula for calculating the exponential curve, now known as the Binet-Simon equation. 
5. Developed the Binet-Simon Test, a widely used IQ test. 
6. Founded the first psychology laboratory in France in 1900. 
7. Developed normative age-scales, now known as the Binet-Simon scales. 
8. Contributed greatly to the field of psychometrics, or measuring mental characteristics, through his work in quantitative psychology.

Born 2 February 1786, Rennes, Bretagne, France. Died 12 May1856, Paris, France.
