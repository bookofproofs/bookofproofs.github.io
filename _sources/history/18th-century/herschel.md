**John Herschel** was an English scientist who worked on astronomy and early photography. He was the son of William Herschel.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a formula for the area and volume of a spherical segment.
2. Introduced the symbol for infinity and the word "photography" into the English language.
3. Explored an element of trigonometry, Laplace’s equation and equations for electrodynamics. 
4. His contributions to algebra were significant, including the theory of equations, symbolic operations and methods of elimination and reciprocity. 
5. He was the first to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra and provided new proofs to theorems of Euclid. 
6. Developed a process of calculus which subverted Newton’s fluxional notation. 
7. Made discoveries in congruences and algebraic geometries. 
8. His work on non-Euclidean geometry which showed the possibility of a geometry in which the parallel postulate does not always hold was notable. 
9. Established an algebraic foundation for the Calculus of Variations. 
10. Demonstrated how to construct a map of any large area of the sky with a particular scale and accuracy.

Born 7 March 1792, Slough, Buckinghamshire, England. Died 11 May1871, Hawkhurst, Kent, England.
