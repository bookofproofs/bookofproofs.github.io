4. Solved a nonlinear system with five equations and five unknowns in 1867.
5. Developed a revised version of the algorithm of Gaussian elimination in 1872.
6. Published a paper on Curves of Constant Width in 1865.
7. Proposed the solution to the problem of Four Squares in 1877.
8. Published a book titled Plane and Spherical Trigonometry in 1867.
