**Adrien-Quentin Buée** was a French priest and mathematician who worked on complex numbers and their graphical representation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He had brothers Pierre Louis Buée (1746-1827) and Auguste Buée.
* There is no information about Buée's education.
* The first we know about Buée is that he arrived in Coutances Cathedral as master of music in February 1766.
* Buée's appointment was to replace the previous master of music at Coutances Cathedral, Pierre Simon Hollet de la Place, who had died on 5 January 1766 aged only twenty-four or twenty-five.
* Buée's brother Pierre Louis Buée was master of music of the cathedral of Dijon and had his motet Benedic, anima mea  performed at the Concert Spirituel on 26 May 1765.
* In early April, Adrien Quentin Buée emulated his brother by having one of his motets performed at the Concert Spirituel in Paris.
* There was a third Motet which deserved to compete, and which was also heard at the Concert with pleasure, it is by M Buée, Master of Music of the Cathedral of Coutances, aged 19 to 20.
* On Thursday 2 June 1768 Buée had another of his motets performed at the Concert Spirituel, namely Noli amulari.
* The fame he had achieved at the Concert Spirituel was a factor in Buée being recommended for the position of music master in the collegiate church of Saint-Martin in Tours in September 1768.
* Buée was given until Christmas to arrange his departure from Coutances.
* There was some unhappiness that Buée had left Coutances and a leading musician wrote to the canons of the cathedral of Coutances expressing regret that they had not increased his wages to try to keep such a talented young musician.
* In August of 1771 Buée obtained a six week leave to go to Paris.
* He continued to lead this life, going to Paris for quite long visits; for example in 1775 he went from January to "the first Sunday in Lent." Although there is no evidence that Buée studied mathematics during his visits to Paris, from the expertise he later showed, it seems highly likely that he did discuss mathematics, a subject which seems to have been as interesting to him as music.
* This does not seem to be a very prestigious position but it appears that Buée was wanting to be in Paris to be in a position to look for something more important.
* Buée remained as a priest in the diocese of Paris, and was an incumbent of the chapel Sainte-Anne and that of Saint-Eutrope but without income.
* Buée was strongly opposed to the Revolution and began publishing strongly worded anti-Revolution pamphlets.
* Buée became a "prêtre réfractaire", that is a priest who had refused to take the oath imposed upon them, also called non-jurors.
* Buée choose to flee to England and settled in Bath.
* Bath had a strong music tradition and one might have expected to find Buée's name among the Bath musicians.
* We have not be able to find any such, however, and all references to Buée that we have found for the time he spent in Bath refer to his work in mathematics and its applications.
* For example, in 1797 we find several of the problems in Dr Hutton's Mathematical Repository being answered by Buée.
* We do not know who this person is but suspect it is a misprint for "the celebrated M Haüy." Buée was certainly a friend of René-Just Haüy (1743-1822) who, like Buée, was a Roman Catholic priest who made important contributions to science, particularly to crystallography.
* Nicholson continues giving a review of the outline which Buée gives of his proposed work.
* According to Dr Peacock, M Buée is the first formal maintainer of the geometrical significance of √-1.
* Buée's memoir, referred to by De Morgan in this quote, was the Mémoire sur les quantités imaginaires Ⓣ(Memoir on imaginary quantities) was read in 1805 at the Royal Society and was published in 1806.
* Buée's achievements are likewise important for the conceptual development of the negative numbers and for the graphical representation of the complex numbers.
* In 1808 John Playfair criticised Buée's paper in an article he wrote for the Edinburgh Review.
* In 1804 Buée published Parallel of Romé de l'Isle's and the Abbé Haüy's Theories of Crystallography.
* 74-75, 1804) under the title "A letter from Abbé Buée to Mr ****, on Mr Romé de l'Isle and the Abbé Haüy's theories of crystallography." Originally written in French, Buée had authored the letter in order to contrast the differences between the crystallographic systems of Romé de l'Isle and Haüy, which at the time were both considered similar in nature.
* It is an important critique of Romé de l'Isle's system, which Buée characterizes as primarily descriptive, as opposed to Haüy's mathematically based system.
* In 1814 Buée left Bath and returned to France where he became an honorary canon at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris.
* Buée continued his interest in the foundations of mathematics and wrote to a "mathematical gentlemen in London, who declines communicating his name to the public." His letter was published as "Solution to a Problem of Col Silas Titus" in the Annals of Philosophy in January 1815.
* The death of the Abbé Adrien-Quentin Buée, honorary canon of Notre-Dame Cathedral, is mentioned in number 46 of L'Ami de la Religion et du Roi Ⓣ(The friend of religion and the King) (1826) where the two lines of text are especially careful to distinguish him from his brother Pierre-Louis Buée.
* Finally we note that Adrien-Quentin Buée is still remembered today by musicians who still perform his musical compositions and by mathematicians who understand that he was one of the originators of the geometrical interpretation of complex numbers.

Born 6 October 1745, Paris, France. Died 11 October 1825, Paris, France.
