**Gaspard Monge** is considered the father of differential geometry because of his work _Application de l'analyse à la géométrie _ where he introduced the concept of lines of curvature of a surface in 3-space.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the method of descriptive geometry, which is used to define the reciprocal positions of objects in space.
2. Applied his knowledge of differential calculus to algebraic equations, leading to ‘Monge’s conditions’ which describe the conditions under which a system of equations has a unique solution.
3. Published Théorie des surfaces in 1795, which laid the foundations for differential geometry. 
4. Received the Grand Prize at the French Academy of Sciences in 1781 for his essay on weapons of oblique fire. 
5. Represented a notable role in the French Revolution during 1789-1794. 
6. Proposed a general theory of curvature, which includes the concept of the Gaussian curvature. 
7. Pioneered in developing solid geometry and algebraic geometry, now known as algebraic geometry. 
8. Devised the Contour mapping technique to represent the features of a geographical region. 
9. Developed the application of calculus for analyzing curves and surfaces. 
10. Dealt with the problems of enumeration and combinations.

Born 9 May 1746, Beaune, Bourgogne, France. Died 28 July 1818, Paris, France.
