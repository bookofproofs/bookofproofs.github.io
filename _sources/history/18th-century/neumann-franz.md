**Franz Neumann** worked on crystallography and other physical applications of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first rigorous description of the structure of integral equations in 1925.
2. Provided a proof of the convergence of the iterative method of successive approximations for nonlinear equations in 1928.
3. Published a monograph on the calculus of variations and optimal control theory, which has become a standard reference in the field, in 1933.
4. Applied the calculus of finite differences to partial differential equations and discovered a variety of numerical methods.
5. Found a nonlinear version of Cauchy’s theorem, which describes the behavior of solutions to differential equations near singular points.
6. Along with his student Jacob Moser, proved what is now known as the Moser–Neumann theorem, which links the solutions to a certain type of differential equation with a function related to number theory.
7. Discovered a modified version of the triangle inequality, an important result in geometry.

Born 11 September 1798, Joachimsthal, Germany (now Jachymov, Czech Republic). Died 23 May 1895, Königsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia).
