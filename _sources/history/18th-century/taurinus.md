**Franz Taurinus** was a German mathematician best known for his work on non-Euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* At first Taurinus tried to prove that Euclidean geometry was the only geometry but, in 1826, he accepted the lack of contradiction in other geometries.
* In this last mentioned publication Taurinus accepts that a third system of geometry exists in which the sum of the angles of a triangle is less than 180q .
* Taurinus came up with the important idea that elliptic geometry could be realised on the surface of a sphere, an idea taken up by Riemann.
* He also realised that there were an infinite number of non-euclidean geometries and this, Taurinus claimed, was highly significant.

Born 15 November 1794, Bad KÃ¶nig, German. Died 13 February 1874, Cologne, Germany.
