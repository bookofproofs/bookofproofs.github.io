**Franz Taurinus** was a German mathematician best known for his work on non-Euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. First to prove the theorem regarding the minimum number of the sides of a triangle that is necessary to uniquely determine a triangle. 
2. Published his major work 'System der Elementargeometrie' in 1840, which introduced the concept of 'Modern Geometry' with axioms and postulates.
3. Developed the concept of "projective group" defined by groups of self-intersecting lines in a plane.
4. Published mathematical papers on topics such as quadrature, trigonometry, algebraic equations and geometry. 
5. Discovered an algebraic expression for establishing the limits of integration to solve infinitesimal problems.
6. Demonstrated the importance of analytic geometry, especially in the calculation of quadric surfaces. 
7. Developed a method for solving polynomial equations of high degree with two unknown variables called "Taurinus Method".
8. Developed the concepts of 'synthetic geometry' and 'metric geometry' which served to bridge the gap between computational geometry and higher mathematics.

Born 15 November 1794, Bad KÃ¶nig, German. Died 13 February 1874, Cologne, Germany.
