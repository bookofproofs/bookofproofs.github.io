**Louis Puissant** was a French mathematician and geographer who is best remembered for his invention of a new map projection.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Louis trained as a land-surveyor but felt that he did not know enough mathematics to carry out this work to the standard that he wished, so decided that he must study geometry.
* Delambre and MÃ©chain had been measuring the meridian since 1792 and this project was still not complete when Puissant was carrying out triangulations using similar methods.
* Puissant was fascinated by this major scientific project, and wrote an book on the problem of the shape of the earth.
* Puissant had risen to the rank of lieutenant-colonel by the time he left the army.
* On 3 November 1828 Puissant was elected to the Academy of Sciences to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Laplace in the previous year.
* Puissant wrote on geodesy, the shape of the earth and spherical trigonometry.

Born 22 September 1769, Champagne, France. Died 10 January 1843, Paris, France.
