**Louis Puissant** was a French mathematician and geographer who is best remembered for his invention of a new map projection.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a general theory for equations of arbitrary degree and a particular solution for quintic equations of odd degree.
2. Made important contributions to the theory of number systems.
3. Discovered the relation connecting the square of the arc and the chord of a circle.
4. Developed the General Theory of Quadratic Reciprocity.
5. Proved that the number of divisors of a number is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of its prime factors.
6. Solved a problem of Diophantine approximation in higher dimensions.
7. Developed the theory of composition of numbers into sums of other numbers.
8. Discovered the law of variation of the difference of arc and chord of a circle.
9. Found the formulae for the equation of a circle in hyperbolic geometry.
10. Developed a new numerical method for solving equations of multiple degrees of complexity.

Born 22 September 1769, Champagne, France. Died 10 January 1843, Paris, France.
