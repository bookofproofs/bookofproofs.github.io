**George Green** was an English mathematician best-known for Green's function and Green's theorems in potential theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. George Green is credited with the discovery of Green's theorem, which is used to calculate fluxes. 
2. He also developed a construction for solving partial differential equations for functions of two variables using a series of polynomials. 
3. Green's major mathematical contributions include introducing and popularizing the concept of potential, developing the mathematical theory of electricity, developing several theories in acoustics, astronomy and optics, and publishing an important work on electricity and magnetism. 
4. George Green was also one of the first to combine mathematical analysis with applied sciences such as electricity and mechanics. He is credited with first recognizing the usefulness of complex analysis in solving physical problems. 
5. In 1828, George Green published "An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism", which contained elements of the modern vector calculus. 
6. He also introduced the idea of creating a “Green’s Function” relating energy and field intensity which is widely used in modern mathematics.

Born 14 July 1793, Sneinton, Nottingham, England. Died 31 May 1841, Sneinton, Nottingham, England.
