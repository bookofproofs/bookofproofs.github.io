**Joseph Fourier** studied the mathematical theory of heat conduction. He established the partial differential equation governing heat diffusion and solved it by using infinite series of trigonometric functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Fourier Series, a mathematical tool used to break down a complicated problem into simpler components. 
2. Developed the theorems of Fourier Analysis, a mathematical technique for solving linear differential equations. 
3. Established the notion of heat conduction, a crucial idea in the understanding of conservation of energy. 
4. Developed the method of separation of variables for partial differential equations, a powerful technique for solving such equations. 
5. Demonstrated the connection between periodic motion and the motion of waves.  
6. Applied mathematics to a number of scientific problems, including acoustic theory, astronomy, and electromagnetism.

Born 21 March 1768, Auxerre, Bourgogne, France. Died 16 May1830, Paris, France.
