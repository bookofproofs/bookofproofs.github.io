**Charles Terrot** was an amateur mathematician who became Bishop of Edinburgh. He wrote an early paper on complex numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published two important texts: "A Treatise on Plane Co-Ordinate Geometry" (1856) and "Elementary Treatise on the Theory of Equations" (1860). 
2. Introduced the notion of the "General Principle of Convergence" to the study of series. 
3. Developed a method for solving quartic equations. 
4. Extended the work of George Boole on algebraic logic.
5. Discovered a theory of matrix algebra.
6. Developed a general theory of algebraic equations. 
7. Pioneered the use of Mobius transformations in geometry. 
8. Introduced an analytical study of higher geometry. 
9. Established the mathematical basis for theory of geodesy.
10. Demonstrated the irrationality of some special numbers.

Born 19 September 1790, Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu, India. Died 2 April 1872, Stockbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland.
