### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the planet Uranus in 1781, which revolutionized humanity's understanding of our solar system.
2. Constructed the powerful 20-foot telescope he used to make his discoveries.
3. Mapping of star clusters and nebulae, including creation of one of the earliest catalogues of nebulae (1786).
4. Proposed the idea of a disk-shaped Milky Way galaxy (1785).
5. Calculated approximate values for the masses of Jupiter and Saturn (1783).
6. Developed a scheme of star classification, among the earliest attempts to qualify stars by spectral class and brightness.
7. Established the rate of stellar proper motion (1783).
8. Estimated the distance of 61 Cygni from the sun (1838).

Born 15 November 1738, Hanover, Electorate of Holy Roman Empire (now Germany). Died 25 August 1822, Slough, England.
