**William Wallace** worked on geometry and discovered the (so-called) _Simson line_ of a triangle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of algebraic geometry and introduced modern concepts of algebraic curves. 
2. Established the dimensions of integrals and determined the formal rules of integration. 
3. Discovered the concept of lowest common denominator for algebraic fractions. 
4. Explored the relationship between plane curves and algebraic equations. 
5. Developed techniques for solving calculus problems. 
6. Developed the first algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of integers and polynomials. 
7. Contributed to the development of the Newtonâ€“Raphson method, a method for root-finding. 
8. Pioneered the introduction of imaginary numbers and mathematical notation.

Born 23 September 1768, Dysart, Fife, Scotland. Died 28 April 1843, Edinburgh, Scotland.
