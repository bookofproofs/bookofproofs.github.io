**Charles-Julien Brianchon** was a French mathematician who worked on projective geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a theorem about projective geometry in 1837 and proved it using homogeneous coordinates. 
2. He introduced the concept of what is now known as Brianchon’s theorem, which states that the six vertices of a hexagon inscribed in a conic section are divided by the four sides of the hexagon into three pairs of collinear points. 
3. He also discovered the theorem, now known as the Brianchon-Cesaro theorem, which states that the lines connecting the opposite vertices of a hexagon inscribed in a conic section intersect in a point. 
4. Developed a function of three variables which allowed him to write polynomials with arbitrary coefficients in a unique form, now known as the Brianchon-Gram Identity. 
5. Discovered formulas used in enumerative geometry for the area of a convex polygon and the volume of a tetrahedron. 
6. Developed a theorem for the existence of conic sections which is now referred to as Brianchon’s theorem. 
7. Constructed a three dimensional polyhedron from a conic section which he also referred to as Brianchon’s theorem. 
8. Extended the concept of Euler’s theorem to 3-dimensional figures.

Born 19 December 1783, Sèvres, France. Died 29 April 1864, Versailles, France.
