**Paolo Frisi** was an Italian mathematician who wrote on geometry, mechanics and cosmology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical proof to explain the tides in the Adriatic and Ionian seas.
2. Contributed to the research and development of the modern concept of calculus of variations.
3. Pioneered the development of hydrostatics, or the study of liquids in motion.
4. Advanced the modern concept of the infinite series, a fundamental tool in calculus and algebra.
5. Discovered a method for calculating the acceleration of gravity, independently of Newton.
6. Devised the cycloidal pendulum, a very important tool in determining longitude at sea.
7. Published the book “Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy”, in which he presented his philosophical theories about mathematics.
8. Developed a theory of evidential probability, a key concept to understand the science of statistics.

Born 13 April 1728, Milan, Austrian Habsburg (now Italy). Died 22 November 1784, Milan, Austrian Habsburg (now Italy).
