**Ruggero Boscovich**'s main work was in mathematical physics. He was the first to give a procedure to compute a planet's orbit from three observations of its position.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new method of solving mathematical problems, specifically forming equations from the analysis of geometrical results. 
2. Wrote the book “On Mathematical Analysis” which provided important insight into the use of mathematical analysis for curvature calculations and solid geometry. 
3. Pioneered the use of the concept of “imaginary points” to simplify the solution of problems involving curves. 
4. Proposed a mathematical theory of the motion of point masses, predicting the motion of the planets using a proto-unified theory of gravity.  
5. Wrote fundamental works on calculus including the “Theory of Descartes' Triangle” and the book “On Higher Space”. 
6. Developed a new notation for the classic Euler’s identity equation, using symbols and a geometrical approach to help simplify the solution process. 
7. Formulated an empirical proof of the law of attraction of gravity which postulated that the force between two masses is proportional to the inverse square of the distance between them. 
8. Developed an innovative approach to the solution of pendulum equations by introducing a new method of series expansion.

Born 18 May 1711, Ragusa, Dubrovnik Republic (now Dubrovnik, Croatia). Died 13 February 1787, Milan, Hapsburg Empire (now Italy).
