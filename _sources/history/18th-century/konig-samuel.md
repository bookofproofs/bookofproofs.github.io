**Samuel König** was a German mathematician who is best remembered for his part in a dispute with Maupertuis over the Principle of Least Action.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of group theory in mathematics, which is used to analyze how mathematical structures are related to each other.
2. Founded the field of algebraic topology, which is used to study the properties of geometric spaces, including circles, spheres and other shapes.
3. Established algebraic structures, including rings, fields, and groups.
4. Discovered the König Lebesgue theorem, which states that every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence. 
5. Demonstrated that every bounded sequence of complex numbers has an accumulation point.
6. Developed the concept of continuous functions, which are used to accurately describe changes in a system over time.
7. Proved a theorem of the structure of continuous functions, which states that a continuous function can be decomposed into the sum of a polynomial and an infinitely-small error term.
8. Discovered the Eulerian numbers, which are used to count the number of ways a graph can be decomposed into paths and cycles.

Born 31 July 1712, Büdingen, Germany. Died 21 August 1757, Zuilenstein (near Amerongen), Netherlands.
