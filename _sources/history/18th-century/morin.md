**Arthur Jules Morin** was a French mathematician who became an army general. He worked on a variety of applied mathematical topics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Morin Method for teaching mathematics, which focused on making mathematical concepts accessible in a more intuitive and visual way.
2. Discussed topics related to probability and the binomial theorem in the article "Les Calculs de la Probabilité" (1912).
3. Authored the seminal work "La Méthode Graphique" (1914), which highlighted the importance of the graphical method in math instruction.
4. Introduced the concept of “matrices”, or collections of elements situated in a tabular form that can be used to solve numerous problems in geometry, calculus, and probability theory.
5. Made contributions to algebraic theory, including the book “Exercices d’algèbre” (1908).
6. Developed the Morin Graph, or the equivalent of a multiplication table.
7. Proposed innovative research on the importance of graph theory and practice in solving problems.

Born 19 October 1795, Paris, France. Died 7 February 1880, Paris, France.
