**Arthur Jules Morin** was a French mathematician who became an army general. He worked on a variety of applied mathematical topics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Morin was fifteen in 1810 when Napoleon was at the height of his power and Paris thrived.
* By this time Morin was studying at the École Polytechnique and the next two years saw the French position deteriorate and the French army suffered a humiliating defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813.
* As the armies of the allies moved towards Paris in 1814, Morin had to terminate his studies at the École Polytechnique and join in the efforts to defend Paris.
* Following the Treaty of Fontainebleau which ended hostilities, Morin's defence duties ended and he entered the École d'Application de Metz where he undertook practical studies in engineering.
* Morin remained at Metz for four years, and then entered the army as a lieutenant in the pontoon unit which had been created in the 1790s.
* It was on 7 April 1855 that Morin reached the rank of General of Division, having been made général de brigade on 26 March 1852.
* As professor of mechanics Morin, who never renounced his army commission, drew heavily on the theoretical and practical work of his friend and teacher Poncelet and of other military officers.
* Morin was Professor of Mechanics for ten years, and then in 1849 he became Director of the Conservatoire.
* In 1849 Morin, working with Poncelet, invented the dynamometer of rotation, which together with later refinements, became the basic investigative tool in the study of work.
* During 1853-56 Morin undertook a series of experiments on the resistance of building materials which he published in a series of papers.
* Another important role that Morin filled was as President of the Commission for the first Universal Exhibition which opened in Paris in May 1855.
* Not only was Morin the President of the Commission, he also exhibited some of his apparatus.
* Morin received many honours for his contributions.

Born 19 October 1795, Paris, France. Died 7 February 1880, Paris, France.
