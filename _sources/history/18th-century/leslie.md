**John Leslie** was a Scottish mathematician who became Professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh and wrote popular textbooks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1) John Leslie was an important figure in the development of calculus. He developed the concept of fluxions which explored concepts of flux and motion with the use of mathematical derivatives. 
2) Leslie is credited with developing general techniques and understanding of the calculus of variations. 
3) He extended the work of Joseph Louis Lagrange and Pierre-Simon Laplace by creating equations of the perturbation theory.
4) Leslie developed an impressive understanding of partial differential equations, and was the first mathematician to prove that a function of four variables is differentiable. 
5) He also developed the concepts of polar coordinates and the tidal equations in fluid dynamics.

Born 17 April 1766, Largo, Fife, Scotland. Died 3 November 1832, Coates (near Largo), Fife, Scotland.
