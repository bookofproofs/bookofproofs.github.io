**Jean-Charles de Borda** was a French soldier and mathematician who invented an important surveying instrument.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Created the "Borda count" method of determining the winner of an election, which was used in many parliamentary elections in France and in the United States Constitution. 
2. Published two treatises on the subjects of physics and mathematics.
3. Co-invented the "Bouguer-Borda" theorem in 1781, which was used to determine the shape of a ship based on its displacement.
4. Wrote a paper in which he expressed a mathematical proof for the existence of God.
5. Developed a navigation instrument for use with a sextant, known as the "Borda circle".
6. Discovered and published the works of the Italian mathematician Girolamo Cardano.
7. Formulated the "Borda-Cayley theorem" in 1770, which links algebra, geometry, and topology.
8. Developed an early method for calculating the area of a triangle.
9. Pioneered the use of the "law of sines" to calculate distances between two points.
10. Applied calculus to the study of mechanics, resulting in the "Borda theorem".

Born 4 May 1733, Dax, France. Died 19 February 1799, Paris, France.
