**Christoph Gudermann** worked on geometry and special functions. He taught Weierstrass.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Christoph was academically able in his schooling so, as many able boys at this time did, it was intended that he should train to became a priest.
* Gudermann worked almost exclusively on spherical geometry and special functions but he is not remembered for any original mathematical results in these areas.
* For this reason and because of its constant curvature there exist many similarities between spherical geometry and plane geometry; yet at the same time Gudermann considered more interesting the study of cases where the similarity no longer holds.
* In his more extensive work on the theory of special functions Gudermann published several papers beginning in 1830 which extended work which was developed by Euler, Landen, Legendre, Abel and Jacobi.
* Gudermann is best known, however, as the teacher of Weierstrass between 1839 and 1841 while Weierstrass worked for his secondary school teacher's certificate.
* Gudermann, at this time, was particularly interested in the theory of elliptic functions and in the expansion of functions by power series.
* Not only did Gudermann undertake research in the theory of elliptic functions but he was one of the first to teach the topic.
* Weierstrass spent the academic year 1839-1840 taking Gudermann's course on elliptic functions.

Born 25 March 1798, Vienenburg (near Hildesheim), Germany. Died 25 September 1852, MÃ¼nster, Germany.
