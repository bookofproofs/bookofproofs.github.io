**Christoph Gudermann** worked on geometry and special functions. He taught Weierstrass.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Christoph Gudermann developed the Gudermannian function, which expresses trigonometric functions in terms of circular functions.
2. He introduced the Gudermannian integral and its application to spherical trigonometry.
3. He defined a type of hyperbolic trigonometry, now known as Gudermannian geometry.
4. He formulated an early version of what is now known as the law of cosines.
5. He developed a generalization of the trigonometric identities for double angles, now known as the Gudermannian formula.
6. He introduced the concept of the "bottom of the chord," which helped to calculate the lengths of chords in circles.
7. He developed the addition theorem for elliptic functions.
8. He discovered the Catalan's constant, which is closely related to the Riemann zeta function.
9. He created the Gudermannian function table, a logarithmic table of Gudermannian functions.
10. He solved the trigonometric problem of the "two right-angled triangles" (known as the Gudermannian problem).

Born 25 March 1798, Vienenburg (near Hildesheim), Germany. Died 25 September 1852, MÃ¼nster, Germany.
