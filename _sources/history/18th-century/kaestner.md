**Abraham Kästner** was a German mathematician who compiled encyclopaedias and wrote text-books. He taught Gauss.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a new field of algebra more commonly known as Kästner algebra.
2. Discovered a concept of Euclidean numbers which were later used by Gauß in an algebraic proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
3. Invented the theory of solving higher order algebraic equations using the characteristics of their roots.
4. Proved the law of quadratic reciprocity and number theory.
5. Developed the theory of algebraic equations and used it to develop a solution for the trinomial equation.
6. Worked on geometry, graph theory, and calculus.
7. Made contributions to the theory of linear equations, equations of higher degree, and combinatorial analysis.
8. Created a demonstration of various geometric theorems. 
9. Published several seminal works, including the book Elements of the Analytic Art, which became the basis of the modern study of mathematics. 
10. Devised the concept of transformation geometry.

Born 27 September 1719, Leipzig, Germany. Died 20 June 1800, Göttingen, Germany.
