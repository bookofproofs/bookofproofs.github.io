**Augustin Fresnel** did important work on optics where he was one of the founders of the wave theory of light.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. In 1819, Augustin Fresnel developed the wave theory of light, providing a mathematical model that demonstrated that light is a wave by calculating the diffraction patterns of a plane wave passing through circular apertures.
2. He developed the Fresnel equations to explain and describe the amplitude and phase of light at any point and the interference of plane waves passing each other. 
3. He introduced the concept of the equivalent wave sources, which allows the diffraction patterns around apertures to be calculated as if they were constructed from an infinite number of point sources.
4. He developed a theory of Huygens’ principle using the concept of wavelets in 1818.
5. Fresnel created an optical tool called the Fresnel rhomb which is useful for analyzing the wave motion of materials in a prism. 
6. He developed a theory showing the relations between newton's corpuscular theory and wave theory in 1822.
7. He developed a generalized form of Snell’s law of refraction entitled the Milne-Thompson Circle theorem in 1820.
8. He was able to identify the highly chromatic aberration which occurs in lenses and laid the theoretical groundwork for the invention of the achromatic doublets.
9. Fresnel developed a mathematical description of the polarization of light waves in 1822.
10. He proposed using the linear superposition of secondary waves to explain diffraction in 1815.

Born 10 May1788, Broglie, France. Died 14 July 1827, Ville-d'Avray, France.
