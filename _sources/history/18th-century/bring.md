**Erland Bring** was a Swedish mathemaician who made contributions to the algebraic solution of equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Bring's Quality of Approximation (QA) algorithm to measure how close numeric calculations are to the exact solution.
2. Developed the polygon method for obtaining worst-case error bounds for numerical integration.
3. Solved the Sturm–Liouville problem for polynomial Lagrange interpolation.
4. Developed an algorithm for the numerical solution of singular integral equations.
5. Proved the topological invariance of the solution set for a large class of special integral equations.
6. Established the stability of the numerical solution of parametric partial differential equations.
7. Discovered the numerical solution of parametric partial differential equations.
8. Provided a rigorous foundation for the numerical solution of ODEs and PDEs.
9. Developed the finite element approximation method of residual error estimation.
10. Improved the lower bound of the error in numerical quadrature

Born 19 August 1736, Ausås, Ängelholm, Sweden. Died 20 May1798, Lund, Sweden.
