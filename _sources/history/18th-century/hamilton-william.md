**William Hamilton** was a Scottish philosopher whose approach to logic influenced Boole, De Morgan and others.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
William Hamilton (1788-1856) was a 19th century Irish mathematician and cleric who made important contributions to mathematics, mechanics, and optics. He is best known for providing the reformulation of Newtonian mechanics in the language of quaternions, an algebraic system which sought to unify the three-dimensional geometric algebra and vector algebra.

1. Developed the mathematical reformulation of Newtonian mechanics in the language of quaternions.
2. Established the algebraic system which sought to unify three-dimensional geometric algebra and vector algebra.
3. Published an influential paper in 1834, exploring the charactristics of the quaternion system.
4. Autonomously developed a comprehensive theory of optics, describing the phenomenon of the aberration of light.
5. Pioneered geometric calculus and the calculus of variations.
6. Implemented a rigorous multiplication concept for three-dimensional vectors and mastering the mathematical properties of the associated multiplication.
7. Discovered new methods for solving partial differential equations.
8. Replaced canon law with quaternions to understand physical phenomena in a unique way.
9. Studied the motion of multiple points and the associated concept of energy.
10. Improved the design of marine navigation tools and magnetic compasses.

Born 8 March 1788, Glasgow, Scotland. Died 6 May 1856, Edinburgh, Scotland.
