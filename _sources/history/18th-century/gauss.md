**Carl Friedrich Gauss** worked in a wide variety of fields in both mathematics and physics incuding number theory, analysis, differential geometry, geodesy, magnetism, astronomy and optics. His work has had an immense influence in many areas.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which states that every polynomial equation of degree n has at least one root.
2. Discovered the construction of the heptadecagon using only a compass and straight-edge.
3. Demonstrated the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (also known as the Unique Factorization Theorem).
4. Developed the Gaussian elimination technique for solving linear equations.
5. Established the theory of complex numbers as numbers that can be expressed in the form a + bi.
6. Developed the concept of least squares approximations for fitting data to curves, and defined the Gaussian Bell Curve.
7. Codified and extended the use of integral and differential calculus to solve problems in physics.
8. Discovered several of the geometric theorems that would become known as the Theorema Egregium.
9. Discovered the construction of the 17-sided regular polygon, now known as the Gaussian heptadecagon.
10. Explored several topics in number theory such as Fermat’s Last Theorem, quadratic residue, and prime numbers.

Born 30 April 1777, Brunswick, Duchy of Brunswick (now Germany). Died 23 February 1855, Göttingen, Hanover (now Germany).
