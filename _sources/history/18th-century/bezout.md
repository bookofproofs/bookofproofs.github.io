**Étienne Bézout** was a French mathematician who is best known for his theorem on the number of solutions of polynomial equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed to the development of the modern theory of equations, introducing new methods for solving polynomial equations.
2. Developed the basic ideas of modern algebraic geometry, including the use of eliminating variables.
3. Formulated a proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra.
4. Developed a generalization of the calculation of prime numbers.
5. Pioneered the subject of analytic geometry and the improvement of numerical integration techniques.
6. Wrote a landmark book, "Cours de Mathématiques" which became a reference work for the generations to come.
7. Introduced the notion of symbolic representation of algebraic equations.
8. Developed methods for the integration of differential equations that are still used today.
9. Streamlined the calculation of determinants on matrices using his “method of substitution”.
10. Developed the method of least squares for curve fitting.

Born 31 March 1730, Nemours, France. Died 27 September 1783, Basses-Loges (near Fontainbleau), France.
