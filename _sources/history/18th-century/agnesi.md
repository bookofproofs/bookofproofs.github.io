**Maria Agnesi** was an Italian mathematician who is noted for her work in differential calculus. She discussed the cubic curve now known as the 'witch of Agnesi'.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the first book on integral and differential calculus, Instituzioni Analitiche (Analytical Institutions), in 1748. 
2. Introduced the fundamental theorem of algebra. 
3. Helped define curves by solving “tangent problem”, allowing mathematicians to draw what is now called the Witch of Agnesi. 
4. Published the first book on the convex analysis, Propositiones Philosophicae, in 1755. 
5. Proved the existence of semicircular arcs. 
6. Proved the emergence of a stationary point in higher derivatives, which would later be known as the “Agnesi’s maximum principle”. 
7. Proved the convergence of the sequence of polynomials. 
8. Developed the “parallelogram law” of forces. 
9. Proved that trajectories of two forces acting on a particle move on two opposite arcs. 
10. Developed a method for solving a general equation of the nth degree in a single variable.

Born 16 May1718, Milan, Habsburg Empire (now Italy). Died 9 January 1799, Milan, Habsburg Empire (now Italy).
