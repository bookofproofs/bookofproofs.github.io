**Jesse Ramsden** was an English instrument maker who made improvements to telescopes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The family were not well off and Jesse attended a free school in Halifax from 1744 to 1747.
* At this stage Ramsden was sent to live with his uncle, Mr Craven, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and he spent four years there studying mathematics taught by the Revd Mr Hall.
* Ramsden spent much time at Dollond's house learning about optical instruments.
* Of their two sons and two daughters, only one son, John Ramsden, survived to adulthood.
* Marriage gave Ramsden a share in the patent that John Dollond had taken out on his most famous invention, the achromatic lens.
* Ramsden soon opened a new business in Haymarket, near Little Suffolk Street.
* It was Ramsden, however, 100 years later who found that this design reduces blurring of the image caused by the sphericity of the lenses or mirrors.
* Ramsden produced such an instrument in 1767 but it did not give as accurate results as was hoped.
* A second version produced in 1775 was considerably better and led to Ramsden being awarded Â£300 two years later by the longitude commissioners.
* Although he was highly successful in his business, Ramsden does not appear to have been so successful with his marriage for his wife did not move with him when he opened larger premises in 1773.
* Sarah and their son John moved into a house owned by the Dollond family, but Sarah seems to have continued to assist Ramsden in his business.
* Indeed Ramsden continued to expand his business, enlarging his premises in 1780.
* The procedures adopted by Ramsden and Troughton for correcting initial dividing marks are also described.
* Ramsden's health deteriorated and he was advised to go to Brighton to aid his recovery.
* This did not happen and Ramsden died there.

Born 15 October 1735, Salterhebble, near Halifax, Yorkshire, England. Died 5 November 1800, Brighton, Sussex, England.
