**Jesse Ramsden** was an English instrument maker who made improvements to telescopes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ramsden spent much time at Dollond's house learning about optical instruments.
* Marriage gave Ramsden a share in the patent that John Dollond had taken out on his most famous invention, the achromatic lens.
* Ramsden soon opened a new business in Haymarket, near Little Suffolk Street.
* It was Ramsden, however, 100 years later who found that this design reduces blurring of the image caused by the sphericity of the lenses or mirrors.
* Ramsden produced such an instrument in 1767 but it did not give as accurate results as was hoped.
* A second version produced in 1775 was considerably better and led to Ramsden being awarded Â£300 two years later by the longitude commissioners.
* Indeed Ramsden continued to expand his business, enlarging his premises in 1780.
* The procedures adopted by Ramsden and Troughton for correcting initial dividing marks are also described.
* Ramsden's health deteriorated and he was advised to go to Brighton to aid his recovery.
* This did not happen and Ramsden died there.

Born 15 October 1735, Salterhebble, near Halifax, Yorkshire, England. Died 5 November 1800, Brighton, Sussex, England.
