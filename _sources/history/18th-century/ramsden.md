**Jesse Ramsden** was an English instrument maker who made improvements to telescopes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a 'dividing engine' consisting of two intersecting wheels to calculate division and multiplication, which became the first reliable calculation device.
2. Developed a 'screw-bar instrument' that would enable more accurate measurement of angles, a device whose improvements would be felt by surveyors, astronomers and cartographers.
3. Refined and improved the astronomical transit, the theodolite and the sextant, all of which were vital instruments for accurate measurement of angles.
4. Revolutionised the manufacture of mathematical instruments, introducing more exact standards to their construction such as a metric graduated scale for measuring angles. 
5. Developed a sophisticated microphone to measure the positions and angles between sighting stars.  
6. Developed a new form of equatorial mount which became the international standard for astronomical telescopes.
7. Pioneered the use of high quality lenses for telescope design and the production of photo-micrographical equipment. 
8. Came up with extremely precise dividing machines that used vernier scales, allowing far finer readings than could previously be achieved.

Born 15 October 1735, Salterhebble, near Halifax, Yorkshire, England. Died 5 November 1800, Brighton, Sussex, England.
