**Farkas Bolyai** was a mathematics teacher, best known as the father of János Bolyai.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Farkas Bolyai's father Gáspár Bolyai was 43 years old when Farkas was born.
* When Farkas was born Nagyszeben was the military centre of Transylvania and the capital of the region.
* Farkas was taught at home by his father until he reached the age of six years when he was sent to the Calvinist school in Nagyszeben.
* This meant that Bolyai was now treated as a member of one of the leading families in the country, and he became not only a tutor to Simon but a close friend.
* In 1790 Bolyai and his pupil both entered the Calvinist College in Kolozsvár where they spent five years.
* The time spent in Kolozsvár was important for Bolyai's development.
* This meant that Bolyai was presented with its fundamental idea that reason was the route to understanding the universe and to improving the position of man.
* There was an increasing resentment against the Habsburgs, particularly from the workers, and Bolyai too felt support for Hungarian culture, language, and nationality.
* The professor of philosophy at the College in Kolozsvár was an impressive person, and he tried to turn Bolyai against mathematics and towards religious philosophy.
* Bolyai on the other hand had wide ranging interests, science, mathematics, and literature all interested him and in 1795 after leaving the College he spent a few weeks considering a career as an actor.
* First they reached Jena where Bolyai for the first time began to study mathematics systematically.
* After six months in Jena Bolyai and Kemény went to Göttingen.
* This was the time when one could say that Bolyai really became a mathematician.
* By the autumn of 1798 Bolyai and Kemény had completed their studies but back in Hungary Baron Kemény had hit hard times financially and although he supplied enough money for his son to return, Bolyai was left penniless in Göttingen.
* In Zsuzsanna's parents home on 15 December 1802 their son János Bolyai was born.
* When Farkas Bolyai was offered a job at the Calvinist College in Marosvásárhely he was rather reluctant to accept but his father, wanting his son to have a secure job, pressed him to accept.
* Bolyai taught mathematics, physics and chemistry at Marosvásárhely for the rest of his life.
* Life was not easy for Bolyai in Marosvásárhely.
* Life was not easy at home too, for Bolyai's wife was a difficult person to live with and became increasingly difficult over the years as her health steadily deteriorated.
* Bolyai taught his son János mathematics, for this was the subject which he hoped that he would follow.
* Mathematics, the subject which Farkas Bolyai loved, was relegated to something to do for relaxation.
* Three years later, on 18 September 1821 Bolyai's wife died.
* Through all these difficult years Bolyai was working on the Tentamen, his mathematical masterpiece published in 1832.
* All his life Bolyai was interested in the foundations of geometry and the parallel axiom.
* The Tentamen is built on Bolyai's belief that mathematics consists of arithmetic and geometry with arithmetic as the mathematics of time and geometry as the mathematics of space.
* The problem which had perplexed Bolyai most in his study of mathematics had been the independence of Euclid's Fifth postulate.
* There are other ideas in the Tentamen which show the quality of Bolyai as a mathematician.
* However, in 1825 Bolyai's son János showed him his discovery of non-euclidean geometry.
* At first Farkas Bolyai was not enthusiastic but certainly by 1830 he had become enthusiastic for at this stage he persuaded János to write up his discoveries.
* Bolyai retired from his teaching in 1851 and after a number of strokes, died five years later.

Born 9 February 1775, Bolya (near Nagyszeben), Transylvania, Hungary (now Sibiu, Romania). Died 20 November 1856, Marosvásárhely, Transylvania, Hungary (now Târgu-Mureș, Romania).
