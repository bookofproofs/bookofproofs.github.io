**Farkas Bolyai** was a mathematics teacher, best known as the father of János Bolyai.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first ever geometric representation of non-Euclidean geometry.
2. Proposed the axiom of parallels, which states that if two lines are not parallel, they must intersect.
3. He pioneered the use of point sets for analytic geometry and introduced a concept of zero curvature in two dimensions.
4. Discovered important new relationships concerning the theory of parallel lines.
5. Found new methods for computing the area of any region through integration.
6. Developed the theory of imaginary numbers.
7. Introduced an intuitive approach to geometry involving an unorthodox view of a point's existence.
8. Developed an original system of kinematics, which he called the Bolyai-Trentini system, for the experimental study of motion.
9. Compiled his research on non-Euclidean geometry in a single major work, the Appendices to the Science of Absolute Space.

Born 9 February 1775, Bolya (near Nagyszeben), Transylvania, Hungary (now Sibiu, Romania). Died 20 November 1856, Marosvásárhely, Transylvania, Hungary (now Târgu-Mureș, Romania).
