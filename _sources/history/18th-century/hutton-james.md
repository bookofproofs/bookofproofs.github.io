**James Hutton** was a Scottish chemist and geologist best known for his theory of the age of the Earth. He was greatly influenced by Newton's work.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a fomula that could calculate the age of the chalk and basalt strata of the Scottish Highlands, which could be used to estimate the age of the Earth.
2. Recognized the compelling evidence in stratigraphic layers and unconformities, which he called "Theory of the Earth", which demonstrated that Earth is much older than previously thought.
3. Pioneered the notion of Uniformitarianism, which proposed that the same processes that shape and change the Earth in the present have been at work on the Earth for millions of years.
4. Observed erosion, faulting, and sediment deposition as prominent geological activities and argued for the gradualistic development of the Earth.
5. Established that sedimentary rocks had been laid down and compressed over long periods of time rather than instantaneously, as had been previously believed.
6. Provided mathematical evidence that erosion and sedimentation had been occurring for thousands of years.

Born 3 June 1726, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 26 March 1797, Edinburgh, Scotland.
