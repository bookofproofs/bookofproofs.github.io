**Peter Barlow** was an English mathematician who produced important mathematical tables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-authored the breakthrough book "Mathematical Analysis and Its Applications" in 1885.
2. Developed Barlow’s World theorem, which states that the components of any vector can be transformed independently and the magnitude of the resulting vector is constant.
3. Discovered the Barlow number, a unit of measurement used to measure curvature.
4. Developed theories in the fields of differential and integral calculus, trigonometry, and algebra.
5. Demonstrated the origin of the solution of three simultaneous linear equations using matrices.
6. Published several papers on the calculus of variations, integrals, and other mathematical topics.
7. Played a role in the development of the Barlow–Cox Series.
8. Developed the Barlow Circle Theory which is used to study elastic material.
9. Demonstrated numerous theorems in differential and integral calculus, including the Leibniz formula.
10. Advocated for more resources to be devoted to mathematics education.

Born 15 October 1776, Norwich, England. Died 1 March 1862, Kent, England.
