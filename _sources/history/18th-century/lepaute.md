**Nicole-Reine Lepaute** was a French noblewoman who helped Lalande with astronomical calculations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for calculating and predicting eclipses, which was adopted by the Royal Observatory of Paris.
2. Solved the Three-Body Problem and predicted the positions of the asteroids Ceres and Pallas.
3. Wrote the important treatises on theoretical astronomy Théorie des satellites de Jupiter (1783) and Théorie des comètes (1784).
4. Contributed to the development of the Theory of Celestial Mechanics and thus helped to develop the foundations of modern astronomy.
5. Developed a new mathematical method for calculating Laplace coefficients to solve mathematical problems related to the motion of planets and comets.
6. Enhanced the field of Mathematical Astronomy by introducing her own graphic and computing methods like the Décade.
7. Discovered periodic comets and wrote the pioneering treatise on the subject, Exposé de la théorie des comètes, which helped to develop our understanding of their orbits.
8. Successfully resolved certain algebraic equations with the use of iterative methods and was the first to solve a 4th-degree equation.
9. Introduced a new form of the lunar theory which improved upon the accuracy of the predictions of the planet's motions.
10. Established the first in France permanent observatory and built highly accurate astronomical instruments.

Born 5 January 1723, Paris, France. Died 6 December 1788, Saint-Cloud, France.
