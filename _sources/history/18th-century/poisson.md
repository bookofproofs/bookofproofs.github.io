**Siméon-Denis Poisson** worked on definite integrals and Fourier series. This was the foundation of later work in this area by Dirichlet and Riemann.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made significant contributions to the field of analysis, particularly in the study of curved surfaces, differential equations, and the calculus of variations. 
2. Developed the Poisson integral formula, which expresses the solution of Laplace's equation in two dimensions.
3. Discovered the Poisson distribution which, among other applications, is used to describe the frequency of events in a given time period. 
4. Was the first to prove Cauchy's Convergence Theorem, which states that a sequence of functions converges uniformly if and only if the sequence of its derivatives converges in a particular manner. 
5. Demonstrated the importance of potential theory by using it to investigate the orbits of moving planets. 
6. Helped develop the concept of local minima, a key tool in mathematical optimization. 
7. Discovered the Poisson summation formula, which assists in deriving mathematical results pertaining to infinite sums. 
8. Developed the Poisson kernel, which can be used to construct solutions to certain elliptic partial differential equations. 
9. Works on game theory and probability are referenced to this day. 
10. Was the first to devise a fruitful and systematic approach to the mathematical theory of elasticity.

Born 21 June 1781, Pithiviers, France. Died 25 April 1840, Sceaux (near Paris), France.
