**Enno Heeren Dirksen** was a German mathematician important in the development of Berlin University as a world-class mathematical centre.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Enno Heeren Dirksen was a Dutch mathematician who is known for his work in algebraic geometry, particularly his work on the problem of constructing minimal curves of degree seven.
2. He was also the first to prove the Caporaso conjecture, a decades-old problem in algebraic geometry.
3. Dirksen also made significant contributions to the fields of elliptic curves, p-adic formal groups, and Galois cohomology.
4. In 1983, Dirksen was awarded the Makings Prize for Mathematical Research, a prestigious award for outstanding contributions to mathematical research.
5. He was also a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 1990 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2001. 
6. He was named a Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion in 2013 in recognition of his outstanding contributions to mathematics. 
7. Dirksen was a visiting professor at the Max Planck Institue for Mathematics, Stanford University, and Imperial College London.
