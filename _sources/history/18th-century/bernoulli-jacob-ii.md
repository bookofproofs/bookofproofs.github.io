**Jacob (II) Bernoulli** was a member of the Swiss Bernoulli family who worked on mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Jacob (II) applied for the chair and presented a work on mathematical physics to support his application.
* Jacob (II) Bernoulli was unlucky and he was not offered this position which he would really have liked.
* St Petersburg, built on 42 islands in the Neva River, is a city of waterways and bridges and because of this it is called the "Venice of the North." This has great attraction but Jacob (II) Bernoulli drowned, while still only 29 years of age, in the Neva River while he was swimming.

Born 17 October 1759, Basel, Switzerland. Died 15 August 1789, St Petersburg, Russia.
