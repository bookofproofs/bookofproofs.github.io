**Jacob (II) Bernoulli** was a member of the Swiss Bernoulli family who worked on mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1782 Jacob (II) Bernoulli's uncle Daniel Bernoulli died and his chair of physics in Basel became vacant.
* Jacob (II) applied for the chair and presented a work on mathematical physics to support his application.
* Jacob (II) Bernoulli was unlucky and he was not offered this position which he would really have liked.
* Despite the rather harsh climate, the city of St Petersburg had great attractions for Jacob(II) Bernoulli since his uncle Daniel Bernoulli had worked there with Euler.
* In fact Jacob(II) married a granddaughter of Euler in St Petersburg but, tragically, the city was to lead to his death.
* St Petersburg, built on 42 islands in the Neva River, is a city of waterways and bridges and because of this it is called the "Venice of the North." This has great attraction but Jacob (II) Bernoulli drowned, while still only 29 years of age, in the Neva River while he was swimming.

Born 17 October 1759, Basel, Switzerland. Died 15 August 1789, St Petersburg, Russia.
