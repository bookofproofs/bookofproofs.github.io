**Jacob (II) Bernoulli** was a member of the Swiss Bernoulli family who worked on mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Jacob (II) Bernoulli developed a calculus of variations which he applied to problems in mechanics, geometry, and astronomy
2. He discovered the famous Bernoulli numbers in a paper entitled Specimen Investigationis de SERIEBUS INFINITISTARUM and in this work also derived the binomial theorem
3. He developed integral calculus and made several advances in the field, such as introducing the concepts of the Taylor series, L'HÃ´pital's rule and the Bernoulli differential equation
4. His work on series, Geometric Exercises,was the first book on probability theoretical principles in the western world
5. He established the law of large numbers, also known as Bernoulli's theorem, which states that in a repeated independent trials, the expected value of the critical random variable increases with the number of trials 
6. He proved that the probability of a coin turning up heads is the same for every single toss
7. He formulated the law of homogeneity for large numbers, now known as Bernoulli's weak law of large numbers
8. He produced some of the earliest work in the field of calculus of variations, pioneering mathematical analysis of the catenary curve

Born 17 October 1759, Basel, Switzerland. Died 15 August 1789, St Petersburg, Russia.
