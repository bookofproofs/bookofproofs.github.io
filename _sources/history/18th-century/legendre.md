**Adrien-Marie Legendre**'s major work on elliptic integrals provided basic analytical tools for mathematical physics. He gave a simple proof that `$\pi$` is irrational as well as the first proof that `$\pi^2$` is irrational.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the Legendre polynomial and developed the Legendre transform.
2. Pioneered least squares regression analysis, now known as the method of least squares.
3. Developed the theory of elliptic functions into a system of differential equations.
4. Established the important results now known as Legendre's theorem in number theory.
5. Discovered the Legendre symbol and associated quadratic reciprocity law.
6. Produced the first proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem in the special case of a≡2 (mod 3).
7. Disproved the assumptions of Frullani's theorem on the logarithmic integration of algebraic functions. 
8. Constructed a useful method for approximating definite integrals named for him as the Legendre Integral.
9. Proved the Abel–Ruffini theorem that some equations of degree five or higher cannot be solved by radicals.

Born 18 September 1752, Paris, France. Died 10 January 1833, Paris, France.
