**Bernard Bolzano** successfully freed calculus from the concept of the infinitesimal. He also gave examples of 1-1 correspondences between the elements of an infinite set and the elements of a proper subset.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new system of logical analysis, which became known as Bolzano-Wright logic, wherein logical assumptions could be tested to the point of strict proof.
2. Put forth an early version of the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that any continuous function must take on any value within a certain range at least once.
3. Showed the relationships between analytic geometry and algebraic equations.
4. Discovered several important types of curves such as hypercycles and other algebraic functions.
5. Developed the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that any bounded sequence of real numbers must have at least one accumulation point.
6. Discovered the principle of least action in classical mechanics, which states that a physical path between two states must minimize the quantity of action.
7. Developed Bolzano's Paradox, which states that any set of real numbers can be both bounded and unbounded at the same time—a paradox which eventually led to the development of non-Euclidean geometry.
8. Published the foundational textbooks “A Mathematical Philosophy” and “Theory of Science”, which introduced new language and formal approaches to the study of mathematical abstractions.

Born 5 October 1781, Prague, Bohemia, Austrian Habsburg domain (now Czech Republic). Died 18 December 1848, Prague, Bohemia (now Czech Republic).
