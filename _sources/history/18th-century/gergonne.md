**Joseph Gergonne** was a French mathematician who published an influential journal and made contributions to duality theory in projective geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However, he died when Joseph was twelve years old.
* Joseph was educated at the Collège de Nancy which was a religious establishment.
* Gergonne gave his support becoming a captain in the National Guard.
* The Assembly called for 100,000 military volunteers and Gergonne joined the French army being assembled to defend Paris against the Prussians.
* On 20 September 1792 Kellermann led the French forces at Valmy with Gergonne in his army.
* Following this great French victory, Gergonne went to Paris where he became a secretary to his uncle.
* Gergonne returned to the French army, this time as secretary to the general staff of the Moselle army.
* Gergonne spent a month at the Châlons artillery school in 1794 and after this he was commissioned as a lieutenant.
* Gergonne was attached to these forces which entered Spain and laid siege to the town of Figueras capturing it.
* At this stage Gergonne was sent with his regiment to Nimes in southern France.
* In that city the École Centrale had been set up shortly before and Gergonne was appointed to the chair of transcendental mathematics.
* Gergonne, however, settled down at this point.
* Finding problems getting his mathematics papers published, Gergonne established his own mathematics journal, the first part appearing in 1810.
* The Journal was officially called the Annales de mathématiques pures et appliquées Ⓣ(Annals of Pure and Applied Mathematics) but became known as Annales de Gergonne .
* Gergonne's mathematical interests were in geometry so it is not surprising that it was this topic which figured most prominently in his journal.
* In fact many famous mathematicians published in the twenty-one volumes of the Annales de Gergonne which appeared during a period of twenty-two years.
* In addition to Gergonne himself (who published around 200 articles), Poncelet, Servois, Bobillier, Steiner, Plücker, Chasles, Brianchon, Dupin, Lamé, Galois and many others had papers appear in the Journal.
* In 1813 Gergonne wrote a prize winning essay for the Bordeaux Academy Methods of synthesis and analysis in mathematics.
* The essay tells us a lot about Gergonne's mathematical ideas.
* Perhaps surprisingly, since Gergonne was himself a geometer, he suggests that algebra is a more important topic than geometry.
* We will examine Gergonne's contributions to geometry later in this article, but for the moment it is worth noting that he did publish on other topics.
* Gergonne looked at how to estimate the values of the response function, and of its derivatives, at a point when there are random errors in the observed values.
* Gergonne was appointed to the chair of astronomy at the University of Montpellier in 1816.
* It was in 1830 that Gergonne became rector of the University of Montpellier.
* Gergonne retired in 1844 at the age of 73.
* Gergonne provided an elegant solution to the Problem of Apollonius in 1816.
* Gergonne introduced the word polar and the principle of duality in projective geometry was one of his main contributions.
* Gergonne's first contributions to duality appear in a series of papers beginning in 1810.
* We have already illustrated Gergonne's interest in the philosophy of mathematics with a description of his unpublished essay on the topic in 1813.

Born 19 June 1771, Nancy, France. Died 4 May 1859, Montpellier, France.
