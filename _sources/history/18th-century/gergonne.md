**Joseph Gergonne** was a French mathematician who published an influential journal and made contributions to duality theory in projective geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Law of Inertia (1811). 
2. Founded modern differential geometry (1824). 
3. Developed the theory of parallel lines (1826). 
4. Established the first modern journal for mathematics (1810). 
5. Generalized the notion of the limit of a function (1820). 
6. Was an early proponent of mathematical analysis (1806). 
7. Developed Gergonne's Theorem, which states that a straight line through two points of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments of unequal length (1820s). 
8. Established the scale of arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means (1815). 
9. Developed the theory of homology (1820s). 
10. Discovered the Gergonne Point, or the point at which the three altitudes of a triangle intersect (1820s).

Born 19 June 1771, Nancy, France. Died 4 May1859, Montpellier, France.
