**Martin Ohm** wa a German mathematician who attempted to put mathematics on to a rigorous basis. He was the brother of the better known Georg Ohm.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a unified approach to teaching algebra, geometry, and trigonometry based on the concept of arithmetical operations.
2. Published "The Elements of Algebra" in 1826, which became the basis for teaching mathematics in many schools across Germany.
3. Established an influential figure for teaching mathematics education at the University of GÃ¶ttingen.
4. Authored several books aimed at students learning mathematics, including "Der Mathematische Unterricht" (1833) and "Grundriss der Elementarabschnitte der Mathematik" (1832).
5. Developed Ohm's Law, which states that the current (I) passing through a conductor is proportional to the potential difference (V) applied across its ends.
6. Discovered the mathematical relationship between the conductance of a circuit, the potential difference applied to it, and the current that flows through it.

Born 6 May 1792, Erlangen, Bavaria (now Germany). Died 1 April 1872, Berlin, Prussia, German Empire.
