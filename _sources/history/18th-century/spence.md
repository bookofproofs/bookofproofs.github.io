**William Spence** was a Scottish mathematician who worked on logarithmic functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In the summer, together with his friends, Spence went fishing or looking for birds' nests.
* As he grew up Spence turned from reading adventure stories to reading biography and history.
* Eventually Spence gave up learning business skills and devoted himself entirely to the study of science.
* The essays of William Spence were very astronomical, we thought them profound; they were all about planets and comets, the cosmogony of the earth, the infinite divisibility of matter, and the boundless of nature, premundane space; any thing of this world was too gross to enter into his speculative theories.
* In 1805, in the company of his school friend James Park, Spence visited many places in England, spending some time with Galt, who was at that time living in London.
* In 1808 Spence was again in London, and during the several months that he lived there, he published An Essay on the various Orders of logarithmic Transcendents; with an Inquiry into their Applications to the Integral Calculus, and the Summation of Series.
* Spence gave the results to nine decimal places and we note that he did not round off his tables.
* The first comprehensive detailed study of the function is the essay of Spence (1809), which was generally not referenced on the continent for several decades.
* It is clear that Spence must have read Lagrange's 1770 paper Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations for he tries to make a systematic approach to solving equations of degree 2, 3 and 4 using symmetrical functions of the roots as does Lagrange.
* This makes it sound as if Spence follows Lagrange rather closely but this is certainly not the case for he gives his own approach to solving these equations.
* However Spence was taken ill at Glasgow, and died in the inn in which they had put up for the night.
* After Spence died, John Herschel edited Mathematical Essays by the late William Spence which was published by Oliver and Boyd in Edinburgh in 1819.
* The others were selected from Mr Spence's papers by the editor, J F W Herschel, Esq., who was pre-eminently qualified to judge the respective merits of the several pieces.
* These papers clearly prove, that Mr Spence possessed both genius and industry in a high degree, and a force of intellect of a very superior kind.
* Finally we should record Spence's musical abilities.
* A few years after his death, a Marble Tablet bearing an inscription written by Galt, was erected to Spence's memory by several of his friends in the Middle Parish Church in Greenock.
* The Spence library in Greenock was founded by Spence's widow and contains his books.

Born 31 July 1777, Greenock, Scotland. Died 22 May 1815, Glasgow, Scotland.
