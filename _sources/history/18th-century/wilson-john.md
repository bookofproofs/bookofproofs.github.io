**John Wilson** is best known for [Wilson's theorem][bookofproofs$8193]: If `$p$` is prime then `$1 + (p - 1)!$` is divisible by `$p$`.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* John Junior, the subject of this biography, attended school at Staveley, near Kendal.
* Before he took his final examinations Wilson had already gained a strong reputation and he had also attracted considerable attention by defending Waring, who was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, from strong attacks which had been made on him as a result of his text Miscellanea analytica â“‰(Miscellaneous analysis).
* On 7 July 1764 Wilson was elected a Fellow of Peterhouse and he taught mathematics at Cambridge with great skill, quickly gaining an outstanding reputation for himself.
* Almost certainly Wilson's theorem was a guess made by him, based on the evidence of a number of special cases, which neither he nor Waring knew how to prove.
* Almost certainly Wilson's interest in mathematics continued during his legal career for he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 13 March 1782.
* At the time that Wilson served on this body it was one of three courts which dealt with common-law business.
* On 7 April 1788 Wilson married Mary Ann Adair, who was the daughter of a sergeant-at-law; John and Mary Wilson had a son and two daughters.
* The marriage, however, was not to be a long one for Wilson died only five years after his marriage.

Born 6 August 1741, Applethwaite, Westmoreland, England. Died 18 October 1793, Kendal, Westmoreland, England.
