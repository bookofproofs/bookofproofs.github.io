**Caspar Wessel** was a Norwegian mathematician who invented a geometric way of representing complex numbers which pre-dated Argand.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Caspar Wessel published a groundbreaking paper titled 'Fundamenta Nova Theoriae Functionum Ultrarotundarum' in 1797, where he laid the foundation for the modern concept of complex numbers.
2. He also developed the analytic representation of a complex number as a point in a plane.
3. Caspar Wessel is credited to having defined the complex logarithm, which improved the calculation of power series expansions. 
4. He presented a Treatise on the Theory of Conjugate Functions, which was the first systematic presentation of the calculus of complex numbers. 
5. He defined the expression arg(z) for the argument of a complex number in his paper Mémoire sur le calcul et sur les fonctions des quantités imaginaires (1799). 
6. He also determined the integral of the geometric power series and evaluated the Gaussian hypergeometric series.

Born 8 June 1745, Vestby (near Dröbak), Norway. Died 25 March 1818, Copenhagen, Denmark.
