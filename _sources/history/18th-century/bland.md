**Miles Bland** was a 19th century mathematician, a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, then later vicar of Lilley in Hertfordshire. He wrote a number of mathematical textbooks which proved very popular, one running to nine editions over nearly forty years. He also wrote some religious texts.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Their surname is derived from Bland, or Bland's-Gill, a hamlet in the chapelry of Howgill, and Parish of Sedbergh.
* We were slightly surprised that obituaries of Miles Bland mention much about the Bland family but little or nothing about his parents.
* Thomas Bland was baptised on 10 April 1728 in the Parish Church of Sedbergh, the son of Myles Bland.
* Thomas married Esther Siddal (born 1760) on 29 June 1786; their son Miles Bland, the subject of this biography, was born on 11 October 1786 and baptised on 12 November 1786.
* Their daughter, Margaret Bland, was baptised on 9 January 1788.
* Thomas Bland, Miles' father, was buried in the Parish Church on 18 July 1790 at the age of 62.
* Esther Bland, Miles' mother, died at the age of 38 and was buried in the Parish Church on 3 February 1799.
* Miles was educated at Sedbergh School.
* The headmaster of Sedbergh School, who arrived in 1799 in the middle of Bland's time at the school, was William Stevens.
* We do not know what Bland's opinion was of Stevens but, after the death of both Stevens and his wife in 1819 leaving a large family in financial difficulty, Bland succeeded in raising a large sum from former pupils of the school to support the Stevens family.
* Bland was in the same class at Sedbergh School as Adam Sedgwick (1785-1873) and both went up to Cambridge in 1804.
* Bland was admitted to St John's College as a sizar on 11 June 1804, and matriculated in October of that year at the start of the Michaelmas term.
* Bland was wont to say that Dawson had had eleven Senior Wranglers for pupils, and intended him to be the twelfth; but he was second to Bickersteth, afterwards Lord Langdale; Blomfield, afterwards Bishop of London, being third.
* Bland was Second Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos examinations of 1808 and was the Second Smith's Prizeman.
* Bland was elected a Fellow at St John's College on 5 April 1808 and, in addition to teaching mathematics, worked towards being ordained, a necessary career path for fellows until the mid 19th century.
* In 1814, 1815 and in 1816 Miles Bland was a Moderator of the Mathematical Tripos.
* Bland continued as a Tutor, first as Assistant Tutor, and afterwards as joint Tutor with Thomas Waldron Hornbuckle (1775-1848), till 1823, when he took the College living of Lilley, in Hertfordshire.
* Bland married soon after taking up the living of Lilley, a small village north of Luton.
* Miles and Ann Bland had two sons, Miles Bland baptised 17 September 1828 in Lilley, Hertfordfordshire (died 1881) and George Templeman Bland baptised 30 April 1830 in Ramsgate, Kent (died 1856).
* They also had a daughter Catherine Henrietta Law Bland, baptised on 15 July 1824 in Lilley, Hertford (married Thomas De Freyne French on 20 August 1867 and died in 1888).
* Let us continue the story of Bland's family life.
* His wife, Ann Bland, died and was buried on 2 September 1831.
* Bland married Emma Russell on 14 June 1836 in Christ Church, St Marylebone, Westminster, England.
* At the time of the 1851 UK Census the family, consisting of Miles and Emma Bland and Miles' daughter Catherine Henrietta Law Bland, are living at Lilley.
* After he left his position as a fellow and tutor at St John's College, Bland continued to publish new mathematical texts and also bring out new editions of all these works.
* Clearly Bland must have intended to write two further volumes on St Luke's Gospel and St John's Gospel.
* We should note Bland was one of the first fellows of the Royal Astronomical Society.
* Bland was one of thirteen proposed for membership at the meeting of 14 April 1820, all being elected at the meeting of 9 June 1820.
* Miles was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 12 April 1821.

Born 11 October 1786, Sedbergh, Yorkshire, England. Died 27 December 1867, Ramsgate, Kent, England.
