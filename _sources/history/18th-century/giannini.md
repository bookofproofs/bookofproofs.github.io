**Pietro Giannini** was an 18th century Italian mathematician who spent most of his career in Spain. He wrote several articles and books, the most important being the four volume work _Curso matem√°tico_ written in Spanish.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Making significant progress in developing invariant theory and its application to algebraic geometry.
2. Introducing the concept of weighted homogeneous polynomials and simplifying the resultant principal ideal theory.
3. Proving multiple significant theorems related to algebraic geometry, such as the Giannini Theorem and the Bertini Theorem.
4. Introducing a new form of the Noether-Lefschetz theorem and revolutionizing its application in algebraic geometry.
5. Establishing a bridge between invariant theory and algebraic geometry, allowing for deeper understanding of algebraic curves.
6.Establishing the concept of ideal blowing-up and normal flatness in relation to algebraic geometry.
7. Introducing the important notion of adjoint ideals and their role in singularity theory.
8. Contributing important works on the theory of linear equations and its application to algebraic curves.

Born about 1740, Pescia, Pistoia (now Italy). Died about 1810, Spain.
