**Barnabé Brisson** was a French engineer who built canals. He also worked on partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the third equation of motion in 1583, providing the first mathematical description of motion and linking mathematics to the physical world.
2. First to posit the idea of instantaneous velocity in 1607.
3. Pioneered the use of analytical geometry, transforming the subject from a a rule-of-thumb geometrical technique to a tool of rigorous mathematical analysis. 
4. Discovered the close relationship between uniform motion (constant speed) and its time derivative (acceleration), describing a law of motion he called "quantity and quality."
5. Developed key ideas in differential calculus through the two-variable analysis of tangents and the recognition of the inverse squared nature of force.
6. Explored the reciprocal relationship between angle and slope in 1583.
7. Made contributions to Optics, Geography, Astronomy and Latin Lexicography.

Born 11 October 1777, Lyon, France. Died 25 September 1828, Nevers, France.
