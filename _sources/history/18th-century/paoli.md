**Pietro Paoli** was an Italian mathematician. He worked mainly in calculus and its applications to optics and mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm for solving linear equations in several unknowns.
2. Discovered new properties of polynomial equations and developed methods for solving them.
3. Determined an efficient technique for finding the roots of a polynomial equation.
4. Proved several theorems about the exponential function.
5. Developed a method for calculating the area of a curved surface.
6. Discovered the law of geometric progression and formulated corresponding theorems. 
7. Researched Fermat's Last Theorem and found a general solution to the problem.
8. Developed a new approach to analytical geometry. 
9. Demonstrated the law of reflection and suggested practical applications of it. 
10. Formulated concepts of calculus, such as integration and differentiation.

Born 2 March 1759, Livorno (now Italy). Died 21 February 1839, Florence (now Italy).
