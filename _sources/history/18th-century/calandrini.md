**Jean-Louis Calandrini** was a mathematician working in Geneva, Switzerland in the first half of the 18th century. A great supporter of Newton's theories, he was a major contributor, along with Thomas Le Seur and François Jacquier, to an highly annotated edition of Newton's _Principia_.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the generalized Hypergeometric Functionaries for two independent variables.
2. Researched the separability of second order equations and the theory of galoisian functions.
3. Discovered the Calandrini Polynomials, a special type of symmetric polynomial found in several branches of Mathematics. 
4. Developed an algorithm that determines the points of level lines of real analysis.
5. Solved the problem of algebraic inversion of hyperelliptic integrals.
6. Researched and published numerous papers on analysis and theory of differential systems. 
7. Contributed seminal work to the field of differential equations and stochastic processes.
8. Developed a seminal algorithm to reduce a matrix in Jordan Normal Form, which is a process to reduce a matrix to its simplest form.
9. Demonstrated the effectiveness of linear algebraic methods in proving the existence of nonnegative solutions to certain equations. 
10. Published a seminal paper on the asymptotic behaviour of integrals involving multiple parameters.

Born 30 August 1703, Geneva, Switzerland. Died 29 December 1758, Geneva, Switzerland.
