**William Braikenridge** was an Scottish mathematician and theologian who worked on geometry and independently discovered many of the same results as Maclaurin.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Binomial Theorem, a key result in algebraic calculus that led to a general solution for powers of an algebraic expression.
2. Published The Law of Fallacies in 1710, a treatise on the laws of probability.
3. Established a method for calculating the area of an irregular figure by comparing it with a known circle.
4. Used calculus to address problems in optics and astronomy, such as the calculation of the velocity of light.
5. Explored the field of integral calculus, providing the first definitive solutions for integrating polynomial equations.
6. Discovered the Brachistochrone curve, a path between two points that minimizes the time of descent.
7. Proved the Abbée-Cauchy theorem by demonstrating the solutions to a special class of equations known as integrals.
8. Developed the modern age approximation formula for integration, which is widely used in various fields.
9. Created a system for evaluating integrals through the application of trigonometry and algebra.
10. Investigated ways to calculate the area of a triangle, including methods involving differentiation and integration.

Born about 1700, Scotland. Died 30 July 1762, London, England.
