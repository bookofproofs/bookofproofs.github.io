**Alexandre-Theophile Vandermonde** was a French mathematician best known for his work on determinants.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Vandermonde convolution, an identity expressing the product of two power series in terms of sums of smaller products. 
2. Developed a method for computing determinants of matrices, now referred to as "Vandermonde's determinant theorem".
3. Expanded the theory of number fields and the theory of algebraic equations.
4. Pioneered the field of combinatorics.
5. Derived a formula for the number of permutations of n elements which is now referred to as "Vandermonde's identity".
6. Developed the Cramer-Vandermonde identity which relates the determinants of matrices with different numbers of elements.
7. Introduced the concept of polynomials as a function from R to R.
8. Developed a method for solving interpolation problems.
9. Discovered how to solve Diophantine equations.
10. Established the Hermite-Vandermonde identity which expresses the determinant of Vandermonde's matrix.

Born 28 February 1735, Paris, France. Died 1 January 1796, Paris, France.
