**Lorenzo Mascheroni** was a geometer who proved in 1797 that all Euclidean constructions can be made with compasses alone, so a straight edge in not needed.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Mascheroni's Identity, a unique mathematical formula for the calculations related to Gamma functions.
2. Contributed to the development of the modern calculus, particularly in the field of integration theory.
3. Proposed the method for the first direct measure of the intensity of the electric field.
4. Authored numerous mathematical and science textbooks, including:
- Analysis of Infinite Series (1790);
- Calcul de l'intégration des Équations Aux Différences Partielles, et des Équations Intégrales (1790);
- Geometriche Tranzendenten (1797);
- Institutes of Geometry (1798);
- Course of Analytic Geometry and Analytic Mechanics (1821);
- Method of Calculating the Difference of Averages (1825).
5. Elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1808.
6. Appointed as the Director of Studies at the University of Pavia in 1817.

Born 13 May 1750, Bergamo, Lombardo-Veneto (now Italy). Died 14 July 1800, Paris, France.
