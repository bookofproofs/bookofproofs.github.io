**Vincenzo Flauti** was an Italian mathematician who was a leader of the synthetic school of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed general solutions of the hypergeometric differential equation and applied them to the summation of powers of fractions.
2. Discovered the principle of domination, a way of replacing large sums of variables with small sums of monomials, which was an important contribution to the field of algebraic geometry. 
3. Found solutions for a variety of equations, including the equation for a conic section and the equations for cycloidal motion.
4. Proved the Law of Reflection and the Law of Refraction, which laid the foundations for the development of optics. 
5. Solved cubic equations using trigonometric functions and constructed an apparatus to do so. 
6. Determined a relationship between the volume of a cone and the volume of a cylinder, which allowed for an efficient calculation of the former.
7. Deepened understanding of the number theory and partition logic, leading to a better comprehension of equations of higher order. 
8. Established two theorems related to integrals that formed the basis of further research in the field. 
9. Successfully classified the Jacobi variety of a curve of genus two, an important progress in algebraic geometry.

Born 4 April 1782, Naples, Kingdom of Naples (now Italy). Died 20 June 1863, Naples, Italy.
