**Karl von Staudt** was a German mathematician who worked on projective geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Karl von Staudt contributed to the development of projective, non-Euclidean, and differential geometry.
2. He formulated the notion of projectivity and worked out the salient properties of projective spaces.
3. He discovered the theory of axiomatic projective spaces and the properties of projective transformations.
4. He created the basic principles for modern synthetic geometry and introduced the notion of projective duality.
5. He formulated a unified approach based on point-function duality that simplified the treatment of figures and fields.
6. He developed methods for the derivation of linear systems from their geometric configurations.
7. He created a comprehensive theory of invariants and covariants, including the method for enumeration and construction of configurations.
8. He introduced the principle of homology and worked out the fundamental properties of cross-ratios.
9. He made advances in the formalization of rigorous geometry, developing a highly successful version of rigid analytic geometry. 
10. He introduced the equivalence principle as a basis of instructional geometry.

Born 24 January 1798, Imperial Free City of Rothenburg (now Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Germany). Died 1 June 1867, Erlangen, Bavaria (now Germany).
