**Pierre-Joseph-Étienne Finck** wrote books on algebra, mechanics, geometry and analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Finck was then adopted and brought up in the town of Landau in der Pfalz.
* Finck entered the École Polytechnique in 1815, in sixth place in the ranking of students admitted that year.
* The work of the Artillery School did not interest Finck and, in March 1818, he requested that he be allowed to enter the cavalry regiment of the Royal Guard.
* Finck tried again with his request in July of the same year, this time saying that if he was not allowed the move he would resign.
* His request was turned down and Finck resigned.
* However, by March 1819 Finck seems to have decided that his actions had been mistaken since he wrote asking to be readmitted to the Artillery School.
* This request was also turned down: Finck was clearly not very highly regarded at the Artillery School.
* Returning to university, Finck entered the University of Strasbourg in 1821 studying mathematics in the Faculty of Science.
* Before completing his doctoral work, Finck began teaching mathematics at the Artillery School of Strasbourg in 1825, which does have a certain irony after his own experiences as a student at Artillery School.
* In 1842 Finck was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the University of Strasbourg.
* Finck wrote over 20 papers and seven textbooks on mathematics.

Born 15 October 1797, Lauterbourg, France. Died 27 July 1870, Strasbourg, France.
