**Pierre-Joseph-Étienne Finck** wrote books on algebra, mechanics, geometry and analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made significant contributions to the field of analytic geometry with his 1837 treatise, “Cours Élémentaire de Géométrie Analytique.”
2. Developed a novel method for determining the area of an ellipse by studying properties of the rotating ellipse.
3. Pioneered the study of the so-called Finck's catenoid, a minimal surface that he wrote about in his 1845 paper, “Leçon Sur Les Surfaces Minimales.”
4. Developed a simplified proof of Catalan's theorem in the area of analytic geometry and algebra.
5. Independently rediscovered several results of Joseph Louis Lagrange and Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi that had been previously published.
6. Mentored numerous students in mathematics, some of whom went on to have their own successful careers in mathematics and science.
7. Published a posthumously edited collection of his works entitled “Œuvres Achevés de I.E. Finck,” which served as a valuable reference for scientists and mathematicians.

Born 15 October 1797, Lauterbourg, France. Died 27 July 1870, Strasbourg, France.
