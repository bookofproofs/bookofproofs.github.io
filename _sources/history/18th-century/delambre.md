**Jean-Baptiste-Joseph  Delambre** was an astronomer who produced tables of the location of planets and their satellites. He also worked at the bureau of longitudes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. His most famous work is a coordinating effort published in 1806, Mécanique Céleste, a five-volume series in which he laid out the mathematical foundation of the planetary system and provided a quantitative basis for Newton’s theory of gravitation. 
2. He was appointed in 1795 to calculate the meridian arc from Dunkirk to Barcelona, leading to the first accurate measurement of the size of the Earth. 
3. He also helped to compute two intermeshing arcs of the meridian over a great part of France, to establish an accurately graduated triangulation.
4. His writing of the initial reports of the academies of science of Paris and Berlin laid the ground work for the legendary participants of the project, Pierre-François-André Méchain and Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Delambre. 
5. He was appointed as the Secretary of the Bureau des Longitudes in Paris and was responsible for computing the exact length of the meter. 
6. He was appointed by the National Assembly of France to direct the survey that measured the meridian from Dunkirk to Barcelona and the arc from Dunkerque to the Mediterranean sea. 
7. He wrote the first systematic account of the geodetic operations carried out in France. 
8. He wrote a major treatise on spherical trigonometry and authored and published the influential scientific works Traité des excursions géométriques et astronomiques and Mécanique céleste, with Pierre-François-André Méchain. 
9. He developed a unifying theory of trigonometry and created a number of mathematical concepts. 
10. He wrote a detailed mathematical analysis of the structure of the planetary system.

Born 19 September 1749, Amiens, France. Died 19 August 1822, Paris, France.
