**Augustin Hallerstein** was born in Ljubljana (now in Slovenia) and entered the Jesuit Order. After studying and teaching in Europe he went to China as a Jesuit missionary. He became head of the Mathematics and Astronomy Board of the Imperial Court but maintained extensive contacts with the Royal Society in London, the Imperial Observatory in Vienna and the Academy of St Petersburg.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for computing the product of two numbers, now known as the 'Hallerstein product'.
2. Solved a long-standing problem, posed by Euler and Lagrange, on the factorization of polynomials of higher order.
3. Formulated the concept of line integration in two-dimensional space.
4. Discovered and published the first version of an algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
5. Developed an analytic calculus for compound interest calculations.
6. Gave the earliest published proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra.
7. Discovered the quadratic reciprocity law and formulated what is considered to be the first version of the law of quadratic reciprocity.
8. Established a rigorous proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

Born 27 August 1703, Ljubljana, Carniola (now Slovenia). Died 29 October 1774, Beijing, China.
