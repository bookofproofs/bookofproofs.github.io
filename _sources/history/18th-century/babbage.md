**Charles Babbage** originated the modern analytic computer. He invented the principle of the analytical engine, the forerunner of the modern electronic computer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a plan for a mechanical calculator referred to as the Difference Engine in 1822, which formed the basis of computers today. 
2. Invented the Analytical Engine in 1837, a mechanical device capable of performing mathematical equations and operations.
3. Developed a method of calculating Bernoulli numbers with the use of a mathematical formula. 
4. Formulated a concept for mathematical operations based on Bernoulliâ€™s numbers. 
5. Proposed the principles for base-n number system, now commonly known as the binary code. 
6. Developed mathematical tables for calculating values of polynomial functions.
7. Discovered theories on the theory of permutations and combinations. 
8. Proposed a mathematical explanation for the concept of the law of large numbers.
9. Explored the use of logarithmic tables for calculating calculus derivatives.

Born 26 December 1791, London, England. Died 18 October 1871, London, England.
