**Wilhelm Bessel** determined the positions and proper motions of stars. He also used a method of mathematical analysis involving what is now known as the Bessel function.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed axiomatic foundations of trigonometry.
2. Founded the first rigorous approach to the theory of errors in mathematical calculations. 
3. Developed the Bessel Function, which acts as a solution to multiple differential equations and has applications in a variety of areas of applied mathematics. 
4. Conducted pioneering work on the theory of planet motion and its use in deriving improved formulas for computing the orbits of comets. 
5. Established precise instruments to measure parallax, leading to improved accuracy in celestial measurements. 
6. Played an important role in the development of the theory of Lissajous curves. 
7. Demonstrated the difference between the inverse-square law of gravity and Kepler's laws. 
8. Established accurate methods of defining longitude at sea. 
9. Introduced a method for solving linear partial differential equations, which is now referred to as Bessel’s Equation. 
10. Published the first comprehensive work on the theory of Bessel Functions.

Born 22 July 1784, Minden, Westphalia (now Germany). Died 17 March 1846, Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia).
