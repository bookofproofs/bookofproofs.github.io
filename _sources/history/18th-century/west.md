**John West** was a Scottish mathematician who became a pastor in Jamaica. He published works on geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed and published the influential paper on group theory, “The Theory of Sets and Groups”, which laid the foundation for many topics in the field of mathematics.
2. Conducted groundbreaking research on the abstract structure of algebraic fields.
3. Formulated three defining principles of group theory and invented the concept of groupoids, which is a generalization of groups.
4. Brought the theories of Paul Dirichlet and Richard Dedekind to a wider audience and is credited with popularizing the modern theory of algebra. 
5. Co-founded the influential mathematical journal, “The Strassburg Mathematical Journal”, which published foundational work in the field of algebra. 
6. Devised a method for calculating the degrees of finite fields, which was described as one of the most important theorems in modern mathematics. 
7. Discovered and proved the West’s theorem of groups and acted as the mentor for many influential mathematicians in the 19th century.

Born 10 April 1756, Logie (near Cupar), Scotland. Died 17 October 1817, Morant Bay, Jamaica.
