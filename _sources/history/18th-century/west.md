**John West** was a Scottish mathematician who became a pastor in Jamaica. He published works on geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Samuel was a Church of Scotland minister in Logie, about ten km north west of St Andrews, from 1751.
* John was the second of his parents' four sons, the eldest being Stewart and the two younger being Maurice and Samuel.
* John matriculated at the University of St Andrews in 1769 at the age of thirteen and was successful in his studies winning prizes for mathematics and physics.
* Nicholas Vilant was the regius professor of mathematics at St Andrews when West was a student, but around 1775 his health deteriorated and he employed assistants.
* West was assistant to Nicholas Vilant from 1775 to 1780 in which year he was given full charge of all mathematics classes at St Andrews.
* While teaching at St Andrews, West taught John Leslie and James Ivory.
* Let us look now at West's Elements of Mathematics (1784).
* The second is to say that, although not a commentary on Euclid's Elements, nevertheless it does follow a similar path albeit with West's own ordering and own proofs.
* Two manuscript treatises were sent, after his death, to John Leslie, but these were not published until 1838.
* These show West to have been familiar with the works of Lagrange, Laplace and Arbogast and, had they been published promptly, would have established him as a leading British exponent of Continental analysis and its applications.
* West died in Jamaica.

Born 10 April 1756, Logie (near Cupar), Scotland. Died 17 October 1817, Morant Bay, Jamaica.
