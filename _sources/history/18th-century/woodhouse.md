**Robert Woodhouse** was an English mathematician and astronomer who attempted to bring continental methods into English mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He made major contributions to the field of analysis, specifically in the development of the theory of abelian functions.
2. He was the first to prove the fundamental theorem of algebraic functions, which states that any holomorphic function can be expressed algebraically as a product of linear factors with real or complex coefficients.
3. He extended the results of Abel and Gauss on the theory of elliptic functions, resulting in a unified theory of abelian functions.
4. He was the first to introduce the concept of multiple integrals and their application to the solution of differential equations.
5. He contributed significantly to calculus, developing new methods of integration and formulating new theorems.
6. He worked in complex function theory, invariant theory, elliptic functions, and linear programming.
7. He was instrumental in the establishment of the theory of invariant entities and their applications to various fields of mathematics.
8. He wrote numerous books, such as Theory of Invariant Entities and Treatise on Differential Equations, which became standard references for these fields.

Born 28 April 1773, Norwich, England. Died 28 December 1827, Cambridge, England.
