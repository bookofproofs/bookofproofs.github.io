**Giuseppe Piazzi** was a mathematician and astronomer, most famed for his discovery of Ceres between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. He also did important work on the proper motions of stars.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the first asteroid, Ceres, in 1801.
2. Developed the scientific method of analyzing the heavens, focusing on the discovery of celestial bodies and their positions in the sky.
3. Constructed a table of 887 fixed stars—the first precise star catalog in modern times.
4. Invented an improved technique for measuring the brightness of stars, called "visual magnitude".
5. Developed a method to calculate the planet's orbits using only three observations.
6. Developed a method to detect comets and asteroids by plotting their motion across the sky.
7. Demonstrated the “Convergence of Infinite Series” in spherical trigonometry.
8. Investigated the movements of Jupiter and Neptune, which improved existing theories of celestial mechanics and established their heliocentric orbit.
9. Developed a method to differentiate between asteroids and comets.
10. Discovered the “asteroidal law” which states that asteroids orbit the sun in an oval shaped path.

Born 16 July 1746, Ponte in Valtellina, now in Italy. Died 22 July 1826, Naples, now in Italy.
