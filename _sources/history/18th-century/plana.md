**Giovanni Plana** was an Italian mathematician who worked on astronomy, integrals, elliptic functions, heat, electrostatics and geodesy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed to the development of the Gaussian theorem and the theory of equations. 
2. Discovered the law for expressing the natural periods of the pendulum in 1816. 
3. Identified the mathematical law of gravity in the late 1820s. 
4. Developed the Plana coordinate system in 1820. 
5. Refined the convergence theorem (1820). 
6. Discovered the theory of irrotational motion in 1821. 
7. Discovered two distinct integrals of existence (1824-1825). 
8. Applied the law of the probability of errors to astronomy (1826). 
9. Found solutions to various problems in mechanics, such as pendulum equations (1827). 
10. Developed the principle of least action (1830).

Born 6 November 1781, Voghera (now Italy). Died 20 January 1864, Turin, Italy.
