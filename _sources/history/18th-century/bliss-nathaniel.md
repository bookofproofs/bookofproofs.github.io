**Nathaniel Bliss** was an English mathematician and astronomer who went on to become Astronomer Royal.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Appointed as the second Astronomer Royal in 1762, and improved the instruments of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. 
2. Established the transit instrument in 1756, as a device used to accurately measure a star's position.
3. Developed and introduced ‘Nautical almanacs’, a set of astronomical data used by navigators to calculate a ship's position at sea.
4. Improved and introduced the movable mural quadrant at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich in 1763.
5. Recognized changes in the rate of movement of the earth's axis, allowing him to make the necessary corrections to star-based navigation.
6. Discovery of the nutation, were minute variations in the speed of the Earth’s axial rotation.
7. Devised principles of spherical trigonometry for nautical observations. 
8. Developed a method for applying greater accuracy when defining angles of position on navigational charts.

Born 28 November 1700, Bisley, Gloucester, England. Died 2 September 1764, London, England.
