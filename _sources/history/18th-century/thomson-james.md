**James Thomson** campaigned to reform Glasgow University. He wrote many textbooks. He was the father of Lord Kelvin.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* James Thomson senior was a farmer who gave his children what little education they would receive.
* James, the subject of this biography, was his parents' third son.
* Thomson showed his mathematical skills and interests at a young age.
* However events of the time were to create a strong impression on the young Thomson which greatly affected his outlook on life.
* Two years later, in 1800, Thomson attended a new school opened by a secessionist Presbyterian minister Dr Edgar to train young men for the ministry.
* Thomson's first appointment was to the school department where he taught arithmetic, geography, and bookkeeping for a year before moving to the college department where he became professor of mathematics.
* The first son of the marriage was James who was born in 1822.
* The second son, born in 1824, is the famous William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin.
* Margaret Thomson died in 1830 leaving Thomson to bring up his seven children.
* Thomson and his children lived in the old college off the High Street in Glasgow during the teaching term which occupied the six winter months.
* Two years after taking up the professorship his two sons James (then twelve years old) and William (then ten years old) began their university studies at Glasgow.
* These two young men turned out to be Thomson's most talented mathematics students.
* Thomson arrived in Glasgow in 1832 just after a cholera epidemic had passed but it was a second cholera epidemic in 1848 which took his life.

Born 13 November 1786, Annaghmore, near Ballynahinch, Co. Down, Ireland. Died 12 January 1849, Glasgow, Scotland.
