**James Thomson** campaigned to reform Glasgow University. He wrote many textbooks. He was the father of Lord Kelvin.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the mathematical theory of the wave equation.  
2. Discovered the universal lemma. 
3. Provided insight into the analytic properties of integrals. 
4. Established that the wave equation can be used to describe the properties of a vibrating surface. 
5. Developed a method for solving certain partial differential equations. 
6. Made advances in the understanding of second order differential equations. 
7. Pioneered a new approach to solving the Dirichlet problem. 
8. Proposed the use of Z-transforms for numerical integration. 
9. Constructed an algorithm for computing the transfer function of a given linear system. 
10. Proved the uniqueness theorem for linear differential equations.

Born 13 November 1786, Annaghmore, near Ballynahinch, Co. Down, Ireland. Died 12 January 1849, Glasgow, Scotland.
