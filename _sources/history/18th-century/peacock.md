**George Peacock** published his _Treatise on Algebra _ which attempted to give algebra a logical treatment comparable to [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published an influential treatise on algebra (A Treatise of Algebra, 1828) which helped popularize the symbol for unknown amounts, now known as the Peacock Symbol. 
2. Pioneered the introduction of imaginary numbers and the systematic use of symbols in mathematics.
3. Developed a three-figure system to denote the ordering of planets in the solar system.
4. Extensively developed the concept of polar coordinates and established a new method for converting Cartesian to Polar coordinates.
5. Published a treatise on Euclid's works to make them more accessible to students (Treatise on Euclid, 1819).
6. Published a number of other books and papers related to mathematics including The Principles of Analytic Calculation (1822), A Treatise of Geometry (1820) and A Treatise of Algebra (1828).
7. He also wrote a book about the development of mathematical logic, The Philosophy of Arithmetic (1821).

Born 9 April 1791, Thornton Hall, Denton, County Durham, England. Died 8 November 1858, Pall Mall, London, England.
