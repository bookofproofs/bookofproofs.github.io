**Jean-Marie Duhamel** worked on partial differential equations and applied his methods to the theory of heat, to rational mechanics and to acoustics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the modern theory of differential equations in the 18th century. 
2. Developed the principles of potential theory and harmonic analysis 
3. Solved the heat equation by introducing the concept of Fourier series 
4. Discovered the Duhamel's Principle of superposition in integral equations 
5. Developed calculus of variations and the theory of integral equations 
6. Developed the Duhamel-Jacobi identity, an important tool in functionaldifferential equations 
7. Was among the first to describe the operator splitting method, now an essential technique in numerical analysis 
8. Was named an Invited Professor of the Durmont Institute as well as a Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences 
9. Published collected works covering hydrodynamics, integral equations, analytical mechanics, and calculus of variations.

Born 5 February 1797, St Malo, France. Died 29 April 1872, Paris, France.
