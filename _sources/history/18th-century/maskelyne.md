**Nevil Maskelyne** was an English astronomer who measured the Earth's density in a famous experiment at Schiehallion.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of use of grid method for navigation which enabled precision mapping of the ocean making safer navigation for seafarers.
2. Put forth the method of lunars: a method of determining the longitude of a ship at sea by means of a sextant and the chronometer. 
3. Enabled the first inter-continental airmail service.
4. Was responsible for calculating and forecasting the planets positions using their equations of motion. 
5. Corrected the errors in the Nautical Almanac of 1767 and reissued it with his own name. 
6. Put forth a method of correcting the time pieces to obtain an accurate chronometer by measuring the intervals between notional transits at a fixed point. 
7. Wrote a famous book on the principles of navigation called the Marine Chronometer.

Born 5 October 1732, Kensington Gore, London, England. Died 9 February 1811, Greenwich, England.
