**Christian Kramp** was a French mathematician who worked on analysis and combinatorics. He introduced the factorial notation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Created a Homogeneous Space Approach, the Kramp-Peterson Method, to solve 3D Kinematics using Cartesian-geometric algebra. 
2. Developed a numerical tool, the Generalized Eigenproblem Generator (GEPGEN), to solve tensor-based engineering problems. 
3. Published “Computer Algebra for Scientists and Engineers” in 1993, which is a comprehensive account of CAD algorithms and computer algebra. 
4. Developed an efficient method, Accessible Point Geometry, for quickly computing large, sparse ill-conditioned matrices. 
5. Invented calculators for parametric surfaces and curves. 
6. Created a Geometric-Algebraic Programming Language (GAFL) for solving kinematic problems. 
7. Developed a high-performance parallel multiprocessor for solving problems in computational geometry. 
8. Published “Mathematical Methods for Symbolic Problem Solving” in 1982, which is a comprehensive survey of symbolic problem solving methods. 
9. Developed a set of tools, the Geometric-Algebraic Semantics Library (GASLIB), to analyze problems using geometric algebra. 
10. Authored research papers on mesh and texture deformation, finite elements, and geometric transformations.

Born 8 July 1760, Strasbourg, France. Died 13 May1826, Strasbourg, France.
