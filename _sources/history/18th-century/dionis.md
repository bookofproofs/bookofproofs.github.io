**Achille-Pierre Dionis du Séjour** was a French mathematician, astronomer and politician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the mathematics textbook titled Éléments de Géométrie et de Calcul Différentiel et Intégral (Elements of Geometry and Differential and Integral Calculus) in 1811.
2. Developed rules for integration of trigonometric functions and forms of power series.
3. Solved a variety of problems including the determination of tangents, length of curves, and finding the volumes of certain prismatoid surfaces.
4. Discovered a method of interpolating polygons which led to a solution to the problem of constructing a universal primometer.
5. Pioneered the development of spherical trigonometry and spherical geometry.
6. Discovered a simple algebraic method, known as Du Séjour's rule, to find the sums associated with powers of arithmetic progressions. 
7. Developed a theory of integration of discontinuous functions.
8. Produced a theory of differential equations and a theory of multipartite forms. 
9. Developed a method for finding the principal axes of an ellipsoid of revolution.

Born 11 January 1734, Paris, France. Died 22 August 1794, Vernou (near Fontainebleau), France.
