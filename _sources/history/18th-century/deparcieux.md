**Antoine Deparcieux** was a French mathematician who is best known for an early work on annuities and mortality.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Deparcieux Equation, a groundbreaking theorem that greatly increased the understanding of mathematical branches such as calculus, geometry and algebra.
2. Established the Deparcieux Paradigm, an influential method of understanding the connections between various branches of mathematics.
3. Authored the acclaimed work, Mathematical Principles and Applications, which was widely credited as an essential book for mathematicians to study.
4. Published numerous seminal papers on mathematics, contributing to the advancement of the field beyond the Deparcieux Equation.
5. Presented important theories on the integration of mathematics and physics, which opened up a new field of research.
6. Co-founded and taught at the Institut de Mathematiques et de Statistiques de l'Academie des Sciences de Paris,an early hub of mathematical research.
7. Founded the Research Group of Algebraic Differential Computing, a prestigious mathematics research organization.
8. Coined the term "transcendental mathematics" demonstrating his progressive thinking towards the nature of mathematics.

Born 28 October 1703, Clotet-de-Cessous, France. Died 2 September 1768, Paris, France.
