**Benjamin Franklin** was an American scientist and diplomat. His mathematical interests included magic squares.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an index clock with a novel temperature-compensation mechanism that allowed it to be more accurate and reliable than any similar device of its time.
2. Refined the theory of Occult Qualities, proposing a scientific basis for the effects of electricity on matter.
3. Pioneered the idea of conservation of charge by demonstrating that electric charge can neither be created nor destroyed.
4. Constructed a prototype of the Franklin Dynamo, a electrical generating device that was the first of its kind.
5. Discovered the principle of electrical polarization, which is still widely used in modern telecommunications and radio technology.
6. Described the behavior of lightning and developed the lightning rod, a device still used today to protect buildings from lightning strikes.

Born 17 January 1706, Boston, Massachusetts, British colony. Died 17 April 1790, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.
