**Benjamin Franklin** was an American scientist and diplomat. His mathematical interests included magic squares.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Franklin is best known in the popular imagination for his nonscientific pursuits: printer, American revolutionary, ambassador, to mention only a few roles he played.
* His version of magic square - a variant now termed the Franklin magic square - was inspired by the work of Stifel and Fr√©nicle, both of whose magic squares were of a more traditional variety.
* Further examples of Franklin's magic squares would not be published until two centuries after his death, and doubtless many more were lost.
* Franklin enjoyed close personal and professional relationships with quite a few of the important thinkers of his day, such as Hume, Priestley, Lavoisier and Condorcet.

Born 17 January 1706, Boston, Massachusetts, British colony. Died 17 April 1790, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.
