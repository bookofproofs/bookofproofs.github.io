**Louis-Antoine de Bougainville** was a French soldier and explorer who wrote a calculus book, but is better known for his other exploits.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Exploring linkages between geography and mathematics through navigational routes through unknown seas and distant lands.
2. Developing an improved method of computing longitude using the Moon's librations.
3. Brainstorming concept of a triangle with unequal sides and an unequal angle, which is now known as a Bougainville Triangle.
4. Designing a nautical charting system to enable long-distance navigation with greater accuracy.
5. Founding of the Academy of Sciences in Paris and contributing to the creation of the comprehensive Paris Academy of Navigational Sciences.
6. Developing an exponential function to compute distances between points on a sphere.
7. Introducing “Bougainville’s Law” for calculating the area of a spherical triangle.
8. Providing the first empirical evidence that Earth is not a perfect sphere, though a slightly flattened one.

Born 11 November 1729, Paris, France. Died 31 August 1811, Paris, France.
