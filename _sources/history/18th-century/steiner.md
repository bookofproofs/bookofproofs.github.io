**Jakob Steiner** was one of the greatest contributors to projective geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He successfully computed the surface area of a spheroid as well as the area of n-gons and the volume of a truncated cone.
2. He pioneered the field of projective geometry and identified many of its fundamental theorems.
3. He developed geometric methods for solving polynomial equations.
4. He was the first to prove the theorem of hexagrams and its generalizations.
5. He discovered the polyhedron formula for computing the surface area from the number of its vertices, edges and faces.
6. He was the first to discover many properties of regular polyhedra.
7. He developed methods for determining the volumes and surface areas of polyhedra by breaking them down into pyramidal components.
8. He invented the technique of circle packing in the plane.
9. He developed the theory of isoperimetry, which states that, among all figures of equal perimeter, the circle encloses the greatest area.
10. He made important contributions to number theory, particularly in the field of multiplication tables.

Born 18 March 1796, Utzenstorf, Switzerland. Died 1 April 1863, Bern, Switzerland.
