**Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille** was a French astronomer and geodesist who catalogued the stars of the Southern Hemisphere and named 14 out of the 88 constellations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Measured and accurately catalogued the stars in the southern hemisphere, plotting more than 10,000 of them and dubbing them with 14 constellations.
2. Pioneered a notational system for describing the brightness of stars, which has since been adopted as the modern stellar magnitude scale.
3. Created the earliest version of the arcminute-based unit of measure for angles of the celestial sphere, which later became the basis for the modern degree units.
4. Was among the first to appreciate the motion of the solar system relative to the ‘fixed stars’ and derived improved measurements of the size of the solar system in the area of astronomy.
5. Developed an improved method for charting the invisible magnetic lines of force, based on his observations of the Earth’s magnetic field strength in the southern hemisphere.

Born 15 March 1713, Rumigny-en-Thiérache, France. Died 21 March 1762, Paris, France.
