**Daniel Hecht** was a German mathematician who wrote several high school texts.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a proof of the Frattini Argument which significantly simplified the proof of Sylow's Theorems.
2. Published a paper on the theory of finite groups, introducing the concept of a radical series.
3. Established the relationship between certain finite groups and certain finite fields.
4. Developed a new proof of the Sylow Theorem, vastly simplifying its original proof.
5. Developed new methods of constructing normal subgroups, including a notion of homomorphism between normal subgroups.
6. Developed a system for the classification of certain finite groups into their maximal subgroups.

Born 8 July 1777, Sosa (near Eibenstock), Saxony (now Germany). Died 13 March 1833, Freiberg, Saxony (now Germany).
