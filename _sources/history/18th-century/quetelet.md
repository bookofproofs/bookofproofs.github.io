**Adolphe Quetelet** was a Flemish scientist who was influenced by Pierre Laplace and Joseph Fourier. He was the first to use the normal curve other than as an error law.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed population statistics and statistical analysis of data.
2. Postulated the concept of the "average man" and used it to analyze social and economic trends over time.
3. Introduced the idea of standard deviation and demonstrated its importance in understanding the normal distribution.
4. Pioneered the use of probability theory to measure the behavior of human populations.
5. Developed the statistic technique of "recurring elements" to identify patterns in social or economic data.
6. Introduced the concept of the "measure of central tendency," such as the mean, mode and median, to study population data.
7. Established correlation, as a vital aid to developing an understanding of the probability of an event's occurrence.
8. Fairly accurately calculated life expectancy rates in populations and developed reliable charts, tables and figures.
9. Was instrumental in bringing prestige to mathematics in the field of statistics and its application in social sciences.

Born 22 February 1796, Ghent, French Empire, (now Belgium). Died 17 February 1874, Brussels, Belgium.
