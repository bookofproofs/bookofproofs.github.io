**Victor-Amédée Lebesgue** was a French mathematician who worked on number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published foundational papers on integration theory and Lebesgue measure in 1902 and 1905, which laid the groundwork for modern real analysis. 
2. Introduced integration by parts and the Riemann-Stieltjes integral. 
3. Proved the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem for the first time. 
4. Started the modern theory of linear programming and optimization. 
5. Developed a process for finding the greatest lower bound of a convex set, known as the Lebesgue Problem. 
6. Established that the measure of a set is independent of the chosen representation. 
7. Defined the integral of a measurable function as an outer measure. 
8. Contributed to the theory of measure and integration. 
9. Developed the Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym theorem. 
10. Demonstrated that the Jordan content of a measurable set is determined by its perimeter.

Born 2 October 1791, Grandvilliers, Oise, France. Died 10 June 1875, Bordeaux, Gironde, France.
