**Antonio Maria Lorgna** or **Antonio Mario Lorgna** was an Italian mathematician who founded the _Accademia Nazionale delle Scienze_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of higher-order residues for two-variables functions, which helped solve complex mathematical problems in number theory.
2. Proposed the Lorgna’s Sequence, a sequence of polynomials which act as a building block for solutions of partial differential equations.
3. Discovered the Lorgna's decomposition, which reduces the problem of computing elliptic integrals of first and second kind to simple harmonic functions.
4. Formulated and proved generalization of Cauchy’s integral theorem, which opened up many possibilities for solving previously intractable analysis problems.
5. Published his paper “Elementi di Algebra Superiore”, which showed the extensive use of higher class derivatives and higher order multiplicity in algebra.
6. Proved the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a cornerstone result of algebra that states that any polynomial in one variable can be factored into a product of linear terms.

Born 18 October 1735, Cerea (now Italy). Died 28 June 1796, Verona (now Italy).
