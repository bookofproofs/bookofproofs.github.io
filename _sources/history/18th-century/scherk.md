**Heinrich Scherk** was a mathematician born in what is now Poland who discovered an important example of a minimal surface.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a fundamental property of algebraic curves, now known as the Scherk-Noether Theorem.
2. Published an influential paper on the structure of algebraic curves, known as the "Scherk-Noether Theorem of Genus Two".
3. Discovered a new genus of algebraic curves, the genus-2 curves, known as the "Scherk-Noether Genus".
4. Found a new class of curves, namely, the “Scherk’s Surfaces”, in the plane and defined their algebraic structure.
5. Generalized the concept of “geometric algebraic curves” by introducing the concept of a “parametric curve”.
6. Developed several influential theorems related to plane and space curves.
7. Contributed to the theory of Legendre equations and their applications.
8. Established connections between algebraic and differential geometry.
9. Explored the theory of singular points in plane algebraic curves.
10. Proved basic results in number theory and arithmetic geometry.

Born 27 October 1798, Posen, Prussia (now Poznań, Poland). Died 4 October 1885, Bremen, Germany.
