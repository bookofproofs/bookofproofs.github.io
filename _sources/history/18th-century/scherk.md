**Heinrich Scherk** was a mathematician born in what is now Poland who discovered an important example of a minimal surface.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Scherk completed his school studies in 1818 and entered the University of Breslau.
* It was H W Brandes who taught him mathematics and astronomy at the University of Breslau, and quickly realised that Scherk had an outstanding pupil.
* This made Scherk financially secure for the two years of its duration, and allowed him to devote himself fully to his studies.
* Scherk's doctoral studies, in which he was advised by Bessel and  Brandes, led to him submitting his doctoral thesis De evolvenda functione ...
* After two years as a privatdozent in Königsberg, Scherk was appointed as an extraordinary professor in Halle.
* Scherk taught at Halle for seven years from 1826 to 1833.
* Remarkably over 11,000 mathematicians can trace their academic parentage back to Scherk through Kummer.
* At Halle, Scherk taught a wide range of courses such as: analytic geometry of lines and the conic sections; analytic geometry of lines and surfaces of the first and second degree; algebra and algebraic geometry; plane and spherical trigonometry; integral calculus; and differential calculus and its application to algebra, analysis and geometry.
* On 5 July 1831 Scherk was appointed to the chair of mathematics at Halle which had been vacant since the death of Johann Friedrich Pfaff in 1825.
* On 13 September 1833 Scherk was appointed as a successor to N T Reimer as the ordinary professor for mathematics and astronomy at the University of Kiel.
* In the years 1841, 1842 and 1848 Scherk was chosen as Rector of the University of Kiel.
* In 1840 Scherk was made a Knight of the Order of Dannebrog, the second highest honour in Denmark (Dannebrog is the name for the Danish flag).
* Bessel died in March 1846 and later that year, at the annual meeting of the Association of German Natural Scientists and Physicians in Kiel, Scherk gave a fine speech in his memory.
* Scherk, however, was a German patriot and one of the three supervisors of the first German sea-cadet school in Kiel set up in 1848, where he was head of mathematics training.
* It is clear, however, that Scherk's German patriotism was unacceptable in the now Danish Schleswig-Holstein.
* The Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Halle tried unsuccessfully to reappoint Scherk, and attempts at Kiel to have him reinstated in his former post were equally unsuccessful.
* In the autumn of 1852 Scherk left Kiel and went to Dresden where he gave private tuition at the Blochmann Institute.
* On 12 December 1854 Scherk was appointed as director of the Höheren Gewerbeschule in Bremen.
* In the following year Scherk was appointed as a teacher at the Handelsschule (part of the High School) in Bremen.
* We should also note that Scherk discovered the third non-trivial examples of a minimal surface which appeared in his paper Bemerkungen über die kleinste Fläche innerhalb gegebener Grenzen Ⓣ(Comments on the smallest area of a surface with given boundary)  published in Crelle's Journal.
* Scherk's result was certainly seen as a major breakthough and brought him considerable fame; two surfaces, Scherk's First Surface and Scherk's Second Surface, as they are named today, are studied in the paper.
* Scherk's doubly periodic surface is the first example of a complete, embedded, doubly periodic minimal surface.
* His minimal surfaces have recently been the basis of sculptures by the American artist Brent Collins who has based many of his works on Scherk's second minimal surface.
* Another contribution by Scherk is still important today, namely his work on the distribution of the prime numbers.

Born 27 October 1798, Posen, Prussia (now Poznań, Poland). Died 4 October 1885, Bremen, Germany.
