**Michel Chasles** worked on algebraic and projective geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of screws in geometry, recognizing the link between curves and surfaces.
2. Contributed to the development of graph theory and analytic geometry.
3. Formulated Chasles' theorem, establishing a relationship between the positions of lines connecting any three points in space.
4. Provided an early contribution to the calculus of surfaces.
5. Developed an innovative geometric analysis technique, known as the method of characteristics.
6. Submitted theories on projective geometry, the principle of duality, and orthogonal surfaces.
7. Encouraged the development of algebraic geometry, making connections from algebraic to geometric principles.
8. Introduced the study of coordinates reference frames, which is the basis for modern topology and the use of real numbers to describe a point's location.

Born 15 November 1793, Epernon, France. Died 18 December 1880, Paris, France.
