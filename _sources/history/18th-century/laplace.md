**Pierre-Simon Laplace** proved the stability of the solar system. In analysis Laplace introduced the potential function and Laplace coefficients. He also put the theory of mathematical probability on a sound footing.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Laplace transform, which advances the Fourier series and provides a powerful tool for solving linear differential equations.
2. Developed the Laplace equation, a partial differential equation which governs many natural occurrences.
3. Formulated the central limit theorem in probability theory.
4. Performed fundamental work in probability theory, including stochastic processes, conditional probability and the Bayesian interpretation of probability.
5. Developed the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector.
6. Formulated the mathematical theories of attraction which addressed the distribution of planetary masses in a system.
7. Enhanced the understanding of fluid dynamics and elasticity, providing seminal theories of hydrodynamics, the theory of atmospheric circulation and acoustics.
8. Demonstrated the utility of probability theory in the study of both natural and human phenomena.

Born 23 March 1749, Beaumont-en-Auge, Normandy, France. Died 5 March 1827, Paris, France.
