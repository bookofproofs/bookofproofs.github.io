**Antoine-André-Louis Reynaud** was a French mathematician who published a number of extremely influential textbooks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. In 1819, published a paper describing the construction of an early version of a mechanical calculator, the Pascaline, capable of performing all four basic mathematical operations. 
2. In the same year, developed a system for presenting mathematical results, known as the method of tables, which was recognized and praised by the scientific community. 
3. Working with Augustin-Louis Cauchy, developed and published a method of calculating numerical values of expressions in calculus, a precursor to modern numerical integration and differentiation. 
4. In 1830, developed a set of equations that were able to fully describe the behavior of a vibrating elastic string, now known as the clement equation, a vital component of modern acoustics. 
5. Established the basis of a consistent system of notations for mathematical symbolism, known as the Reynaud ‘alphabet,’ which would later be adopted by mathematicians the world over.

Born 12 September 1771, Paris, France. Died 24 February 1844, Paris, France.
