**Jacques Français** was a French mathematician who published a version of Argand's work on complex numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Revolutionized the study of maps, transforming map-making from an art to a science
2. Developed sophisticated mathematical tools and algorithms to accurately map large distances and geographical areas
3. Pioneered a mathematical approach to creating precise cartographic instruments such as maps, globes and even geospatial models
4. Discovered the mathematical equations for describing curved surfaces and developing precise cartographic maps
5. Published influential books such as The Geometry of Maps and Textile Locality
6. Played a major role in the development of innovative surveying and cartographic technologies such as "triangulation", which allowed for the precise measurement of large areas
7. Established mathematical rules for calculating the longitude, latitude, and azimuth of geographical locations for the purpose of creating maps
8. Pioneered a technique for drawing the curved lines of accurate topographical maps

Born 20 June 1775, Saverne, Bas-Rhin, France. Died 9 March 1833, Metz, France.
