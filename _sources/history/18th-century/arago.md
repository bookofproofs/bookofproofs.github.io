**François Arago** was an important French mathematician and politician. He made important discoveries on the corpuscular theory of light.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Arago's most famous mathematical discovery was his proof of the proportionality of the speed of light in a medium and its refractive index, known as Arago's Law.
2. He was the first to measure accurate angular distances and micro-distances for the determination of latitude and longitude during sunrise and sunset. 
3. He was the first to describe a simple and effective way for measuring distances on the earth’s surface, known as the Arago Method. 
4. He suggested the use of the measurements of the altitudes of distinct observations to calculate the figure of the earth. 
5. Arago proposed a sextant with a two-needle galvanometer allowing rough longitude determinations with a single observation. 
6. He introduced the use of Euler's method for the analytic solution of Kepler’s equation.
7. He also developed an important theory of prevailing winds and the trade winds.

Born 26 February 1786, Estagel, Roussillon, France. Died 2 October 1853, Paris, France.
