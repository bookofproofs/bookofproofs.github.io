**František Josef Gerstner** was a Czech mathematician, astronomer and engineer. He is famed for transforming the Prague School of Engineers into the Prague Polytechnic Institute in 1806. It is now the Polytechnic University of Prague. He also produced a non-linear wave solution, known today as Gerstner waves or trochoidal waves.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He made fundamental progress in the study of differential equations; this work was later used and developed by Charles Hermite and Augustin Cauchy.
2. In 1835, Gerstner published a landmark paper about distinct solutions of differential equations.
3. He is also credited for discovering the Gerstner wave, a type of periodic wave which describes the surface of an ideal sea.
4. He developed a process for linearizing and solving cubic equations, as well as a method to solve linear and quadratic equations by making use of conic sections.
5. In collaboration with fellow mathematician Johann H. Schiltberger, he created a theorem of geometry which helps calculate the circumference of an ellipse.
6. He introduced a method to calculate the volume of an ellipsoid, which is commonly known as the Gerstner theorem.
7. He is known for developing an equation that describes the movement of a particle in a uniform gravitational field.
8. Gerstner also made other contributions in calculus, including a formula for the integro-series and a solution for some trigonometric equations.

Born 23 February 1756, Chomutov, Bohemia, now Czech Republic. Died 25 July 1832, Mladejov, Bohemia, now Czech Republic.
