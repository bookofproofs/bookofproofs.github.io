**Charles Dupin** made contributions to differential geometry and in particular invented the 'Dupin indicatrix'.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In fact Dupin was both her married and maiden name.
* Charles' father was a lawyer and Charles himself was brought up in Nivernais, the region of his birth.
* Charles was the middle of the three sons of his parents; his older brother André also achieved fame in his profession as a lawyer.
* Dupin was educated at the École Polytechnique in Paris, where he learnt geometry from Monge.
* While an undergraduate he made his famous discovery of what are called today 'Dupin's cyclides' guided in this work by Monge.
* It took him a while to recover from the illness, but Dupin was not idle while recovering in Pisa.
* Other contributions to differential geometry which occur in this work include his invention of the 'Dupin indicatrix' which gives an indication of the local behaviour of a surface up to the terms of degree two.
* The year 1813 saw Dupin elected to the Institut de France, the new organisation set up to replace the Académie des Sciences after the French Revolution.
* With the reestablishment of the Académie des Sciences, Dupin was elected to that body in 1818.
* Dupin was appointed professor at Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers in Paris in 1819.
* These lectures proved extremely popular, mainly since Dupin was an exceptional lecturer.
* In 1830, at the age of 45, Dupin married Rosalie Anne Joubert.

Born 6 October 1784, Varzy, France. Died 18 January 1873, Paris, France.
