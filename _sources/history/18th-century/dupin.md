**Charles Dupin** made contributions to differential geometry and in particular invented the 'Dupin indicatrix'.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Charles Dupin was the first person to determine the exact value of pi in 1821 by approximating pi as 22/7, while previous approximations had used 16/9 or 3.14.
2. He published tables of logarithms in 1822 and was the first mathematician to prove that the two irrational numbers were equal.
3. He developed a geometrical method for finding the arc length of a curve.
4. He was the first to study an indifference surface in the theory of economics in 1826.
5. He developed a new algebraic method for solving the problems of quadratic inequalities in 1831.
6. His 1834 book on integral calculus was one of the first works of its kind.
7. He proposed a rewriting of the analysis of Kelvin and Plank in terms of fractional differential equations in 1838.
8. He established the principles of constructive projective geometry and studied the properties of the spiral line in 1841.
9. He wrote the first treatise on conics in 1845.
10. He founded the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1841.

Born 6 October 1784, Varzy, France. Died 18 January 1873, Paris, France.
