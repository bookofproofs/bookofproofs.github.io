**Johann(II) Bernoulli** was a member of the Swiss mathematical family. He worked mainly on heat and light.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the technique of integration by parts, which established a basis for the theory of integration.
2. Created the Bernoulli numbers, which can be used to calculate the area bounded by a curve, as well as to understand sequences and power series.
3. Established the principle of least action, which states that physical systems will follow the path that allows them to achieve their goal in the most efficient, cost-effective way.
4. Defined probabilistic concepts such as the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.
5. Discovered the generalization of the root-finding process to any degree polynomial, now known as the ‘Ruffini-Horner’s’ method.
6. Developed a method to numerically approximate solutions to differential equations, known as the variation of constants and undetermined coefficients.

Born 28 May1710, Basel, Switzerland. Died 17 July 1790, Basel, Switzerland.
