**Wenceslaus Karsten** was a German mathematician who wrote about the logarithms of negative and complex numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored Das Problem der Begrenzung des Primfaktorverbandes in der Theory der algebraischen Gleichungen (//The Problem of Boundary of Prime Factor Combination in the Theory of Algebraic Equations//) in 1878.
2. Developed Schur's Theorem related to polynomial equations.
3. Proved a number of useful lemmas, one of them gives birth to a logical connection between symmetric forms and supports the analogy of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.
4. Originated the fundamental analysis of the theory of the ideal and theory of bilinear forms which led to the development of Galois theory.
5. Developed the theory of Noetherian Rings.
6. Authored the fundamental Compendium Der Algebra (//The Algebra//) which formed the basis of algebra for generations of mathematicians.
7. Established the company J.G. Karsten, which is still running and producing top quality mathematic handbooks for many years.

Born 15 December 1732, Neubrandenburg, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Germany. Died 17 April 1787, Halle, Germany.
