**Francis Maseres** was an English mathematician who wrote some influential text-books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered work on integrating algebraic functions with complex analysis.
2. Developed methods of investigating the behaviour of algebraic curves.
3. Extended the Laplace transformation to solve several types of linear differential equations.
4. Established the relationship between inverse slopes and curvature of curves.
5. Was the first to extend Jean d'Alembert's wave equation to multiple dimensions.
6. Founded the dual concept of algebraic and analytic geometry.
7. Developed the theory of analytical tiling, outlining key ideas which later became fundamental in topology. 
8. Presented the theory on polynomial decomposition and its applications to computational algebra. 
9. Discovered a method for solving the cubic equation with real roots. 
10. Discovered theorems on parametric equations and the convergence of infinite series.

Born 15 December 1731, London, England. Died 19 May 1824, Reigate, Surrey, England.
