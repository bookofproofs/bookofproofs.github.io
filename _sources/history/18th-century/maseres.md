**Francis Maseres** was an English mathematician who wrote some influential text-books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Peter Maseres was a doctor who first lived in Broad Street, Soho, London but then moved to Rathbourne Place.
* Francis attended the Rev Richard Wooddeson's School in Kingston-upon-Thames before matriculating at Clare College, Cambridge, on 4 July 1748.
* Francis was ranked as fourth wrangler meaning that he was fourth out of the students awarded a first class degree.
* Francis was awarded the first chancellor's classical medal which was presented to him by the Duke of Newcastle.
* In 1750 Maseres entered the Inner Temple meaning he was training to join the legal profession.
* Maseres wrote many mathematical works which show a complete lack of creative ability.
* It is probable that Maseres rejected all mathematics which he could not understand.
* Maseres had an unfortunate influence on the teaching of algebra in Britain for several decades.
* Of the reprints that Maseres made at his own expense, the most significant is the "Scriptores logarithmici" (1791-1807), six volumes devoted to the subject of logarithms, including works of Kepler, Napier, Snell, and others, interspersed with original tracts on related subjects.
* Presumably a number of authors were indebted to Maseres for financial assistance of this sort.

Born 15 December 1731, London, England. Died 19 May 1824, Reigate, Surrey, England.
