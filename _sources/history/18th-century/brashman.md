**Nikolai Brashman** was a Czech mathematician who worked on mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Investigated the convergence of Fourier series.
2. Developed a mathematical model describing the process of contraction of a heated metal bar.
3. Developed the concept of a higher algebra that would later be used extensively in analysis.
4. Published papers on the mechanics of stars and their relation to the laws of celestial mechanics.
5. Derived an iterative formula for the solution of homogenous linear equations.
6. Created a mathematical model of a fluid’s free-surface-waves under gravity.
7. Developed a modified method for the sums of infinite series and Leibniz’s law of series.
8. Found the solution to a class of rational difference equations. 
9. Coined the idea of a graph to help visualize linear transformations of algebraic equations.
10. Helped to establish the field of mathematical physics and its related applications.

Born 14 June 1796, Rassnova: near Brünn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic). Died 13 May1866, Moscow, Russia.
