**Charles Hutton** was an English mathematician who wrote arithmetic textbooks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for determining the area of a polygon using triangles.
2. Provided a proof of the flatness theorem.
3. Propounded a law relating the volume of a pyramid to its height and base area.
4. Solved the Adrain's Chain problem, which had already stumped leading mathematicians.
5. Founded the Huttonian Society of London, a prestigious mathematical institution.
6. Developed summation methods and the concept of a definite integral.
7. Developed an algorithm for the evaluation of infinite series.
8. Developed an algebraic representation of a curve in a three-dimensional space.
9. Discovered the interesting idea that curves of the third degree can be expressed in terms of coordinates and equations.
10. Published works that greatly advance the progress and understanding of mathematics.

Born 14 August 1737, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England. Died 27 January 1823, London, England.
