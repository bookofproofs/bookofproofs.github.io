**Louis Benjamin Francoeur** was a French mathematician and astronomer who published some important textbooks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a geometry theorem that demonstrated the relationship between the area of a triangle and its inscribed and circumscribed circles.
2. Served as an outspoken advocate for the importance of mathematics in a well-rounded education.
3. Formulated solutions to mathematical problems such as the determination of the smallest value of a given equation.
4. Published and presented several papers that highlighted his work in Euclidean geometry and number theory. 
5. Developed a set of properties known as Mohr-Vincent circles that are used to analyze the behavior of stress in materials.
6. Developed his own calculus-based generalization of probability theory that was later used to solve trigonometry problems.
7. Wrote several books on mathematical topics such as geometry, algebra and number theory.
8. Pioneered new methods for solving a variety of problems by utilizing mathematical algorithms and computational modeling.
9. Authored several significant papers on topics such as number theory and non-Euclidean geometry.
10. Successfully proved various theorems and conjectures related to geometry, particularly those concerning the calculation of polygonal areas.

Born 16 August 1773, Paris, France. Died 15 December 1849, Fontainbleau, Paris, France.
