**Émile Clapeyron** was a French engineer who designed steam locomotives and worked on the theory of heat.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Clapeyron and Lamé went together to Russia in 1820.
* Clapeyron and Lamé went to St Petersburg where the École des Travaux Publics had been set up and these they taught both pure and applied mathematics.
* Both Clapeyron and Lamé remained in Russia for 10 years.
* Clapeyron proposed a railway line from Paris to St Germain and sought funding for the project.
* In 1835 the construction of the line from Paris to St Germain was authorised and Clapeyron and Lamé were put in charge of the project.
* Lamé was offered the chair of physics at the École Polytechnique shortly after they began their work and Clapeyron was left to head the venture.
* In 1836 Clapeyron, who specialised in designing steam locomotives, went to England to arrange for the building of some specialist locomotives.
* Clapeyron approached Stevenson, the most famous of the builders of locomotives, but Stevenson found Clapeyron's designs too difficult and declined the contract.
* Clapeyron then approached Sharp, Roberts, and Company, a firm which made railway locomotives in one of the earliest applications of the use of interchangeable parts.
* Continuing with his project on his return to France, Clapeyron extended his activities to the design of metal bridges.
* In 1844 Clapeyron was appointed professor at the École des Ponts et Chaussées then, in 1848, he was elected to the Paris Academy of Sciences.
* Clapeyron expressed Sadi Carnot's ideas on heat analytically, with the help of graphical representations, in 1834.
* Sadi Carnot's work was virtually unknown before Clapeyron's paper in which the Carnot cycle is given in mathematical formulation.
* This work of Clapeyron had important influences on Thomson and Clausius when its importance for the second law of thermodynamics became apparent.
* The Clapeyron relation, a differential equation which determines the heat of vaporisation of a liquid, is named after him.

Born 26 January 1799, Paris, France. Died 28 January 1864, Paris, France.
