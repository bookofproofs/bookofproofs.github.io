**Émile Clapeyron** was a French engineer who designed steam locomotives and worked on the theory of heat.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropic change of a thermodynamic system is always greater than or equal to zero. 
2. Developed the Clapeyron equation, which describes the relationship between thermodynamic properties of a system. 
3. Discovered the concept of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, a result of the integration of the Clapeyron equation.
4. Developed the concept of entropy, which is used to measure the disorder in a thermodynamic system. 
5. Discovered the criteria for chemical equilibrium in a closed system, known as Clapeyron's equation. 
6. Coined the term exergy, a measure of the maximum potential work a system can do.
7. Established the theory of chemical potential, which describes the relationship between chemical potential and other thermodynamic properties of a system.
8. Developed the Clausius-Duhem theorem, which relates chemical potential to the rate of change of internal energy.
9. Applied mathematics to chemical thermodynamics, developing the Gibbs free energy equation.
10. Utilized mathematics to describe mechanical thermodynamics, developing the Joule-Thomson coefficient and the Joule-Thomson effect.

Born 26 January 1799, Paris, France. Died 28 January 1864, Paris, France.
