**John Bonnycastle** was an English teacher of mathematics and prolific writer. He wrote for the early volumes of Rees's _Cyclop√¶dia_, about algebra, analysis and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He is renowned as the author of a pioneering mathematics textbook called Introductio ad Logarithmosa.
2. He developed an algebraic notation early on, allowing accurate calculations to be done more easily.
3. He wrote a book on the trigonometric tables that was later republished in 1809, offering an even more primary basis and structure of mathematics.
4. He also contributed to the development of the decimal system of mathematics.
5. He composed a book on the new planetary theorem that was published in 1817.
6. He wrote a groundbreaking analysis of equations in 1775, which was republished in 1822.
7. He wrote a novel paper on the approximate calculus of polynomials.
8. He published a paper on spherical trigonometry, one of the most important papers in this field.
