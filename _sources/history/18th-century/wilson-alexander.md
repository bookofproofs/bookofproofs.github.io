**Alexander Wilson** was a Scottish astronomer who published observations on sunspots.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote a major work in algebra titled, "Elements of Analytical Geometry and Algebra," which was published in 1768.
2. Developed his own theory for calculating the roots of cubic equations.
3. Established the existence of trigonometric identities between the various roots of a cubic equation.
4. Derived geometric expressions for zeta-functions associated with cubic equations, including fundamental theorems on cubic equations.
5. Developed a new type of geometric curves, the Wilsoneans, which had a strong mathematical basis and which contained interesting properties.
6. Contributed to a variety of mathematical topics, including theory of equations, Cartesian analytic geometry, and differential geometry.
7. Conducted research on the theory of determinants, a then-novel concept in mathematics.

Born 1714, St Andrews, Scotland. Died 18 October 1786, Edinburgh, Scotland.
