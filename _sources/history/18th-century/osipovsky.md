**Timofei Fedorovic Osipovsky** was a Russian mathematician who wrote some influential textbooks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Osipovsky studied first at the seminary in Vladimir until 1783, then for three years at the St Petersburg Pedagogical Institute leaving in 1786.
* After graduating from the St Petersburg Teachers Seminary, Osipovsky taught mathematics and physics in Moscow.
* Osipovsky was one of the nine professors appointed to Kharkov University in 1805, the year of the foundation of the University.
* In 1813 Osipovsky became rector of the University.
* In 1816 Mikhail Vasilevich Ostrogradski began studying at Kharkov University under Osipovsky.
* However in 1820 Osipovsky was suspended from his post on religious grounds and we now explain how this came about.
* In 1820, following Golitsyn's lead, Osipovsky was dismissed by the Curator of Kharkhov University, Z Ia Karneev, because of an alleged lack of fervour when saying "God lives" during an oral examination of a graduate student.
* This had a rather serious consequence for his most famous pupil Ostrogradski who was examined by Osipovsky in 1820, for, following Osipovsky's dismissal, the Ministry of Education refused to confirm the award of Ostrogradski's doctorate.
* They required him to retake the examinations (officially on the grounds that he had not attended lectures on philosophy and theology), but, knowing that the real reason was that he had been examined by Osipovsky, he refused to retake the examinations and never received the degree.
* Osipovsky was one of the best mathematicians in Russia at the beginning of the nineteenth century.
* Other work by Osipovsky outside mathematics was in physics, astronomy and philosophy, and it is in this latter subject that he has acquired the greatest lasting fame.

Born 2 February 1765, Osipovo, Vladimir gubernia, Russia. Died 24 June 1832, Moscow, Russia.
