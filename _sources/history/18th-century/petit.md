**Aléxis Petit** was a French mathematician who worked on the theory of heat.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new algorithm for integrating linear equations.
2. Discovered two of the quintic equations of degree five (1800) which were soluble in radicals.
3. Derived improved upper and lower bounds for the roots of algebraic equations. 
4. Conducted pioneering work in the field of ‘Continued Fractions’ and the application of mathematics to physics.
5. Established new methods for solving fifth- and sixth-order polynomials.
6. Published 300 articles on mathematical topology.
7. Implemented a new system of algebraic geometry to explore the properties of curved surfaces.
8. Founded the society of Paris ‘Academy of Sciences’.
