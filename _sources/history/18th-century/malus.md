**Étienne Louis Malus** was a French mathematician who was almost entirely concerned with the study of light.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Invented the mathematical theory of multiple reflections of light, later used as a theory of polarization of light.
2. Discovered the phenomenon of light polarization by reflection off uniaxial crystals.
3. Resolved the paradox of a beam of light passing through two crossed polarizers.
4. Proposed the law of Malus, which states that the intensity of light after passing through a polarizer is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the polarizer and the polarization vector of the incident light.
5. Developed equations for propagation of light through an anisotropic medium.
6. Demonstrated his methods for determining cloaking properties of materials for use in optical technology.
7. Established the theory of Fresnel diffraction, using mathematical theory to analyze the degree of light diffraction based on the wavelength.

Born 23 July 1775, Paris, France. Died 24 February 1812, Paris, France.
