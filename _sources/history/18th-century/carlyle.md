**Thomas Carlyle** was a Scottish writer who was also interested in mathematics. He translated Legendre's work _Éléments de géométrie_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father, James Carlyle, was a stonemason and his mother, Margaret Aitken, the daughter of a bankrupt Dumfriesshire farmer, was James' second wife.
* James and Margaret married in 1794 and Thomas was the eldest of their nine children.
* Thomas first learnt basic arithmetic from his father.
* Thomas attended the village school at Ecclefechan until he was six years old and then Hoddam parish school until he was ten years old.
* However Annan Academy was six miles away and Thomas's mother did not want him to attend the school.
* His father, however, insisted and on 24 May 1806 he accompanied his ten year old son on the six mile walk to the Academy where Thomas became a boarder during the school week returning home for the weekends.
* Carlyle entered the Edinburgh University in November 1809 where his parents expected him to train to enter the ministry.
* The university was eighty miles from Ecclefechan and Carlyle said goodbye to his parents on the edge of his home town then walked the eighty miles during the following three days.
* Carlyle completed the one year of full time study but did not enjoy it.
* Unhappy with teaching, Carlyle resigned from his post in Kirkcaldy in 1818, and returned to Edinburgh University.
* Carlyle chose not to follow Leslie's advice but, despite making a little money as a mathematics tutor, he was in severe financial difficulties.
* In mathematics Carlyle is famed for his English translation of Legendre's Eléments de géométrie which David Brewster commissioned him to undertake for £50 in 1821.
* Carlyle held a number of posts as a tutor after leaving Edinburgh University, having no fixed base.
* Carlyle was soon sending Jane letters showing his affection, but she found it hard to imagine that she might ever marry.
* Despite little encouragement, Carlyle persisted in his attempts to win Jane over.
* Carlyle lived for a year at a small isolated farm called Hoddam Hill near the town of his birth.
* Several important events happened in the years between Carlyle meeting his future wife and their marriage.
* In the spring of 1827 Carlyle and his wife began to consider living at Craigenputtoch, a small farm about 20 miles from Dumfries which Jane had inherited from her father.
* It is interesting, however, that even at this stage, Carlyle was still interested in teaching mathematics.
* Carlyle also applied unsuccessfully for the chair of moral philosophy at St Andrews University, and he even applied for the chair of astronomy at Edinburgh University in 1834.
* Carlyle and his wife spent six years living at Craigenputtock, from 1828 until 1834, after which he went to set up home in London.
* Carlyle had to rewrite the whole volume from memory.
* As well as his historical works Carlyle wrote Chartism (1840) which opposes conventional economic theory.
* These works had achieved fame for Carlyle who now received invitations to lecture which solved his financial problems.
* Carlyle became rector of Edinburgh University in 1865 after Gladstone retired from the office.
* In fact Carlyle was still at the University following his address when news reached him that his wife had died in London on 21 April.

Born 4 December 1795, Ecclefechan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. Died 5 February 1881, Chelsea, London, England.
