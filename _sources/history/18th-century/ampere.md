**André-Marie Ampère** made important contributions to the theory of Electricity and magnetism. His theory became fundamental for 19th century developments.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed ampèrian curves which are a fundamental concept in graph theory.
2. Developed Amperian Law which states that the electric current in a circuit is equal to the sum of the electromotive forces in that circuit.
3. Invented the notion of a force between two electric currents which is now known as Ampère's force law. 
4. Formulated the Electrodynamic Theory of Matter, also known as Ampère's Molecular Currents. 
5. Established the first mathematical basis of the electromagnetism theory. 
6. Developed an algebraic representation of electric and magnetic fields, which is the basis of electromagnetic calculations. 
7. Developed the theory of electric central forces which explains the effect of electric currents on electric charges. 
8. De-constructed the theory of electricity and magnetism which was later developed by James Clerk Maxwell.

Born 20 January 1775, Lyon, France. Died 10 June 1836, Marseilles, France.
