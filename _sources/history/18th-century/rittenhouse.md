**David Rittenhouse** was (with Benjamin Franklin) one of only two 18th Century American mathematicians.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an improved method of calculating the orbit of a cometary body, enabling more accurate prediction of future movements.
2. Became the first American to be elected as a foreign member to the Royal Society in London, in recognition of his achievements in the field of mathematics.
3. Wrote the famous paper “The Nature of the Solar System From Observations,” which was a landmark in the study of celestial mechanics.
4. Devised a pedagogical approach for demonstrating the elements of astronomy and mechanics by constructing orreries and other models of planetary and cosmic motion.
5. First to construct an achromatic telescope lens, eliminating rainbow-colored fringes from images in the field of view.
6. Constructed a machine for calculating logarithms, which was later adopted by the US Navy.
7. Published numerous scientific works related to astronomy, mechanics, and mathematics, including influential texts on optical instruments, spherical trigonometry, and practical accounting.

Born 8 April 1732, Paper Mill Run, near Germantown, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 26 June 1796, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.
