**August Crelle** was a German mathematician who founded an important mathematical journal.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Crelle designed and published the influential Journal für die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik (Journal for Pure and Applied Mathematics) in 1826.
2. He was the first to successfully solve the general quintic equation in the early 1800s.
3. Crelle formulated the Crelle's theorem in 1828 seeking to link the roots of the polynomial to its coefficients.
4. In 1832 he proposed his Crelle congruence, which proposed that any even integer can be written as the difference of two squares. 
5. He also developed the Crelle-Abel equation in 1838 to link elliptic integrals and functions.
6. In 1848 Crelle formulated Crelle's Transfer Principle of the residues of an ideal, which soon afterwards led to the development of abstract algebra.

Born 11 March 1780, Eichwerder, (near Wriezen) Prussia (now Germany). Died 6 October 1855, Berlin, Prussia (now Germany).
