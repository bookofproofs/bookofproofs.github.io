**Jean Nicolas Pierre Hachette** was a French mathematician who worked on descriptive geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* This first contact with Monge would be one of many throughout his career, and even at this young age Hachette greatly impressed him.
* In 1785, when Hachette was sixteen years old, he entered the University of Rheims.
* Monge had set up a descriptive geometry course at the École Royale du Génie which Ferry was teaching when Hachette was appointed to the staff.
* Hachette assisted Ferry in teaching the descriptive geometry course.
* This was to change the course of Hachette's life, particularly since he was a strong supporter of the Revolution.
* At first Hachette continued with his post in Mézières, then in 1792 he entered a competition for professor of hydrography at Collioure and Port Vendres.
* Ferry was elected to be a deputy on the National Convention in 1873 and Hachette returned to the École Royale du Génie of Mézières to take over his position teaching mathematics.
* During this period Hachette showed his strong support for the Revolution.
* Hachette took an active role in setting up the École using his experience at Mézières to good effect.
* In 1799 Hachette was promoted to full professor at the École Polytechnique and continued to serve the School both as a teacher and an organiser.
* The students at the School were served well as Hachette encouraged his best students with research projects, raising the level and reputation of the School.
* Hachette edited this publication until he was forced out of the School in 1816.
* Another educational establishment, the École Normale, was set up to train secondary school teachers and from 1810 Hachette taught there and at the Faculty of Sciences in Paris in addition to the École Polytechnique.
* However, in 1816 the Government reorganised the École Polytechnique and Hachette found himself excluded from the school.
* Hachette worked on descriptive geometry, collected work by Monge and edited Monge's Géométrie descriptive Ⓣ(Descriptive Geometry) which was published in 1799.
* The final area which interested Hachette was physics.

Born 6 May 1769, Mézières, Ardennes, France. Died 16 January 1834, Paris, France.
