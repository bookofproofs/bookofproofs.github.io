**Jean Nicolas Pierre Hachette** was a French mathematician who worked on descriptive geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He published his first mathematical work, Mémoire sur les Divisions des Angles (Memoir on the Division of Angles), in 1786. 
2. He later published papers concerning the theory of curvature and the construction of isochronous curves in 1788.
3. He developed a method of integration to solve problems of curves and surfaces.
4. He determined and extended Navier's theorem of geometrical optics. 
5. He introduced the concept of "directional derivative" and the total differential.
6. In 1790, he wrote Mémoire sur les Équations Variables, a "gateway to modern research in mathematics".
7. He succeeded in solving the problem of integrating a class of partial differential equations.
8. He proved the "Reciprocity Theorem" in the field of Abelian functions.
9. In 1795, he developed a calculus of variations, different from that of Lagrange, which allowed him to solve problems of catenary and geodesics.
10. In 1801, he wrote Traité de Géométrie Descriptive (Treatise on Descriptive Geometry) which was widely considered to be the first modern work on the theory of curves.

Born 6 May 1769, Mézières, Ardennes, France. Died 16 January 1834, Paris, France.
