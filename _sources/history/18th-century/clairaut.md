**Alexis Clairaut** was a French mathematician who worked to confirm the Newton-Huygens belief that the Earth was flattened at the poles.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved an important theorem in the normative calculus of probabilities, the Clairaut-Schröter theorem, in 1738.
2. Made substantial contributions to the differential and integral calculus of partial derivatives
3. Developed the first systematic calculus of probability theory
4. Was one of the first to develop a systematic study of the potential theory of gravity
5. Wrote the monumental work "Théorie de la figure de la Terre" which laid the foundation for modern geodesy
6. First to suggest using the notation f(x,y) and the use of partial derivatives to solve equations in 1731.
7. Contributed significantly to the development of analytic geometry
8. Developed and improved upon the foundations of Maclaurin's theorem
9. Solved the infinitesimal calculus of variations problem posed by Johann Bernoulli
10. Extended and improved upon the work of Euler and d'Alembert on wave propagation.

Born 7 May 1713, Paris, France. Died 17 May 1765, Paris, France.
