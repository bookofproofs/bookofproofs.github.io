**Nathaniel Bowditch** was an American mathematician who published works on navigation and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a corrected version of Pierre-Simon Laplace's "Celestial Mechanics", which was the first American book to make a major contribution to mathematical science.
2. Introduced modern trigonometric methods to the United States in his 1802 book, "The New American Practical Navigator".
3. Developed a method for finding the most accurate values for several trigonometric relationships.
4. Wrote a number of books that became seminal works in elementary mathematics, including the famous "American Practical Navigator".
5. Created a teaching method for the accurate teaching of mathematics to achieve maximum comprehension by students.
6. Discovered a formula used in integrating rational fractions.
7. Discovered an important longitude-finding tool used in celestial navigation.
8. Produced an extensively detailed and accurate analysis of gravitation of the planets which is still in use today.

Born 26 March 1773, Salem, Massachusetts, USA. Died 16 March 1838, Boston, USA.
