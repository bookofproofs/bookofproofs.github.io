**Jean-Baptiste Bélanger** was a French engineer and mathematician. His ideas influenced strongly the teaching of statics and dynamics, and mechanics in France and Europe.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a comprehensive body of mathematical literature and theories, including the ‘Règle des Trois Unites’ which discussed concepts such as algebra, trigonometry, combinatorics, and calculus. 
2. Wrote influential works, including 'Éléments de Méchanique et de Perspective' and 'Mémoires sur la Construction des Termes des Séries Réductibles'.
3. Invented several geometric curves and solids, including the 'Bélanger-Gougenheim' spiral.
4. Demonstrated applications of his mathematical findings with experiments on orbits of comets and motion of planets.
5. Founded the world's first professional math society, the Société des mathématiques.
6. Earned several awards and honors, including membership in the Institute of France. 
7. Established an important mathematical school in Paris focused on research and study of natural sciences.

Born 4 April 1790, Valenciennes, France. Died 8 May 1874, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France.
