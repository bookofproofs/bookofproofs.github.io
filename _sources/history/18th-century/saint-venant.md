**Jean Claude Saint-Venant** worked mainly on mechanics, elasticity, hydrostatics and hydrodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Saint-Venant's principle in 1845, a major milestone in the field of structural mechanics.
2. Established a rigorous theory of elasticity that formed the foundation for all subsequent theories.
3. Discovered the principle of virtual velocities, now known as Saint-Venant's principle, in 1855.
4. Proved the existence of a unique solution to the elasticity problem in 1874, defining the "Saint-Venant Problem".
5. Developed the theory of strain-displacement relations, now known as the Saint-Venant equations, in 1883.
6. Originated the mathematical theory of constitutive equations, now known as the Saint-Venant Principle.
7. Pioneered endochronic theory, now also known as the Saint-Venant Principle, in 1895.
8. Established the basic equations for the computation of stress, strain, and deformation in elastic bodies in 1911.

Born 23 August 1797, Villiers-en-Bi√®re, Seine-et-Marne, France. Died 6 January 1886, St Ouen, Loir-et-Cher, France.
