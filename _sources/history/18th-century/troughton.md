**Edward Troughton** was an English maker of scientific instruments.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Edward Troughton took the science of instrument-making very seriously indeed and began to study the mathematical background necessary, as well as astronomy, so that he could understand precisely how the instruments were being used and the type of scientific discoveries that users of the instruments were hoping to make.
* Edward began to design and to build his own instruments.
* Soon after this, however, in 1788 John died and Edward Troughton ran the business on his own.
* Troughton's most famous instruments were astronomical ones.
* One of Troughton's most important contributions was a method of dividing a circle.
* The procedures adopted by Ramsden and Troughton for correcting initial dividing marks are also described.
* Troughton was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1810 largely due to the fact that he had been prepared to share his methods of dividing instruments which he had kept a closely guarded secret up to that time.
* Troughton was by this time over 70 years old and was suffering from some of the ailments of old age such as rheumatism and lumbago.
* For example a dispute which Troughton became involved in towards the end of his life was with Sir James South who was President of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1829 to 1831.
* It was a sad affair in which South, who had previously been friendly with Troughton, ended up trying to damage his reputation.
* In fact a court case was still in progress when Troughton died.
* Simms continued Troughton's internationally known business after Troughton died in 1835 at his home in Fleet Street.

Born (baptised) 6 November 1753, Corney, Cumberland, England. Died 12 June 1835, London, England.
