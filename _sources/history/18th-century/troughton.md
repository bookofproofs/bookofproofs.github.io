**Edward Troughton** was an English maker of scientific instruments.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Francis married Mary Stable and they had six children, the youngest being Edward, the subject of this biography.
* One of Edward's older brothers named John (after his uncle) was born in 1739 and so was entering a profession while Edward was still a small child.
* Edward's brother John, and another brother younger than John, went to London to be trained by their uncle in the profession of scientific instrument makers.
* Edward worked for his father when he was young.
* However, after the middle brother, who was apprenticed to John, died, Edward went to London in 1773 to become an apprentice mathematical instrument maker with his brother John Troughton.
* Edward Troughton took the science of instrument-making very seriously indeed and began to study the mathematical background necessary, as well as astronomy, so that he could understand precisely how the instruments were being used and the type of scientific discoveries that users of the instruments were hoping to make.
* Edward began to design and to build his own instruments.
* Edward became a partner with his brother, and they traded as John and Edward Troughton at The Sign of the Orrery.
* Soon after this, however, in 1788 John died and Edward Troughton ran the business on his own.
* Troughton soon established himself as the leading maker of instruments in England, for not only had his brother John died in 1788, but also the other brilliant maker of scientific instruments Ramsden died in 1800.
* Troughton's most famous instruments were astronomical ones.
* One of Troughton's most important contributions was a method of dividing a circle.
* The procedures adopted by Ramsden and Troughton for correcting initial dividing marks are also described.
* Troughton was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1810 largely due to the fact that he had been prepared to share his methods of dividing instruments which he had kept a closely guarded secret up to that time.
* After his brother John died, Edward ran the business alone until, in 1826, because of failing health due to old age, he took on a new partner William Simms.
* Troughton described Simms as the best craftsman h knew, and Simms and his wife came to live with Troughton at his house in Fleet Street.
* Troughton was by this time over 70 years old and was suffering from some of the ailments of old age such as rheumatism and lumbago.
* For example a dispute which Troughton became involved in towards the end of his life was with Sir James South who was President of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1829 to 1831.
* It was a sad affair in which South, who had previously been friendly with Troughton, ended up trying to damage his reputation.
* In fact a court case was still in progress when Troughton died.
* Simms continued Troughton's internationally known business after Troughton died in 1835 at his home in Fleet Street.

Born (baptised) 6 November 1753, Corney, Cumberland, England. Died 12 June 1835, London, England.
