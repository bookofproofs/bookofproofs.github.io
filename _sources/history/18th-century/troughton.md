**Edward Troughton** was an English maker of scientific instruments.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Designed and built the 24-inch reflecting telescope for the Royal Greenwich Observatory in 1789, helping to further the science of astronomy. 
2. Reduced the two-foot length of the telescope by half while maintaining the original resolution. 
3. Developed a transit circle that helped to accurately measure longitude. 
4. Made improvements to the reflecting circle, dramatically reducing its size and cost of manufacture. 
5. Designed and built an Equatorial Telescope for the Royal Observatory, which was the first to use opposite clockwork for describing circles. 
6. Conducted a survey of the southern stars and mapped them with precision, which has served as a reference for other astronomers. 
7. Helped develop the meridian circle, which made it much easier to accurately measure the positions of stars.

Born (baptised) 6 November 1753, Corney, Cumberland, England. Died 12 June 1835, London, England.
