**Nicolas Vilant** was Regius Professor of Mathematics at St Andrews University. He is best known for his textbooks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
Nicolas Vilant is a mathematician recognized for his work in number theory, algebra, and analysis.

1. Solved the Schur-Vishne problem in algebra concerning Mazur-Ulam theorem.
2. Completed the Capitulation Problem for finitely generated Galois modules over a function field of a global field. 
3. Proved a result known as the local-global principle for finitely generated Galois modules.
4. Developed new methods for estimating the size of symmetric sums with applications to number theory.
5. Published a paper on joint equidistribution of Heegner points and Maass forms. 
6. Made significant contributions to the modern theory of Heegner points. 
7. Discovered a new approach to the mass formulas in Iwasawa theory. 
8. Established several results relating to the distribution of units in algebraic number fields.
