**Tobias Mayer** was a German scientist who developed the method of determining longitude by lunar observations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first comprehensive system of lunar tables, which accurately predicted the location of the Moon. 
2. Developed a new method for determining the orbit of planets.
3. Constructed a map of the Moon's surface, including more than 60,000 individual craters. 
4. Invented the Mayer Curve which described the motion of a planet around the Sun using a mathematical formula.
5. Made significant contributions to the understanding of tides and oceanographic currents by pioneering the use of harmonic analysis. 
6. Developed a mathematical formula to account for the Earth's obliquity.
7. Discovered a method of calculating Jupiter's orbit by considering it to be composed of five separate ellipses. 
8. Proposed a new system for determining longitude by using eclipses of the Moon. 
9. Used his mathematical skills to accurately measure the gravitational pull of the Moon on the Earth. 
10. Developed an improved chronograph, an instrument used to measure the speed of celestial phenomena, such as stars.

Born 17 February 1723, Marbach, Württemberg, Germany. Died 20 February 1762, Göttingen, Germany.
