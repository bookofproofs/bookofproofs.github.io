**Robert Adrain** was an Irishman who was one of the first mathematicians to work in America.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Adrain's Rule for calculating the mass of a particle.
2. Developed the first approximation of the earth's gravitational constant, which is now known as "Adrain's Constant".
3. Devised the Adrain's Correction, which is an adjustment to the Deflection of the Vertical used to take into account the curvature of the Earth.
4. Conceived of an improved method for computing logarithms that became known as the "Adrain Logarithms". 
5. Pioneered mathematical research on the analytical theory of combinations.
6. Discovered the Laws of Combination and the Discrete Interpolation Formula, which are fundamental to statistical analysis.
7. Established the mathematical principles for the use of calculus in solving differential equations.
8. Determined the properties of curves and the methods for constructing them.
9. Authored the Handbook of Curvature and Principles of the Analytical Theory of Curves. 
10. Conducted research on the theory of elasticity, providing insights into the strength of materials.

Born 30 September 1775, Carrickfergus, Ireland. Died 10 August 1843, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA.
