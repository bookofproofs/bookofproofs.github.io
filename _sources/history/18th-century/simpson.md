**Thomas Simpson** was an English mathematician who is best remembered for his work on interpolation and numerical methods of integration.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Thomas received little formal education.
* From about 1725, when Simpson was fifteen years old, until around 1733, he taught mathematics in Nuneaton.
* Simpson was the most distinguished of a group of itinerant lecturers who taught in the London coffee houses.
* For example De Moivre used Slaughter's Coffee House in St Martin's Lane as a base during these years, and William Jones, who was a friend of Simpson, was able to make a living lecturing in coffee houses such as Child's Coffee House in St Paul's Churchyard.
* In 1743 Simpson was appointed as the head of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich.
* In fact this Academy was founded only two years before Simpson took up the post and his appointment there had an impact on the mathematical topics he investigated.
* Two years after his appointment, Simpson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.
* Simpson is best remembered for his work on interpolation and numerical methods of integration.
* However the numerical method known today as "Simpson's rule", although it did appear in his work, was something he learned from Newton as Simpson himself acknowledged.
* Much of Simpson's work in this area was based on earlier work of De Moivre.
* Simpson published Mathematical Dissertations in 1743 which discussed the attraction of the solid obtained by rotating an ellipse around one of its axes.
* Problems in astronomy such as the precession of the equinoxes were discussed by Simpson in Miscellaneous Tracts (1757).
* Simpson's attempt at an analytical solution is interpreted.
* It would be fair to note that others described Simpson's conduct as irreproachable.

Born 20 August 1710, Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, England. Died 14 May 1761, Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, England.
