**Thomas Simpson** was an English mathematician who is best remembered for his work on interpolation and numerical methods of integration.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a general method for solving polynomial equations of degree higher than four. 
2. Established Simpson's Rule as an effective numerical method for approximating definite integrals. 
3. Devised a three-component notation for fractions, involving numerator, denominator, and ancilla. 
4. Travelled to Edinburgh, Scotland in 1743 to complete studies under mathematician Colin Maclaurin. 
5. Published several papers and books on the topics of geometry, fluxions, and mechanics. 
6. Developed the Simpson Line, a special line in regards to conic sections. 
7. Was among the first to use symbols to represent the operators of algebra.

Born 20 August 1710, Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, England. Died 14 May1761, Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, England.
