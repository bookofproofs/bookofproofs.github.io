**Claude-Louis Navier** was a French mathematician best known for the Navier-Stokes equations describing the behaviour of a incompressible fluid.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He formulated his famous equations of motion for fluids using mathematical principles, which became known as Navier-Stokes equations.
2. He was the first to accurately describe the behavior of a frictionless viscous fluid in equilibrium.
3. He developed a general theory of elasticity from which he derived the elastic constants of materials.
4. He established the concept of surface tension of liquids and was the first to provide a theoretical explanation for capillary action.
5. He formulated the principles of mass, momentum, and energy conservation in his work on the elasticity of gases.
6. He introduced an empirical law that characterized the volume changing properties of gases, known as the Navier-Hugoniot relations.
7. He also discovered the phenomenon of finite elasticity and formulated the Navier equation of finite deformations.
8. He provided the theory of the distribution of stresses in curved beams and plates, which led to the development of the theory of bending of beams.

Born 10 February 1785, Dijon, France. Died 21 August 1836, Paris, France.
