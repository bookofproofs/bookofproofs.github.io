**Mary Somerville** wrote many works which influenced Maxwell. Her discussion of a hypothetical planet perturbing Uranus led Adams to his investigation. Somerville College in Oxford was named after her.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Mary Fairfax was born in the church manse in Jedburgh, the home of her mother's sister Martha Charters and Martha's husband Thomas Somerville.
* Mary's father was a naval officer, later Vice-Admiral Sir William George Fairfax, who was at sea at the time of her birth.
* Mary's mother had visited London from where her husband embarked on a long sea voyage.
* Margaret Fairfax broke her journey north at Jedburgh where Mary was born.
* Mary was the fifth of seven children but three died very young.
* Of the four remaining children, Mary was brought up with her brother who was three years older than she was.
* A sister was born when Mary was seven, and a second brother when she was ten.
* The two brothers were given a good education but, in keeping with the ideas of the time, little need was seen to educate girls so Mary's parents saw no need to provide an education for their daughter.
* When Mary was ten years old she was sent to Miss Primrose's boarding school for girls in Musselburgh (a few miles east of Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth).
* The school in Musselburgh neither gave Mary a happy time nor a good education.
* After this Mary returned to her home in Burntisland but she began to educate herself by reading every book that she could find in her home.
* In order that she might learn the correct skills for a young lady, Mary was sent to a school in Burntisland where she was taught needlework.
* However, one member of Mary's family did encourage her with her educational ambitions.
* When visiting her uncle in Jedburgh Mary told him that she had been teaching herself Latin.
* Far from being cross, her uncle encouraged her and the two would read Latin before breakfast while Mary stayed in the Jedburgh manse.
* When Mary was about thirteen, the family rented a house in Edinburgh where they spent the winter months, the summers being spent in Burntisland.
* Mary balanced her life between the social life expected of a young lady at this time and her own private study.
* In fact it was through Nasmyth that Mary first became interested in mathematics.
* This comment was enough to start Mary on the road to study Euclid's Elements which she did with the help of her younger brother's tutor.
* There was another quite different reason why Mary became interested in studying algebra.
* Her younger brother's tutor was able to provide Mary with algebra texts and help introduce her to the subject.
* Mary became so engrossed in mathematics that her parents worried that her health would suffer because of the long hours of study that she put in, usually during the night.
* Mary married Samuel Greig in 1804 when she was 24 years old.
* Her husband was a naval officer who was a distant relation on her mother's side of the family (Samuel Greig's father was a nephew of Mary's maternal grandfather).
* However Samuel was in the Russian navy and Mary's parents did not allow the marriage to take place until Greig received an appointment in London, for they did not want Mary to go to Russia.
* Mary and Samuel Greig went to London but Mary found that her husband did not understand her desires to learn.
* By this time Mary had given birth to two sons and on the death of her husband she returned to Scotland with them.
* In this correspondence they discussed the mathematical problems set in the Mathematical Repository and in 1811 Mary received a silver medal for her solution to one of these problems.
* At this time Mary also read Newton's Principia and, at Wallace's suggestion, Laplace's Mécanique Céleste and many other mathematical and astronomical texts.
* In 1812 Mary Greig married William Somerville who was an inspector of hospitals.
* William was the son of her aunt Martha and her husband Thomas Somerville in whose manse she had been born.
* At this time William and Mary lived in Edinburgh and, advised by Wallace, Mary read the most advanced French texts of the day.
* In 1814 Mary's oldest daughter from her first marriage died at the age of nine and, in the same year, the only son of her second marriage died as a baby.
* When William Somerville was appointed as Inspector to the Army Medical Board in 1816, the family moved from Edinburgh to London.
* Mary's husband was elected to the Royal Society and Mary and William moved in the leading scientific circles of the day.
* In 1817 William and Mary visited Paris and were introduced to the leading scientists there by Biot and Arago (whom they had met in London).
* Mary met Laplace, Poisson, Poinsot, Émile Mathieu and many others.
* Returning to London, Mary and William lived in central London which enabled them to continue close contact with their many scientific friends.
* Mary Somerville published her first paper The magnetic properties of the violet rays of the solar spectrum in the Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1826.
* In 1827 Lord Brougham made a request on behalf of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge for Mary Somerville to translate Laplace's Mécanique Céleste.
* However Mary went far beyond a translation, for she explained in detail the mathematics used by Laplace which was unfamiliar to most mathematicians in England at that time.
* Mary Somerville spent about a year abroad in 1832-33.
* Back in London, Mary helped Ada in her study of mathematics and provided strong encouragement to her.
* Honours now come quickly to Mary Somerville.
* A letter which Mary wrote to Arago contained information important enough for him to have an extract from the letter published as a paper in Comptes Rendus in 1836.
* In 1838 William Somerville's health deteriorated and the family went to Italy.
* (William survived for 22 further years there.) Most of the rest of Mary's life was spent in Italy where she wrote many works which influenced Maxwell.
* Many further honours were given to Mary as a result of this publication.
* Mary Somerville was a strong supporter of women's education and women's suffrage.
* When John Stuart Mill, the British philosopher and economist, organised a massive petition to parliament to give women the right to vote, he had Mary put her signature first on the petition.
* Somerville College in Oxford was named after her in 1879 because of her strong support for women's education.
* Many tributes to Mary Somerville sum up her contribution.

Born 26 December 1780, Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, Scotland. Died 29 November 1872, Naples, Italy.
