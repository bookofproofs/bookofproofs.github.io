**Antoine Parseval** was a French mathematician best known for his theorem in Fourier analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The starting point of the historical events which were to play a major role in Parseval' life was the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789.
* Parseval, perhaps not surprisingly since he was of noble birth, was a royalist so for him the increasing problems for the monarchy meant that his life was more and more in danger.
* It was a time of great danger for royalist supporters and indeed it proved so for Parseval who was imprisoned in 1792.
* This may have been good news for France in general but royalists like Parseval, despite being freed from prison, remained in fear of their lives.
* Parseval should have kept his head down if he wanted at avoid trouble but it was a time when it was almost impossible not to get drawn into the political events.
* Parseval published poetry against Napoleon's regime and, not surprisingly, had to flee from France when Napoleon ordered his arrest.
* Parseval had only five publications, all presented to the Académie des Sciences.
* It was the second of these, dated 5 April 1799, which contains the result known today as Parseval's theorem.
* Today this theorem is seen in the context of Fourier series, and often also in more abstract settings which are quite far removed from Parseval's original ideas.
* Parseval's result was not widely known until his five papers were all published by the Académie des Sciences in 1806.
* Before that it was known by members of the Académie and it appeared in works by Lacroix and Poisson before Parseval's papers were printed.
* Parseval was never honoured with election to the Académie des Sciences.
* It would not be unfair to say that Parseval has fared well in having a well known result, which is quite far removed from his contribution, named after him.

Born 27 April 1755, Rosières-aux-Salines, France. Died 16 August 1836, Paris, France.
