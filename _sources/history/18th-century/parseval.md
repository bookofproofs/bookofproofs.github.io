**Antoine Parseval** was a French mathematician best known for his theorem in Fourier analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a generalization of the Newton-Raphson method for solving algebraic equations.
2. Developed the Parseval equation, an analytical tool for the investigation of waves, oscillations, and the nature of sound.
3. Discovered and solved the convergence problem in numerical integration.
4. Developed a mathematical approach to the difficulties of ballistics, which helped improve the accuracy of artillery.
5. Proved the de Moivre–Laplace theorem, which pertains to the normal distribution.
6. Produced the first complete system of complex analysis.
7. Developed a formula for the combination of two power series.
8. Charted a path toward discovering analytical solutions for differential equations.
9. Developed a method for the evaluation of definite integrals by expanding functions into infinite series of sinusoidal functions.

Born 27 April 1755, Rosières-aux-Salines, France. Died 16 August 1836, Paris, France.
