**George Atwood** was an English mathematician best known for his invention of a low-friction pulley system.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Newton's theorem of revolving orbits which stated that planets, moons and other celestial bodies moved in ellipses rather than circles. 
2. Demonstrated his theorems with a modified version of Newton's method of fluxions. 
3. Invented a paper-based calculating machine called the Atwood machine in 1783 which was an early forerunner of the modern computer. 
4. Published a key algebraic equation that states that for all n, n + n = 0n.
5. Established the addition rule for logarithms, which states that when the logarithm of a sum or a difference of two numbers is taken, the logarithms of those terms are added together.

Born October 1745, Westminster, London, England. Died 11 July 1807, Westminster, London, England.
