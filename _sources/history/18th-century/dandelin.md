**Germinal Dandelin** was a French mathematician best known for a method of approximating the roots of an algebraic equation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the principle of concentric spheres, which states that the locus of points equidistant from the two foci of an ellipse is a sphere. 
2. Developed the theorem of polyhedral angles, which states that the angles of a polyhedron remain constant regardless of how the polyhedron is manipulated. 
3. Improved the theory of multiple integrals, used in the calculation of volumes of solids and areas of surfaces. 
4. Created a method for representing surfaces analytically, allowing for the exploration of their geometric properties. 
5. Demonstrated that the coefficients of a characteristic equation of a differential equation of the second-order represents conics.
6. Advanced the theory of poles and polars, a fundamental theorem in Euclidean geometry used to describe various shapes. 
7. Provided insight into the theory of elliptic functions, which are periodic functions of a complex variable often used to describe periodic phenomena.

Born 12 April 1794, Le Bourget, near Paris, France. Died 15 February 1847, Brussels, Belgium.
