**Georg Simon Ohm** was a German mathematician best known for _Ohm's Law_ on electrical resistance.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Ohm's law (1827), which states that the current through an electrical conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference between them.
2. Proved the inverse square law for magnetism (1832).
3. Discovered the connection between electrical and acoustic circuits (launching the study of acoustics) (1839).
4. Discovered the concept of electrical resistance (1841).
5. Formulated the mathematical theory of electrical circuits (1845).
6. Developed the concept of electrical fields and their electricity problems (1862).
7. Established a practical method for measuring electrical currents (1870).

Born 16 March 1789, Erlangen, Bavaria (now Germany). Died 6 July 1854, Munich, Bavaria, Germany.
