### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a formula to calculate the acceleration of the Moon due to gravity.
2. Discovered the existence of eight asteroids. 
3. Proved that the Moon's orbit was not a perfect circle.
4. Described the motions of comets and described the orbits. 
5. Demonstrated that the comet Encke had a period of less than three years. 
6. Found that Jupiter had a mean motion of 6 revolutions per year. 
7. Discovered and cataloged 27 different nebulae. 
8. Found that the orbits of the planets followed Bode's Law.

Born 27 June 1767, Contamines, Haute-Savoie, France. Died 7 June 1843, Paris, France.
