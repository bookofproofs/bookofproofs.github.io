**Giordano Riccati** made contributions to music, architecture, mechanics and mathematics. He studied and experimented with Young's modulus 25 years before Young.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed general solutions to linear differential equations, the Riccati equation, and other special cases of differential equations.
2. Coined the term "integral invariant" to describe the solution of linear differential equations.
3. Published a book titled “Fondamenti di Algebra,” introducing the concept of matrices and their solution with determinants.
4. Discovered the Riccati equation, a solution to certain nonlinear differential equations.
5. Proposed the "Riccati transformation" method, which converts second order linear differential equations into equations of the first order.
6. Proved the equivalence of differential equations of the first and second orders.
7. Established important findings related to the theory of elliptic functions and polynomial equations.
8. Published a work titled “Analisi dei Fatti,” which outlines a theory that is still used today by mathematicians.

Born 25 February 1709, Castelfranco, Veneto (now Italy). Died 20 July 1790, Treviso, Veneto (now Italy).
