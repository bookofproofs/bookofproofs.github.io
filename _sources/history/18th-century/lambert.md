**Johann Lambert** was the first to provide a rigorous proof that `$\pi$` is irrational.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the modern theory of hyperbolic functions and is regarded to be the first mathematician to account for non-Euclidean geometry.
2. Wrote “Photometria”, a book on the measurement of light and color in which he introduced the concept of the ‘logarithmic visualPhotometrika and defined the brightness of a light source.
3. Introduced the first consistent system of geometric notations and concepts, allowing him to outline a set of rules for a new type of geometry and the first to postulate the idea of ‘fluxions’, a term which later became known as “differential calculus”.
4. Founded the field of projective geometry and created a new branch of mathematics called “Lambertian” from his name.
5. Developed a rigorous proof of Euclid’s Parallel Postulate, disproving the theory of parallel lines in relation to infinite space.
6. Proposed Pi could be described as an irrational number, thus disproving the Pythagorean Theorem which was widely accepted at the time.
7. Pioneered the foundation of trigonometry, being one of the first to recognize the importance of logarithms in that field.
8. Was the first mathematician to make use of the exponential series, as well as developing a procedure to solve equations in up to 4 unknowns.

Born 26 August 1728, Mülhausen, Alsace (now Mulhouse, France). Died 25 September 1777, Berlin, Prussia (now Germany).
