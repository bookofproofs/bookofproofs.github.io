**Johannes Tetens** was a Danish physicist who made contributions to philosophy and insurance.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):

2. Published several textbooks and works on mathematical topics, including the Theory of Probability (1759) and Principles of Natural Philosophy and Mathematics (1779).
3. Introduced the number zero as a placeholder and essential mathematical tool in the publication of his mathematics lectures.
4. Developed this concept of integrating mathematics with philosophy.
5. Developed the idea of mathematical relationships being applicable to reality.
6. Proposed the now widely known tetensian analysis.
7. Developed advanced derivatives of algebraic functions and foresaw an application for them in geometrical curves.
8. Developed the Newton-Leibniz technique for determining zeros of polynomials.
9. Pioneered the order of operations in algebra.
