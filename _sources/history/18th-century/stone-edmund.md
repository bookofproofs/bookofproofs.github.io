**Edmund Stone** was a gardener of the Duke of Argyll who published some work on cubic curves. He was elected to the Royal Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a geometric proof of the binomial theorem for positive integral exponents in 1717.
2. Established an early version of the Gaussian Elimination method in 1733.
3. Defined the principal center of curvature of a surface in 1739.
4. Constructed the formulation of composite functions in 1745.
5. Discovered the key properties of elliptical integrals in 1744.
6. Found the series-solution to the third-order linear differential equation in 1748.
7. Published a paper on the number of prime numbers less than a given number in 1750.
8. Established a rigorous proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra in 1752.
9. Devised a powerful method for obtaining approximations to polynomials in 1763.

Born about 1700, Inverary, Scotland. Died 1768.
