**Edmund Stone** was a gardener of the Duke of Argyll who published some work on cubic curves. He was elected to the Royal Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* At the age of eighteen, Stone came to the attention of the duke when the latter found Stone's copy of Newton's Principia in his grounds and assumed that it had been removed from his library.
* Stone translated works of the Marquis de l'Hôpital on conic sections (1720) and Bion on scientific instruments (1723).
* In 1730, he published The Method of Fluxions, both Direct and Inverse: the first part is a translation and reworking in Newtonian notation of De l'Hôpital's  Analyse des infinement petits (in fact, written by Johann Bernoulli), and the second part is Stone's own.
* Following the death of the Duke of Argyll in 1743, Stone's situation deteriorated and he spent the latter part of his life in poverty.

Born about 1700, Inverary, Scotland. Died 1768.
