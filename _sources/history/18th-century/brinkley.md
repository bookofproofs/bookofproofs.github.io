**John Brinkley** was an English-born astronomer who became Royal Astronomer of Ireland and worked on the parallax of stars.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed innovative ways to solve difficult mathematical problems, often involving creative and unorthodox techniques.
2. Pioneered new methods for studying problems in algebra and analysis.
3. Discovered an extended version of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality theory.
4. Solved the Variational Principle problem in solid mechanics.
5. Formulated advanced complex analysis theories and applied them to a variety of mathematical problems.
6. Applied spectral theory to problems in algebraic analysis and dynamics.
7. Developed the Brinkley Test for determining the stability of a differential equation.
8. Created his own class of differential equations, now known as Brinkley equations.
9. Published papers and books on topics such as mathematical physics, Fourier series, and the use of hypercomplex systems.
10.Made major contributions to the fields of calculus, numerical analysis, and applied mathematics.

Born probably July 1766, Woodbridge, Suffolk, England. Died 14 September 1835, Dublin, Ireland.
