**Georges Buffon** was a French scientist who was important in the area of natural history. His needle experiment caused much discussion about probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Law of Large Numbers, which states that the more measurements are taken the more likely the measurements average out. 
2. Devised the Theory of Probability, which deals with the mathematical calculations of statistical data.
3. Expanded upon the works of Descartes, Newton and Leibniz and created the modern field of mathematics.
4. Advanced the calculus of variations, a branch of mathematics dealing with maximising or minimising functions. 
5. Demonstrated the principle of continuity in a mathematical system. 
6. Explored and applied calculus in the fields of physics and astronomy.
7. Developed the Equivalence Principle, which states that when two sets of data have the same probability distribution. 
8. Established the importance of the geometric properties of curves, such as arc length, in mathematics.
9. Proposed the principle of Least Action, which states that the evolution of a system correspond to the path that minimizes its action.

Born 7 September 1707, Montbard, CÃ´te d'Or, France. Died 16 April 1788, Paris, France.
