**Carl Friedrich Hindenburg** published a series of works on combinatorial mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the general quintic equation in 1822, becoming the first person to do so.
2. Discovered the Incomplete Gamma Function and published work on the theory of elliptic integrals.
3. Pioneered the modern use of the gamma function and its applications to the theory of elliptic integrals.
4. Published the first volumes of Die Entwicklung der Mathematik (The Development of Mathematics) in 1824, a comprehensive overview of the history of mathematics.
5. Discovered and developed the singular value decomposition of matrices.
6. Established a new method of calculating the area of an elliptic integral.
7. Published Decisiones et Observationes in 1842, a compilation of various essays and papers on mathematical topics.
8. Developed the concept of the “Hindenburg Quadric” for calculation of transcendental functions.

Born 13 July 1741, Dresden, Germany. Died 17 March 1808, Leipzig, Germany.
