**François Français** was one of a pair of French mathematical brothers who worked on partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The brothers were the children of Jacques Frédéric Français, who was a grocer in Saverne, and Maria Barbara Steib.
* In 1789 François became a seminarist, that is a student in an institution for training candidates for the priesthood.
* Political events produced an interlude in Français' career.
* Français joined the government army in May 1793 which was moving to put down the rebellion.
* Français continued to fight with the government forces and as the autumn approached they became a more cohesive force under a single command and heavily defeated the rebel army (by this time numbering around 65000) in October.
* Français, however, left the government army in October and returned to teaching.
* The period of army life must have been attractive to Français for he quickly rejoined the army as an officer and served for a further four years until October 1797 when he was appointed professor of mathematics at the École Centrale du Haut-Rhin in Colmar.
* Français never seemed to be one to stay in any one post for long but this appointment in Colmar lasted longer than any of his others.
* Much of François Français's work was published after his death by his brother who added to it in a way to make the contribution of each hard to distinguish.
* François worked on partial differential equations and his memoir of 1795 on this topic was developed further and presented to the Académie des Sciences in 1797.
* Lacroix praised Français' work and described it as making a major contribution to the study of partial differential equations; however, it was not published.
* Français was friendly with Arbogast and together they worked on the calculus of derivations.
* After Arbogast died in 1803, Français inherited his mathematical papers and continued to work on the calculus of derivations.
* After this Français did work which was praised by Legendre, Lagrange, Lacroix and Biot but submitted no further memoirs during his lifetime.
* However, as described above, his brother published much of his work after his death, publishing four memoirs of François Français's work.

Born 7 April 1768, Saverne, Bas-Rhin, France. Died 30 October 1810, Mainz, Germany.
