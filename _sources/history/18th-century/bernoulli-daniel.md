**Daniel Bernoulli** was a Dutch-born member of the Swiss mathematical family. His most important work considered the basic properties of fluid flow, pressure, density and velocity, and gave the _Bernoulli principle_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the mathematical theory of probability and expected utility.
2. Developed the Bernoulli Equation, a fundamental building block in mathematics which forms the basis for many branches of mathematics and physics.
3. Invented the Stirling numbers, named after him, which aid in the study of permutations and probability theory.
4. Discovered the rule of partial differential equations.
5. Developed the principle of virtual velocities, which is the foundation of modern fluid dynamics.
6. Demonstrated the conservation of energy in his work Hydrodynamica.
7. Formulated a law of large numbers in his work Ars Conjectandi concerning the probability of events in large numbers of trials.
8. Developed a mathematical concept known as Bernoulliâ€™s principle, which explains the relationship between pressure and velocity in fluids. 
9. Provided an equation for the flow of an incompressible fluid, now known as the Bernoulli equation. 
10. Devised new methods for the solution of linear differential equations.

Born 8 February 1700, Groningen, Netherlands. Died 17 March 1782, Basel, Switzerland.
