**Karl  Mollweide** was a German mathematician and astronomer. He invented a map projection called the Mollweide projection.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the eponymous Mollweide projection, a map projection from the sphere onto the plane.
2. Developed the theory of elliptic functions and proposed a solution for the interpolation problem of Gauss.
3. Represented the equations of the three-body problem in the form of a differential equation of the third order.
4. Proved that the second-order equation of co-ordinate geometry with two variables is integrable by quadratures.
5. Developed Mollweide’s harmonic equation, a method for the integration of differential equations.
6. Established a new method for the integration of the Laplace equation in polar coordinates.
7. Discovered a special case of the Runge–Kutta method for solving initial value problems for ordinary differential equations.
8. Proved Thales’s theorem and established a new way to construct elementary geometric figures in an analytic way.
9. Developed a method for solving linear equations which became known as Mollweide’s formula.
10. Developed the theory of Möbius transformations and derived the Möbius invariants.

Born 3 February 1774, Wolfenbüttel, Brunswick, now Germany. Died 10 March 1825, Leipzig, Germany.
