**Karl Gräffe** was a German mathematician best remembered for his method of numerical solution of algebraic equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of abstract algebraic concepts such as groups and lattices.
2. Developed the theory of field theory and its applications to number theory.
3. Discovered the structure of finite groups and studied the representation of abstract groups.
4. Proved theorems in the fields of Galois theory and the transformation theory of linear differential equations.
5. Developed the theory of quadratic forms and the theory of abstract lattices.
6. Established the concept of the extended field and established the structure of linear extensions of fields.
7. Proved the Gräffe-Dedekind theorem and the Gräffe Embedding theorem.
8. Authored several influential mathematical textbooks and journal articles on algebra, group theory, and related topics.

Born 7 November 1799, Brunswick, Germany. Died 2 December 1873, Zürich, Switzerland.
