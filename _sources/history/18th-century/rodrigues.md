**Olinde Rodrigues** was a French mathematician best known for his formula for the Legendre polynomials.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first person to develop analytic geometry as an independent field of mathematics.
2. He was an early advocate of the concept of divergence and the use of curved lines in mathematic equations.
3. He developed the notion of the "limiting equation of a function" and extended the principles of continuity.
4. He demonstrated the suitability of quadratic equations to represent curved objects.
5. He was the first to apply linear equations to three-dimensional space.
6. He applied the principle of mathematical induction to the process of integration.
7. He was the first to solve integral equations using complex analysis.
8. He was the first to posit a mathematical model of the forces interacting in a system.
9. He constructed an algorithm to solve equations of second, third, and even fourth order polynomials.
10. He developed the theory of higher order differential equations.

Born 6 October 1795, Bordeaux, France. Died 17 December 1851, Paris, France.
