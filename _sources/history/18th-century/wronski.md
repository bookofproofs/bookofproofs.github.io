**Jozéf Wronski** wrote on the philosophy of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel approach to the calculus of variations, known as the Calculus of Residues.
2. Formulated a general method of constructing and solving algebraic equations, which is now known as Wronskian.
3. Developed the theory of equations, and studied the integers of different types of algebraic equations.
4. Extended the mathematical concept of determinants, inventing the Barycentric calculus.
5. Worked extensively on the theory of finite differences and their applications.
6. Was the first to solve and simplify the equations of the fourth order.
7. Developed polynomial interpolation theory.
8. Determined specific approximate methods of solving equations without the use of calculus or limits.
9. Studied the properties of elliptic functions and other special functions.
10. Discovered the principle of analytical cancellation, a method for computing the inverse of a matrix.

Born 23 August 1778, Wolsztyn, Poland. Died 8 August 1853, Neuilly-sur-Seine (near Paris), France.
