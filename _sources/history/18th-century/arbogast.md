**Louis Arbogast** was a French mathematician who worked on the calculus of derivatives and the operational calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* From this time on information on Arbogast becomes more plentiful.
* While at the Collège de Colmar Arbogast entered a mathematical competition which was run by the St Petersburg Academy.
* Arbogast submitted an essay to the St Petersburg Academy in which he came down firmly on the side of Euler.
* Arbogast won the prize with his essay and his notion of discontinuous function became important in Cauchy's more rigorous approach to analysis.
* In 1789 Arbogast moved from Colmar to Strasbourg where he taught mathematics at the École d'Artillerie.
* Arbogast's career in Strasbourg reached new heights.
* The formal algebraic manipulation of series investigated by Lagrange and Laplace in the 1770s was put in the form of operator equalities by Arbogast in 1800 in Calcul des dérivations.
* Arbogast was interested in the history of mathematics and classified Mersenne's papers and collected manuscript copies of memoirs and letters of Fermat, Descartes, Johann Bernoulli, Varignon, de L'Hôpital and others.
* Arbogast was friendly with François Français and together they worked on the calculus of derivations and the operational calculus.
* After Arbogast died in 1803, François Français inherited his collection of manuscripts, and also his mathematical papers.
* He continued Arbogast's work on the operational calculus and presented a memoir on this topic, in particular applying the methods to study projectiles in a resistant medium, to the Académie des Sciences in 1804.
* The historical manuscripts which went to François Français on Arbogast's death were bought by Libri from a bookseller in Metz in 1839.
* We should mention one other important contribution made by Arbogast.
* Arbogast was elected to the Académie des Sciences in 1792 and the mathematics section of the Institut National in 1796.

Born 4 October 1759, Mutzig, Alsace. Died 18 April 1803, Strasbourg, France.
