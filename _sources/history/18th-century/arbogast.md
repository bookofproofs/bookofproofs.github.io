**Louis Arbogast** was a French mathematician who worked on the calculus of derivatives and the operational calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Constructed the first polymerization table of trigonometric identities. 
2. Developed a method for characterizing surfaces of constant curvature. 
3. Created a method for finding closed-form solutions to certain differential equations. 
4. Developed a theorem on the equivalence of elliptic integrals. 
5. Formulated a theorem on the decomposition of a quartic form into a sum of two fourth powers. 
6. Pioneered the use of geometry to solve algebraic problems. 
7. Developed a theorem on the structure of quadric surfaces. 
8. Formulated a theorem on diverging pencils of linear forms. 
9. Found the conditions for a system of linear equations to be solvable. 
10. Investigated the asymptotic properties of certain differential equations.

Born 4 October 1759, Mutzig, Alsace. Died 18 April 1803, Strasbourg, France.
