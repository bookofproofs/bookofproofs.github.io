**François-Joseph Servois** was a French mathematician who worked on projective geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He proposed the concept of linear homogeneous differential equations of second order, which later served as the basis for the mathematical theories of Laplace, Poisson and Hamilton.
2. He developed the theory of the general solution of linear equations, which helped in the formulation of the theory of linear computational operators.
3. He was among the first to develop the theory of linear equations with constant coefficients.
4. He formulated the theory of intersection of conic sections, which provides the basis for current applications of algebraic geometry.
5. He also contributed to the formulation of the theory of limits and developed the first form of analysis known as infinitesimal analysis.
6. He established the notion of linearization, which is the basis for the theory of linear operators in the calculus.
7. He was the first to introduce the use of fractions to represent negative numbers in algebra.
8. He developed the theory of algebraic equations, which today serves as the foundation of modern algebra.

Born 19 July 1768, Mont-de-Laval (N of Morteau), Doubs, France. Died 17 April 1847, Mont-de-Laval, Doubs, France.
