**Émilie du Châtelet** was a French noblewoman who became important to mathematics as the translator of Newton's _Principia_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Refined Pierre- Louis Moreau de Maupertuis' principle of least action.
2. Published an influential book called “Institution du calcul infinitésimal” (Institution of Infinitesimal Calculus).
3. Proved the conservation of energy and developed formulas for kinetic energy and vis viva, a form of the conservation of momentum.
4. Developed the theory of air resistance, heat flow, and vibration.
5. Discovered Newton's law of reciprocal proportions and extended it to specific heats.
6. Was the first to provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of gravity.
7. Wrote extensively about metaphysics and physics in her “Discours sur le bonheur” (Discourse on Happiness).

Born 17 December 1706, Paris, France. Died 10 September 1749, Lunéville, France.
