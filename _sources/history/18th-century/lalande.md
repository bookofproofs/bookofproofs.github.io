**Jérôme Lalande** was a French astronomer who made important measurements of the Solar System.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the first comprehensive star catalog in 1799, which contained nearly 10,000 stars.
2. Shortened the calculation of the trajectory of comets from days to hours.
3.Developed a method for accurately predicting the return of comets using their orbital elements.
4. Formulated a simplified criterion for establishing whether a planet belongs to the Solar System.
5. Established a procedure for calculating the orbits of comets, asteroids and planets.
6. Calculated the mass of Jupiter and Saturn and the masses of their moons.
7. Discovered two minor moons of Uranus and two comets.
8. Compiled tables of perturbed planetary motions of Mercury and Venus.
9. Established a new system of coordinates for studying the positions of stars.
10. Demonstrated the existence and extent of the solar parallax.
