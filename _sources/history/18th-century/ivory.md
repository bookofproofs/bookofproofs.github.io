**James Ivory** was a Scottish mathematician who wrote on mathematical astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After his university education Ivory taught mathematics in Dundee Academy.
* By 1815 Ivory's mental state seems to have worsened and he tried to resign his post but was persuaded to withdraw his resignation.
* Ivory was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1815.
* Between these dates, in 1838, Ivory gave the Bakerian lecture to the Royal Society, entitled On the theory of astronomical refractions.
* Ivory and Wallace were early supporters of the work of the French analysts, especially Lagrange and Laplace.
* Ivory's critical commentary of Laplace's Mécanique céleste was praised by Laplace.
* Ivory wrote several articles for encyclopaedias, including the influential Equations in Encyclopaedia Britannica.
* We mentioned above that Ivory, because of his mental problems, tended to quarrel with his fellow mathematicians.
* His relations with Wallace deteriorated with arguments over Ivory's Attraction article to Encyclopaedia Britannica.
* Ivory's article on Capillary action for the same publication led to an argument with Thomas Young.
* Many other cases were simply caused by Ivory suffering from a quite incorrect belief that he was being persecuted by others.

Born 17 February 1765, Dundee, Scotland. Died 21 September 1842, London, England.
