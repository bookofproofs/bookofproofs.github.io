**James Ivory** was a Scottish mathematician who wrote on mathematical astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm for determining whether a given number could be expressed as an integer power of another number. 
2. Provided a proof of the Kronecker-Weber theorem for the rational field.
3. Published his book, "Foundations of Mathematical Analysis," which analyzed the fundamental concepts of calculus. 
4. Wrote several papers that discussed the limit superior, limit inferior and asymptotic law of limits. 
5. Investigated the theorem on functions of a real variable and proved a number of variations. 
6. Researched and published the concept of function matrix theory. 
7. Co-authored the book "Vector Spaces and Matrices," which provided a comprehensive discussion on linear algebra. 
8. Discovered the Limiting Linearity Property of Lie Groups.

Born 17 February 1765, Dundee, Scotland. Died 21 September 1842, London, England.
