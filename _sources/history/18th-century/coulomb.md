**Charles Coulomb** worked on applied mechanics but he is best known for his work on electricity and magnetism.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a treatise on mathematics in 1773, titled “Mémoire sur les forces mouvantes” which contained groundbreaking research on the motion of bodies
2. Developed the law of electrostatics, now known as Coulomb’s law, which describes the force between two charged particles
3. Proved that the electrical force between two charged bodies is proportional to their charge
4. Proved the inverse square law for magnetic forces, in which the magnitude of the force between two magnets decreases as the inverse of the square of the distance between them
5. Constructed an equation to describe the static frictional force between two surfaces
6. Performed experiments to investigate the nature of electricity and magnetism and to mathematically study them
7. Determined the force of torsion between two rods. Developed the torsion balance, which is now called the Coulomb balance

Born 14 June 1736, Angoulême, France. Died 23 August 1806, Paris, France.
