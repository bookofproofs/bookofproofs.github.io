**Jean-Baptiste Biot** was a French mathematician who worked in astronomy, elasticity, electricity and magnetism, heat, optics and geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the Principle of Convergence and Divergence of Series in 1826.
2. Discovered that if a sequence of partial sums converges, the limit is independent of the order in which the terms of the series are taken.
3. Developed a method of determining the location of an earthquakeâ€™s epicenter by triangulation based on the arrival times of seismic waves.
4. Investigated the properties of optical flares and mirages.
5. Developed an equation to describe the thermal and electrical properties of matter.
6. Found that the electric current traversing two wires affected the degree of magnetization of a third, interconnected wire.
7. Discovered that electricity flowing through a wire created a magnetic field around the wire.
8. Proposed the hypothesis that the Earth is asymmetrical in its distribution of mass.
9. Wrote the first treatise on the construction of charts of the heavens.
10. Investigated the mathematical properties of Bessel functions.

Born 21 April 1774, Paris, France. Died 3 February 1862, Paris, France.
