**Théodore Olivier** was a French geometer who made string models of ruled surfaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He obtained the help of three top scientists, one being Théodore Olivier, the other two being Baptiste Dumas and Eugène Péclet.
* Olivier became a professor at the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures when it opened in the Hôtel de Juigné in the Marais district of Paris in 1829.
* In his role as professor Olivier lectured on descriptive geometry and mechanics.
* From the 1840's Olivier wrote textbooks.
* In fact Olivier earned quite a good income from selling these models, particularly in the United States.
* Other institutions in the United States such as the Columbia School of Mines also purchased models from Olivier while Princeton had copies of Olivier's models made for them.
* In 1849 Olivier presented a full set of the range of models he had created to the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers.
* In 1857, four years after Olivier died, Harvard University purchased 24 of Olivier's models from Fabre de Lagrange and after the university received the order Benjamin Peirce gave a series of lectures on the mathematics which they illustrated.
* Even after giving a complete set of his models to the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, forty models were still in Olivier's possession at the time of his death.
* When Gillispie died Olivier's models were sold to the college.

Born 21 January 1793, Lyon, France. Died 5 August 1853, Lyon, France.
