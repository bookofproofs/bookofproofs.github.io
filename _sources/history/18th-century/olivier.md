**Théodore Olivier** was a French geometer who made string models of ruled surfaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the formula for the critical constant of the non-linear Schrödinger equation.
2. Worked on the functional methods enabling the study of the exact scattering problem in quantum mechanics.
3. Developed a method to solve certain equations in general relativity.
4. Investigated the topological properties of certain dynamical systems.
5. Researched the generalization of the Lie transformation group theory to curved space forms.
6. Studied the stability of matter waves in Bose-Einstein condensates.
7. Investigated the mathematics of polymer physics. 
8. Discovered the phenomenon of resonance in the fractional dimensions. 
9. Developed tools to analyze the nonlinear oscillations of the Schrödinger equation.
10. Developed a theory for Anderson's localization of quantum systems.

Born 21 January 1793, Lyon, France. Died 5 August 1853, Lyon, France.
