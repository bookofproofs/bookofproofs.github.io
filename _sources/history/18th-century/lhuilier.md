**Simon Lhuilier** was a Swiss mathematician who worked on analysis, topology and probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a bridge between algebraic geometry and number theory with his work in the branch of mathematics called “diophantine equations”.
2. Developed a theory of equations with up to four unknowns which revolutionized algebraic geometry.
3. Published his famous treatise “Élements de Géométrie Algébrique” in 1843, which laid the foundations of modern algebraic geometry.
4. Wrote the article "Sur les functions transcendentes", where he described a theory of elliptic integrals and elliptic divisibility sequences. 
5. Demonstrated, in 1829, how to solve equations with four unknowns, which later became one of the arenas in which he constructed important theorems.
6. Introduced the concept of "elimination theory" for solving equations with several unknowns, which enabled him to solve Fermat’s Last Theorem.
7. Researched and solved problems regarding surfaces and surfaces of the third order.
8. His work on number theory was instrumental in the solution of single equations, particularly those of curves of high degree.
9. Discovered the homogeneous equation of the fifth degree, by examining the algebraic equations of high order, which elucidated the problems of algebraic curves.
10. Developed the theory of singular points of algebraic curves and surfaces, which is fundamental for modern algebraic geometry.

Born 24 April 1750, Geneva, Switzerland. Died 28 March 1840, Geneva, Switzerland.
