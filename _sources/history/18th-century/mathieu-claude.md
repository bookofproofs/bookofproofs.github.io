**Claude-Louis Mathieu** was a French astronomer who was one of those responsible for the adoption of the metric system.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published several fundamental works on the theory of differential equations, including the General Theory of Differential Equations in 1830.
2. Developed a classification of homogenous linear differential equations with constant coefficients in 1832.
3. Established the first rigorous treatment of the theory of surfaces, in part by applying the theory of integrals on them in 1845.
4. Developed the theory of conformal mapping in 1871.
5. Formulated the concepts of integral invariants and the generalized potential function in 1876.
6. Established the theory of curves with distinguished properties that are related to differential equations in 1882.
7. Formulated the theory of graphs and networks in 1884.
8. Developed the Mathieu groups of functions and the Mathieu functions in 1888.
9. Introduced the origin of the theory of p-adic numbers in 1891.

Born 25 November 1783, MÃ¢con, France. Died 5 March 1875, Paris, France.
