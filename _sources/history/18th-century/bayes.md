**Thomas Bayes** was an English clergyman who set out his theory of probability in 1764. His conclusions were accepted by Laplace in 1781, rediscovered by Condorcet, and remained unchallenged until Boole questioned them. Since then Bayes' techniques have been subject to controversy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proposed the theorem of probability, which introduced the notion of probability as a measure of the degree of belief in a given proposition. 
2. Developed a law of large numbers, which which came to be one of the foundations of modern statistical inference. 
3. Proposed and developed Bayes theorem, which is used today to assess risk in a variety of different fields such as finance, healthcare, and political science. 
4. Applied the law of transform and inverse transform to lay the foundations of modern probability theory. 
5. Developed the Bayesian statistical method, an approach to statistical analysis based on the concept of conditional probability. 
6. Applied the law of probability in games of chance, which he used to make predictions concerning the outcomes of lotteries.

Born 1702, London, England. Died 17 April 1761, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England.
