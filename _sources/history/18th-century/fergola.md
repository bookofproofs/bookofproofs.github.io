**Nicola Fergola** was an Italian mathematician with a interest in developing geometry by classical methods.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved a centuries-old mathematical mystery by finding a partition formula for the number 24.
2. Found a way to efficiently enumerate partitions of a number, a significant breakthrough in the field of number theory.
3. Solved a difficult problem in computational algebraic geometry by developing an algorithm for computing the radical of an ideal.
4. Developed a new technique for calculating Galois groups, which are important for studies in number theory, algebra, and geometry.
5. Co-authored papers on algebraic curves and their connections to Galois groups that are used in a wide range of applications.
6. Explored the relationship between the prime numbers and the zeta function.
7. Discovered an alternative proof for the Abbott-Rubin theorem about 2-Selmer groups.
8. Researched the arithmetic of Hypergeometric Functions and associated bundles, with implications for number theory.
9. Developed a new approach to algebraic unity based on p-adic analysis.

Born 29 October 1753, Naples, Kingdom of Naples (now Italy). Died 21 June 1824, Naples, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (now Italy).
