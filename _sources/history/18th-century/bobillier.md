**Étienne Bobillier** is best known for his work on polars of curves and of algebraic surfaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the theorem of ranges, which unified the theory of equations and classical geometry.
2. Pioneered the study of the calculus of variations.
3. Discovered the first example of a continuous curve, shaped like an arc of a parabola.
4. Constructed a theory of the logarithms of negative numbers.
5. Developed the infinitesimal calculus and introduced a notation for derivatives.
6. Established the foundations of algebraic analysis and created the theory of algebraic equations.
7. Introduced the concept of a function to mathematics.
8. Advanced methods of analytic geometry, including the use of curves defined by equations.
9. Invented an early form of integration and differentiation.
10. Developed integral equations which allowed series expansions and helped lay the groundwork for power series.

Born 17 April 1798, Lons-le-Saunier, France. Died 22 March 1840, Châlons-sur-Marne, France.
