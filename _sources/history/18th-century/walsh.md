**John Walsh** was an eccentric Irish mathematician who wrote on a wide variety of mathematical topics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm that enabled him to solve in a single step a problem that mathematicians had previously believed would require six steps.
2. Worked with a team to devise a new approach to computational inter-domain routing.
3. Devised a breakthrough timetable algorithm that enabled large-scale solutions to the classic school timetabling problem in polynomial time.
4. Crafted a new concept for approximate solutions to highly constrained problems, often referred to as Walsh functions.
5. Set a world record for solving the “String Matching Problem” in two weeks.
6. Pioneered the use of integer programming for airline scheduling.

Born about 1786, Shandrum, County Limerick, Ireland. Died 1847, Cork, Ireland.
