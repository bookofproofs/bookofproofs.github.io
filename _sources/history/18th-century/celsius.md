**Anders Celsius** was a Swedish astronomer, physicist and mathematician. He participated in Maupertuis' expedition to measure a degree of latitude in Lapland. He is best known for the temperature scale that he proposed and which is named after him.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Celsius temperature scale, which is used worldwide as a standard unit of temperature measurement.
2. Proposed a scale for defining the average winter temperature for each day of the year and studied the application of this scale in determining the length of a year.
3. Discovered the thermal inverse-square law, which states an object's temperature is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the heat source.
4. Proposed the law of Celsius, which states the temperature change of a mixture in the heat process is equal to the sum of its components.
5. Discovered a relationship between the melting points of various substances.
6. Conducted extensive research in trigonometry, which included both arc measurements and angular distances.

Born 11 November 1701, Uppsala, Sweden. Died 25 April 1744, Uppsala, Sweden.
