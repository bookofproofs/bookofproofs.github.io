**Lazare Carnot** is best known as a geometer. In 1803 he published _Géométrie de position _ in which sensed magnitudes were first systematically used in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of using mathematical equations to determine the energy requirements of a system, a concept that became known as Carnot's Law.
2. Pioneered the concept of heat engines, which laid the foundation for thermodynamics and later, much of modern engineering. 
3. Investigated the properties of gas and liquids and developed influential theories related to their behavior.
4. Wrote papers on the topics of applied mathematics, geometrical optics, and steam engine construction. 
5. Was among the first to propose a modern gas turbine and suggested possible improvements such as the use of multiple stages. 
6. Was a pioneer in the study of kinetic energy and was one of the first to recognize the transfer of energy between moving objects.
7. Proposed the law of transformation of kinetic energy in its modern form, a concept which later became known as the Second Law of Thermodynamics. 
8. Also proposed the law of isothermal expansion of gases. 
9. Was the first to introduce the concept of reversibility to physics.

Born 13 May 1753, Nolay, Burgundy, France. Died 2 August 1823, Magdeburg, Prussian Saxony (now Germany).
