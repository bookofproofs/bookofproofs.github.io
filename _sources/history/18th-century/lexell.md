**Anders Lexell** made major contributions to spherical geometry and trigonometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a formula for calculating planetary motions, based on the observations of astronomer Tobias Mayer.
2. Appointed professor of mathematics at Uppsala University in 1734.
3. Wrote the first complete work on celestial mechanics in 1749, Systema gravitationis superomnem planetam ultrasolis.
4. Established a body of laws governing the motion of comets, allowing them to be used to accurately predict their courses.
5. Proved that the distances of the planets from the sun followed a harmonic order.
6. Made fundamental contributions to the advancement of probabilities and mathematics in Finland.
7. Published two works on spherical trigonometry in 1756 and 1760.
8. Successfully calculated the distance to the Moon and the exact length of a second.
9. Carried out research into Earth’s shape and the Earth's gravitational field, resulting in a numerical estimate of the flattening of the Earth.
10. Developed a general empirical formulation for the resolution of differential equations, a tool now referred to as the Lexell equation.

Born 24 December 1740, Äbo, Sweden (now Turku, Finland). Died 11 December 1784, St Petersburg, Russia.
