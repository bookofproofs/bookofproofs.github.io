**Benjamin Robins** was an English engineer who wrote on Newton's mathematics and invented the ballistic pendulum.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new branch of mechanics known as 'Theory of Axes in Space' which was used to find the velocity of projectiles.
2. Described the shape of cannonballs in flight, allowing for a more accurate estimation of their paths.
3. Developed a mathematical analysis for the impact of projectiles which was based on Newton's Laws of Motion.
4. Explored the momentum of objects in motion and analyzed the deformation of structures under impact loads.
5. Proposed the principle of least action, which is an important foundation in calculus of variations.
6. Developed a formula for the centrifugal force that is associated with a curved path.
7. Created a hinge theorem which compares the motion of freely suspended bodies to motion along curved paths.
8. Published a paper on using mathematical principles to calculate the velocity of projectiles in three-dimensional motion (1746).

Born 16 April 1706, Bath, England. Died 20 July 1751, Madras, (now Chennai) India.
