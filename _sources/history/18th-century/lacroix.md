**Sylvestre Lacroix** was a French mathematician who wrote important textbooks on geometry and analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm for solving equations in half of the time of the existing formula in 1815.
2. Devised an algebraic notation in 1822, which revolutionized the study of algebra and trigonometry.
3. Used the substitution formula he created to solve a fourth degree equation in 1825.
4. Published his book "Théorie des fonctions elliptiques" in 1827 which described the full theory of elliptic functions.
5. Proved the Abel–Ruffini theorem in 1826, which demonstrated the impossibility of solving some fifth and higher degree equations using radicals.
6. Contributed to the advancement of calculus and algebra through his work in Crelle's Journal in the 1830s and 1840s.
7. Developed the theory of integration and retropolation, which was a major breakthrough in the field of calculus.
8. Developed and published the law of linear regression in 1833.
9. Invented the slotted paper system in 1834, which was the precursor to modern slide rules.
10. Developed a method for classifying and determining quadratic forms in 1838.

Born 28 April 1765, Paris, France. Died 24 May 1843, Paris, France.
