**James Glenie** was a Scottish mathematician who was involved in an early dispute in the Royal Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the 'Glenie Method' which is a form of numerical simulation used to solve problems in algebra.
2. Formulated the 'Glenie Product' which is used to decompose polynomials and analyze their structure.
3. Developed the Glenie-Bryant Identity which is used to solve multivariate equations with higher-degree polynomials.
4. Discovered a new class of polynomials now known as the 'Glenie Polynomials'.
5. Determined the most accurate type of interpolation for non-linear functions.
6. Constructed and studied polynomial equations that represent the dynamics of complex systems.
7. Created and studied a practical framework to identify the boundaries of dynamical systems.
8. Developed a simplified algorithm to measure complex mathematical approximations. 
9. Investigated the global behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. 
10. Developed new methods to decide the best prediction of numerical solutions to mathematical equations.

Born 18 October 1750, Leslie, Fife, Scotland. Died 23 November 1817, Chelsea, London, England.
