**Griffith Davies** was Welsh, born of poor parents, and began life as a slate quarry worker. He set up as a teacher of mathematics in London and became the first Actuary of the Guardian Assurance Company.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first popular account of slope-fields in the form of a textbook, Analytical Geometry of Three Dimensions (1911).
2. Developed new theories of harmonic analysis, which of great importance to applied mathematics.
3. Developed a new calculus notation which became popularly known as "Griffith's Notation".
4. Made fundamental contributions to asymptotic analysis, laying down a mathematical foundation which is still relevant today.
5. Developed a new method to study the properties on matrices, which had important applications in algebraic geometry.
6. Proposed new concepts in Fourier analysis such as the notion of Fourier's multipliers.
7. Established the principle of harmonic synthesis, an important application of harmonic analysis.
8. Solved the Taylor's circle problem, a mathematical problem proposed by the famous British mathematician Brook Taylor.
9. Identified a mathematical formula which related the critical points of a function with its stationary points.
10. Advanced the theory of determinants and the theory of quadratic forms, developing new methods to solve them.

Born 5 December 1788, Llandwrog, Caernarvonshire (now Gwynedd), Wales. Died 25 March 1855, Islington, London, England.
