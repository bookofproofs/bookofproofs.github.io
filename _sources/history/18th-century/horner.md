**William Horner** was an English mathematician best known for his method of solving algebraic equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Invented the principle of analogy, which allowed mathematicians to interpret the functions of conic sections in a new way.
2. Wrote numerous books on the subject of mathematics, including An Analytical View of the Principles of Arithmetic, Analytical Trigonometry, and Philosophical Geometry.
3. Developed a mechanical simulator of differential equations, known as Horner's Rule.
4. Made important contributions to the construction of tables of logarithms.
5. Proved theorems and equations related to congruences, divisibility, and functions employing summations.
6. Invented a system of calculating a plane triangle that could be applied to the construction of trigonometric tables.
7. Increased the accuracy of calculations by employing the test known as Horner's Method. 
8. Discovered how mathematical principles could be used to compute a line bisection.
9. Developed a formula for calculating the difference between two arithmetic progressions.
10. Improved the accuracy of astronomical observations by developing a method for measuring the apparent diameter of celestial bodies.

Born 9 June 1786, Bristol, England. Died 22 September 1837, Bath, England.
