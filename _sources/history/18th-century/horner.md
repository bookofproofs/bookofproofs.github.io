**William Horner** was an English mathematician best known for his method of solving algebraic equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* John Wesley, a founder of Methodism, encouraged William Horner senior to come to England and join the Methodist Society as a minister.
* Horner is largely remembered only for the method, Horner's method, of solving algebraic equations ascribed to him by Augustus De Morgan and others.
* In the 19th  and early 20th  centuries, Horner's method had a prominent place in English and American textbooks on algebra.
* The answer lies simply with De Morgan who gave Horner's name and method wide coverage in many articles which he wrote.
* Horner made other mathematical contributions, however, publishing a series of papers on transforming and solving algebraic equations, and he also applied similar techniques to functional equations.
* We mention that Horner published Natural magic, a familiar exposition of a forgotten fact in optics (1832) and the modern invention of the zoetrope, under the name Daedaleum in 1834, has been attributed to him.
* After Horner died in his home in Grosvenor Place, Bath, of a stroke in 1837, one of his sons, also called William, carried on running the school The Seminary in Bath.

Born 9 June 1786, Bristol, England. Died 22 September 1837, Bath, England.
