**Leonhard Euler** was a Swiss mathematician who made enormous contibutions to a wide range of mathematics and physics including analytic geometry, trigonometry, geometry, calculus and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of calculus, which revolutionized the study of mathematics and was used to describe exponential growth and forces of nature.
2. Developed basic principles of calculus of variations, leading to modern optimization theory.
3. Established the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, which is used to evaluate integrals.
4. Demonstrated the power of analytic geometry and revitalized this field.
5. Developed the theory of analytic number theory, which helps to understand prime numbers, divisibility and prime factorization.
6. Established the Euler identity where e to the power of i theta equals one.
7. Proved the Euler-Fermat theorem, which states that 2^n + 1 is prime for only numbers n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
8. Developed mathematical notation and concepts leading to partial differential equations which are widely used today in basic science and engineering.
9. Unveiled relationships between Kepler's law of planetary motion and Newton's law of gravitation, paving way for modern physics. 
10. Discovered the Euler-Lagrange equations which are still applied today to physics, engineering and more.

Born 15 April 1707, Basel, Switzerland. Died 18 September 1783, St Petersburg, Russia.
