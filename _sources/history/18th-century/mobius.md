**August Möbius** is best known for his work in topology, especially for his conception of the Möbius strip, a two dimensional surface with only one side.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of the Möbius strip in 1858, the first example of a non-orientable surface in mathematics.
2. Proved the theorem of Gauss-Bonnet in 1867, which relates the intrinsic geometry of surfaces to their topology.
3. Established a “tabular arrangement” of two-dimensional crystals in 1877, a pioneering step in the development of topology and geometry.
4. Explored the concept of homotopy theory in his “Survey of Geometry” in 1887, which connected topological algebra with geometry.
5. Published his magnum opus “Introduction to Natural Philosophy” in 1895, which generalized theories of differential equations and mechanics.

Born 17 November 1790, Schulpforta, Saxony (now Germany). Died 26 September 1868, Leipzig, Germany.
