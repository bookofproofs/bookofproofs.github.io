**Louis Lefébure de Fourcy** was a French mathematician who taught at the École Polytechnique. He is best known for having refused Galois entry to the school.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed important advances in the study of the calculus of finite differences.
2. Published a proof of the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem in a paper entitled “Sur les fonctions qui se déterminent par deux équations différentielles du premier ordre.” 
3. Proposed the use of integration of discrete simplices in the calculus of laminar areas and solved the double integral of certain elliptic integrals using integration of simplices.
4. Founded the field of graph theory by introducing the concept of the smallest circle that could enclose two lines.
5. Contributed to the study of the numerical solution of linear partial differential equations and the Appell-Laguerre equation.
6. Helped in developing Lagrangian mechanics by demonstrating the possibility of isolating the motion of multiple-body systems.
7. Produced an early description of algorithms that used variable precision expansions of different ordinates to calculate the integrals of differential equations.

Born 25 August 1787, Port-au-Prince, Saint-Domingue, now Haiti. Died 12 March 1869, Paris, France.
