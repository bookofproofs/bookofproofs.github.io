The **Marquis de Condorcet**'s most important work was on probability and the philosophy of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Condorcet's theorem is a major result in probability theory which extends Bayes' theorem to unequal measures between events. 
2. He described the probability calculus in his Theory of Chances and its Application to Natural Philosophy. 
3. Condorcet wrote the first detailed analysis of operations on probability distributions for Bernoulli variables. 
4. He also wrote a paper introducing the method of least squares which provided a way of fitting curves to measured data. 
5. Condorcet was among the first mathematicians to realize the importance of integrals in calculus. 
6. He used his knowledge of calculus to solve the classical isoperimetric problem. 
7. He proposed a formulation of the tautochrone problem, now known as the brachistochrone. 
8. Condorcet developed a new version of the law of large numbers.

Born 17 September 1743, Ribemont, France. Died 29 March 1794, Bourg-la-Reine (near Paris), France.
