**Bartholomew Lloyd** was an Irish mathematician who became a bishop and provost of Trinity College Dublin.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new method for solving Diophantine equations.
2. Constructed a mechanical calculating machine capable of performing basic algebraic operations.
3. Proposed the first solution to the Kepler Conjecture, proposing an upper bound on the density of sphere packings.
4. Developed the Lloyd algorithm, a popular sorting algorithm used in computer science.
5. Used algebraic methods to resolve a long-standing debate on the exact value of Ï€.
6. Proposed a set of cardinality axioms which helped establish set theory and transfinite numbers. 
7. Established the notion of non-Euclidean geometry, thereby laying the foundations for modern-day differential geometry.

Born 5 February 1772, New Ross, County Wexford, Ireland. Died 24 November 1837, Dublin, Ireland.
