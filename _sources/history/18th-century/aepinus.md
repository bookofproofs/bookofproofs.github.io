**Franz Aepinus** was a German scientist who did important work on electricity and magnetism.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism, known as electrostatics and magnetostatics, respectively
2. Wrote major work on electricity and magnetism, including his two-volume Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism
3. Replaced the traditional linear field equations with an equation of divergence, the first of its kind
4. Developed a method to simplify the calculation of electrical currents
5. Made advancements in the theory of the electric and magnetic fields
6. Established experiments to study static electrostatic fields
7. Developed a method to calculate the electric forces of action between two bodies using the principle of superposition
8. Gave the first description of a mechanical analogy between electric forces and various mechanical forces
9. Introduced the idea of using electricity to measure and calculate forces

Born 13 December 1724, Rostock, Mecklenberg-Schwerin (now Germany). Died 10 August 1802, Dorpat, Russia.
