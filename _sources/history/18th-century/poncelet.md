**Jean-Victor Poncelet** was one of the founders of modern projective geometry. His development of the pole and polar lines associated with conics led to the principle of duality.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Poncelet's work contributed to the beginning of group theory, allowing for the systematic study of symmetry, which is fundamental in mathematics;
2. Developed a theory of projective geometry, allowing mathematics to study less familiar properties of forms and figures that remain invariant under a variety of transformations such as stretching and shearing;
3. Formulated the principle of continuity, connecting geometry and analysis and leading to the development of integral calculus;
4. Established the principle of duality, one of the central ideas in projective geometry;
5. Introduced the polar coordinates system and wrote a treatise on its properties;
6. Pioneered the use of the concept of an invariant in mathematics;
7. Produced many important insights into loops and Theorem VII of higher plane curves;
8. Created the use of complex numbers in projective geometry and introducing a new way of geometric analysis;
9. Developed the modern classification and enumeration of geometric figures.

Born 1 July 1788, Metz, Lorraine, France. Died 22 December 1867, Paris, France.
