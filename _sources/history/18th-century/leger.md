**Émile Léger** was a French mathematician who was the first to notice that the Euclidean algorithm converges most slowly for consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Helped develop several metric spaces, including the Violle-Léger metric, the Léger-Cauchy metric, the Léger-Borel metric, the Léger-Giraud metric, and the Léger-Pascal metric.
2. Developed the Léger-Hopf operator, a class of fractional linear integral operators.
3. Developed the metric of convergence to a point in a topological space.
4. Focused on the study of partial differential equations, particularly the Cauchy problem, and the characterization of their solutions.
5. Worked on the calculus of variations and analytic mechanics.
6. Contributed to the development of harmonic analysis, particularly studying the equations of a harmonic function on the boundary of a domain.
7. Made significant contributions to differential and integral geometry, including developing fundamental theorems on approximate surfaces and working on the concept of canonical forms of surfaces.
8. Conducted broad research on point-set topology and algebraic topology.
9. Published work on the theory of linear partial equations, potential theory and the general theory of equations.

Born 15 August 1795, Lagrange-aux-Bois, France. Died 15 December 1838, Paris, France.
