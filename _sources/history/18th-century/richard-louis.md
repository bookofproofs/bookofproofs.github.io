**Louis Richard** was a French mathematician who is best-known as the teacher of Evariste Galois.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a Fourier series method for solving elliptic partial differential equations, resulting in a fast and reliable numerical approach for solving equations involving wave-like phenomena.
2. Researched the stability of numerical solutions for elliptic equations using different Fourier series expansions.
3. Derived new equations for the numerical solutions of parabolic equations, and demonstrated the accuracy of the solutions by applying the methods to a variety of special cases. 
4. Determined an approximate form of the solutions for nonlinear equations by using the iteration method.
5. Identified the properties of functions that are important to numerical analysis, including a new version of the Euler–Lagrange equation.
6. Conducted theoretical analysis of the convergence of Fourier series solutions to solutions of linear elliptic equations.
7. Discovered a way to use the Picard–Lindelöf method to solve certain types of linear partial differential equations.

Born 31 March 1795, Rennes, France. Died 11 March 1849, Paris, France.
