**Dominique Cassini** (Cassini IV) was a French mathematician and surveyor who worked on his father's map of France.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Researched and developed a new theory on the dynamics of the solar system
2. Discovered insights into the motion of the Moon and Saturn’s Rings
3. Found a relation between the chaotic behavior of some asteroids and Jupiter's orbit
4. Conducted groundbreaking studies in Celestial Mechanics and mathematical astronomy
5. Determined the size and shape of Earth and other planetary bodies using astrometry
6. Developed mathematical methods for measuring the universe's large-scale structure
7. Used statistical methods to analyze interplanetary distances and trajectories
8. Proved the existence of the Cassini–Gauss Theorem of planetary motion dynamics

Born 30 June 1748, Paris, France. Died 18 October 1845, Thury, France.
