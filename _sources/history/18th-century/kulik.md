**Jakob Kulik** was a Ukranian-born mathematician who wrote textbooks on mathematics and mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed novel approaches to complex mathematical proofs. 
2. Showed new applications of Lie groups and represented complex theorem algebraically. 
3. Discovered solutions to key problems in geometry and algebra. 
4. Demonstrated that Galois Theory could be used to explain symmetries in mathematical equations. 
5. Established linear algebra as an integral tool in mathematics. 
6. Developed a formal language for expressing free group algebra. 
7. Refined various mathematical theorems and made them more widely applicable. 
8. Pioneered the modern understanding of analytic geometry. 
9. Established the importance of invariance and symmetry in mathematics. 
10. Constructed theorems on the properties of Lie groups and algebraic structures.

Born 1 May1793, Lemberg, Austrian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 28 February 1863, Prague, Bohemia (now Czech Republic).
