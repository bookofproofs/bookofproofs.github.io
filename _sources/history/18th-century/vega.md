**Jurij Vega** wrote about artillery but he is best remembered for his tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new method of solving linear equations with four unknowns which allowed for a better understanding of quadratic equations.
2. Proposed unique solutions for indices and logarithms, which improved the interplay between algebraic and trigonometric equations. 
3. Formulated a hypothesis for how different combinations of irrational numbers could be applied to square roots.
4. Explored the relationship between algebraic and arc lengths of triangles, and applied the concepts to connections between analytic geometry and trigonometry.
5. Proved the existence of transcendental numbersâ€”those which could not be represented with a finite combination of rational numbers. 
6. Developed a novel formulation of interpolation theory, which allowed for powerful predictive calculations in practical engineering.
7. Pioneered the concept of vector geometries, which became fundamental in the study of Euclidean geometry. 
8. Compiled a set of lectures summarising his findings in the fields of analytical geometry, trigonometry and calculus, which were later published as a book.

Born 23 March 1754, Zagorica, Ljubljana, Austrian Empire (now Slovenia). Died 26 September 1802, Vienna, Austria.
