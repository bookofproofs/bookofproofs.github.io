**Giovanni Fagnano** was an Italian priest who worked on geometry and calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He proved that angles that sum up to 180Â° are either right angles or angles containing a right angle.
2. He published a book on the theory of curves in 1697, asserting that algebra could be used to characterize curves by means of equations.
3. He determined the asymptote of the hyperbola and parabola and also determined their tangents and normals.
4. He worked on the theory of integration and developed the method of Solomon of Saragossa for determining areas of curved figures such as quadrilaterals.
5. He established the idea of the cycloid of a point, the mean proportional of the sum of two lines and the sum of three squares.
6. He indicated how the multiplication of one moment by another moment could be used to solve quadratic equations.
7. He published a book on mechanics in 1709 which was one of the earliest rigorously axiomatic treatments of the subject.
8. He worked on finding solutions to cubic equations and giving expressions for them in terms of elliptic functions.
9. He developed a transformation formula for integrating a trigonometric function twice without knowing the value of the integrals.
10. He demonstrated a theorem which expressed the arc of a hyperbola in terms of the sum of the distances between its vertices and any external point.

Born 31 January 1715, Sinigaglia (now Senigallia, Italy). Died 14 May1797, Sinigaglia (now Senigallia, Italy).
