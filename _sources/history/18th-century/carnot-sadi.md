**Sadi Carnot** is best known for his theory of thermodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Carnot Cycle, a thermodynamic model which demonstrates the relationship between the efficiency of heat engines and temperatures. 
2. Formulated the second law of thermodynamics, stating that heat can never pass spontaneously from a colder to a hotter body.
3. Established the principle of theoretical attraction and repulsion of heat, which examined the mechanics of heat exchange between two bodies. 
4. Proposed the caloric theory of heat and the conservation of heat, which states that heat is a form of matter and can never be completely lost. 
5. Investigated the properties of gases to distinguish between temperature, pressure, and volume. 
6. Proposed the fundamental principle of maximum work, which states that the maximum useful work can be achieved by a heat engine if its input and output temperatures differ as much as possible.

Born 1 June 1796, Paris, France. Died 24 August 1832, Paris, France.
