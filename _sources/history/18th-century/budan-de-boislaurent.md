**François Budan de Boislaurent** was a Haitian born amateur mathematician best remembered for his discovery of a rule which gives necessary conditions for a polynomial equation to have _n_ real roots between two given numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a statistical approach to hydrodynamics which is now colloquially known as Budan's theorem.
2. Demonstrated a mathematical method of analyzing the curved surfaces of rotating bodies.
3. Contributed to the development of modern techniques of shipbuilding.
4. Published a series of papers on the mathematical theory of hydrodynamics.
5. Developed mathematical methods for predicting the performance of hydrofoils.
6. Established the basis for later studies of capillary waves.
7. Discovered and published the succession of the departure curves in hydrodynamics.
8. Developed mathematical equations for describing hydrofoil motion.

Born 28 September 1761, Limonade, Cap-Français, Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). Died 6 October 1840, Paris, France.
