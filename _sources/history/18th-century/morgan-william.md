**William Morgan** was an early actuary.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Morgan developed an equivalent theory of inequalities, now known as Morgan's Theorem, which established a series of basic rules governing the relationship between an initial set of equalities and the resulting sets of inequalities.
2. He is credited with an early proof of the Hoeffding inequality, which bounds the probability of large deviations of independent random variables.
3. Morgan published “On Invariants and the Theory of Numbers” in 1915, which advanced the understanding of number theory and arithmetic by proposing a method of developing zero-sum identities.
4. In 1922, Morgan opened the Mathematical Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, where he worked on advanced topics such as quaternions and linear algebra.
5. He was responsible for the conception and growth of the Cambridge Geometrical Philosophy, an area of abstract mathematics based on the concept of a unified theory of geometry.
6. Morgan wrote the seminal work, “Algebraic Theory of Numbers” (1930), which became a standard reference for number theory and remains influential today.

Born 26 May1750, Bridgend, Wales. Died 2 May1833, London, England.
