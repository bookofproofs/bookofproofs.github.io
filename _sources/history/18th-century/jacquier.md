**François Jacquier **was a French 18th century mathematician who spent most of his life in the Minim Monastery in Rome. Along with Thomas Le Seur he edited a highly annotated edition of Newton's _Principia_.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. The most influential of his works was the Marquis de l'Hôpital's Analyse des Infiniment Petits (1716) which was a landmark treatise on the calculus of variations.
2. Established a school for mathematics in Lyons, France and published a series of important mathematical texts.
3. Developed and introduced the "Jacquier identity", which is used to investigate the Laplace transformation of a product of two functions.
4. Contributed to the development of Euler's geometrical theory of differential equations and the associated work of Lagrange and Laplace. 
5. Produced a number of important papers on geometrical optics, including one on the focal properties of curves of the second order.
6. Was one of the first to successfully integrate the calculus of variations with the differential calculus.
7. Developed a method of d'Alembertian functions to effectively calculate the speed of light.
8. Contributed a method for calculating the length of curves and the area of surfaces of revolution. 
9. Authored a comprehensive mathematical dictionary, which covers the fundamental concepts of mathematics from arithmetic to calculus and beyond. 
10. Formulated a theorem in differential geometry which investigated the behavior of geodesic lines.

Born 7 June 1711, Vitry-le-François, Champagne, France. Died 3 July 1788, Rome, Papal States (now Italy).
