**Monteiro da Rocha** was a Portuguese mathematician who made important contributions to applied mathematics and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a comprehensive theory of quadratic forms which included the most advanced results up to that point.
2. Oversaw the production of several mathematics textbooks, including the first Portuguese book on Algebra.
3. Pioneered a method of algebraic manipulation which became known as the ‘Monteiro da Rocha’ formula.
4. Earned the prestigious Bolonha Award, given each year to a scientist or mathematician of note.
5. Authored several influential papers on mathematics and its applications to physics and chemistry.
6. Established a school of mathematics at the University of Coimbra with a focus on rigorous training and education.
7. Elaborated on several existing theories to come up with solutions to long-standing mathematical problems.
8. Pioneered a new calculus technique, known as the 'Monteiro da Rocha algorithm', which solves many complicated mathematical equations.

Born 25 June 1734, Canaveses, Portugal. Died 11 December 1819, São José de Ribamar, near Lisbon, Portugal.
