**Thomas Young** was an English mathematician and physicist best known for _Young's modulus_ and his work on interference.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the wave theory of light, proposing that light consists of transverse undulations in an ether medium.
2. Unified Newton's corpuscular and Huygens' wave theories of light, advancing the principle of superposition.
3. Formulated Young's modulus, a mathematical expression of the relationship between stress and strain in elastic solids.
4. Accurately calculated the intensity of light from two slits, predicting what is now known as the interference of light.
5. Devised a mathematical method to accurately measure the size of the Earth near the equator.
6. Established the principle of the reversibility of light, which formed the basis for optical imaging.

Born 13 June 1773, Milverton, Somerset, England. Died 10 May 1829, London, England.
