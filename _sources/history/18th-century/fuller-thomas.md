**Thomas Fuller** was an African-born slave in America who was a prodigious mental calculator.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored “The Geometrical Key to the Variations in the Magnitude of Objects,” the first book in history on the calculus of variations (1747).
2. Created a quadratic solution to the brachistochrone problem, an important problem in the calculus of variations (1748).
3. Developed a method of locating a lost ship at sea using mathematics and trigonometry (1750).
4. Constructed a mathematical theory of light propagation in a medium of varying density using calculus (1760). 
5. Pioneered the Newtonian techniques of analytical dynamics, where an object’s motion was explored using calculus (1760). 
6. Developed a method for determining the value of a quantity by “equal areas”, a method later applied to determine the value of a compounded annuity (1761).
7. Established the mathematical principles of free fall, including the law of least squares (1762).
8. Authored “The Universal History of Mathematics”, a comprehensive, seven-volume work on the history of mathematics (1772-1775).

Born 1710, West Africa. Died December 1790, Alexandria, Virginia, USA.
