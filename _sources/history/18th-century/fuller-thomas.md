**Thomas Fuller** was an African-born slave in America who was a prodigious mental calculator.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Present day thinking is that Fuller learnt to calculate in Africa before he was brought to the United States as a slave.
* Despite Fuller's calculating abilities he was never taught to read or write and again this is evidence that he did not learn to calculate while in the United States.

Born 1710, West Africa. Died December 1790, Alexandria, Virginia, USA.
