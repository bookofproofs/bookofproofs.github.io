**John Playfair** worked on geology, physics and geometry and studied at the University of St Andrews. His best-known contribution to mathematics is his form of Euclid's parallelism axiom.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of the mathematical proof.
2. Formulated the five postulates of Euclidean geometry.
3. Published a book called “Elements of Geometry” in 1795, which became an important source of information for scholars.
4. Wrote a book called “A Treatise on Mathematical Instruments” in 1802, which became an important reference for surveyors and architects.
5. Collaborated on the first publication of the logarithmic tables of sines and tangents in 1814.
6. Contributed to the development of trigonometry, developing the concept of smallest circle enclosing three non-collinear points.
7. Encouraged the further development and advance of mathematics in the UK through his works and lectures.

Born 10 March 1748, Benvie (near Dundee), Scotland. Died 20 July 1819, Burntisland, Fife, Scotland.
