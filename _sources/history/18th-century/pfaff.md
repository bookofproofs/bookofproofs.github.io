**Johann Friedrich Pfaff** was an influential German mathematician who worked on systems of partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established an efficient method for algebraic integration, the pfaffian method, which laid the foundations for integration theory.
2. Developed a method for finding particular integrals for certain classes of equations, simplifying integration of differential equations.
3. Published various works on the theories of differential, integral and vector calculus.
4. Established the Pfaff-Kummer theorem, which related series and hypergeometric functions.
5. Coined the term "elliptic integrals" and laid the groundwork for the modern theory of elliptic functions.
6. Contributed to the theory of linear equations, algebraic curves and partial differential equations.
7. Published influential books such as "Anleitung zur Analyse" and "Theorie der Differentialgleichungen".

Born 22 December 1765, Stuttgart, WÃ¼rttemberg (now Germany). Died 21 April 1825, Halle, Saxony (now Germany).
