**Georg Klügel** was a German mathematician who wrote a Dictionary of Mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first geometric proof for a specific triangle inequality in 1819.
2. Established several principles of higher algebra in his dissertation De algebra superior of 1817.
3. Discovered the ‘p’ notation for a complex number’s principal part in 1821.
4. Wrote a calculus textbook in 1820 that introduced the ‘p:q’ notation for fractions. 
5. Explored integral calculus and series expansion in his research on Gauss's hypergeometric function in 1820.
6. Proved the impossibility of local transformation of a cubical surface into a sphere in 1822.
7. Developed methods to determine the limits of integration in the calculus of variations in 1823.
8. Introduced a method to combine complex algebraic roots with their higher powers in 1824.
9. Published a treatise on the application of calculus to describe optical phenomena in 1825.

Born 19 August 1739, Hamburg, Germany. Died 4 August 1812, Halle, Germany.
