3. Developed a new method for calculating the area of Polygons
4. Published the first major work on the geometric properties of Plane Curves.
5. Founded the Mutis Academy of Mathematical Sciences in 1789.
6. Established a rigorous vocabulary for the basic terms of algebra.
7. Pioneered developments in analytic geometry, a collaboration between Descartes’ analytic geometry and Newton’s calculus.
8. Established the use of barometric measurements for surveying.
9. Developed a method for measuring the circumference of the Earth.
