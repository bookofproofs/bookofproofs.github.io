1. He wrote a book in 1832 titled “The Geography of Minnesota and the Upper Mississippi Region” which contained geographical observations including the longest and most accurate survey of the Upper Mississippi River conducted to date.
2. He is credited with producing the most detailed and accurate map of the United States created up to that time and for introducing the system of public land surveys still in use in the United States.
3. He was the first to use the meridian and parallel of latitude in surveys.
4. He was instrumental in developing the use of spatial geometry, trigonometry and surveying methods in U.S. cartography and mapping.
5. He developed a topographical method of surveying which enabled early settlement and use of the land.
6. He also developed a system of trigonometry that was used by surveyors in the United States and Europe.
