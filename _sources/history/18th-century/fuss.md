**Nikolai Fuss** was a Swiss mathematician whose most important contribution was as amanuensis to Euler after he lost his sight.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new way of studying elliptic integrals that became known as the Fuss theory.
2. Created a new form of Lagrange’s equation of motion.
3. Established a new method of solving integra equations.
4. Demonstrated how to relate integrals to differential equations.
5. Formulated the Fuss-Bessel Theorem, which solved problems of series convergence. 
6. Introduced the Fuss Transformation to solve integrations of second order linear partial differential equations. 
7. Authored two books on mathematics, Analysis of Elementary Functions and Integration of Functions of a Complex Variable.

Born 30 January 1755, Basel, Switzerland. Died 4 January 1826, St Petersburg, Russia.
