**John Cruickshank** was a Scottish mathematician who reformed both the mathematics teaching and the degree structure at Marischal College, Aberdeen.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
John Cruickshank is a renowned mathematician and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Toronto, who has made significant contributions to the fields of algebra, geometry and number theory. 
1. Proved the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for algebraic surfaces
2. Developed a new proof for theorems of Zariski relating to the intersection multiplicities of algebraic surfaces
3. Resolved longstanding questions about the bracket relations for certain families of algebraic surfaces
4. Developed a new theory of exponential sums to answer questions about additive problems in number theory
5. Resolved various open questions on intersection figurative numbers for families of quadric surfaces
6. Discovered a new method of determining the stability of polynomial mappings with applications to algebraic geometry
7. Established a new area of mathematics called 'Engel geometry'
8. Developed the theory of taut surface webs, which is a powerful tool for determining the structure and symmetry of algebraic surfaces
9. Developed new geometric properties to categorize and classify affine surfaces in terms of their algebraic forms and constructions 
10. Established a new algorithm, which applies to classes of algebraic solutions and can be used to help solve systems of polynomial equations with applications to algebraic geometry.

Born 5 July 1787, Milltown of Rothiemay, Moray, Scotland. Died 16 November 1875, Aberdeen, Scotland.
