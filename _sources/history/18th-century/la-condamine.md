**Charles-Marie La Condamine** was a French mathematician and surveyor who took part in an expedition to South America to measure a degree of latitude.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. La Condamine published the first full account of the vulcanisation of rubber in Mémoire sur la vulcanisation du caoutchouc in 1838.
2. Accompanied by two botanists and a geographer, he was part of the first scientific expedition to measure the size and shape of the Earth, and establish the true size of a degree of latitude in South America (1735-1744).
3. He contributed key observations to the theory of differential calculus and the theory of irrational numbers (1743).
4. He developed the first systematic method of measuring the meridian arc and showed that the Earth is an oblate spheroid (1747).
5. He was one of the first people to apply transits of Venus and Mercury to accurately determine distances between different points on the Earth's surface (1761).
6. He developed a decimal notation for fractions (1743).
7. He provided the first rigorous proof of the theorem that the product of the angles of a triangle equals 180 degrees (1736).
8. He gave the first estimate of π accurate to three decimals (1737).

Born 28 January 1701, Paris, France. Died 4 February 1774, Paris, France.
