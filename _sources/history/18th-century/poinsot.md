**Louis Poinsot** was the inventor of geometrical mechanics, investigating how a system of forces acting on a rigid body could be resolved into a single force and a couple.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of conic sections, which includes circles, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas.
2. Introduced mathematical constructions for the representation of curves, known as the Poinsot construction.
3. Put forward a geometric proof of a theorem of Euler regarding the properties of certain dihedrals and polyhedrons.
4. Derived the law of equilibrium of a flexible chain, which describes the constraints of applied forces and torques in the form of algebraic equations.
5. Constructed a windmill of blades or sails based on geometric principles, designed to generate power without gears or other moving parts.
6. Discovered a type of gearing called the involute and developed a formulation for the geometry of toothed wheels.
7. Put forward the first exact construction of a harmonic curve and the first account of harmonic analysis of the planetary motion.
8. Showcased pioneering applications of differential equations to problems in physics.

Born 3 January 1777, Paris, France. Died 5 December 1859, Paris, France.
