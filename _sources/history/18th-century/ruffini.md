**Paolo Ruffini** was an Italian mathematician who gave a proof that the quintic equation could not be solved earlier than Abel.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Named Fellow of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei for his achievements in mathematics (1810).
2. Successfully demonstrated the impossibility of solving a cubic equation using the methods of Euclidean geometry  (1813).
3. Established criteria for the solvability of some algebraic equations (now known as Ruffini-Horner method) (1805).
4. Authored numerous treatises emphasizing significant findings regarding algebraic equations, calculus and equations of more than three variables (1800-1813).
5. Co-founded a mathematical journal called Giornale di Matematiche (1809).
6. Provided clear and appropriate determinations of the sum and products of polynomials, achieving a solution that was simpler and more convenient to the sum and product operations with polynomials (1814).
7. Published important discoveries in number theory and philosophy of mathematics and presented a type of integral calculus (1817).
8. Published a definitive paper on the theory of equations, discussing the results of fellow mathematicians (1822).

Born 22 September 1765, Valentano, Papal States (now Italy). Died 10 May1822, Modena, Duchy of Modena (now Italy).
