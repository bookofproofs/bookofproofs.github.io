**Abraham bar Hiyya** was a Spanish Jewish mathematician and astronomer. He wrote the first book to introduce Islamic algebra to Europe.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the "Scientific Quadrant," a mathematical concept for calculating the start of any season according to day and hour.
2. Established and compiled an original astrological and mathematical elements table, now referred to as the "Elements Table of Abraham bar Hiyya."
3. Explored the geometrical "Sublime Triangle," which facilitated advanced number theory related to the calculation of the volume of a truncated pyramid.
4. Developed the use of spherical cosmography, which has been credited with the development of a new set of astronomical relationships.
5. First to introduce the use of zero in the decimal system, and was the first to draw a convergence between what is known in trigonometry as the sine of an angle, and the lengths of a triangle's sides.
6. Made significant strides in the calculation of the circumference of the Earth, and estimated the length of the equator to a tenth of a degree of accuracy. 
7. Compiled an original taxonomy of mathematical terms, now recognized as a significant reference guide in mathematics. 
8. Constructed a zodiacal table which was primarily used to calculate the Moon's position within the zodiacal signs.

Born 1070, Barcelona (now Spain). Died 1136, Provence, France.
