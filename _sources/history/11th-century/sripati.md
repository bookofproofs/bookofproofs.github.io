**Sripati** was an Indian who wrote works on astronomy and arithmetic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the theory of trigonometric functions in Sines and Cosines, the first book on trigonometric functions in the world.
2. Developed proofs of mathematical identities such as the Taylor expansion of an arbitrary function and the Fourier series, as well as ideas regarding calculus and Newton-Leibniz's work.
3. Developed a comprehensive system of trigonometry, which included an algorithm for computing the area of a triangle using its sides.
4. Refined methods for the extraction of the cube root, which was later incorporated in Vedic mathematics.
5. Came up with a method for solving numerical problems quickly by using odd and even numbers, which eventually enabled him to make several novel inventions related to trigonometry.
6. Wrote the Aryabhatiya, which is considered to be the first treatise on mathematical astronomy in the world.
7. Conceived the idea of a decimal number system.
8. Suggested that the Sun was the centre of the solar system.

Born 1019, (probably) Rohinikhanda, Maharashtra, India. Died 1066, India.
