**Al-Zarkali** was a Spanish  Muslim instrument maker, astrologer and important astronomer. He invented a form of the astrolabe.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The family had a reputation as skilled makers of instruments, in fact al-Zarqali was also given the name 'al-Nekkach' which means 'the engraver', and al-Zarqali learnt these family skills as he grew up in Córdoba.
* Before we give some details of al-Zarqali's life, we need to give some background to al-Andalus, Muslim Spain, in which he grew up.
* It was in Córdoba that al-Zarqali grew up.
* It was realised that al-Zarqali was not only expert as an instrument maker, but he was also highly intelligent.
* We should now look at some of al-Zarqali's accomplishments.
* These tables contained much copied from earlier tables such as those by al-Khwarizmi, al-Battani and Ptolemy, but they also contained the observations of al-Zarqali and the other members of Qadi ibn Said's large astronomy group which consisted of both Muslim and Jewish scholars.
* In fact it is claimed that al-Zarqali observed the sun for twenty-five years and the moon for thirty years.
* It is interesting to compare work being carried out in Toledo by al-Zarqali and his group with that being carried out in Esfahan by the group set up there by Omar Khayyam who was about twenty years younger than al-Zarqali.
* Let us look at some other of al-Zarqali's achievements.
* We know from references in other sources that in this book al-Zarqali details the motion of the solar apogee, giving it a motion of 1° in 279 years.
* This is based on an earlier work of the 3rd or 4th century, but has modified data from the observations of al-Zarqali and his colleagues in Toledo.
* Al-Zarqali wrote one work on astrology, the main interest in this work being the magic squares which he used to make talismans.
* It was here that al-Zarqali suggested that the centre of Mercury's epicycle followed an oval shaped path which he described as 'like a pine nut' in his book on the motion of the seven planets written about 1081.
* Barbastro, not far south of the Pyrenees, fell to the Christians in 1063 so the process was going on throughout the time that al-Zarqali led the astronomers of Toledo.
* At this time al-Zarqali fled from Toledo and returned to his home town of Córdoba which was further south and still under Muslim control.
* Córdoba was controlled by al-Mutamid of Seville who supported al-Zarqali for a few years and he was able to continue his observations with the help of one of his students.
* By that time al-Zarqali was no longer supported and it is unlikely that he did any scholarly work during the final ten years of his life.
* A look at the references to this article shows at once that al-Zarqali's name and achievements have continued to be kept alive.

Born 1029, Córdoba, Spain. Died 15 October 1100, Córdoba, Spain.
