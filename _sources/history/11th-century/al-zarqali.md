**Al-Zarkali** was a Spanish  Muslim instrument maker, astrologer and important astronomer. He invented a form of the astrolabe.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the astrolabe, the first instrument more precise than the naked eye for casting horoscopes and for measurements of the stars and planets.
2. Developed a precision table of sines for two hundred and fifty-seven degrees, which is more accurate than any existing sine table at that time.
3. Revolutionized mathematical astronomy by introducing the use of the lever to measure the positions of planetary bodies.
4. Produced an important new star catalogue, containing more than a thousand stars.
5. Discovered the precession of the equinoxes, a small movement of the sun in relation to the stars relative to one sidereal year.
6. Developed mathematical methods that could predict solar and lunar eclipses.
7. Wrote several important works, including the famous Kitab ar-Riyadatain ("Book of Two Havens of Refuge") and the Almagestum novum, a commentary on the Almagest.
8. Developed a mechanical model that could predict planetary motions.

Born 1029, Córdoba, Spain. Died 15 October 1100, Córdoba, Spain.
