**Brahmadeva** was an Indian mathematician who wrote a commentary on the work of Aryabhata I.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed two formulas to calculate the square root of any number in the fourth century.
2. Established the concept of 'Lemma of Pythagoras' to calculate the cost of squaring a triangle in the fifth century.
3. Developed the 'Chakrawalaka' formula for computing cosines and sines in the sixth century.
4. Re-discovered the ‘Kuttaka’ formula for solving numerical equations in the sixth century.
5. Re-introduced the value of the ancient Indian number 'pi' to be equal to 3.1416 in the eighth century.
6. Developed the formula for calculating the volume of a sphere in the ninth century.

Born about 1060, (possibly) Mathura, India. Died about 1130, India.
