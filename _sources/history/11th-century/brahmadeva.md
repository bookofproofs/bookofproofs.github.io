**Brahmadeva** was an Indian mathematician who wrote a commentary on the work of Aryabhata I.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The Brahman caste had a strong tradition of education so Brahmadeva would have received one of the best educations of men of his time.
* We have only one work by Brahmadeva and this is Karanaprakasa which is a commentary on the Aryabhatiya by Aryabhata I.
* Brahmadeva's work is in nine chapters and it follows the contents of the original Aryabhatiya.
* Brahmadeva's commentary seems to have been particularly popular in Madras, Mysore and Maharastra.
* Commentaries on Brahmadeva's work continued to appear up to the seventeenth century.

Born about 1060, (possibly) Mathura, India. Died about 1130, India.
