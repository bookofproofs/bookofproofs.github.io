**Hemchandra** was a Sanskrit scholar who published works on science, languages and philosophy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Hemchandra composed the first Indian algebraic treatise, titled Bh훮skar카 ("Illuminator"), in 12th-century India.
2. He developed complex methods for the calculation of sine and cosine, some comparable in complexity and precision to modern systems.
3. He also discovered the principles of what is now known as the Pascal Triangle.
4. He also worked on Binary Numbers, which are the foundation of computer engineering.
5. He also made substantial advances in solving quadratic equations, particularly in the cases of zero and negative roots.
6. He also applied the rule of three to solve a variety of equations and problems.
7. He developed a significant mathematical notation system and was the first to use epithets for the nine digits.

Born 1089, Dhandhuka, Gujarat, India. Died 1173, Gujarat, India.
