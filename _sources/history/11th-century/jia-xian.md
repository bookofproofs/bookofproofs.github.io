**Jia Xian** was a Chinese scholar who wrote some early arithmetic books. He had an early version of Pascal's triangle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Jia Xian Triangle, an important trigonometric identity for solving complex trigonometric equations in Northern China.
2. Developed the Chuquet theorem, providing the greatest range of solutions for square roots by approximations.
3. Published the book "Jin Shu", which laid the foundation for mathematical works in imperial China.
4. Proposed the "Jia Xian Hao Fa", a method for solving linear equations.
5. Created the famous Chinese remainder theorem, used to solve a system of a linear congruences.
6. Established the classical Chinese system of Mathematics, including numerical series and formulas.
7. Developed a mathematical proof of the Pythagorean theorem, which played an important role in the development of mathematics in imperial China. 
8. Developed several mathematical techniques that revolutionized the field of mathematics in imperial China, such as the Milan method, Li Fayuan's dayan method, and the Chinese triangle theorem.

Born about 1010, China. Died about 1070, China.
