**Al-Nasawi** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote summaries of some of [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Al-Nasawi had prepared an original version of it in Persian for the library of the Iranian prince Majd al-Dawlah, of the Buyid dynasty.
* Before the work was completed, however, Majd al-Dawlah was deposed as ruler so, on completion of the work, al-Nasawi presented it to Sharaf al-Muluk who was the vizier of Jalal ad-Dawlah (Jalal ad-Dawlah was the ruler of Baghdad from 1025 to 1044).
* Sharaf al-Muluk ordered al-Nasawi to rewrite the work in Arabic, and this he did.
* From this description, and from the fact that al-Nasawi dedicated another work to a Shi'ite leader in Baghdad, we at least can deduce that al-Nasawi worked for part of his life in Baghdad.
* A paragraph about al-Nasawi's life has been found in a manuscript and it tells us that he spent time in Rayy, and was visited by ibn Sina.
* Tract 26 is a summary of Euclid's Elements by al-Nasawi.
* The reasons which al-Nasawi gives for writing this summary are two-fold.
* All al-Nasawi appears to have done is to omit some constructions and change a few of the proofs.
* The arithmetic book by al-Nasawi is of this third "Indian numeral" type.
* In each of the four cases al-Nasawi explains the four elementary arithmetical operations.
* Each method for each of the four types is illustrated with worked examples and a checking procedure is explained which usually involves usually casting out nines The method al-Nasawi gives for taking cube roots is the same as the method described in the Chinese Mathematics in Nine Books, but quite how he learnt of this method is unknown.
* Al-Nasawi is critical of works on arithmetic written by earlier authors.
* In fact, in some respects, al-Nasawi does not rate too highly as a mathematician.
* There seems nothing original in any of his works and, more significantly, there are several places where al-Nasawi presents pieces of mathematics which he fails to properly understand.
* Two other works by al-Nasawi have survived.

Born about 1010, possibly Nasa, Khurasan,Iran. Died about 1075, possibly Baghdad, Iraq.
