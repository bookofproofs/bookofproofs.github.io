**Al-Nasawi** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote summaries of some of [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an innovative method of solving linear equations and quadratic equations. 
2. Discovered a connection between arithmetic and algebra that allowed algebraic methods to be used to solve equations of a degree greater than two. 
3. Developed methods for calculating the areas of figures, volumes and the edges of a triangle. 
4. Formulated methods for finding an unknown quantity using ratios and proportions. 
5. Constructed numerical tables precursors to algebraic equations. 
6. Developed a method for the automatic solution of equations. 
7. Developed techniques for calculating the volume of a sphere and other curved figures. 
8. Wrote commentaries and notes on the work of earlier mathematicians, which provided an invaluable source of inspiration for others. 
9. Established a method for solving problems involving unknown proportions and combinations of numbers.

Born about 1010, possibly Nasa, Khurasan,Iran. Died about 1075, possibly Baghdad, Iraq.
