**Donald Coxeter**'s work was mainly in geometry. In particular he made contributions of major importance in the theory of polytopes, non-euclidean geometry, group theory and combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of regular polytopes and higher-dimensional geometries, introducing the concepts of readily visualized uniform polyhedron and honeycomb. 
2. Pioneered the research on symmetry and sentex structures as group theory, Coxeterâ€“Dynkin diagrams, and other geometric and algebraic techniques. 
3. Researched extensively in the area of discrete geometry, projective geometry, and the theory of reflection groups. 
4. Founded the Canadian Journal of Mathematics, one of the principal journals in its field. 
5. Developed the concept of the truncated regular polyhedra to explain the crystallographic forms.
6. Authored numerous papers and books exploring topics of geometry, such as Regular Polytopes, Non-Euclidean Geometry and Projective Geometry of N Dimensions. 
7. Pioneered the use of computers for geometric research and visualizing three-dimensional forms. 
8. Invented notation for hyperbolic symmetry groups, now known as Coxeter groups.

Born 9 February 1907, London, England. Died 31 March 2003, Toronto, Canada.
