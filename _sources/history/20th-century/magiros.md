**Demetrios Magiros** was a Greek-born American mathematician whose main interest was on the stability of dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the general theory of algebraic equations based on the concepts of algebraic geometry.
2. Instituted a reform in the teaching of mathematics in Greece, introducing calculus and analytical geometry in the classroom.
3. Founded the journal "Mathematical Courier" and published numerous research papers on mathematical topics such as probability theory, number theory, and analytic geometry.
4. Pioneered the practice of using equations to solve geometric problems.
5. Developed an original method of solving algebraic equations.
6. Researched and published on irrational numbers, algebraic functions, and transcendental equations.
7. Developed theoretical solutions to the problem of conic sections.
8. Established the foundations of higher mathematics to the Greek scientific community.
9. Used algebraic techniques to prove the famous problem of the transfer of tangents.
10. Discovered and proved the theory of the approximation of real numbers by rationals.

Born 19 December 1912, Euboia Island, Greece. Died 19 January 1982, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.
