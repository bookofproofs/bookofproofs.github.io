**Demetrios Magiros** was a Greek-born American mathematician whose main interest was on the stability of dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1949 Magiros went to the United States where he studied applied mathematics at Brown University, then the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in New York, and finally at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
* Magiros was then appointed as professor of mathematics and mechanics at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York (founded in 1935 on land donated by businessman William S Hofstra).
* In 1960 Magiros left his position at Hofstra University to take up full time research activities at the Space and Missile Center of the General Electric Company.
* One of Magiros' main interests was on the stability of dynamical systems.
* Magiros wrote other papers on stability such as The stability in the sense of Lyapunov, Poincar√© and Lagrange of some precessional phenomena (1970) and Remarks on stability concepts of solutions of dynamical systems (1974).
* Other papers which Magiros wrote include these all published in 1976: On the linearization of nonlinear models of the phenomena.
* Two papers which Magiros published in 1977 are: Nonlinear differential equations with several general solutions  in which he gives specific devices for finding solutions of some nonlinear ordinary differential equations; and The general solutions of nonlinear differential equations as functions of their arbitrary constants  presenting some nonlinear differential equations for which, surprisingly, some superposition does occur, that is, there are families of solutions depending linearly on arbitrary constants.

Born 19 December 1912, Euboia Island, Greece. Died 19 January 1982, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.
