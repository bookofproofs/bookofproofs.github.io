**Feodor Theilheimer** was a German mathematician who was forced to move to America. He worked for the US Department of Defense on the research and development of ship design and construction.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Gustav, the son of Raphael Löw Theilheimer and Therese Bauer, and Rosa, the daughter of Veiss Nathan Waldmann and Regina Steiner, were married on 18 August 1898.
* Gustav Theilheimer was a cattle dealer and also bought hops.
* Gustav and Rosa Theilheimer had six children, all born in the house on Brunnenstrasse.
* These were Thekla (born 19 May 1899), Regina (born 26 May 1901 but died when one year old), Bella (born 3 November 1902), Hedwig (born 4 January 1904), Richard (born 30 March 1905), and Feodor (the subject of this biography, born 18 June 1909).
* Before we give a biography of Feodor, we give some details of what happened to his four siblings who survived to adulthood.
* Feodor Theilheimer began his education in a one-room Jewish school in Gunzenhausen.
* Feodor found the material taught to his class too trivial and preferred to listen to the lessons that were being taught to the older children.
* This school was non-sectarian and had an entrance examination but this was not a challenge to Theilheimer.
* Theilheimer was given religious instruction by Hauptlehrer Marx who had taught him in the Jewish school.
* However, Gunzenhausen did not have either of these schools so Theilheimer went to Nuremberg in 1925 to spend three years studying at the Oberrealschule there.
* Theilheimer only spent one year at this seminary before entering the Friedrich-Wilhelm University of Berlin in 1932 to study mathematics.
* In 1933 Theilheimer's father died, his mother having died five years earlier and, with his siblings Thekla, Bella, Hedwig, and Richard, he continued to treat half of the house at 15 Brunnenstrasse as his home.
* Among the mathematicians at Berlin when Theilheimer was studying there were Ludwig Bieberbach, Alfred Brauer, Georg Feigl, Erhard Schmidt, Richard von Mises, and Issai Schur.
* Theilheimer entered the university before the Nazis came to power in January 1933 but once the Nazis took over the government things became exceptionally difficult both for Jewish professors and for Jewish students.
* Theilheimer was able to continue to study at Berlin, mainly taking courses by Schur and Schmidt, and undertook research on invariant theory for his doctorate advised by Issai Schur.
* Despite this humiliating situation for Schur and his student, Theilheimer submitted his thesis Ein Beitrag zur Theorie der charakteristischen Invarianten Ⓣ(A contribution to the theory of characteristic invariants) and was awarded his doctorate in 1936.
* Theilheimer taught in a school in Berlin for a year after the award of his doctorate.
* The position of Jews in Nazi Germany had become quite impossible and his brother Richard Theilheimer had, as we mentioned above, emigrated to the United States in 1935 and was living in New York City.
* It was Richard who made it possible for his brother Feodor to emigrate to the United States in November 1937 by signing an affidavit.
* However, after arriving in the United States was difficult for Theilheimer to find work suited to his academic attainments.
* On Tuesday 30 December, Theilheimer was introduced by Richard von Mises and delivered the talk The potential of curvilinear distributions to the Applied Mathematics Section.
* In September 1942 Theilheimer was appointed as an instructor in mathematics at Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut.
* Dr Theilheimer, German born and bred, received his degree from the University of Berlin.
* Dr Theilheimer resigned from the Brown faculty in 1942 to accept the post of instructor in mathematics at Trinity College in September of that year.
* In addition to all this research that he is conducting, Dr Theilheimer is instructing the Freshmen and other Math 1 majors in the principles of plane trigonometry and elementary calculus.
* Also in 1948, Theilheimer married Henriette Rubel (4 February 1916 - 22 May 2013), known as Henny, originally from Hochspeyer in Germany, and they lived in Chevy Chase, Maryland.
* In fact the Theilheimer family lived at 2608 Spencer Road, Chevy Chase, Montgomery County, Maryland.
* They had one child, Rachel Theilheimer born 1950.
* Theilheimer was much involved with the Mathematical Association of America.
* This paper gives a good indication of the type of work Theilheimer was carrying out at the Model Basin.
* In 1961, Theilheimer and Pao C Pien were awarded the David W Taylor Award for Scientific Achievement.
* Dr Theilheimer was present to receive the award letter and citation.
* Dr Feodor Theilheimer.
* In 1969 Theilheimer published the paper Matrix Version of the Fast Fourier Transform in the IEEE Transactions on Audio and Electroacoustics.
* After retiring in 1977 Theilheimer taught mathematics courses at the University of Maryland until 1983.
* Theilheimer and his wife continued to live in Chevy Chase after he retired and, in December 2000, he died there.
* Henny Theilheimer, his wife, moved to New York after the death of her husband and died there on Wednesday, 22 May 2013.

Born 18 June 1909, Gunzenhausen, Germany. Died 24 December 2000, Chevy Chase, Montgomery County, Maryland, USA.
