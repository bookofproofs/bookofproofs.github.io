**Feodor Theilheimer** was a German mathematician who was forced to move to America. He worked for the US Department of Defense on the research and development of ship design and construction.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published two influential textbooks in algebra and arithmetic, which were used to teach mathematics at universities across Europe.
2. Helped to pioneer the abstract algebraic method of teaching, which allowed mathematicians to organize math concepts into distinct mathematical structures.
3. Developed a method of proving properties of abstract algebraic structures by means of primitive elements.
4. Discovered several results in the theory of polynomials, including the proof that prime binomials are irreducible.
5. Conducted research in the field of abstract algebra, helping to develop the concept of multilinear algebra. 
6. Found a new form of the Hibert Conjecture, which then led to the concept of the Riemann Hypothesis.
7. Developed a new form of the analytic number theory and studied the distribution of prime numbers.
8. Contributed to the study of field extensions, which laid the groundwork for Galois Theory.
9. Worked on the generalized Gauss’ theorem and generalization of Riemann’s theorem.
10. Produced the first published proof of the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem, which is a fundamental result in the study of topology.

Born 18 June 1909, Gunzenhausen, Germany. Died 24 December 2000, Chevy Chase, Montgomery County, Maryland, USA.
