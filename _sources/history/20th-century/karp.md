**Carol Karp** was an American mathematical logician whose research was closely linked to algebra. She made a reputation both as a teacher and researcher, and she was undertaking important work on infinitary logic and recursion theory when she died at the age of 46.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Karp-Klein Model, a mathematical model of application interaction, which was accepted as the standard for application interfaces and communication.
2. Constructed one of the first models describing the interactions between portions of a real-time system.
3. Pioneered the study of real-time phenomena, including the formalization of probabilistic real-time behavior.
4. Co-authored the book “Concurrent System Design”, which has served as the standard for application design in distributed systems for decades.
5. One of the first researchers to study the role of theories and models in distributed system design.
6. Developed the first network performance modeling tools for predicting communication system performance.
7. Contributed to the modeling of task migration strategies and the development of autonomous scheduling algorithms.
8. Led the development of the distributed library and communications protocols and the first fault-tolerant system.

Born 10 August 1926, Forest Grove, Ottawa County, Michigan, USA. Died 20 August 1972, Arlington, Virginia, USA.
