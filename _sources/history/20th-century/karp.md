**Carol Karp** was an American mathematical logician whose research was closely linked to algebra. She made a reputation both as a teacher and researcher, and she was undertaking important work on infinitary logic and recursion theory when she died at the age of 46.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Carol had a brother Wallace Earl Vander Velde (born in 1929).
* Carol also had a brother Myron Dale Vander Velde (born 11 March 1939), known as Mike, who was awarded a degree in electrical engineering from Michigan State University in 1966.
* Having given some information about Carol's parents and her brothers, let us return to her biography.
* When she was eleven, the family moved to Alliance, Ohio, where Carol attended Alliance High School.
* We can see that Carol was a very successful student at Alliance High School from information in Red and Blue, the Alliance High School student newspaper.
* Carol graduated from Alliance High School in 1944.
* Around the same time Carol moved to Michigan too, enrolling for a Master's degree at Michigan State College (now Michigan State University) in East Lansing.
* On 21 June 1952 she married Arthur Louis Karp in Los Angeles, California.
* Arthur Karp (1930-2020) had been born in the Bronx, New York City on 20 June 1930.
* After her marriage to Arthur Karp, Carol was known as Carol Karp.
* However Karp was teaching several years before the award of her Ph.D. having accepted a position as instructor at New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in 1953.
* Karp spent a year at the College in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
* On her return from Japan, Karp accepted a post as an instructor at the University of Maryland.
* Before she submitted her thesis, Karp published four abstracts in Volume 5 of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society.
* Soon after the award of her doctorate Karp was promoted, in 1960, to assistant professor at the University of Maryland.
* Basically Karp wanted to return to GÃ¶del's original proof-theoretic definitions of recursive sets but of course using more liberal notions of proof so as to obtain generalisations of recursion theory.
* Carol Karp was in the habit of doing most of her own research work during the summer months.
* It was both as a teacher and researcher that Karp made her reputation.

Born 10 August 1926, Forest Grove, Ottawa County, Michigan, USA. Died 20 August 1972, Arlington, Virginia, USA.
