**Boris Yakovlevich Levin** was a Soviet mathematician who made contributions to function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed the first explicit formulae for the representation of multiple integrals.
2. He wrote the first Russian textbook devoted to the theory of multiple integrals.
3. He provided the first generalization of the classical Law of Conservation of Energy in dynamical systems.
4. He formulated a new approach to the study of stability of nonlinear chromic fluids.
5. He introduced the first concepts of optimal control of dynamical systems.
6. He solved the first boundary value problems for non-linear partial differential equations.
7. He developed new methods for the construction of approximating functions.
8. He introduced a new area of analysis called Thematic analysis.
9. He contributed to the study of the series of Dirichlet functions.
10. He proposed the first applications of functional analysis in mechanics.

Born 22 December 1906, Odessa, Russia (now Ukraine). Died 24 August 1993, Kharkiv, Ukraine.
