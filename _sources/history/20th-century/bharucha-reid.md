**Albert Bharucha-Reid** was an American mathematician who worked on probability theory, Markov chains, and statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We shall, however, for simplicity use the name Bharucha-Reid throughout this biography.
* William and Mae Reid had three children: William Micajah Reid (born 27 September 1924 in Elizabeth City, Virginia); Cora M Reid (born about 1925/26); and Albert Turner Reid, the subject of this biography.
* Albert was given the name Turner because he was related to Charles Henry Turner (1867-1923), the first African American to receive a Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Chicago, who published over 70 papers and made important advances in zoology, particularly in understanding insect behaviour.
* In 1930, when Albert was two years old, the family were living at Chesapeake, Elizabeth City, Virginia.
* They were still at the same address ten years later, and at this time Albert was in 7th grade of Elementary School.
* Bharucha-Reid graduated from George P Phenix High School in Hampton, Virginia, a school for African Americans created by the Hampton Institute, in 1944 and then for a time attended Howard University in Washington D.C. followed by the Hampton Institute.
* While undertaking research on mathematical biology, probability and statistics at Chicago, Bharucha-Reid also worked at a Research Assistant in Mathematical Biology at the University.
* On 5 June 1954 Albert Reid married the Indian Rodabe Phiroze Bharucha (born 15 June 1930) in Cook County Illinois, and, shortly after that time, changed his name from Reid to Bharucha-Reid.
* We note that Rodabe also changed her name to Bharucha-Reid and she was awarded a doctorate by Wayne State University in 1972 for her thesis Organized behavior under stress.
* Albert and Rodabe Bharucha-Reid had two children, Kurush Feroze Bharucha-Reid and Rustam William Bharucha-Reid (born 1967).
* We note that Kurush Bharucha-Reid, born on 29 March 1955, became an intelligence and special operations expert in the United States Army, serving with great distinction.
* Now let us give a comment on the name change to Bharucha-Reid.
* Albert Bharucha-Reid attended the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, December 1954 and July-August 1955 and presented the paper On the Stochastic Theory of Epidemics.
* His name on the paper in the published Proceedings is given as A T Bharucha-Reid and the affiliation Columbia University.
* He and his wife, and first child took a flight from New York to Bombay, India, on 12 June 1956, however, and gave their names as Albert Reid, Rodabe Reid and Kurush Reid.
* When they returned, flying from Bombay to Idlewild Airport, New York on 7 October 1956 they gave their names as Albert T Bharucha-Reid and Rodabe P Bharucha-Reid.
* When Bharucha-Reid was undertaking the research for the paper On the Stochastic Theory of Epidemics mentioned above, he was supported by funds provided under Contract AF 18(600)-939 with the USAF School of Aviation Medicine, Randolph Field, Texas.
* Bharucha-Reid had left Columbia University in 1955 and worked as an Assistant Research Statistician at the University of California, Berkeley for the year 1955-1956 before taking up the appointment of Instructor at the University of Oregon in 1956.
* Bharucha-Reid published two different types of books.
* The book with Masilamani Sambandham was published a year after Bharucha-Reid died.
* The second type of book that Bharucha-Reid published consisted of long articles written by experts in their fields.
* Bharucha-Reid explains his aims with these series in the Preface to the first of these books.
* We gave details above of Bharucha-Reid's career up to 1981.
* During his last months at Atlanta University, Bharucha-Reid was very active in several aspects of the physics program.
* For example, in 1994 the National Association of Mathematicians inaugurated the NAM Albert Turner Bharucha-Reid Lecture Series.
* Tepper Gill had been one of Bharucha-Reid's Ph.D. students.
* Dr Bharucha-Reid also mentored at least thirteen Ph.D. students.

Born 13 November 1927, Hampton, Virginia, USA. Died 26 February 1985, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.
