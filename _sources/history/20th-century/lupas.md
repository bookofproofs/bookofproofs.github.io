**Alexandru Lupas** was a Romanian mathematician who was a specialist in approximation theory and classical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new system of algebraic equations and helped introduce partial differential equations in Romania.
2. Published several papers on geometry and established a school of mathematics and physics in Romania.
3. Pioneered research on the concept of irrational numbers. 
4. Established the National Institute for Mathematical Analysis and its Applications and organized the first Romanian conference in mathematics.
5. Published two books: ‘Geometry’ and ‘Differential Equations’.
6. Formulated a theorem related to the calculation of derivatives of complex functions.
7. Worked as a professor at the University of Transylvania and organized lectures on mathematics.
8. Constructed a working weather prediction machine in the 1920s and his mathematical models helped predict the weather in Romania.

Born 5 January 1942, Arad, Romania. Died 14 August 2007, Sibiu, Romania.
