**Alexandru Lupas** was a Romanian mathematician who was a specialist in approximation theory and classical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Lupas graduated in 1964 and was then appointed as a researcher at the Institute of Numerical Computation of the Romanian Academy in Cluj-Napoca.
* Lupas held this appointment until 1975 when the Institute of Numerical Computation was transferred from the Romanian Academy to the National Education Minister and the number of researchers reduced from 48 to 6.
* While working at the Institute of Numerical Computation, Lupas published a number of excellent papers.
* His advisor Tiberiu Popoviciu sadly died in 1975 so Lupas was advised by Dimitrie D Stancu for the final months of his work.
* We noted above that Lupas was appointed to the University of Sibiu in 1976.
* Lupas was a major figure in the affairs of the university through this difficult period.
* Lupas was married to Luciana who was herself an eminent mathematician on the staff of the university.
* Alexandru and Luciana Lupas, together with Heiner, were editors of the Proceedings of the conference Mathematical analysis and approximation theory which consisted of papers presented to the 5th  Romanian-German Seminar on Approximation Theory held in Sibiu from 12 to 15 June  2002.
* His unexpected death, occurring only one year after the death of his wife Luciana Lupas, also a distinguished mathematician at the University "Lucian Blaga" in Sibiu, shocked not only his family, but also his friends, disciples, PhD students and students.

Born 5 January 1942, Arad, Romania. Died 14 August 2007, Sibiu, Romania.
