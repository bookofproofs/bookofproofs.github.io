### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Gladys attended Craigmount School, Edinburgh, from 1913 to 1919 and, in passing, we note a news item which tell us that in 1914 she took part in "a fancy dress frolic for children under twelve dressed as a Normandy Peasant." She sat the Scottish Leaving Certificate Examinations and obtained passes at Higher level in English, French, Latin, and Mathematics, having obtained a pass in Lower mathematics in the previous year.
* In 1919 Mackenzie matriculated in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Edinburgh giving Church of Scotland as her Religious Denomination.
* After working in Edinburgh for two years, Mackenzie was appointed to a Lectureship in Physics at Newnham College, Cambridge in 1926.
* Miss Mackenzie graduated with First-Class Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy as recently as 1924.
* Miss Mackenzie is an M.A. and B.Sc. of Edinburgh University, and she was a demonstrator in the Physics Laboratory of Edinburgh University at the time of her appointment.
* Gladys Mackenzie joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in March 1925.
* On 14 March 1929 Mackenzie married Wallace Russell Harper, Ph.D. who was also a physicist; they had one son.
