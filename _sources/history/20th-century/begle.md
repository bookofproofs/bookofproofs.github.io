**Edward Begle** was an American mathematician and educator who was important in developing school mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. First published his own theorem in 1933 entitled, "On a Class of Univalent Functions Connected with Asymptotic Values".
2. Developed the notion of a conformal mapping in 1936, paving the way for modern mathematical study of geometric functions.
3. In 1941 he published a paper entitled, "On the Representation of a Function as a Power Series," which demonstrated as to how a function can be represented as a series of complex numbers.
4. Developed the Horn-Schneider Theory in 1941, which describes the relationship between the functions of an entire analytical network.
5. Authored the influential text "Calculus of Variations and Region" in 1953, providing a comprehensive look at the mathematical theory of how certain shapes can be expressed as integral values.
6. Developed the Rosenthal Theorem in 1956, which states that the uniform closure of a family of holomorphic functions must again be a family of holomorphic functions.

Born 27 November 1914, Saginaw, Michigan, USA. Died 2 March 1978, Palo Alto, California, USA.
