**Hans Bethe** was a mathematician and physicist who worked on quantum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1967 for his work on energy production in stars.
2. Developed the Bethe-Salpeter equation, a fundamental equation in relativistic quantum mechanics.
3. Made important contributions to quantum electrodynamics (QED), the quantum theory of radiation.
4. Developed a method for calculating the composition of atomic nuclei from fundamental principles.
5. Proposed the theory that the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle is responsible for the production of energy in stars.
6. Discovered the Analytical S-matrix theory, a mathematical method for solving the scattering problem in quantum mechanics.
7. Provided important contributions to the “liquid drop” model of atomic nuclei.
8. Developed a theory of neutrino emission from supernovae.
9. Authored over 150 scientific articles.

Born 2 July 1906, Strasbourg, Germany (now France). Died 6 March 2005, Ithaca, New York, USA.
