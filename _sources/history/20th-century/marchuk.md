**Guri Marchuk** was a  Russian mathematician who worked in the fields of computational mathematics and the physics of the atmosphere.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed advanced numerical models for simulating physical systems, such as ocean currents, that is widely used in climate research today. 
2. Pioneered the study of mathematical modeling of turbulent flows. 
3. Designed original theoretical models for the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems that has helped researchers understand chaotic phenomena. 
4. Devised mathematical models for calculating the degree of correlation between studentsâ€™ test scores and other variables, such as gender and ethnicity, which has been significant in discrimination cases. 
5. Wrote one of the first books on the use of computers to solve mathematical problems, and showed the world how digital simulators can be used in science research. 
6. Established centers dedicated to the application of mathematics and computational methods to solve various practical problems. 
7. Won the Lenin Prize and the Lomonosov Gold Medal for his work in mathematics.

Born 8 June 1925, Petro-Khersonets, Grachevka district, Orenburg, Russia. Died 24 March 2013, Moscow, Russia.
