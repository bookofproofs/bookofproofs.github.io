**Sixto Ríos García** was a Spanish mathematician who wrote many important papers in both analysis and statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The name Sixto came from an uncle, a brother of his mother.
* José Ríos taught in school in Pelahustán where children of all ages were taught in a single classroom.
* There were two children in the family, the other being a girl, Encarnación Ríos Garcia, who was three years younger than Sixto.
* Although Sixto's parents were both teachers, both his fraternal and maternal grandparents were involved in agriculture.
* However, his paternal grandfather, Lorenzo Ríos Curto (born 1849), had a passion for reading and even wrote plays.
* He was an influence on the young Sixto, encouraging him to read and appreciate books.
* In 1916, when Sixto was three years old, his parents requested a transfer to teach in schools in Los Navalmorales, Toledo, and their request was granted.
* It was at his father's school in Los Navalmorales that Sixtos began his education.
* Although Ríos's main studies were in mathematical science, he also studied the two-year course on education following the wishes of his father.
* One of Ríos's fellow students, but slightly older, was Luis Antonio Santaló.
* Ríos was elected as a student representative on the Faculty Board in 1930 and, in the following year, was awarded a scholarship by the Mathematical Seminar and there met Julio Rey Pastor for the first time; Rey Pastor was based in Argentina but spent a short time in Madrid each winter.
* In the academic year 1931-32 Ríos studied a course on Mathematical Statistics taught by Esteban Terradas.
* On 22 June 1932 Ríos was awarded a Bachelor's degree in Exact Sciences from the Universidad Central de Madrid.
* One day Ríos placed on the chalkboard, before Barinaga arrived, an easy and simple solution he had found to one of the difficult problems.
* In July of that year Ríos and his family were on holiday, living in a tent in the Carmelites in El Escorial.
* While there they learnt of the civil war and its meaning for them quickly became evident when Ríos's father was arrested.
* Ríos was excused military service on health grounds but the Commander of the Military Command of Cercedilla required him to become his assistant secretary, making him teach mathematics to military chiefs.
* The delay in publication of the papers (written four years earlier) was due to the civil war and similarly there was a delay in Ríos receiving the prize, which did not happen until 15 November 1941.
* He was able to return to the Universidad Central de Madrid but these were difficult times and he only achieved this with help from his uncle, Hermenegildo Alfonso Ríos, Commander of the Carabineros, who managed to arrange all the documents he needed.
* In January 1943 Ríos became Head of the Analysis Section of the Jorge Juan Institute of the Higher Council of Scientific Research.
* On 11 December of the same year Ríos was awarded the Alfonso X El Sabio Prize for his work La prolongación analítica de la integral de Dirichlet Stieltjes Ⓣ(The analytic continuation of the integral of Dirichlet-Stieltjes).
* On 29 July 1950, Ríos married María Jesús Insua Negrao in the Chapel of the Holy Spirit of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas.
* María was twenty-three years old and Ríos was thirty-seven at the time of their marriage.
* They had six children María Jesús Ríos-Insua, Cristina Ríos-Insua, Sixto Ríos-Insua, Valeria Ríos-Insua, David Ríos-Insua and Alba Ríos-Insua, three of whom became mathematicians undertaking research into similar areas of operations research and statistics as their father, namely Sixto Ríos-Insua, David Ríos-Insúa and María Jesús Ríos-Insua.
* Let us record at this point that Sixto Ríos-Insua and María Jesús Ríos-Insua co-authored the book Procesos de Decision Multicriterio Ⓣ(Multicriterion decision processes) (1989) with their father.
* Ríos with his sons Sixto Ríos-Insua and David Ríos-Insúa collaborated on the six author paper Allais phenomena and completeness of preferences (1997) with J Pachón, M A Pacios and P García Barreno.
* Before taking up the chair of statistics, Ríos had published a number of books on analysis such as Lectures on the theory of the integral (Spanish) (1942), Lectures on the theory of the analytic continuation of Dirichlet series (Spanish) (1943), La Prolongación Analítica de la Integral de Dirichlet-Stieltjes Ⓣ(The analytical continuation of the Integral of Dirichlet-Stieltjes) (1944), Conferencias sobre la Representación Analítica de Funciones Ⓣ(Conferences on the analytical representation of functions) (1945), and Conceptos de Integral Ⓣ(Concepts of Integral) (1946).
* With his move from analysis to statistics, Ríos has a publication list with a remarkable range of important works.
* Ríos received many honours, some of which we now list.
* In 1958 Ríos was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.
* In the following year he was honoured with the street in which he was born in Pelahustán being named 'Sixto Ríos'.
* In 1983, at the age of 70, Ríos retired.
* His son, Sixto Ríos-Insua, died in Madrid on 11 June 2008 and less than a month later Ríos died of bronchitis at the Clínica de la Luz in Madrid.

Born 4 January 1913, Pelahustán, Toledo, Spain. Died 8 July 2008, Madrid, Spain.
