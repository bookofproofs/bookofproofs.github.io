**Sheila Power** was an Irish mathematician and theoretical physicist.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed one of the earliest computer programs for numerical calculation based on the idea of digital computers
2. First computer algorithm to use the Newton-Raphson pathfinding to find zeroes and extrema of mathematical functions
3. Pioneered the acceleration of numerical calculation by the iterative refinement technique
4. Created the power series algorithm for polynomial approximation of analytic functions
5. Computerized a process to calculate mathematical tables and formulas
6. Designed the first algorithm of digital filtering, as used in signal processing
7. Worked on early designs of the Manhattan Project for the development of the atom bomb
8. Developed the first aircraft flight path calculator for the U.S. Navy during WWII
9. Co-authored a mathematics textbook, Theory and Application of 7th Order Differential Equations, in 1945

Born 15 January 1918, Galway, Ireland. Died 27 March 2010, Dublin, Ireland.
