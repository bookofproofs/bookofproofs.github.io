**Fritz John** was a German-born mathematician who worked in partial differential equations and ill-posed problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of constrained optimization in 1949, known as John's Theory of Lagrange Multipliers.
2. Derived the necessary condition of optimality, also known as Fritz John conditions. 
3. Co-authored the monograph Calculus of Variations with Courant in 1937. 
4. Published the paper “Partial Differential Equations of Mathematical Physics” in 1945.
5. Developed a version of the KKT conditions known as the Fritz-John necessary conditions. 
6. Pioneered the use the use of strong duality for the equivalent formulation of optimization. 
7. Developed the Gödel-John rotating body theorem.
8. Contributed to the theory of convergence of solutions of partial differential equations in the early 1950s.
9. Established a rigorous stability proof of the Euler method for solving ordinary differential equations in 1943.
10. Proposed a numerical integration procedure based on the concept of optimal quadrature in 1950.

Born 14 June 1910, Berlin, Germany. Died 10 February 1994, New York, USA.
