**David Broomhead** was an English mathematician who specialised in dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Returning from Uganda, Broomhead matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, in 1970.
* He published the two-volume book Molecular Quantum Mechanics in 1970, so Broomhead's project was very much in line with his current interests.
* One important event in Broomhead's life which occurred while he was at Merton College, Oxford, was meeting Eleanor J Harries who was also studying chemistry.
* They were later married and had one son, Nathan Thomas Broomhead.
* After completing his thesis, David Broomhead spent a year as a postdoctoral student at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell in Oxfordshire.
* While at the University of Kyoto, Broomhead wrote the paper The Self Interaction and Mutual Interaction of Limit Cycles.
* Returning to England, Broomhead took up a postdoctoral position working with George Rowlands in the Physics Department at the University of Warwick in 1980.
* Dave also made fruitful connections to the Dynamical Systems group in Warwick's Department of Mathematics including Robert MacKay, David Rand and Christopher Zeeman.
* Broomhead left the university environment in 1983 when he took up a position in the scientific civil service.
* In 1995 Broomhead was appointed as professor of applied mathematics at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST).
* In 2004 UMIST merged with the University of Manchester so Broomhead became a professor in the University of Manchester.
* In August 2002 Broomhead became the editor of Mathematics Today, a publication of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA).
* Among the honours and awards Broomhead received, we mention the John Benjamin Memorial Prize which he was awarded (jointly with David Lowe and D A R (Andrew) Web) in 1989.
* Broomhead died suddenly at the age of 63.

Born 13 November 1950, Leeds, England. Died 24 July 2014, London, England.
