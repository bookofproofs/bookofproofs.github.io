**Giovanni Ricci** was an Italian mathematician who worked in number theory, differential geometry, mathematical analysis and theory of series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After graduating, Ricci went to Rome where he was appointed as a lecturer.
* Ricci held this position for eight years.
* As examples of the papers Ricci published during his eight years as a professor in Pisa we mention: Sulle funzioni simmetriche delle radici dell'unità secondo un modulo composto Ⓣ(On symmetric functions of the roots of unity in a  compound form) (1931), Sui grandi divisori primi delle coppie di interi in posti corrispondenti di due progressioni aritmetiche.
* Let us also note that, in 1951, Ricci wrote a paper on the school of mathematics in Pisa La scuola matematica pisana dal 1848 al 1948 Ⓣ(The mathematics school of Pisa from 1848 to 1948).
* In 1936 Ricci moved to Milan where he was appointed as Professor of Mathematical Analysis at the University.
* Ricci was unable to continue his research with the vigour that he had in Pisa and was more involved in teaching and administration.
* In it Ricci discussed the estimation of exponential sums, the distribution of f(x)f (x)f(x) mod 1, Waring's problem and Goldbach's problem.
* Ricci held the chair of Mathematical Analysis in Milan for over 36 years.
* We mentioned Ricci's research on the distribution of primes.
* We should not, however, give the impression that all Ricci's work was in number theory for he also made significant contributions to the theory of functions of a complex variable.
* Finally we mention that Ricci's most famous doctoral student during his time in Milan was Enrico Bombieri.

Born 17 August 1904, Florence, Italy. Died 9 September 1973, Milan, Italy.
