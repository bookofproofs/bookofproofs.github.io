**Norman Steenrod** was an American mathematician who worked in algebraic topology and was one of the founders of homological algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of homology theory, a topological technique used in algebraic topology to calculate the properties of geometric figures.
2. Established the idea of fiber bundles, which allow for efficient calculations of geometrical properties.
3. Defined the Steenrod square, an algebraic tool that allows for calculations of some cohomology operations.
4. Co-authored the seminal book ‘The Topology of Fibre Bundles’, which helped further the development of algebraic topology.
5. Developed the first-ever abstract homology theory.
6. Interwove algebraic topology and algebraic geometry through published works.
7. Developed theory and techniques for measuring the homotopy groups of spheres.
8. Published hundreds of important papers, books, and monographs related to algebraic topology.

Born 22 April 1910, Dayton, Ohio, USA. Died 14 October 1971, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
