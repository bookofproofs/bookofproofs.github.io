**Ernst Straus** was a German-born American mathematician who worked in a variety of areas including relativity and combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1978 for his pioneering work on nonlinear partial differential equations.
2. Authored over 150 publications in mathematics, including seven books.
3. Developed theories on singularity theory, the Cauchy problem, and non-linear waves.
4. One of the first researchers to study Ostrowski’s type equations.
5. Established the theory of constant coefficient hyperbolic partial differential equations.
6. Proposed new methods of rigorous solutions of boundary-value problems.
7. Constructed the theory of general solutions, leading to the Straus’ theorem.
8. Co-authored a monograph on nonlinear functional analysis with L. Nirenberg.

Born 25 February 1922, Munich, Germany. Died 12 July 1983, Los Angeles, California, USA.
