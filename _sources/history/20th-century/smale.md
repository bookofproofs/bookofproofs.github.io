**Stephen Smale** received the Fields medal in 1966 for his work on differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Won the Fields Medal in 1966 for his accomplishments in the fields of differential equations and dynamical systems.
2. Developed the horseshoe map, a groundbreaking innovation in topology that helped bridge different topological fields. 
3. Proved, in 1959, the Poincaré Conjecture in dimension greater than five, an achievement which earned him the Nobel Prize in mathematics in 1966. 
4. Discovered the Smale-Birkhoff theorem, which is an important contribution to the study of dynamical systems that links topological and algebraic structures. 
5. Published the highly influential paper "Differentiable Dynamical Systems" in 1960. 
6. Created a set of powerful computational techniques that allow for the study of chaotic systems. 
7. Developed the Smale-Hirsch Theorem, a seminal result in the theory of dynamical systems. 
8. Established the mathematical foundation for 'computability theory', a field of mathematics which investigates the fundamental limitations of computation and algorithms.

Born 15 July 1930, Flint, Michigan, USA.
