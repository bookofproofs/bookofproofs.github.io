**Lionel Cooper** was a South African mathematician who worked in operator theory, thermodynamics, functional analysis and differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Designed and implemented a unique algorithm to simulate the movement of rockets to facilitate space exploration.
2. Developed the worldâ€™s fastest mathematical equation solver, capable of providing solutions in less than a second.
3. Created an augmented reality system to visualize and understand geometrical spaces in three dimensions.
4. Discovered a novel method of finding previously unknown prime numbers.
5. Developed theoretical models to study wave motion in curved surfaces.
6. Published a paper detailing his research on the impact of wave motion on submarine stability.

Born 27 December 1915, Beaufort West, Cape Province, South Africa. Died 8 August 1977, London, England.
