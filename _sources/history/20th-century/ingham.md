**Albert Ingham** was an English mathematician who worked in number theory and in particular on the prime number theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Albert Ingham was educated at Stafford Grammar School, and from there he won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, in December 1917.
* In 1926 Ingham was appointed a Reader at Leeds University but four years later returned to Cambridge as a university lecturer and a fellow of King's College, on the death of Ramsey, and remained there for the rest of his life.
* Many of the ideas here, as in other work of Ingham's, came from the joint work undertaken by Harald Bohr and Littlewood.
* ran out of print, Ingham could never be persuaded to prepare a second edition.
* Ingham's work was on the Riemann zeta function, the theory of numbers, the theory of series and Tauberian theorems.
* Ingham, in 1942, was able to find an ingenious method to show how a counterexample could be constructed.
* Some of Ingham's work on number theory was carried further by Linnik.
* Ingham led a life of great simplicity.

Born 3 April 1900, Northampton, England. Died 6 September 1967, Chamonix, France.
