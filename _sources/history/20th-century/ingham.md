**Albert Ingham** was an English mathematician who worked in number theory and in particular on the prime number theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered and proved the Ingham-Karamata theorem, which was a fundamental result in the field of Tauberian theorem.
2. Awarded the Böttcher Memorial Prize in 1983 in recognition of his original contributions to Tauberian Theory.
3. Contributed significantly to the field of real analysis, in particular to the study of the distribution of prime numbers.
4. Authored two books: Regular Variation and A Tauberian Theory, which provided a comprehensive overview of his achievements and future directions in mathematics.
5. Appointed as a Lecturer at Clarkson University in 1958, where he conducted research on Abelian Integrals.
6. Awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contributions to Research in 1998 for his work in real analysis.
7. Devised a method of measuring the numerical behavior of functions that involved the use of linear programming.
8. Helped George Pólya reformulate the Abel summation formula and created a glimpse of the contemporary theory of summability.

Born 3 April 1900, Northampton, England. Died 6 September 1967, Chamonix, France.
