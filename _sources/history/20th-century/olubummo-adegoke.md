* Professor Olubummo was someone with strong passion for traditional ceremonies and cultural events.
* In addition to the book we mentioned above, Olubummo has published the book Introduction to Real Analysis (1979) and around 25 papers, the last two of which both appeared in 1989.
* In 1985 Olubummo retired from the University of Ibadan, and became Dean of the Faculty of Science of Ondo State University, Ado-Ekiti.
