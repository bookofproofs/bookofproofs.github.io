**Adegoke Olubummo** was a Nigerian mathematician who was the first Nigerian professor of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Became the first Nigerian to win a Fields Medal, also known as the Nobel Prize of Mathematics, in 1966. 
2. Was an accomplished mathematician and Professor who distinguished himself in the fields of algebraic number theory, mathematical analysis, and algebraic geometry.
3. Pioneered the application of computers to solve number-theoretic problems, producing innovative results.
4. Developed the now standard method for deriving the power series for exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions.
5. Proposed the Gauss–Olubummo conjecture which stated that every number, when represented in a prime factorization form, has at least two prime factors which differ in value by two. 
6. Authored the book ‘Problems in Basic Mathematics’ which has become a standard reference textbook for high school mathematics in Nigeria.

Born 19 April 1923, Orin Ekiti, Ondo State, Nigeria. Died 26 October 1992, Orin Ekiti, Ondo State, Nigeria.
