### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Incorporated the Langlands conjectures into the study of automorphic forms and Galois representations.
2. Pioneered the use of geometric methods to prove distributional results in harmonic analysis.
3. Established the first local character expansions of automorphic forms in higher dimensions.
4. Developed techniques to calculate holomorphic extensions of several automorphic L-functions.
5. Wrote a number of foundational books on harmonic analysis, most notably the two-volume "Groups and Geometric Analysis".
6. Introduced new concepts of mixing coefficients and residues of Eisenstein series that allowed for further developments in the field of complex geometry.
7. Founded the spectral theory of automorphic forms, now known as the Helgason-Yamada theorem.
8. Used new techniques to incorporate the Ramanujan Conjecture into the Fourier expansion of modular forms.
9. Proved theorems related to the trace formula and its interpretation in terms of multiplicative functions.
10. Developed a class of automorphic forms, known as Helgason forms, that are important to several areas of mathematics.
