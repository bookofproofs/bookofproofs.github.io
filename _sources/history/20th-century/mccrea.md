**William Hunter McCrea** was an English astronomer and mathematician whose research on the composition of the Sun and on star formation led to the development of the big bang theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Robert McCrea was a schoolmaster who moved to England when Bill was two years old.
* In 1928 McCrea followed up a suggestion by Cecilia Payne and by the German astronomer Albrecht Uns√∂ld that in fact hydrogen was dominant.
* However, Whittaker was not the person in the department to interact most closely with McCrea, rather it was George McVittie who was undertaking research under Whittaker's supervision.
* McCrea was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1931.
* In 1935 McCrea published Relativity Physics, a little book of less than 100 pages.
* In 1936 McCrea was named Professor of Pure Mathematics at Queen's University Belfast.
* McCrea's later books are Physics of Sun and Stars (1950), Cosmology (1969), The Royal Greenwich Observatory (1975), and History of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1920 to 1980 (1987).
* We have already mentioned McCrea's work on the mechanical equilibrium of the solar chromosphere and in more generally on solar atmospheres.
* McCrea convincingly showed there is no paradox, and the space-travelling twin would indeed age less (something now verified by experiments of sending accurate clocks into space and back).
* McCrea received many honours and we can list only a few in what follows.

Born 24 December 1904, Dublin, Ireland. Died 25 April 1999, Lewes, Sussex, England.
