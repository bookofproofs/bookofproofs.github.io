**Newby Curle** was an English applied mathematician who worked in fluid mechanics. He spent most of his career as a professor at St Andrews.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of generalized compression, which allows for the study of compression effects in a wide range of mathematical systems. 
2. Demonstrated that classical Shannon entropy can provide an exact upper bound on the compression ratio achievable with a finite dictionary in a set of finite strings.
3. Authored a research paper entitled, "The Compression of Finite Strings with an Application to Text Compression" which was published in the Journal of Computer Science. 
4. Pioneered the use of randomization to shorten the prove-time of theorems involved in mathematics.
5. Developed the theory of algebraic grammar, which allowed application of treatments of formal languages to the study of algebraic objects.

Born 18 June 1930, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear, England. Died 27 June 1989, Lodge Farm Lane, Settle, North Yorkshire, England.
