* Newby Curle was appointed to the Gregory Chair of Applied Mathematics at the University of St Andrews in 1967.
* Newby Curle was the one to realise this and went out of his way to make it easy for me.
* Over more than twenty years in St Andrews Newby Curle had done much to build up teaching and research in Applied Mathematics.

Born 18 June 1930, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear, England. Died 27 June 1989, Lodge Farm Lane, Settle, North Yorkshire, England.
