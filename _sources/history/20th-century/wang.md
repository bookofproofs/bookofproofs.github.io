**Hsien Chung Wang** was a Chinese-born American mathematician who worked in differential geometry, Lie groups and algebraic topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His original intention was to take a degree in physics so he began his studies taking courses which would lead to this degree.
* On 7 July 1937 Japanese and Chinese troops clashed near Peking.
* In late July further fighting broke out and the Japanese quickly captured Peking and Tientsin.
* Tsing Hua University was moved to Southwest China where it was amalgamated with Nankai and Peking universities.
* Wang had to journey to the new site of his university and begin his studies again.
* Wang graduated in 1941 and began to study under S S Chern.
* He was awarded a master's degree in 1944 and began teaching in a school.
* However, after one year, he was awarded a British Council Scholarship to continue his studies in England.
* After a while at Sheffield he studied under Newman at Manchester and received a Ph.D. in 1948.
* On his return to China, Wang took up a research post at the Chinese National Academy of Sciences.
* Between early November 1948 and early January 1949 the Communists and Nationalists fought for control.
* The Chinese National Academy of Sciences was set up on Taiwan and Wang followed the Academy there.
* From 1949 Wang lived in the United States.
* This was not an easy time to obtain a mathematics post in the United States and Wang, although he had an impressive reputation as a mathematician by this time, could only manage a succession of temporary posts.
* First he taught at Louisiana State, then for two years at Baton Rouge before he spent his first year at Princeton in 1951-52.
* Again he held temporary posts, this time for two years at Alabama Polytechnic, then 1954-55 at Princeton again, 1955-57 at the University of Washington in Seattle followed by a time at Columbia in New York.
* The year 1957 saw Wang receive an offer of a permanent post for the first time.
* This was at Northwestern University where he remained, having further spells at Princeton during this time, until 1966 when he was appointed to Cornell.
* Wang worked on algebraic topology and discovered the 'Wang sequence', an exact sequence involving homology groups associated with fibre bundles over spheres.
* These discoveries were made while he worked with Newman in Manchester.
* Wang also solved, at that time, an important open problem in determining the closed subgroups of maximal rank in a compact Lie group.
* Wang's most important work was on discrete subgroups of Lie groups, a topic on which he continued to work.
* He published Two-point homogeneous spaces in 1952 which dealt with a homogeneous space of a compact Lie group.
* His teaching and other mathematical and administrative activities continued unabated, however, and he played an important role in the department at Cornell.
* He was very much liked there, as everywhere, for his modesty, generosity, kindness and curtsey.
* He was a fine teacher and lecturer.
* He enjoyed excellent health until he was suddenly stricken with leukaemia in June 1978.
* He succumbed within weeks, to be survived for only a few months by his wife.

Born 18 April 1918, Peking (now Beijing), China. Died 25 June 1978, New York, USA.
