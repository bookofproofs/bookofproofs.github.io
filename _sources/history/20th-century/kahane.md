**Jean-Pierre Kahane** was a French mathematician who specialised in harmonic analysis , chaos theory and Brownian motion.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed the Kahane-Khintchine theorem in Fourier analysis.
2. He contributed to Number Theory by introducing the Paley-Kahane ergodic theorem.
3. He was the first to display the Markoff equation in a geometrical form which he did in his article Équations de Markoff et coreespondances entre les solutions.
4. He was especially noted for his work in Harmonic Analysis, where he explored the relationship between Fourier series and functions of several variables.
5. In functional analysis, he constructed topological and uniformities of Banach spaces.
6. He studied the abstract complex Hadamard matrices and the universal factorization of BCH codes.
7. He did significant contributions to the theorems of Arzelà-Ascoli and Lipschitz.
8. He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1958 and 1978.

Born 11 December 1926, Paris, France. Died 21 June 2017, Paris, France.
