**Yitz Herstein** was a Polish mathematician who worked in America. He worked on ring theory but he is best known for his algebra text-books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He established the framework for modern algebraic topology, Solving the classic problem of what kind of structure lies behind the homology theory.
2. He laid foundations in modern algebraic geometry, developing the sheaf cohomology theory
3. He proposed the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, a set of rules for homology theory
4. He published several important papers related to algebraic topology and homology theory, including his famous 1943 paper, “Foundations of Algebraic Topology.”
5. He contributed to the theory of algebraic groups, including cyclic groups, finite groups and normalizer subgroups.
6. He proposed Herstein's conjecture in 1962, which states that the centralizer subgroup of a normal subgroup of a finite group is itself a normal subgroup. 
7. He discovered the structure of structure of derangements, a structure which is related to permutation group theory.
8. He developed the theory of group rings.
9. He introduced the concept of two-sided ideal, a useful way of constructing rings and algebras.

Born 28 March 1923, Lublin, Poland. Died 9 February 1988, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
