**Yitz Herstein** was a Polish mathematician who worked in America. He worked on ring theory but he is best known for his algebra text-books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Yitzchak is the Hebrew version of Isaac but when he was in primary school his teachers called him Israel and he was known by that name ever since.
* In fact, like Yitz, Chaim was later not known by that name but called Harvey.
* After his marriage to Marianne Deson, Herstein moved to the University of Indiana and received a Ph.D. in 1948 for a thesis Divisor Algebras written under Max Zorn's supervision.
* In Chicago, Herstein was influenced by Abraham Albert.
* His appointment as Assistant Professor at Chicago was in Mathematics and Economics and Herstein published some papers relating to economics while holding the post.
* A A Albert was chairman of the Mathematics Department at Chicago and had been desperate to bring Herstein back there.
* The faculty approved Herstein's appointment.
* In addition to work on rings and algebras Herstein also worked on groups and fields.
* Herstein is perhaps best known for his beautifully written algebra texts, especially the undergraduate text Topics in algebra (1964).
* Topics in Ring Theory was based on lectures Herstein gave at the University of Chicago and first published in the University of Chicago Mathematics Lecture Notes series.
* The book largely concerns Herstein's work on Lie and Jordan structure of simple associative rings which he published in various papers in the early 1950s.
* Matters mathematical by Herstein and Kaplansky is an interesting book, based on a course designed to introduce students who were not specialising in mathematics.
* Herstein supervised 30 research students.
* Often Yitz would take us to Mama Luigi's for a late dinner, where we talked for hours.
* (Yitz kept an automobile in storage in Rome for his frequent visits there - but he was equally at home in all of the world's great cities.) ...

Born 28 March 1923, Lublin, Poland. Died 9 February 1988, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
