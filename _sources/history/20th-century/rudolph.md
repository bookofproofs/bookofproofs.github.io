**Daniel Rudolph** was an American mathematician who worked in ergodic theory and dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Of course, as part of his studies in theoretical physics, Rudolph studied mathematics courses and he soon decided that he wanted to be a mathematician rather than a theoretical physicist.
* After graduating with a B.S., Rudolph went to Stanford University to undertake research.
* Rudolph's 59-page thesis was entitled Non-Bernoulli Behavior of the Roots of K-Automorphisms and it earned him a Ph.D. in 1975.
* After the award of his doctorate, Rudolph spent the year 1975-76 as a postdoctoral fellow at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
* In the summer of 1976 Rudolph returned to the United States, taking up a fellowship at the Miller Institute of the University of California at Berkeley.
* Several papers by Rudolph appeared while he was at the Hebrew University.
* Rudolph spent three years at Stanford (1978-81) but during this time he stayed at the University of Maryland during the autumn of 1979 participating in the 'Special Year in Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems'.
* The plane, a twin-engine Beechcraft, piloted by Gregory Rudolph crashed while attempting to land at Cedar City Airport.
* Dan Rudolph spent 23 years at the University of Maryland where he was appointed as a full professor in 1985.
* Before 1991, Rudolph would work at the university all day and then spend his evenings with friends or participating in his modern dance.
* In fact he would often perform with modern dance companies and a friend even choreographed a duet dedicated to Rudolph's parents entitled 'For Bill and Johnalou' in which he starred.
* Rudolph published two important books.
* In fact Janet Whalen Kammeyer was Rudolph's first Ph.D. student, writing her thesis Classifying the two point extensions of Bernoulli Z actions at the University of Maryland and receiving the degree in 1988.
* In 2005 Rudolph was appointed to the Albert C Yates Endowed Chair in Mathematics in the College of Natural Sciences of Colorado State University.

Born 3 October 1949, Sheridan, Wyoming, USA. Died 4 February 2010, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.
