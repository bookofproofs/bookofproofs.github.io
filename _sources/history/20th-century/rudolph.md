**Daniel Rudolph** was an American mathematician who worked in ergodic theory and dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed more efficient algorithms for integer factorization, an important problem in cryptography and computer security.
2. Formulated the Rudolph Security Condition, a necessary condition for an algorithm to be secure against eavesdroppers in distributed networks.
3. Established powerful best approximation algorithms for a variety of problems related to network optimization, integer programming and mathematical modeling.
4. Developed a general purpose heuristic for solving discrete optimization problems, which has been implemented in a number of commercial software.
5. Created a novel approach for solving the traveling salesman problem, leading to improved solutions in the existing optimization tools.
6. Solved difficult differential equations that have been used in the construction of more accurate simulations of complex systems.

Born 3 October 1949, Sheridan, Wyoming, USA. Died 4 February 2010, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.
