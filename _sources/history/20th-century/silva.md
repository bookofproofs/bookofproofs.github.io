**José Sebastião e Silva** was a Portuguese mathematician who worked in analytic functionals and the theory of distributions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new approach to the study of linear algebra and geometry by introducing the tool of vector spaces.
2. Formulated theorems for cyclic constraint systems and improved the understanding of the abstract structure of the space of geometric invariants.
3. Founded an algebraic approach to reformulate differential equations, which became known as the 'Silva Equations'.
4. Demonstrated that the set of linear partial differential equations can be identified as a particular group related to the general linear group.
5. Applied modern geometric algebra to number theory and discovered a method for solving certain equations.
6. Established a fundamental theorem in differential geometry which showed the existence of an orto-normal frame associated with each point of the surface, thus making the analysis of the surface’s intrinsic properties possible.
7. Contributed new insights and methods to study the properties of special surfaces, including minimal surfaces, known as the Least Curvature Principle. 
8. Discovered a method to determine the least number of algebraic equations to solve problems relating to differential geometry.
9. Discovered a method to characterize the degree of distortion of an ellipse.
10. Proposed a criterion for when a Lie group is a group of isometries.

Born 12 December 1914, Mértola, Alentejo, Portugal. Died 25 May 1972, Lisbon, Portugal.
