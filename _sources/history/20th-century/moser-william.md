**William Moser** was a Canadian mathematician who worked in combinatorial geometry and group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His parents were Laura Feurstein and Robert Moser from Austria.
* Moser entered the University of Manitoba, following the career path of Leo, and graduated with a B.Sc. in 1949.
* Moser then did a Master's degree at the University of Minnesota, being awarded an M.A. in 1951.
* In fact this thesis was a major component in the classic text Generators and relations for discrete groups jointly authored by Donald Coxeter and Willy Moser and published by Springer-Verlag in Berlin-Göttingen-Heidelberg in 1957.
* See Coxeter-Moser Preface for a complete version of the Preface.
* The second publication by Moser On the number of ordinary lines determined by n points was again of major significance.
* We note in passing that Moser published a joint paper with Peter Borwein in 1990 A survey of Sylvester's problem and its generalizations  which looks at developments.
* In 1959 Moser returned to the University of Manitoba, where he had studied as an undergraduate, being appointed an Associate Professor.
* In order to promote his specialty, Moser became involved in the teaching of high school mathematics teachers, making films about geometry, organizing mathematical competitions and collecting and disseminating competition problems.
* Moser published a fine collection of combinatorics papers jointly with Morton Abramson: A note on combinations (1966); Combinations, successions and the n-kings problem (1966); Permutations without rising or falling w-sequences (1967); Enumeration of combinations with restricted differences and cospan (1969); Generalizations of Terquem's problem (1969); The problem of the second seating and generalizations (1972); Arrays with fixed row and column sums (1973); and Linear and ring arrangements (1976).
* Finally we must say something about Moser's remarkable contributions in publishing surveys of problems in discrete geometry in both books and articles.
* In 1989 the First Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry was held in Montreal and Moser presided over the two problem sessions publishing Problems, problems, problems  in the conference proceedings.
* This interest in problems in discrete geometry culminated in 2005 with the publication of a 500 page book Research problems in discrete geometry published jointly by Moser, Peter Brass and János Pach.
* Colin Campbell, who has been our colleague at St Andrews for forty years, studied for a Master's Degree at McGill University under Moser's supervision during 1964-65.
* It gave me an opportunity to visit the Guthrie theatre in Minneapolis, encouraged by Moser who is a great enthusiast for the theatre.
* A few years later Moser supervised a second Master's student with the name of Campbell, namely Harvey A Campbell, on a similar topic.
* In March 2003 Moser was interviewed by Siobhan Roberts who was working on her major work on Coxeter King of Infinite space.
* Moser's opportunity came at the end of Coxeter's 1955 summer of roving lectures, after his session in Stillwater, at Oklahoma State University.
* Moser drove down to meet Coxeter and serve as his assistant, taking detailed notes of the well-polished lectures.
* "At the end of the summer we drove north, to civilisation," said Moser wryly.
* We end this biography of Willy Moser by quoting his words from his address to the Canadian Mathematical Society at the time he received its Distinguished Service Award in 2003.

Born 5 September 1927, Winnipeg, Canada. Died 28 January 2009, Montreal, Canada.
