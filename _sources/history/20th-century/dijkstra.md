**Edsger Wybe Dijkstra** was a Dutch mathematician and computer scientist best known for his shortest-path algorithm in graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Won the 1972 A.M. Turing Award for his contributions to the foundations of computer science and engineering.
2. Formulated the concept of Self-stabilizing systems, making significant advancement in distributed computer systems.
3. Developed the Dijkstra-Scholten algorithm for recognizing termination of a distributed process.
4. Developed efficient algorithms for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph.
5. Formulated the concept of Structured Programming, a revolutionary approach to programming.
6. Developed the Shunting-yard algorithm to parse mathematical expressions.
7. Coined the term "GOTO-less programming".
8. Published the first algorithm for Deadlock Detection.
9. Published foundational works on computer algorithms and data structures, such as the Dijkstra algorithm and the Dijkstraâ€“Prim algorithm. 
10. Demonstrated that the halting problem forproposition logic is decidable.

Born 11 May1930, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Died 6 August 2002, Nuenen, The Netherlands.
