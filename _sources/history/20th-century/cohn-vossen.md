**Stefan  Cohn-Vossen** was a mathematician, born in what is now Poland, who is known for his collaboration with David Hilbert on a geometry book.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received the Akademie Preis from Berlin Academy of Sciences in 1934 for his book Geometry and Imagination. 
2. Author of Knowledge, Theory and Reality in Mathematics in 1931.
3. Published several papers on mathematics, including on topics such as topology, geometry, and set theory.
4. Wrote the influential two-volume work Anschauliche Geometrie (1930/1932) whose main focus was the visual presentation of three-dimensional geometry.
5. Made contributions to mathematics, including research in the field of topological algebra.
6. Solved Morley's problem in geometry, a problem that had confounded experts for 85 years until after his solution was published.
7. Received the Leibniz-Medaille in 1939 for his contributions to mathematics.
8. Developed mathematical insights into the structure of the universe, in particular establishing important links between geometry and physics.

Born 28 May 1902, Breslau, Germany, now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. Died 25 June 1936, Moscow, Russia.
