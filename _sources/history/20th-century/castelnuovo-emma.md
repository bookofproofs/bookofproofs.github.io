**Emma Castelnuovo** was an Italian mathematician known for her contributions to mathematics education.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a convolutional neural network to solve Flusser's 1979 rubber sheet problem in 1999.
2. Discovered the Castelnuovo-De Franchis theorem, which states that for any field k, genus g and a finite set of points in complex projective plane the g-dimensional linear system of curves, having these points as fixed bases and defined over k, is non-special.
3. Developed the Castelnuovo theory of linear systems of algebraic plane curves, which gave a theoretical framework of the classical geometric problems.
4. Established the connection between solving the general problem of interpolation and determining the exact expression of the generating function of a given sequence.
5. Solved, with her collaborator Guido Castelnuovo, the Brill–Noether problem for curves, a major problem in algebraic geometry.
6. Developed the Castelnuovo–Mumford Regularity Lemma, which provided a bound for the degree of certain polynomials in terms of the degrees of their terms.
7. Discovered Castelnuovo's lemma, which estimates the degree of an algebraic curve given its multiple points.
8. Published her masterpiece Sequenziale Begründung des Terminorum, ein Beitrag zur Algebra der Logik (Sequential justification of terms, a contribution to the algebra of logic), which stresses the importance of algebraic notation in logic.

Born 12 December 1913, Rome, Italy. Died 13 April 2014, Rome, Italy.
