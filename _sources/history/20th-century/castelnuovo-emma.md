**Emma Castelnuovo** was an Italian mathematician known for her contributions to mathematics education.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* This award was named after Emma Castelnuovo.
* Emma's father Guido Castelnuovo and her uncle Federigo Enriques, the brother of her mother Elbina, were prominent researchers in this field, both full professors in university.
* Emma graduated in mathematics at the University of Rome in 1936.
* Just after the Second World War, Emma with a university professor and a young colleague organized a successful series of talks held by mathematicians, physicists, philosophers, and educators.
* Already at the beginning of her career Emma was looking for a way of teaching aimed at actively involving students.
* In Emma's interpretation of Clairaut's project the winning ideas are: intuition, real problems, and history.
* Some decades later Emma succeeded to have the elements of probability in the new Italian programmes for middle school launched in the 1970s.
* Emma's new way of teaching geometry is based on the use of concrete materials, on looking at objects, discovering geometric properties, and in manipulating changing figures.
* Since 1949 Emma was in contact with teachers of the École Decroly, where Paul Libois (1906-1991) used concrete materials.
* On many occasions Emma refers to Enriques's view on the importance of the history of mathematics in building knowledge and claims to apply that view in her teaching.
* This was the case of Emma who was asked by Gattegno to join CIEAEM (Commission Internationale pour l'Étude et l'Amélioration de l'Enseignement des Mathématiques - International Commission for the Study and Improvement of Mathematics Teaching).
* Emma was president of CIEAEM from 1979 to 1981.
* Emma was one of the two representatives of Italy and took an active part in the discussion about modern mathematics.
* When Freudenthal succeeded in achieving the two goals of founding a new journal and having a conference dedicated to mathematics education, Emma was an active participant in both events.
* Emma was a very special teacher for many reasons.
* Emma's contributions to mathematics education was not only directed to students, but also to her colleagues, especially young colleagues.
* Emma had cultural influences, for example, her father and Enriques for mathematics education, Jean-Ovide Decroly (1871-1932), Maria Montessori (1870-1952) and Jean Piaget for general pedagogical issues.

Born 12 December 1913, Rome, Italy. Died 13 April 2014, Rome, Italy.
