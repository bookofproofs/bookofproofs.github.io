2. Authored Multiple books on optimization theory and design algorithms.
3. Developed Vajda's theorem, a major advance in the theory of optimization.
4. Refined the cyclic pursuit method in the context of optimal control theory.
5. Ideated the analytic perturbation technique for nonlinear systems.
6. Developed the multidimensional target adaptation algorithm for dynamical systems.
7. Contributed to the general theory of vectors and linear spaces in control systems.
8. Pioneered the use of apportionment algorithms in control systems.
9. Discovered novel methods to solve the partial differential equations associated with optimal control design.
10. Formulated the concept of the Lyapunov spectrum to analyze dynamical systems.
