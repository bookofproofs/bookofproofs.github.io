**Grigori Margulis** is a Russian-born American mathematician known for his work on lattices in Lie groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a complete proof of the Oppenheim Conjecture in 1979
2. Also developed the superrigidity theorem which examines how groups of symmetries interact with each other
3. Proved the Oppenheim Conjecture in 1983, showing that a positively curved manifold is homogeneous if it admits a Lie group action with finitely many isotropy subgroups
4. Made a defining contribution to the proofs of the general case of Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem and the ergodic theorem
5. Pioneered the use of ergodic theory and dynamical systems theory in the study of problems in number theory
6. Resolved the Gauss-Bonnet conjecture in dimension three
7. Developed the Margulis lemma and Margulis normal subgroup technique, which has been fundamental in the study of ergodic theory and discrete subgroups
8. Received the Fields Medal for his contributions to dynamical systems and hyperbolic geometry in 1978.

Born 24 February 1946, Moscow, Russia.
