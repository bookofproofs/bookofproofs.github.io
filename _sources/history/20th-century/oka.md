**Kiyoshi Oka** was a Japanese mathematician who worked in the theory of several complex variables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He discovered the Newton diagram, a method for visualizing different sets of points and lines.
2. He developed a new approach to linear programming by introducing the notion of a simplex figure.
3. He formulated the basis theorem for the description of convex sets in Euclidean space.
4. He established the fundamental principle of convex functions in multivariable calculus.
5. He produced an arithmetic-geometric mean inequality for multiple variables, now known as Oka’s inequality. 
6. He extended the Minkowski theorem, which establishes the infinitely transcendental values of certain polynomial equations.
7. He proved the Perron–Frobenius theorem, which deals with the existence of the positive eigenvalue of a matrix.
8. He was the first to introduce the notion of a stiffness matrix into analysis.
9. He developed the Oka-Lodge formula, a method for estimating cost structures in linear programming problems. 
10. He introduced the notion of a convex cone, a widely used tool in optimization theory and linear algebra.

Born 19 April 1901, Osaka, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. Died 1 March 1978, Nara, Japan.
