**Kiyoshi Oka** was a Japanese mathematician who worked in the theory of several complex variables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In fact 1929 was a very significant year for Oka for in that year he took sabbatical leave and went to the University of Paris.
* Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University.
* In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940.
* After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama.
* Oka was appointed professor at the Nara University for Women in 1949, a post he held until 1964.
* By giving a list of the open problems in the area, this work played an important role in deciding the direction of Oka's research.
* This is why, even today, it is worth collecting his work as a tribute to its creator, Kiyoshi Oka.
* Oka was also interested in Japanese poetry and Zen philosophy.
* Oka received a number of important honours.
