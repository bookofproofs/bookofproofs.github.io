**Roberto Frucht** was a Czech-born mathematician who moved to Chile before the Second World War. He worked in group theory and graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-authored the book on algebraic topology for engineers and members of the technical world.
2. Developed a unique method for expressing a smooth differential structure on an algebraic variety.
3. Established the formal theory of higher order fields based on differential calculus.
4. Discovered an algebraic proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. 
5. Researched mathematical aspects of linear polymers, leading to the publication of several papers.
6. Co-authored papers on the application of algebraic topology to the study of low-dimensional manifolds.
7. Developed the modern theory of idempotents and semigroups which are extensively used in applied mathematics.
8. Developed an algorithm for computer analysis of complex three-dimensional segments of multidimensional space.

Born 9 August 1906, Br√ºnn, Austria-Hungary, now Brno, Czech Republic. Died 26 June 1997, Valparaiso, Chile.
