**Wendelin Werner** is a German-born French mathematician known for his work on random processes. He was awarded a Fields Medal in 2006

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Fields Medal in 2006 for providing a new perspective on the geometry and structure of fractals, becoming the first French person to win the award.
2. Showed that the critical percolation dimension is equal to its expected value, ending a 20 year-old mathematical mystery.
3. Developed stochastic Loewner evolutions theory, a new area of research in probability theory.
4. He has written and published numerous papers in fields such as algebra, analysis, probability and differential geometry.
5. Jointly founded the European mathematical society in 1990.
6. He also teaches courses on probability theory and stochastic analysis at ETH Zürich.
7. Included in the Royal Society's list of world renowned scientists in 2013.
8. Awarded the Cantor medal of the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung in 2011 and the Fermat Prize in 2014.

Born 23 September 1968, Cologne, Germany.
