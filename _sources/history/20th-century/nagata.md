**Masayoshi Nagata** was a Japanese mathematician who worked in the field of commutative algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Sarbadhikari-Nagata theorem relating to unique factorization in commutative rings. 
2. Established the Kuroda-Nagata theorem concerning the structure of certain local rings. 
3. Introduced a point-counting function to use in number theory.
4. Developed a new method to study the connections between whole numbers.
5. Discovered how certain types of polynomials can be transformed into linear equations. 
6. Found a way to use the semigroup concept in the field of abelian varieties. 
7. Developed the Nagata-Higman theorem related to the maximum intersection of subgroups in a finite group. 
8. Constructed a new formulation for the Jacobian Conjecture.

Born 9 February 1927, Obu, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. Died 27 August 2008, Kyoto, Japan.
