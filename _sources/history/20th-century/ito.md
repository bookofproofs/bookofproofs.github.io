**Kiyosi Ito** was a Japanese mathematician who pioneered the theory of stochastic integration and stochastic differential equations. He won the Gauss prize in 2006.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He helped construct the theoretical framework for the study of population dynamics and studied the effects of pollution on marine life.
2. He developed the Ito calculus, a concept in stochastic calculus, which provides a mathematical foundation for stochastic differential equations. 
3. He created the Ito integral, which provided a way to tackle difficult problems using the theory of random processes. 
4. He collaborated with colleagues to develop the Markov models of population genetics, which describe the evolution of populations over time. 
5. He published numerous books and papers on probability theory and its applications.
6. His work also extended to wavelet analysis and bioinformatics. 
7. He was awarded the Japan Academy Prize in 1983 and the Kyoto Prize in 1991.

Born 7 September 1915, Hokusei-cho (now Inabe, Mie Prefecture), Japan. Died 10 November 2008, Kyoto, Japan.
