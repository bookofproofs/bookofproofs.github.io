**Laila Soueif** is an Egyptian mathematician who became a professor of mathematics at Cairo University. She is an activist for human rights and has been involved in many demonstrations including calling for academic freedom at Cairo University.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In fact Mustafa Soueif translated the writings of Sigmund Freud into Arabic.
* The mood of those around Soueif changed with everyone talking of the disaster for the country.
* When Soueif was studying at the high school she would walk past Cairo University and see student sit-ins and banners of protest.
* Soueif graduated from the high school in 1973 and, in the autumn of that year, she began to study mathematics at the University of Cairo.
* Soueif worked with the group but did not join them, she was too intent on her mathematical studies.
* In 1977, after Soueif graduated, she was appointed as a tutor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Cairo where she began working towards a Master's Degree in algebra.
* Out on bail until Mubarak approved the sentence, he met up with Soueif who, on hearing of his sentence, had rushed back to Cairo.
* Soueif returned to Poitiers and continued to undertake research for her Ph.D. advised by Annie Page.
* Soueif published the paper Normalizing extensions and injective modules, essentially bounded normalizing extensions (1987).
* Soueif was appointed to a tenured professorship in mathematics at Cairo University.
* For her part, and even while retaining her mathematics professorship at Cairo University, Laila had gained a reputation as one of Cairo's most indefatigable "street" leaders, the veteran of countless protest marches against the government.
* From demonstrations calling for academic freedom at Cairo University to the earliest manifestations of the Kifaya movement to the uprising of 2011 and beyond, Soueif is a curiously iconic figure.
* Laila Soueif is someone who is driven by her complete commitment to social justice.
