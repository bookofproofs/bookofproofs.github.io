**Laila Soueif** is an Egyptian mathematician who became a professor of mathematics at Cairo University. She is an activist for human rights and has been involved in many demonstrations including calling for academic freedom at Cairo University.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In fact Mustafa Soueif translated the writings of Sigmund Freud into Arabic.
* Laila had an older sister Ahdaf (born 23 March 1950) who became a well-known novelist.
* Laila was born in London, England, since her mother was studying for a Ph.D. at the University of London.
* Her parents had been politically active when they were young and they instilled in Soueif a strong belief in justice.
* The mood of those around Soueif changed with everyone talking of the disaster for the country.
* When Soueif was studying at the high school she would walk past Cairo University and see student sit-ins and banners of protest.
* He would later become Soueif's husband but, at this time, they had not met.
* Soueif graduated from the high school in 1973 and, in the autumn of that year, she began to study mathematics at the University of Cairo.
* Soueif worked with the group but did not join them, she was too intent on her mathematical studies.
* In 1977, after Soueif graduated, she was appointed as a tutor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Cairo where she began working towards a Master's Degree in algebra.
* Many, including Soueif and her husband, considered this to be an act of betrayal putting Egypt at odds with the rest of the Arab world.
* The first of their children, Alaa (named after Soueif's brother) was born 18 November 1981.
* Soueif went to the University of Poitiers with her baby son Alaa and was assigned Annie Page as her thesis advisor.
* Having a child, however, was a help to Soueif.
* Ahmed Seif, Soueif's husband, was charged with possessing illegal weapons, he was arrested, tortured until he signed a confession, and in late 1984 sentenced to five years in prison.
* Out on bail until Mubarak approved the sentence, he met up with Soueif who, on hearing of his sentence, had rushed back to Cairo.
* Soueif had become pregnant during their time on the run, and their second child, a girl they named Mona, was born on 12 March 1986 in Cairo.
* Soueif returned to Poitiers and continued to undertake research for her Ph.D. advised by Annie Page.
* Soueif published the paper Normalizing extensions and injective modules, essentially bounded normalizing extensions (1987).
* Soueif was appointed to a tenured professorship in mathematics at Cairo University.
* Before her paper was published, Soueif's third child, Sanaa Seif, was born on 20 December 1993.
* For her part, and even while retaining her mathematics professorship at Cairo University, Laila had gained a reputation as one of Cairo's most indefatigable "street" leaders, the veteran of countless protest marches against the government.
* That note of black humour aside, under the rule of Sisi, matters were to play out very differently for Laila's son from the way they had in the past.
* Alaa was given a five year prison sentence, while Sanaa, Soueif's youngest daughter protesting her brother's treatment was arrested and charged with violating the "no protests" law.
* Soueif and her daughter Mona have both gone on lengthy hunger strikes in protest at Alaa's imprisonment.
* Ahmed Seif, Soueif's husband, died on 24 August 2014 following open heart surgery.
* From demonstrations calling for academic freedom at Cairo University to the earliest manifestations of the Kifaya movement to the uprising of 2011 and beyond, Soueif is a curiously iconic figure.
* Laila Soueif is someone who is driven by her complete commitment to social justice.

Born 1 May 1956, London, England.
