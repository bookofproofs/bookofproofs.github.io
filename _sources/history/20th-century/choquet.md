**Gustave Choquet** was a French mathematician who worked in functional analysis, potential theory, topology and measure theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed to the development of functional analysis, topology, and measure theory.
2. Developed the Choquet theorem, which states that the sum of a continuous set of convex functions can be represented as the integral of a convex function.
3. Developed the “capacity theory of integration”, a theory that is the basis for the study of measure and integration,
4. Published several papers on probability theory and set theory, including one on the structure of Borel sets in 1936.
5. Developed the concept of infinite divisibility and established various properties of probability distributions.  
6. Created the Choquet theory of integrals, which involves abstract measure spaces and non-additive integrals. 
7. Published a book on the theory of integration in 1950.
8. Showed the existence of a “weakly additive integral,” which led to a branch of measure theory known as Choquet integral.

Born 1 March 1915, Solesmes, near Valenciennes, Nord, France. Died 14 November 2006, Lyon, France.
