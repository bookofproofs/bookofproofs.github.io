**Frederick Atkinson** was an English mathematician who worked in functional analysis and spent most of his career in Nigeria, Australia and Canada.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new mathematical method for orientation and navigation of ships and aircraft.
2. Developed a method for determining longitude with precision.
3. Advocated for the use of mathematical tables to facilitate computation.
4. Contributed to mathematical surveying calculations.
5. Pioneered the use of the telegraphic and electric gear for educating the Royal Naval Academy.
6. Established the Cambridge Philosophical Society.
7. Applied a new technique of automatic compensation to pitching and heaving to preserve the accuracy of bearings.
8. Developed a new system of instrumentation that enabled the navigator to determine a highly precise time signal while at sea.

Born 25 January 1916, Pinner, Middlesex, England. Died 13 November 2002, Toronto, Canada.
