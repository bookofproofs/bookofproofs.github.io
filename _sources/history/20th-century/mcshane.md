**Edward J McShane** was an American mathematician noted for his work in the calculus of variations and integration theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After attending school in New Orleans, McShane entered Tulane University.
* After completing his first degrees (for he had two!), McShane continued to study at Tulane for his Master's degree in mathematics while teaching mathematics as an instructor.
* With the award of a Master's degree from Tulane in 1927, McShane went to the University of Chicago to undertake studies for his doctorate.
* McShane spent part of the following two years at Princeton, part at Ohio State, part at Harvard and part at Chicago.
* McShane and his wife spent the session 1932-33 at GÃ¶ttingen, but if 1932 was a bad year in the United States, 1933 was certainly a bad year in Germany with Hitler coming to power and bringing in his first anti-Jewish legislation.
* Having seen the frightening start of the Nazi rise to power, the McShane family returned to the United States where McShane spent the next two years at Princeton.
* In 1935 McShane was appointed to a professorship at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, where, except for temporary appointments elsewhere, he was to remain for the rest of his life.
* McShane had been asked to complete a questionnaire.
* McShane is famous for his work in the calculus of variations, Moore-Smith theory of limits, the theory of the integral, stochastic differential equations, and ballistics.
* In 1974, the year he retired and was made Professor Emeritus at Virginia, McShane published Stochastic calculus and stochastic models which again reflected his work on the mathematical setting for quantum mechanics.
* McShane was much involved with both the American Mathematical Society and with the Mathematical Association of America.

Born 10 May 1904, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. Died 1 June 1989, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.
