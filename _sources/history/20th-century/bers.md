**Lipman Bers** was a Latvian-born American mathematician who worked on  pseudoanalytic functions, Riemann surfaces and Kleinian groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed the "Bers Fiber Space", a topological space first described by Adolf Weinberger in 1955 which was a major contribution to the development of 3-manifolds theory.
2. He developed and refined the irreducible representations of noncompact groups and the corresponding survival equations, by using the Fourier integral operator and the theory of pseudo-differential operators.
3. He formulated the Gelfandâ€“Fuks theory, a powerful method for solving PDEs. 
4. He was part of the team which proved the existence of quasiconformal mappings on manifolds.
5. He proposed the theory of surface quasi-conformal mappings.
6. He proved the existence of quasiregular mappings.
7. He wrote the book  Theory of pseudo-uniform mappings. 
8. He discovered the Bers slice theorem in 1971, a breakthrough result in the field of low-dimensional topology.

Born 23 May 1914, Riga, Russia (now Latvia). Died 29 October 1993, New Rochelle, New York, USA.
