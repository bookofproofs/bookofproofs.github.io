**Aryeh Dvoretzky** was a Ukrainian-born Israeli mathematician who worked in functional analysis, statistics and probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of random matrices and its application to the study of quantum mechanics.
2. Developed the theory of random lacunary series and its applications to harmonic analysis.
3. Developed techniques and theorems in convex geometry which enabled many celebrated problems in the field to be solved.
4. Introduced the Erdős–Rényi model in combinatorics.
5. Was one of the first analysts to use the probabilistic method in investment problems, including his classical paper on the "covering problem".
6. Developed the Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz inequality, which measures the rate at which a test can discriminate between two hypotheses.
7. Co-developed the Dvoretzky–Kac–Sudakov inequality, which limits the radius of a sphere in a high-dimensional Euclidean space.
8. Was a major contributor to the field of the probabilistic analysis of algorithms, and established a number of results related to them.

Born 3 May1916, Khorol, Ukraine. Died 8 May2008, Jerusalem, Israel.
