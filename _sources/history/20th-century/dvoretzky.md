**Aryeh Dvoretzky** was a Ukrainian-born Israeli mathematician who worked in functional analysis, statistics and probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The principal of the school was Dr Arthur Biram who developed the school greatly during the years that Dvoretzky was a pupil.
* After graduating from the Hebrew Reali School, Dvoretzky entered the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
* This university, which opened in 1925, had only awarded its first degrees a few years before Dvoretzky began his studies there.
* Dvoretzky was awarded his Master's Degree by the Hebrew University in 1937 and continued to undertake research there for his doctorate advised by Fekete.
* After the award of his doctorate in 1941, Dvoretzky was appointed to the teaching staff of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
* Dvoretzky made many research visits abroad, mainly to the United States but also to the Collège de France.
* Let us now look briefly at Dvoretzky's mathematical contributions.
* His best known fundamental result in this field is the Dvoretzky theorem, which was related by Vitali Milman to Paul Lévy's measure concentration phenomena and served as a starting point to modern Banach space theory.
* At the same time, Dvoretzky was producing work on probability.
* Throughout the years, Dvoretzky cooperated with Erdős, Jacob Wolfowitz, Abraham Wald, Herbert Robbins and Y S Chow in producing elegant and fundamental work in probability theory.
* We should say a little more about the Dvoretzky theorem.
* In 1950 Dvoretzky published a joint paper with Ambrose Rogers entitled Absolute and Unconditional Convergence in Normed Linear Spaces.
* One such proof appeared in Grothendieck's 1956 paper Sur certaines classes de suites dans les espaces de Banach et le théorème de Dvoretzky-Rogers Ⓣ(On certain classes of sequences in Banach spaces and the Dvoretzky-Rogers theorem) which also contained a number of important conjectures.
* In 1959 Dvoretzky proved the conjecture by Grothendieck which today is known as Dvoretzky's theorem.
* Dvoretzky's theorem initiated an avalanche of work on finite-dimensional normed spaces, guided by the heuristic principle: "All convex bodies behave like ellipsoids, and ever more so as the dimension increases." This principle runs completely counter to one's initial experience.
* Later Dvoretzky wrote a number of single-author papers on Brownian motion including On the oscillation of the Brownian motion process (1963) and Polygons on two-dimensional Brownian paths (1986).
* Dvoretzky received many honours for his contributions.
* In 2009, the Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University established an annual lecture series in memory of Dvoretzky.

Born 3 May 1916, Khorol, Ukraine. Died 8 May 2008, Jerusalem, Israel.
