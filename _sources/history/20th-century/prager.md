**William Prager** was a German-born American applied mathematician who worked in the field of mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the field of Solid Mechanics and created the technique of Structural Mapping.
2. Formulated the Prager-Synge Weakening Criterion for defining the full range of time-dependent deformation behaviour in materials.
3. Developed a theory for predicting material behaviour under cyclic loading.
4. Established the Prager-Weingarten strain energy approach for accounting for the effects of plasticity on strength in metals.
5. Discovered the existence of the then-mysterious ‘Tearing Mode’ of fracture.
6. Proposed the ‘Prager-Lemaitre’ equation of motion, later used to describe and predict material behaviour in many applications. 
7. Pioneered computer-based simulation tools and methods for engineering analyses.
8. Developed and popularised numerous mathematical models for determining the strength and failure of materials under varying loading conditions.

Born 23 May 1903, Karlsruhe, Germany. Died 16 March 1980, Zürich, Switzerland.
