**John Stewart Bell** was an Irish mathematician who worked in quantum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theorem regarding the representation of a rotation in classical physics that became known as Bell’s theorem.
2. Discovered ways to incorporate thePauli exclusion principle into quantum mechanics, resulting in his "spin matrix" theory.
3. Pioneered the use of the semiclassical approximation method.
4. Extended Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and formulated concept of "spin-orbit coupling”.
5. Developed the concept of "non-locality”, which has since become a major topic in quantum physics.
6. Proposed the “Bell Inequality” which has since become a standard test of “locality” in quantum mechanic.
7. Made several discoveries in mathematics including two theorems in group theory.
8. Established the field of "quantum geometry” and did pioneering work on the mathematical aspects of relativity.

Born 28 July 1928, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Died 1 October 1990, Geneva, Switzerland.
