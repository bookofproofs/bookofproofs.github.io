**Cora Ratto de Sadosky** was a mathematician and political activist who taught at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina for ten years before a coup in Argentina forced her to resign. She spent her last years in exile in Spain.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Cora Ratto attended schools in Buenos Aires and, around 1932, she entered the Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales of the University of Buenos Aires.
* She became one of the leaders of the Argentine University Federation (the FUA, Federación Universitaria Argentina) which had been founded in 1918 with the aim of changing the university system so that teachers, graduates, and students would participate in the government of the universities.
* She felt strongly about discrimination against women in the exact sciences and this led to her becoming a leader of the student movement.
* During her undergraduate years the Chaco War was being fought between Bolivia and Paraguay from 1932 to 1935.
* This war was being fought for control of a region which was rich in oil and Cora Ratto felt that the war was being forced on her neighbours Bolivia and Paraguay by the United States and Great Britain; she strongly denounced the war.
* The mathematics staff in the University of Buenos Aires when Ratto was a student consisted of Julio Rey Pastor, the only paid professor, and Juan Carlos Vignaux, who held an honorary position.
* There were, however, a number of outstanding students of mathematics at that time.
* Manuel Sadosky was in the same class as Ratto and Yanny Frankel was also a student.
* Cora immediately invited him to play at her home and, after a long argument, convinced Mischa to accept the offer.
* Cora and Manuel shared a long and happy marriage.
* Ratto de Sadosky participated in this Anti-war Association playing an active part in collecting food and organising events with speakers against the war.
* The rise of the Nazis in Germany was also something that Ratto de Sadosky strongly opposed and after Germany invaded Russia in 1941, she together with Maria Rosa Oliver created La junta de la Victoria, a women's organisation aimed at defending democracy and supporting the allied effort against the Nazis.
* Ratto de Sadosky and other members of the Victory Union collected money, clothing and food to send to the troops.
* La junta de la Victoria was highly successful with around 45,000 members by 1943.
* Ratto de Sadosky served as General Secretary and was one of the delegates of La junta de la Victoria at the First International Congress of Women in Paris at the end of 1945.
* In this role she played a part in founding the International Democratic Federation of Women.
* In December 1945, as one of two representatives of her organisation, Cora was a founding member of the International Women's Union at its first meeting in Paris.
* Juan Perón had been elected president of Argentina in 1946 and in 1949 introduced Constitutional Reforms.
* These were not supported by all and were opposed by the Radicals who declared the Peronists did not have the required majority to make constitutional changes.
* In 1955 Perón began to lose the support of the military and, after a failed coup in June 1955, another in September 1955 succeeded and Perón fled to exile in Spain.
* Ratto de Sadosky was able to restart her doctoral studies at the University of Buenos Aires advised by Mischa Cotlar.
* She was awarded a doctorate in 1959 for her thesis Condiciones de continuidad de operadores potenciales generalizados, con métrica hiperbólica Ⓣ(Continuity conditions of generalized potential operators, with hyperbolic metric).
* While she did not complain about having a harder time in her profession for being a woman, she was acutely aware that this was the case.) During her decade at the university, Cora initiated and edited a celebrated series of research publications (the first volume, 'Mathematics and Quantum Physics', was written by Laurent Schwartz, Fields Medal, 1950, the third, 'Singular integrals and Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations', by the Argentinean-born mathematician Alberto Calderón, National Medal of Science, 1991); this series became an important resource for library interchanges.
* Cora was most remarkable as a teacher.
* She devoted a part of her immense energy to teaching the first courses in calculus and algebra.
* Ratto de Sadosky taught calculus and algebra, and she taught first year classes on mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
* Together with Manuel Sadosky, she designed a teaching system that allowed her to provide personalised education to her students whom she inspired with her own passion and mathematical approach.
* A course employing this book as text should be able to both initiate the student to the concepts and techniques of algebra and prepare him for graduate-level work.
* The plan of the book is as follows: an introduction (discussing the various number systems), algebraic structures (relations and operations, propositional algebra, groups, rings, fields, polynomials), and linear algebra (vector spaces, matrices and linear transformations, linear and p-linear forms, determinants, systems of linear equations, inner products, and eigenvalues - all over the reals).
* There are many examples, carefully presented; while there are relatively few exercises, many of the simple verifications are left to the student.
* For this reader, strong points include a careful treatment of the various "relations and operations", construction of the splitting field of a polynomial, and the presentation of determinants (as p-linear alternating forms (after a discussion of the conventional determinants of orders two and three).
* There were two other achievement by Ratto de Sadosky made during her ten years at the University of Buenos Aires which we should mention.
* The academic achievement was setting up in 1957, in collaboration with Mischa Cotlar, the Fundación Alberto Einstein, with the aim to assist the study of talented young people who were lacking in financial resources by providing scholarships.
* It also provided mentoring for these young people.
* This was edited by Mischa Cotlar, Cora Ratto de Sadosky and the architect Francisco Bullrich.
* Production of the magazine Columna 10 ended with the ninth issue in May 1966 when an Argentinian coup made continuing impossible.
* Arturo Illia had become President of Argentina following elections in June 1963.
* He tried to split the Perónists, who controlled the unions, from their exiled leader Perón.
* The Perónists reacted by supporting a coup against President Arturo Illia in June 1966 and General Juan Carlos Onganía, the commander in chief of the army, took control of the country.
* Manuel Sadosky and Cora Ratto de Sadosky were at a Board of Directors meeting on the night of 29 July when the police arrived at the Faculty and began to attack and arrest teachers, graduates and students on what became known as the 'Night of the Long Batons'.
* From this time on, Ratto de Sadosky concentrated her efforts on trying to publicise the human rights abuses which the military regime was perpetrating.
* Many academics left the country immediately after the coup of 1966 but Manuel Sadosky and Cora Ratto de Sadosky spent several years living part of the time in Buenos Aires and part in Montevideo.
* In 1973 Juan Perón returned to Argentina and became President again on 12 October 1973.

Born 3 January 1912, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Died 2 January 1981, Barcelona, Spain.
