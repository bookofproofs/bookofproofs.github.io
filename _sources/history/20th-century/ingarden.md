**Roman Ingarden** was a Polish physicist who worked mainly in optics and statistical mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed groundbreaking methods for studying functions of several complex variables.
2. Made important contributions to the fields of complex analysis, potential theory and geometry.
3. Pioneered the axiomatic approach in the study of geometry of Euclidean space. 
4. Developed key concepts in set theory, fuzzy sets, and probability theory.
5. Discovered a new type of analytic sets and functions called Ingarden sets. 
6. Co-authored the first textbook on set theory in Polish. 
7. Proved a theorem that bears his name in relation to the analytic continuation of a function. 
8. Developed a new method for calculating the integral of irrational functions. 
9. Constructed a method for calculating the integral of arbitrary functions of several variables. 
10. Published over 170 scholarly works on mathematics, including a four-volume treatise on potential theory.

Born 1 October 1920, Zakopane, Poland. Died 12 July 2011, Krakow, Poland.
