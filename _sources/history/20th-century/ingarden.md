**Roman Ingarden** was a Polish physicist who worked mainly in optics and statistical mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Roman Witold Ingarden studied philosophy and mathematics in Lemberg (now Lviv in Ukrain) and Göttingen, and received a doctorate in 1918 with Edmund Husserl as his advisor.
* Although he had begun teaching at the University of Lviv in 1928, Schauder had continued with his position as a secondary school teacher which greatly benefitted the young Ingarden.
* Ingarden studied for six years at the Third National Gymnasium, then spent the years 1936-38 at the National Gymnasium.
* Ingarden continued his studies for a while but soon things changed again for, on 22 June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union.
* An underground Polish university operated in Lviv and Ingarden attended lectures there as well as working at the Jan Bujak optical factory in Lviv.
* Ingarden left Lviv and went to Gliwice in Poland where the Polish professors from Lviv Polytechnic who had been forced to leave Lviv, founded the Silesian University of Technology.
* Ingarden was appointed as an assistant in the Department of Physics in 1944 but, in addition, he was able to continue his studies at the Jagiellonian University in Kracow.
* Ingarden did not remain for long at the Silesian University of Technology for, on 20 August 1945, he moved to the Department of Theoretical Physics, University of Wrocław, where he was appointed as an assistant.
* Ingarden obtained a Master's degree from the Jagiellonian University in Kracow in 1946 and then worked for his doctorate supervised by Rubinowicz.
* Ingarden discussed with Aleksander Jablonski, the founder of physics research at the Nicholaus Copernicus University at Toruń, a possible move to the Nicolaus Copernicus University.
* At the Nicholas Copernicus University, Ingarden was director of the Institute of Physics (1969-1986), held the Chair of Thermodynamics and the Theory of Radiation (1966-1969) and the Chair of Theoretical Physics (1969-1986).
* In 1970 Ingarden founded the journal Reports on Mathematical Physics.
* We must mention Ingarden's fascination with Japan and all things Japanese.
* At that time Professor Ingarden was the leading researcher in the fields of quantum information and Finsler geometry.
* Since then Professor Ingarden visited Tokyo University of Science several times and we had the opportunity to discuss problems of mutual scientific interest.
* It should be mentioned that Professor Ingarden has very broad scientific interests beyond physics itself, including psychology, biology and even philosophy.
* Under the leadership of Professor Ingarden, many outstanding researchers, specializing in mathematical physics and quantum information started their careers in Toruń.
* Ingarden was honoured with the award of an honorary doctorate from the Nicolaus Copernicus University of Toruń in 1995.
* His son, Krzysztof Ingarden, was born in Wrocław in 1957 and studied at Kraków and also in Japan.

Born 1 October 1920, Zakopane, Poland. Died 12 July 2011, Krakow, Poland.
