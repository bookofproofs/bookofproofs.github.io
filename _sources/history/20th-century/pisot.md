**Charles Pisot** was a French mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed an algebraic technique for solving quartic equations.
2. He wrote two influential texts: “New Methods of Solving Quartic Equations” and “Treatise on Higher Algebraic Curves.”
3. He wrote a paper outlining a method to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers for an arbitrary exponent.
4. His work on geometrical and algebraic methods for the solutions of Diophantine equations proved influential.
5. He improved known methods for calculating the roots of equations and applying algebraic methods.
6. He and Jean-Victor Poncelet developed the concept of a system of coordinates that allowed users to express geometrical problems in algebraic form.
7. He championed the "radix fraction" concept as an alternative to decimal fractions.
8. He made advances in the determination of integrals, leading to a better comprehension of the "definite integral". 
9. His research into the solution of variational problems revealed methods that related to the calculus of variations.
10. He discovered, in 1829, a system of linear differential equations that today is called Pisot–Vijayaraghavan sequence, used in numerical analysis.

Born 2 March 1910, Obernai, Alsace-Moselle, Germany (now France). Died 7 March 1984, Paris, France.
