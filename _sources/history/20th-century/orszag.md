**Steven Orszag** was an American mathematician who specialised in the areas of computational fluid dynamics, turbulence theory and numerical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The family were Jewish and originally from Hungary with Steven's paternal grandparents Alex and Regina Orszag both being born in Hungary.
* Joseph married Rose (born 26 July 1909) and their son Steven was born in Manhattan.
* When he took the examination, Orszag was still at Forest Hills High School but the other eight winners were all much older and university undergraduates.
* His thesis advisor was Martin David Kruskal who was Professor of Astronomy at Princeton but, when Orszag began his graduate studies, Kruskal was also a member of Project Matterhorn, which today is known as the Princeton Plasma Physics laboratory.
* Orszag completed his doctoral thesis Theory of Turbulence within three years and was awarded a Ph.D. in 1966.
* Orszag, in collaboration with his thesis advisor, published a paper in 1966 with the same title as his thesis.
* Steven and Reba were married on 21 June 1964; they had three sons J Michael Orszag, Peter Richard Orszag and Jonathan Marc Orszag.
* Peter Orszag became an economist and served as an advisor to President Clinton, then as budget director for President Obama.
* In 1967 Orszag was appointed as a professor of applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
* In the 1977 SIAM monograph 'Numerical Analysis of Spectral Methods: Theory and Applications', Gottlieb and Orszag presented the first unified description of the field, with an emphasis on numerical analysis and algorithmic considerations.
* In addition to these books, Orszag was an editor of a number of books: (editor with K Kuwahara and Raul Mendez) Supercomputers and Fluid Dynamics (1986); (editor with Raul H Mendez) Japanese Supercomputing: Architecture, Algorithms, and Applications (1988); and (editor with Boris Galperin) Large Eddy Simulation of Complex Engineering and Geophysical Flows (1993).
* Orszag published over 400 papers in his career as well as making six successful patent applications.

Born 27 February 1943, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA. Died 1 May 2011, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.
