**Steven Orszag** was an American mathematician who specialised in the areas of computational fluid dynamics, turbulence theory and numerical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed mathematical and statistical models to study macroeconomics, public finance, and labor markets.
2. Founded the field of government-wide budget forecasting, providing detailed annual reports to Congress that incorporated both macroeconomic and microeconomic considerations.
3. Established the Office of Management and Budget's workforce and found the concept of the "CPI Index", both of which are used to control inflation and understand economic cycles.
4. Authored two books on mathematical economics: The Theory of Economic Policy and International Trade Policy.
5. Pioneered the concept of "sub-sectoral modeling", an approach used to evaluate industries and sectors separately.
6. Advocated for the use of optimization techniques in policy making, which seek to maximize a given set of goals.
7. Helped develop the microsimulation models for evaluating government policy and health reform.
8. Published numerous articles in prominent economic journals such as the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity and the Journal of Monetary Economics.

Born 27 February 1943, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA. Died 1 May2011, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.
