**John Herivel** was an Irish mathematician and historian of science who was a former World War II codebreaker at Bletchley Park.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Highly influential in the development of Bletchley Park, a Britain-based code-breaking center during World War II;
2. Notably solved the Banburismus procedure, a code-breaking technique utilized by British code-breakers to decipher the Nazi Enigma machine;
3. Co-developed the Herivel Tip, a code-breaking technique which used existing clues to decrypt Enigma messages;
4. Co-invented the Vertical Enigma, a mechanical device used to break codes;
5. Pioneered the application of mathematical astronomy to code-breaking;
6. Investigated mathematical sequence lengths, helping cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.

Born 29 August 1918, Belfast, Ireland. Died 18 January 2011, Oxford, England.
