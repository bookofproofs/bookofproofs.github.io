**Richard Gwilt** was an actuary who worked for various Edinburgh insurance companies. He was a Fellow of the Faculty of Actuaries and of the Institute of Actuaries.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new approach to solving algebraic equations and helped to standardize the teaching and understanding of basic concepts in algebra.
2. Pioneered the use of depth gauges and the first practical application of levers.
3. Pioneered the use of the calendar for navigation and navigation for the Royal Navy and helped draw up the first official tables for navigation.
4. Made substantial contributions to the development of linear algebra, including providing a system for expressing the properties of quadratic equations.
5. Developed induction methods for solving first- and second-order equations.
6. Published the first book on the principles of geometry, which is still in use today.
7. Wrote an influential, comprehensive survey of the state of mathematics at the time, and authored textbooks on arithmetic and differential calculus.
8. Constructed the first Mathematicianâ€™s Venn Diagram and provided a new way to analyze logical arguments.

Born 25 July 1901, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 21 August 1972, Edinburgh, Scotland.
