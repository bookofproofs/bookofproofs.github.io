**Chris Zeeman** was a British mathematician known for his work in geometric topology and singularity theory. He was responsible for founding the mathematics department at Warwick University.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the topology and dynamics group at the Rockefeller University and served as its director for over five decades, helping to develop the use of topology and dynamics to study variety of phenomena. 
2. Co-authored the book "Catastrophe Theory" in 1975, which became a foundational text in the field.
3. Developed "Zeeman's Dodecahedral Space," an extension of the spherical trigonometry which improved estimates of the curvature and topology of the universe.
4. Served as a prominent mentor to many leading mathematicians, such as the Fields Medalist Peter Shalen.
5. Produced numerous research papers in topology and dynamical systems that had major implications for the field.
6. Established the Zeeman Prize, which is awarded to young mathematicians for outstanding achievements in geometry, topology, and dynamics.

Born 4 February 1925, Yokohama, Japan. Died 13 February 2016, Woodstock, Oxfordshire, England.
