### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of coefficient of determination in interpreting the results of statistical tests.
2. Co-authored the treatise on correlation and regression Analysis with Harry C. Carver.
3. Developed the Youden Square, a graphical technique that aids in deciding between two statistical tests.
4. Established tables of the t-distribution, including the two extremes, the number of degrees of freedom, and the probability levels.
5. Pioneered the development of statistical sampling and quality control methods.
6. Developed analytics for estimating the precision, accuracy, and power of a statistical test.
7. Developed sampling designs for agricultural experiments.
