**Phillip Griffiths** is an American mathematician, known for his work in geometry and algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Phillip was an undergraduate at Wake Forest College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
* Donald Spencer became Griffiths' advisor partway through his first year of study.
* Griffiths was advised to read certain texts and papers which were to have a huge impact on the direction his mathematical research would take.
* After the award of his doctorate, Griffiths returned to Berkeley where he was Miller fellow at the University of California during the two years 1962-64.
* After nine years holding this chair, Griffiths was appointed as Director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
* Some of the author's most enduring results come from simple such calculations which show how different higher-dimensional variations of cycles or Hodge structures are, often referred to as Griffiths transversality.
* We mentioned above that Griffiths has written many books.
* Here is a list of most of them: (with Joseph Harris, a doctoral student of Griffiths who was awarded his Ph.D. in 1978) Topics in algebraic and analytic geometry (1974); Entire holomorphic mappings in one and several complex variables (1976); Principles of algebraic geometry (1978); An introduction to the theory of special divisors on algebraic curves (1980); (with John W Morgan) Rational homotopy theory and differential forms (1981); Exterior differential systems and the calculus of variations (1983); (with Gary R Jensen) Differential systems and isometric embeddings (1987); Introduction to algebraic curves (1989); and (with Mark Green, a doctoral student of Griffiths' who was awarded his Ph.D. in 1972) On the tangent space to the space of algebraic cycles on a smooth algebraic variety (2005).
* There are other important aspects of Griffiths' career which we must say a little more about.
* Griffiths has served, or still serves, as an editor for seven major journals: Advances in Function Theory; Annals of Math.
* Griffiths has received many more honours which we will have to omit through lack of space, but we should mention his role as Secretary of the International Mathematical Union from 1999 to 2006.

Born 18 October 1938, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.
