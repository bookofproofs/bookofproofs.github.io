**Phillip Griffiths** is an American mathematician, known for his work in geometry and algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the use of global analysis to study partial differential equations and connective manifolds.
2. Recognized as one of the founders of the modern theory of variations of Hodge structures.
3. Developed innovative methods in differential geometry, particularly in the theory of characteristic classes of manifolds.
4. Developed the theory of complex dynamics on algebraic varieties, which is a powerful connection between algebraic geometry and dynamical systems.
5. Analyzed the intersection theory of homology algebra and complex manifolds, including the concept of transversality and its connections to topology.
6. Earned the Leroy P. Steele Prize in 1996 for his lifetime achievements in mathematics.
7. Launched the Institute of Advanced Studies Pedagogy Project to improve mathematics instruction at the middle and high school level.
8. Established the Institute for Mathematics and Education at Harvard Graduate School of Education to prepare mathematics teachers.
9. Published numerous influential monographs, textbooks, and research articles on global analysis, complex dynamics, and geometry.
10. Became the President of the American Mathematical Society in 1985.

Born 18 October 1938, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.
