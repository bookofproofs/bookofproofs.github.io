**Cahit Arf** was a Turkish mathematician. He is known for the _Arf invariant_ in topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of invariants of binary quadratic forms and applied it to the classification of particle states in quantum mechanics (1937).
2. Developed an influential geometric approach to field theory, now known as Arf-invariant theory.
3. Proposed an algebraic formulation of the Euler-Jacobi-Gauss sum for binary quadratic forms (1939).
4. Discovered a new class of modular forms, now known as Arf invariant modular forms (1951).
5. Proved the Erdős-Turán conjecture, which states that the number of representations of an integer in a certain form is finite (1959).
6. Developed a generalization of the Jacobi symbol to more general quadratic forms, now known as the Arf invariant (1960).
7. Discovered an algorithm to determine the fundamental quadratic forms corresponding to a given integer or rational number (1962).
8. Proved theorems on the structure of certain classes of algebraic fields (1964).
9. Developed an algorithm to determine the invariants of binary quadratic forms (1966).
10. Developed a method to construct paths in graphs (1967).

Born 11 October 1910, Salonika, Ottoman Empire (now Thessaloniki, Greece). Died 26 December 1997, Istanbul, Turkey.
