**Wolfgang Gaschütz** was a German mathematician who worked on group theory, in particular in the theory of finite groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In the autumn of 1945 Gaschütz entered the University of Kiel (Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel).
* Gaschütz's interest in group theory, as explained in the quote above, was initiated by Andras Speiser's book Die Theorie der Gruppen endlicher Ordnung and stimulated by Helmut Wielandt's work.
* So algebraic life started again in Kiel, and Gaschütz succeeded - also by attracting other algebraists interested in group theory - to transform Kiel into a noted centre of this field.
* The important contribution to studying this problem is due to Gaschütz.
* Very early Gaschütz realized the importance of the Frattini subgroup for the structure theory of finite groups.
* In his paper Praefrattinigruppen Ⓣ(About Frattini groups) (1962) Gaschütz introduced subgroups in finite soluble groups which somehow take hold of the complications arising from Frattini properties.
* Gaschütz never followed modern trends much but rather his own scientific interests.
* As an example we mention Gaschütz's formation theory which has its origin in famous papers of Philip Hall and Roger Carter and has been spreading all over the world since 1963 when his brilliant article Zur Theorie der endlichen auflösbaren Gruppen Ⓣ(On the theory of finite resolvable groups) was published.
* Gaschütz produced a general method to construct saturated formations.
* In his Canberra Lecture Notes Lectures on subgroups of Sylow type in finite soluble groups (1979) Gaschütz gives a unified treatment of these theories.
* Further results of Gaschütz attracted much attention.
* Wolfgang Gaschütz was invited as a visiting professor to Michigan State University (1963), Queen Mary College of the University of London (1965, 1970), Universities of Padua, Florence, Naples (1966, 1971, 1974), University of Warwick (1967, 1973, 1977), University of Illinois at Chicago (1968), and the University of Canberra (1969).

Born 11 June 1920, Karlshof, Germany. Died 7 November 2016, Kiel, Germany.
