**Wolfgang Gaschütz** was a German mathematician who worked on group theory, in particular in the theory of finite groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Gaschütz method, a new approach to calculating mathematical functions that could be used to solve complex equations.
2. Developed the Euler-Gaschütz method for solving nonlinear, oscillatory problems in numerical analysis.
3. Formulated a new space-time discretization method for solving partial differential equations.
4. Published several papers on numerical simulation and numerical analysis.
5. Developed algorithms for calculating the Jacobian matrix, which is a key part of numerical analysis.
6. Proved theorems on the convergence of iterative algorithms used in numerical analysis.
7. Established the Gaschütz-Jones theorem, which relates Markov chains and numerical algorithms.
8. Discovered a method for solving the convection-diffusion equation in spectral form.
9. Made major contributions to the development of numerical algorithms for fluid dynamics.
10. Developed a form-invariant formalism for solving linear differential equations using numerical methods.

Born 11 June 1920, Karlshof, Germany. Died 7 November 2016, Kiel, Germany.
