**Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat** is a French mathematician and physicist who made important contributions to the general theory of relativity. She was the first woman to be elected to the French Academy of Sciences.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However, she is best known by the name Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat, that she has used since she married her second husband Gustave Choquet.
* For simplicity, we will use the name Yvonne Bruhat throughout this biography.
* Yvonne Bruhat was the daughter of Georges Bruhat (1887-1945) and Berthe Hubert (1892-1972).
* Georges Bruhat had been ranked first in the Concours d'agrégation in physics in 1909.
* Georges and Berthe Bruhat had two children, a daughter Yvonne (the subject of this biography) born in 1923 and a son François Bruhat (who also has a biography in this archive) born in 1929.
* In 1927, when Yvonne was under four years old, her father was appointed to the Faculty of Science in Paris so she was brought up in that city.
* Yvonne Bruhat undertook her secondary school education in Paris.
* Georges Bruhat had been appointed as deputy director of the École Normale Supérieure in 1935 and was appointed to the chair of physics there in 1941, the previous holder of the chair having lost his position through a decision of the Vichy government.
* In 1943 Yvonne Bruhat began her studies at the École Normale Supérieure de Jeunes Filles at Sèvres just outside Paris.
* The Gestapo took Mrs Bruhat and Mrs Baillou hostage, to exchange them for their husbands the next day; the cleaning woman, not realizing the implications, was complaining loudly about the ashes left in Apéry's room.
* Bruhat and Baillou were deported, and Bruhat perished at Buchenwald.
* Yvonne was in the middle of her studies when the tragedy happened.
* Berthe Bruhat, born Hubert, 1892-1972, who always encouraged me to try to understand some of the world and to pursue scientific research.
* Georges Bruhat's books include the four volume Cours de physique générale Ⓣ(A general physics course).
* Let us add at this point that Yvonne's mother, Berthe Hubert Bruhat, published Traite de pedagogie generale Ⓣ(Treatise on general education) in 1946.
* Yvonne Bruhat graduated from the École Normale Supérieure de Jeunes Filles in 1946 and undertook research advised by André Lichnerowicz.
* They were all published under the name Yvonne Fourès-Bruhat, since she had married the mathematician Léonce Guy Fourès who, like Bruhat, was undertaking research in Paris.
* Of very great significance is that Yvonne Bruhat's analysis enabled her to prove rigorously for the first time local-in-time existence and uniqueness of solutions of the Einstein equations.
* Bruhat spent part of the academic year 1951-1952 and the academic year 1952-53 in the United States, at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.
* Bruhat and her husband were soon back at Princeton spending part of the academic year 1955-56 at the Institute for Advanced Study.
* MathSciNet lists 241 publications by Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat (some of these are under the name Yvonne Fourès-Bruhat.
* Bruhat gave courses at the University of Paris to students taking the Master of Mathematics degree which prepared them for the practical use of distributions in the partial differential equations of theoretical physics.
* Bruhat and Cecile DeWitt-Morette produced a companion volume in 1989.
* We must mention two further important books which were single-author works by Bruhat.
* Bruhat had a daughter Michelle with her first husband, Léonce Fourès, and a son Daniel and a daughter Geneviève with her second husband Gustave Choquet.
* For her contributions to mathematical physics, Bruhat has received many honours.

Born 29 December 1923, Lille, France.
