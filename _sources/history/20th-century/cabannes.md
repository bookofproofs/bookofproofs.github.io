**Henri Cabannes** was a French mathematician who worked on the mechanics of fluids and vibrating ropes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Jean Cabannes specialised in optics and was trained in the laboratory of the physicist Charles Fabry (1867-1945) in Marseille.
* It was in Montpellier that Henri Cabannes began his schooling.
* Henri entered the École Polytechnique in 1941 while he was still a pupil in the special preparatory Mathematics class at the lycée Saint-Louis.
* Cabannes, being born in 1923, was not affected by this but, nevertheless, he decided to interrupt his studies at the École Normale Supérieure and try to reach England or North Africa.
* The war ended in May 1945 and by July Cabannes was back in France.
* Henri and Madeleine were both Roman Catholics and met at the Catholic youth gatherings.
* Cabannes's doctoral thesis was examined by Henri Villat, Joseph Pérès and Georges Valiron.
* In 1952 Cabannes was promoted to Professor of Rational Mechanics at the Faculty of Science in Marseille and in the following year he became a member of the council of the French Mathematical Society.
* Cabannes spent 9 months as a Visiting Professor at Laval University, Quebec, Canada during 1956-57.
* Henri was rather glad of that; he said, "Five is good." Madeleine was helped by a very nice girl living at their home, but her baby, the little Hélène and Jean-Paul did not let her be idle.
* We have details of what Cabannes taught since he published Cours de mécanique générale Ⓣ(General mechanics course) in 1962.
* In 1966 Cabannes published the collection of exercises Problèmes de mécanique générale Ⓣ(General mechanical problems) and in the same year published a second edition of Cours de mécanique générale Ⓣ(General mechanics course.).
* Cabannes was appointed as Professor of General Mechanics at the Pierre and Marie Curie University (Paris 6) in 1969.
* Cabannes made a second trip to the University of California at Berkeley in 1980 and delivered a set of lectures on the discrete Boltzmann equation as part of a graduate course in the Mechanical Engineering Department.
* Throughout his career, Cabannes received many honours.
* In 2002 Cabannes was interviewed by the Romanian "Magazin Istoric" and asked "At present, what do you recommend to young Europeans?".

Born 21 January 1923, Montpellier, Hérault, France. Died 30 May 2016, Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer, Var, France.
