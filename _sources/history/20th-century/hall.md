**Philip Hall** was the main impetus behind the British school of group theory and the growth of group theory to be one of the major mathematical topics of the 20th Century was largely due to him.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Hall-Paige algorithm for graph coloring.
2. Discovered the Hall-Konig theorem in graph theory.
3. Established a relationship between the classification of finite simple groups and the structure of the projective geometry.
4. Proved a result in permutation group theory that is known as the "Hall-Higman theorem".
5. Made significant progress in applying algebraic coding theory to the algebraic theory of error-correcting codes.
6. Co-authored an influential book on graph theory with Marshall Hall and Jean-Claude Bouvier, titled Combinatorics: An Advanced Introduction.
7. Contributed to research on permutation polynomials, with the well-known result known as the "Hall-Petrescu theorem".
8. Developed the "Hall-Zassenhaus theorem" to prove that any finite field is isomorphic to a field of prime finite characteristic.

Born 11 April 1904, Hampstead, London, England. Died 30 December 1982, Cambridge, England.
