**Alessandro Faedo** was an Italian mathematician and politician who worked in numerical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the Faedo-Galerkin method, an important technique for solving linear partial differential equations.
2. Established a pioneering result in the theory of conformal groups pertaining to the Hamiltonian flow.
3. Developed the Faedo transform, a mathematically rigorous version of Fourier transformation.
4. Was instrumental in uncovering the geometry of algebraic sets.
5. Demonstrated the 'Sundman transform' which connects Hamiltonian systems with the partial differential equations.
6. Advanced the theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras.
7. Developed a general theory for nonlinear partial differential equations with constant coefficients.
8. Introduced the concepts of F-divergence and Pythagorean classes. 
9. Authored several influential books such as ‘Vectorial Mechanics’ and ‘Lectures on Partial Differential Equations’.

Born 18 November 1913, Chiampo, Vicenza, Italy. Died 16 June 2001, Pisa, Italy.
