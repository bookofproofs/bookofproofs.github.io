**David Champernowne** was an English economist and mathematician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the von Neumann-Champernowne Constant, the first example of an irrational normal number.
2. Established the concept of computable numbers with Alan Turing.
3. Pioneered the concept of recursive functions.
4. Coined the term “computability” to describe the processes of computing mathematical functions and results.
5. Developed the theory of computable functions and distributions.
6. Developed algorithms for analysis based on grammatical considerations.
7. Proposed novel methods for the analysis of interrelationships between sets and classes.
8. Developed the borel hierarchy, an operational definition of sets based on the concept of open-boundedness.
9. Revolutionized the area of recursive function theory with his invention of the Turing Machine.

Born 9 July 1912, Oxford, England. Died 19 August 2000, Budleigh Salterton, Devon, England.
