**Claude Shannon** founded the subject of information theory and he proposed a linear schematic model of a communications system.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published arguably the most important paper in the history of modern mathematics: "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" (1948).
2. Developed information entropy, a cornerstone of modern information theory.
3. Proposed the use of Boolean algebra and switching circuits in the design of digital electronic circuits. 
4. Developed the concept of applying a probabilistic approach to language translation.
5. Developed the now widely-used Kalman filter, which is used for signal processing and prediction.
6. Coined the term "bit" for binary digit.
7. Developed the field of computational complexity and was one of the first to apply it to engineering problems.
8. Constructed the first device capable of solving complicated mathematical equations.

Born 30 April 1916, Gaylord, Michigan, USA. Died 24 February 2001, Medford, Massachusetts, USA.
