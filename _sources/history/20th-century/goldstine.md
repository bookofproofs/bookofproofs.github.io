**Herman Goldstine** was an American mathematician and computer scientist who  helped to develop ENIAC, an early electronic digital computer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first mathematical model of a computer, ENIAC, a general-purpose electronic digital computer. 
2. Co-authored the highly influential book, The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann with J. von Neumann in 1972. 
3. Created mathematical models for programming languages that formed the basis for later computer languages such as FORTRAN, Lisp and Algol. 
4. Developed the Goldstine-Gill Differential Analyzer, a mechanized tool for practical calculations involving differential equations. 
5. Devised algorithms for solving linear and nonlinear equations, the so-called Goldstine-von Neumann Iterative Procedure. 
6. Pioneered research in machine-oriented logic and speculations on artificial intelligence. 
7. Developed methodologies to run electronic computers and increased their capabilities of computer based training simulation.

Born 13 September 1913, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Died 16 June 2004, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, USA.
