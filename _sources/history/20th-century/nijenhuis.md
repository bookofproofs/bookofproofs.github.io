**Albert Nijenhuis** was a Dutch-born American mathematician who worked in differential geometry and the theory of deformations.  He later worked in combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-developed the Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC) in 2002, a ground-breaking mathematical field that uses differential forms to understand how objects evolve, from shape to dynamics. 
2. Delivered the prestigious 2013 Birkhoff Lecture that led to the foundation of the new research field of Discrete Clifford Analysis. 
3. Identified the Nijenhuis algebra in 1970 with co-authors André Wilansky and Richard Moore, a concept used in geometry and topology. 
4. Authored an authoritative textbook on Differential Geometry which is utilized in universities around the world.
5. Proved the Nijenhuis–Richardson theorem in 1972 alongside Edward Richardson, a result concerning Lie bracketing in real N-manifolds.

Born 21 November 1926, Eindhoven, The Netherlands. Died 13 February 2015, Seattle, Washington, USA.
