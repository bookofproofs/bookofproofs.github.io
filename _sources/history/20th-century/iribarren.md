**Gonzalo Pérez Iribarren** was a Uruguayan mathematician and statistician who was forced to spend ten years in exile during the right-wing dictatorship beginning in 1973. He returned to Uruguay in 1983 and was the main force in rebuilding the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics and setting up the Basic Sciences Development Programme.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He had an older brother Ricardo Pérez Iribarren who played a large role in Gonzalo Pérez's life and we shall say more about him later.
* Iribarren was interested in studying mathematics but this was only possible in the Faculty of Engineering which he entered.
* Iribarren was a seminarian in Rome and studied theology, Greek and Latin.
* Iribarren was deeply involved in these religious events but was never ordained as a priest.
* In the mid 1960s, Gonzalo Pérez Iribarren's brother, Ricardo Pérez Iribarren, was the Director of the Institute of Electrical Engineering of the Faculty of Engineering in Montevideo.
* Iribarren fled, with several other Uruguayan mathematicians, to the University of Buenos Aires where they were given work.
* Iribarren remained in Buenos Aires for a while using his mathematical skills to work for both public and private companies.
* Iribarren saw what was coming in December 1975 and left with his family eventually settling in Maracaibo, a city a northwest Venezuela.
* Iribarren's unusual route into teaching mathematics at university level meant that he had no degree.
* Iribarren returned with his wife and large family to Colonia in Uruguay in that year but with no regular employment, he made money giving private tuition.
* Perhaps Iribarren's greatest achievement was setting up the Basic Sciences Development Programme (PEDEClBA) sponsored by UNESCO.
* Iribarren died when only 61 years of age.

Born 26 June 1936, Carmelo, Uruguay. Died 27 August 1998, Montevideo, Uruguay.
