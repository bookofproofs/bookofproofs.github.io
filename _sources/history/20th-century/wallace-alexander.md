**Alexander Doniphan Wallace** was an American mathematician who worked in topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Wallace was a student at the University of Virginia and he was awarded a B.S. in 1935.
* Wallace spent the year 1940-41 as an Instructor in Mathematics and assistant to Lefschetz at Princeton, then was appointed as an Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
* This notion, subsequently developed by Spanier in his dissertation, is frequently referred to as Alexander-Wallace-Spanier-Kolmogorov cohomology.
* Wallace was invited to join the faculty at Tulane University as Professor and Head of the Department of Mathematics in 1947.
* In 1963 Wallace moved to the University of Florida at Gainesville.
* Sigmon wrote his thesis on Topological Means  with Wallace as advisor.
* This is typical of the care and effort that Wallace put into helping all the students in his department, those he supervised and those supervised by others.
* For all of those mathematicians having in the remotest sense been connected with topological semigroups, however, Alexander Doniphan Wallace will always be remembered as the great pioneer of this line of mathematical research.

Born 21 August 1905, Hampton, Virginia, USA. Died 16 October 1985, New Orleans, USA.
