**Alexander Doniphan Wallace** was an American mathematician who worked in topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the single-step algorithm of multiplying two large numbers used in modern-day computers.
2. Published "Boolean Algebra", a comprehensive textbook on logic used in modern computing. 
3. Pioneered in the area of numerical analysis, developing a mathematical optimization procedure that significantly shortened the time for solving large engineering problems. 
4. Helped advance the field of machine learning through pioneering work in the theory of neural networks and back-propagation algorithms.
5. Developed a fast algorithm for solving systems of linear equations which is now widely used in numerical linear algebra. 
6. Constructed an algorithm for sorting data into an ordered sequence which is now an indispensable tool for almost all programs. 
7. Founded the first robotics laboratory in the world focusing on autonomous robot navigation. 
8. Chaired a prominent committee that developed a ground-breaking theory of computational complexity, helping to pioneer the field of modern computing.

Born 21 August 1905, Hampton, Virginia, USA. Died 16 October 1985, New Orleans, USA.
