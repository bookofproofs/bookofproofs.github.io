**Maryam Mirzakhani** was an Iranian mathematician who worked in America and was the first woman to be awarded a Fields Medal. She worked in the geometry of Riemann surfaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. She became the first female to be awarded the Fields Medal in 2014 for her "outstanding contributions to the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces".
2. She held a doctorate in mathematics from Harvard University and was a professor at Stanford University. 
3. She was a leader in her field and published numerous papers in the areas of algebra and geometry, including four in the top-tier Journal of the American Mathematical Society and one in the very prestigious Annals of Mathematics.
4. One of her most recognized works was her 2013 Annals of Mathematics paper â€œGrowth in the Number of Simple Closed Geodesics on Surfaces", which demonstrated an unexpected relationship between dynamics and geometry in the space of surfaces. 
5. In 2009 she won first place in the International Math Olympiad at the age of 15, the youngest female to do so.

Born 12 May 1977, Tehran, Iran. Died 14 July 2017, California, USA.
