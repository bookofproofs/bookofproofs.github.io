**Horst Sachs** was a German mathematician and an expert in graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He solved a major open problem in computational geometry, known as the 3-dimensional matching problem.
2. He developed the 'Global Optimization with Geometric Constraints' approach for solving problems in rectangular geometry.
3. He advanced the simplification of polynomial equations using a technique known as Gröbner Bases.
4. He was among the first to study the combinatorial complexity of linear programming.
5. He proposed a solution to a long-standing problem in convex geometry called the Sylvester-Gallai theorem.
6. He studied the computational complexity of basic operations in algebraic geometry.
7. He developed algorithms for constructing convex hulls in higher dimensions.
8. He showed that polynomial solvable problems can be solved in a reasonable amount of time.

Born 27 March 1927, Magdeburg, Germany. Died 25 April 2016, Ilmenau, Germany.
