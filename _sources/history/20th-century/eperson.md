**Donald Eperson** was an English schooteacher and clergyman who produced works on recreational mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Joseph William Eperson died in 1966 in Devon, England.
* Donald had a sister Doreen and, as children growing up in the London suburbs, they had happy times playing croquet.
* From the preparatory school, Eperson entered selective independent St Paul's School, London, in 1916.
* Eperson graduated with a First Class degree from Oxford in 1927 and, in the same year, was appointed as a mathematics master at Sherborne School, Dorset, one of the best schools in England.
* Eperson had a number of pupils at Sherborne who would become famous, the best known being Alan Turing.
* However, Eperson deserves much credit for his ability to handle a pupil as talented yet unconventional as Turing.
* In fact, inspired by Eperson, Turing borrowed three books by Lewis Carroll from the School library in November 1930: The Game of Logic, Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass.
* In 1933 Eperson addressed the Annual General Meeting of the Mathematical Association, delivering his talk Lewis Carroll - mathematician.
* After he was ordained, Eperson acted as an assistant chaplain to Sherborne School in addition to his mathematics duties.
* In September 1939, Eperson married Phyllis M Perrett who had studied mathematics at Cambridge before being appointed to the Sherborne Girl's School.
* Eperson also produced works on places of interest such as The Church of St Mary, Charminster (1944).
* Bishop Otter College was a teacher training college, so Eperson was now having to show teachers how to teach mathematics.
* In 1964, when he reached the age of 60, Eperson retired from Bishop Otter College where he had, for some years, been a Principal Lecturer and Dean of Chapel.
* In 1988, when he was eighty four years old, Eperson published a book entitled Patterns in Mathematics which ran to five editions.
* It was published in the Spring issue of The Carrollian, the journal of The Lewis Carroll Society, at around the time of Eperson's death.

Born 22 July 1904, Gunnersbury, Middlesex, England. Died 13 May 2001, Worthing, West Sussex, England.
