**Donald Eperson** was an English schooteacher and clergyman who produced works on recreational mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical theory to enable a more accurate calculation of elliptic integrals. 
2. Contributed to the concept of the Galois group in mathematics.
3. Proved the impossibility of the quintic equation being solved by radicals.
4. Used elliptic functions to solve the Kowalski problem.
5. Performed important work in the calculus of variations.
6. Published two influential mathematical papers related to number theory.
7. Discovered connections between elliptic and modular forms.
8. Achieved national recognition at the International Congress of Mathematicians for his research on Abelian Integrals.

Born 22 July 1904, Gunnersbury, Middlesex, England. Died 13 May2001, Worthing, West Sussex, England.
