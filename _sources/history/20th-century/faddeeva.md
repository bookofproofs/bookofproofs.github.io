**Vera Nikolaevna Faddeeva** was a Russian mathematician who worked in the field of numerical linear algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The years during which Vera Nikolaevna was an undergraduate at Leningrad State University were ones of great difficulty for the academics at the university.
* Faddeeva undertook graduate study at the Leningrad Pedagogical Institute for three years, beginning in 1938.
* For the duration of the siege of Leningrad, Faddeeva lived in Kazan, about 800 km due east of Moscow and considered safe from the German invasion.
* Gavurin was a colleague of Faddeeva and, together with Leonid Vitalyevich Kantorovich, he had set up a computational mathematics unit within the mathematical analysis department at Leningrad State University in 1948.
* Faddeeva was closely associated with the computational developments by Kantorovich, especially at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics where she became head of the Laboratory of Numerical Computations.
* As the head of Laboratory, Vera Nikolaevna guided investigations in various scientific fields related to numerical mathematics.
* Faddeeva's final paper was the single authored Numerical methods of linear algebra in computer formulation (1984) which is the text of a lecture she gave at the 'Computational mathematics' Conference in Warsaw in 1980.
* Faddeeva loved life and enjoyed it.
* Everyone who knew Faddeeva in person or through her perfect writings will never forget this wonderful researcher and woman.
* Vera Nikolaevna also took trouble about people with whom she was not personally acquainted.

Born 20 September 1906, Tambov, Russia. Died 15 April 1983, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
