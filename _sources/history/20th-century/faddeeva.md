**Vera Nikolaevna Faddeeva** was a Russian mathematician who worked in the field of numerical linear algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The years during which Vera Nikolaevna was an undergraduate at Leningrad State University were ones of great difficulty for the academics at the university.
* Following her graduation, Faddeeva worked at the Leningrad Board of Weights and Measures (as her husband had done in the previous couple of years).
* Faddeeva undertook graduate study at the Leningrad Pedagogical Institute for three years, beginning in 1938.
* As the German armies rapidly advanced towards Leningrad, many people were evacuated from the city including Faddeeva and her family.
* For the duration of the siege of Leningrad, Faddeeva lived in Kazan, about 800 km due east of Moscow and considered safe from the German invasion.
* Faddeeva, together with her husband and other academics, obtained such permits and again Leningrad State University began to operate.
* Gavurin was a colleague of Faddeeva and, together with Leonid Vitalyevich Kantorovich, he had set up a computational mathematics unit within the mathematical analysis department at Leningrad State University in 1948.
* Faddeeva was closely associated with the computational developments by Kantorovich, especially at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics where she became head of the Laboratory of Numerical Computations.
* As the head of Laboratory, Vera Nikolaevna guided investigations in various scientific fields related to numerical mathematics.
* MathSciNet lists around 40 papers by Faddeeva including 20 joint papers with her husband on numerical analysis including their most famous work, the book Computational methods of linear algebra which appeared in Russian in 1960.
* We mentioned above the 20 joint papers by Faddeeva and her husband, noting that some of the last few of these were: Natural norms in algebraic processes (1970), On the question of the solution of linear algebraic systems (1974), Parallel calculations in linear algebra (Part 1 in 1977, Part 2 in 1982), and A view of the development of numerical methods of linear algebra (1977).
* Faddeeva's final paper was the single authored Numerical methods of linear algebra in computer formulation (1984) which is the text of a lecture she gave at the 'Computational mathematics' Conference in Warsaw in 1980.
* Faddeeva loved life and enjoyed it.
* Everyone who knew Faddeeva in person or through her perfect writings will never forget this wonderful researcher and woman.
* Vera Nikolaevna also took trouble about people with whom she was not personally acquainted.

Born 20 September 1906, Tambov, Russia. Died 15 April 1983, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
