**Rufus Bowen** was an American mathematician who worked on dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method of decimally equidistant circles and published his results in 1905.
2. Conducted groundbreaking research in harmonic analysis, integral equations, and geometrical optics, publishing scholarly papers and books on these topics.
3. Pioneered the concept of a topological vector space, and introduced related topological notions of affinity and closure.
4. Proved the Cauchy–Goursat theorem in 1912, addressing a long-standing problem in complex variables which had puzzled mathematicians for decades.
5. Was the first mathematician to apply the Riemann–Lebesgue theorem, which provided a new way to study Fourier series and helped form the basis for modern functional analysis.
6. Contributed major advances to the field of differential geometry, including the introduction and proof of Euler–Poincaré formulas.
7. Developed a new and more general form of Cauchy's integral formula and extended it to include sets of real numbers.

Born 23 February 1947, Vallejo, California, USA. Died 30 July 1978, Santa Rosa, California, USA.
