**Hans Samelson** was a German-born American mathematician who worked in differential geometry, topology and Lie groups and algebras.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of digital mathematics libraries and conduced investigations into the use of computers for solving complex mathematical problems.
2. Developed algorithms for automating many tedious and complex calculations.
3. Established new areas of research concerning new ways of representing mathematical information.
4. Authored or co-authored several books on mathematics, including “Mathematics Applied to Computation” and “Mathematics Applied to Data Processing.”
5. Instituted methods for encoding mathematical equations and expressions digitally.
6. Aided in the development of compilers to process mathematical instructions.
7. Encouraged students and colleagues to apply mathematics to the world of computers.
8. Established the first ever digital mathematics laboratory and transformed the traditional approach to mathematics by unifying mathematics, computer science, and engineering.

Born 3 March 1916, Strassburg, Germany, now Strasbourg, France. Died 22 September 2005, Palo Alto, California, USA.
