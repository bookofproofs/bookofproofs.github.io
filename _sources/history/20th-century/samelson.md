**Hans Samelson** was a German-born American mathematician who worked in differential geometry, topology and Lie groups and algebras.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Siegfried Samelson was the son of Adolf Samelson and Moritz Pasch's younger sister Henriette Pasch.
* The Samelson family were Jewish but Siegfried, who was professor of pediatrics and director of the school health system in Strassburg, married Irmgard Engel who was also a paediatrician.
* It is a sad fact that Siegfried and Irmgard's ethnicity had such a major effect on their lives and those of their children Hans, Klaus and Franz.
* In November 1918, when Hans was two years old, following the defeat of Germany, French troops entered Strassburg and declared the city to be part of France.
* Hans's younger brother was born in Strasbourg (as it had been renamed) in December 1918 shortly after the French occupation and before international recognition of the city's transfer to France in the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919.
* The Samelson family were expelled from Strasbourg by the new French authorities and, after a brief stay in the Black Forest, they returned to Siegfried's hometown of Breslau, where Siegfried became a professor of paediatrics and director of school health system.
* Hans's youngest brother Franz was born in Breslau in 1923.
* Hans Samelson was educated in Breslau but after the Nazis came to power in 1933 not only did his father lose his position in the university but all three boys, being half-Jewish, also began to have restrictions imposed on their education.
* Although Hans studied at the University of Breslau, advanced studies were restricted and he left Germany in 1936 to study for his doctorate in mathematics at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule in Zürich.
* Hans worked for his doctorate advised by Heinz Hopf but also attended lectures by Michel Plancherel and George Pólya.
* In 1938 Samelson's paper Über die Drehung der Tangenten offener ebener Kurven Ⓣ(On the rotation of the tangents to open plane curves) was published and, in the same year, a joint paper Zum Beweis des Kongruenzsatzes für Eiflächen Ⓣ(To prove the congruence theorems for oval surfaces) written with Heinz Hopf appeared.
* Following Kristallnacht, as this event had been called, Siegfried Samelson decided that the only way he could help his family was to commit suicide.
* Hans Samelson continued his research in Switzerland and in 1940 published Über die Sphären, die als Gruppenräume auftreten Ⓣ(On spheres that act as group rings) in which he gave a topological proof that a compact Lie group of rank one (that is a Lie group in which maximal abelian subgroups are of dimension one is homeomorphic to the circle, the 3-sphere or projective 3-space.
* Samelson married Renate Reiner in 1940 but he had no reason to be in Switzerland after the award of his doctorate.
* However, there was still a major problem for Samelson and his wife had to escape from Europe.
* Samelson and his wife escaped by making for Spain and then taking a boat to New York.
* At first the Samelsons sublet an apartment of William "Ted" Martin, who was just leaving Princeton, but then found their own place to live.
* Of course it was vital to Samelson that he remain in the United States after the year in Princeton so he applied for every possible position.
* Samelson took up his appointment at Syracuse University in 1943.
* In 1946 Samelson moved to Ann Arbor and took up an appointment at the University of Michigan.
* Hans' younger brother Franz also came to Ann Arbor and studied social psychology at the University of Michigan.
* In 1956 Samelson married his second wife Nancy Morse.
* Today, that operation is called the Samelson product.
* Perhaps Hans Samelson's most important results were contained in his joint work with R Bott.
* All those interested in Lie algebras will know Samelson's wonderful book Notes on Lie algebras (1969).
* Twenty years after this first edition was published Samelson produced a revised edition.
* Samelson also published a linear algebra text An introduction to linear algebra (1974).
* Away from mathematics Samelson had many other interests.

Born 3 March 1916, Strassburg, Germany, now Strasbourg, France. Died 22 September 2005, Palo Alto, California, USA.
