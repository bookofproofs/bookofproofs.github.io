**Hubert Linfoot** was a British mathematician who worked in optics as well as pure mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new method for calculating the coefficients of Fourier series.
2. Pioneered a method for eigenanalysis of non-self-adjoint systems.
3. Co-authored the book ‘Quasi-Linearization and Nonlinear Boundary Value Problems’.
4. Found a new solution to the Taylor series problem with infinite terms.
5. Developed a powerful numerical algorithm for solving ordinary differential equations.
6. Improved traditional methods for solving functional equations.
7. Showed the existence of invariant manifolds for nonautonomous nonlinear systems.
8. Contributed to the development of methods for calculating Fourier Integrals.

Born 8 June 1905, Sheffield, England. Died 14 October 1982, Cambridge, England.
