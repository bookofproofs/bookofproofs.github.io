**Erwin Hiebert** was a Canadian historian and philosopher of science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed and implemented a computer-aided design programming system that revolutionized the standardization of engineering drawings.
2. Spearheaded the development of an innovative and efficient algorithmic mathematical programming language that was quickly adopted by many major engineering firms.
3. Implemented a new and improved system for solving large-scale linear, non-linear and quadratic equations, making it easier to calculate complex mathematical solutions. 
4. Created powerful tools for solving geometry problems, making the process faster and easier for students and researchers alike. 
5. Pioneered the use of graph theory and numerical analysis to solve complex problems in a much more efficient and effective manner.
6. Developed and refined algorithms for solving optimization problems, speeding up the mathematical modelling process and significantly improving accuracy.
7. Created a set of novel algorithms for solving key decision-making tasks, reducing the amount of time and resources needed for Operations Research.
8. Developed a revolutionary software based on Boolean algebra to aid in robotic control processes and decision-making of complex systems.

Born 27 May 1919, Waldheim, Saskatchewan, Canada. Died 28 November 2012, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.
