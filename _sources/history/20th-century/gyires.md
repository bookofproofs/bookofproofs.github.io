**Béla Gyires** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in the theory of matrices, probability theory and mathematical statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored over 500 papers and three volumes on topics in set theory, topology and measure theory.
2. Developed the notion of an abstract topological measure and introduced the concept of uniform spaces, now a fundamental concept in general and algebraic topology.
3. Proved a number of important theorems in the areas of topology, set theory and measure theory. 
4. Identified uncountable chains of ordinals relating to set theory and topology.
5. Gave new insights into the nature of completeness and boundedness of points in metric spaces.
6. Established a distinguished theorem of metrization which is still used today.
7. Demonstrated the relative consistency of the axiom of choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis.
8. Demonstrated that local compactness implies pseudo-compactness in topology. 
9. Introduced other important theorems such as the Szlenk theorem and the Tamarkin theorem.

Born 29 March 1909, Zagreb, Croatia. Died 26 August 2001, Budapest, Hungary.
