**Béla Gyires** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in the theory of matrices, probability theory and mathematical statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* At the time Béla was born, Zagreb was in Croatia-Slavonia, an autonomous kingdom within the Hungarian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
* The Gyires family's move to Debrecen, therefore, meant that they were again in Hungary.
* In Debrecen, Béla Gyires attended the Piarist Gymnasium, graduating in 1928.
* It was at this school that Gyires first developed a love for mathematics.
* After graduating in 1928, Gyires entered the Péter Pázmány University of Budapest where he studied for his first degree, mainly taking courses in mathematics and physics.
* Gyires was awarded his first degree in 1933 which qualified him for a career as a high school teacher.
* Jordán had been made a professor in the year that Gyires graduated with his first degree and he is recognised as the founder of the Hungarian School of Probability.
* Gyires, like Jordán who influenced him so strongly, had broad interests but made his most important contributions to the theory of probability and to mathematical statistics.
* Gyires was awarded his doctorate from that university in 1941 and, in that year, published the paper A korlátolt pontosságú szorzás hibahatárai Ⓣ(The margin of error in limited precision multiplication)  which was his Ph.D. thesis.
* We mentioned above that Gyires worked as a school teacher while undertaking research for his doctorate.
* They had two children, Klara Gyires (born 1946) who became a pharmacologist and professor at Semmelweis University in Budapest, and Tibor Béla Gyires (born 1948) who became a mathematician and computer scientist.
* In 1943 Gyires moved to Kassa, a town now known as Košice in Slovakia.
* Gyires taught at the College of Commerce there until 1945.
* In 1946 Gyires habilitated in linear algebra and analysis.
* Professor Béla Gyires was an excellent lecturer, he had always a lot of students and many of them became teachers in secondary schools, university teachers and professors.
* In 1993, when he was 84 years of age, Gyires published the book Linear approximations in convex metric spaces and the application in the mixture theory of probability theory.
* Gyires received many honours.
* Gyires officially retired in 1979 but continued to teach and only in 1994, when he was 85 years old, was he made professor emeritus.
* Also the University of Debrecen makes the Gyires Béla Award for outstanding academic performance in the field of probability theory and applied mathematics.
* The award was set up on the initiative of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Béla Gyires' two children, Klara Gyires and Tibor Gyires, in 2003.

Born 29 March 1909, Zagreb, Croatia. Died 26 August 2001, Budapest, Hungary.
