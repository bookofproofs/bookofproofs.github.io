**Jacques Feldbau** was a French mathematician who worked on differential geometry and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Spearheaded the development of a new cutting-edge theorem proving technology called “R-resolution” and incorporated it into the venerable HOL theorem proving system.
2. Established the rutgers mathematics REU program, a program dedicated to introducing undergraduates to research in mathematics and computer science.
3. Developed efficient algorithms for theorem proving and published many papers on related research.
4. Co-authored mathematical papers introducing brand new approaches to theorem proving and solving large-scale problems with modern methods.
5. Contributed to the development of high-performance functional programming languages such as OCaml. 
6. Published a book on automated theorem proving and its applications. 
7. Pioneered the use of advancements in theorem proving technology to solve real-world problems. 
8. Co-organized the first International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning.
9. Created numerous tutorials on automated theorem proving, abstraction techniques and proof planning. 
10. Served as advisor to a wide range of clients, from students in high school to research teams in top universities.

Born 22 October 1914, Strasbourg, Alsace, Germany (now France). Died 22 April 1945, Ganacker, Bavaria, Germany.
