**Yves-André Rocard** was a French physicist who worked in a variety of fields including radio-astronomy and development of the French atomic bomb.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Became a professor of mathematics at the École Normale Supérieure in 1948. 
2. Published several influential textbooks, including two that have been translated into English: The Mechanics of Solids (1952) and Optics (1952).
3. Invented a geometrical method for calculating the expressions of motion in nonlinearly elastic solids.
4. Developed a mathematical description of the spectral properties of molecules in statistical mechanics.
5. Introduced a mathematical theory of the catalytic action of enzymes.
6. Developed the theory for the use of stable isotope fractionation in paleoclimatology.
7. Developed a mathematical interpretation of the dual photoelectric effect.
8. Found the mathematical conditions for nonlinear phase synchronization.
9. Established the theoretical basis of enstrophy transport in dynamical systems. 
10. Developed a mathematical model of classical spin liquid theory.
