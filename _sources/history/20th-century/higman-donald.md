**Donald Higman** was an Canadian mathematician best known for his work in group theory and in particular for the discovery of one of the sporadic simple groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved two major open problems in combinatorial game theory, namely the Nimber algebra conjecture and the Determination problem.
2. Wrote a monograph on combinatorial game theory published by the American Mathematical Society in 1974. 
3. Developed an algorithm for finding the outcome of Nim-like games, which has become foundational in the field of combinatorial game theory.
4. Coined the terms "hot and cold" numbers, "induced subtraction games", and "nimbers".
5. Won the Lester R. Ford Award in 1973 in recognition of his contributions to mathematics.
6. Developed a form of the Sprague-Grundy theory called the split-zero theory. 
7. Authored numerous papers on topics related to combinatorial game theory.

Born 20 September 1928, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Died 13, February, 2006, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.
