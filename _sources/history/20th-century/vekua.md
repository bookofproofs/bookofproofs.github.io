**lya Vekua** was a  Georgian mathematician, specializing in partial differential equations, singular integral equations, generalized analytic functions and the mathematical theory of elastic shells.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a comprehensive theory of integral equations, known as the Vekua Theory, which elucidated the basic principles and characteristics of boundary value problems. 
2. Wrote important papers on boundary value problems, the theory of conformal mapping, and the theory of partial differential equations.
3. Developed a ground-breaking method for constructing approximate solutions to elliptic equations.
4. Included a method for calculating the singular integral in his landmark paper on the theory of boundary value problems.
5. Proved important theorems on the regularity of solutions to certain boundary value problems.
6. Co-authored the widely used textbook Partial Differential Equations of Mathematical Physics.

Born 23 April 1907, Shesheleti, Kutaisi Governorate, Russian Empire (now Ochamchira District, Abkhazia, breakaway region of Georgia). Died 2 December 1977, Tbilisi, Georgia, USSR.
