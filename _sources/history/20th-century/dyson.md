**Freeman Dyson** was an English theoretical physicist and mathematician who worked in quantum electrodynamics, solid-state physics and astronomy. He worked in America for many years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Dyson's inequality for the longest increasing subsequence of a permutation. 
2. Published proof of the stability of matter theorem in condensed matter physics. 
3. Established an exact equivalence between certain integrals coming from quantum field theory and some classical statistical mechanics problems.
4. Helped in the formulation of the theory of the renormalization group and its application to critical phenomena. 
5. Developed the mathematical theory of zero-point energy in quantum physics. 
6. Formulated the concept of "effective complexity” which is the minimum number of parameters needed to simulate a process. 
7. Developed the theory of the four colors that are needed to color the faces of any map.
8. Proved the connectedness of the Edward’s Compactified Euclidean Space in the theory of mathematical relativity.

Born 15 December 1923, Crowthorne, Berkshire, England. Died 28 February 2020, Princeton, New Jersey. USA.
