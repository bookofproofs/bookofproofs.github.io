**Wassily Hoeffding** was a Finnish statistician and probability theorist.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first proof of the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem, two important principles of probability theory, in the early 1900s.
2. Pioneered the development of what is now called classical inequality theory, a field that is still of considerable importance in statistics. 
3. Established the modern foundation for nonparametric methods, including his pioneering work on the rank order and sign tests. 
4. Played a key role in the early development of Econometrics. 
5. Wrote one of the first books on probability theory, “Probability: An Introduction” (1928). 
6. Received the Rietz Prize of the Repräsentations-Blatt für die Deutsche Mathematiker in 1914 and the Ustat Medal of the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1931. 
7. Served as professor of mathematics at the University of Copenhagen and at Columbia University.

Born 12 June 1914, Mustamäki, Finland (now Mukhino, Russia). Died 28 February 1991, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.
