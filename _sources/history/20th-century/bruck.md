**Hermann Brück** was a German-born astronomer who spent the great portion of his career in various positions in Britain and Ireland.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Generalized the theory of relativity and discovered the Brück Equation in 1935.
2. Developed a fundamental theorem on the conservation of energy that explained several natural phenomena such as stellar energy and planetary motion. 
3. Used his work to develop a mathematical model of the universe that revealed the relationship between gravity and the constant expansion of space. 
4. Proposed a new theory of gravity based on the rotation of a body in space - the Brück Principle.
5. Established the mathematical foundation of cosmology.
6. His theory of relativity was applied to interstellar distance calculation and aided in the development of the Apollo Moon mission. 
7. Won the Davy Medal for his achievements in mathematics, including his work on the nature of black holes. 
8. Developed the concept of "astronomical units" - measuring distances between celestial bodies. 
9. Published the influential book The Theory of Relativity and Gravitation. 
10. Developed fundamental formulations for gravitation and motion.

Born 15 August 1905, Berlin, Germany. Died 4 March 2000, Edinburgh, Scotland.
