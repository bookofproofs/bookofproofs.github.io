**Kenkichi Iwasawa** was a Japanese mathematician who worked in algebraic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Heustrated the generalized class number formula, linking algebraic number theory and modular functions.  
2. He published several works on p-adic analytic functions and variation of Iwasawa modules. 
3. He defined Iwasawa algebras and provided a structure theory of Iwasawa modules. 
4. He worked on analytic number theory, pointing out connections between the Dirichlet series and Lacunary functions, and between zeta functions and the prime number theorem. 
5. Solved the main conjecture in Iwasawa theory, which states that for all sufficiently large prime numbers p, the exponent of the p-part of the ideal class group of an algebraic number field is finite. 
6. He developed a theory of $p$-adic Galois representations. 
7. Investigated Zeta Functions and Dirichlet Series in Number Theory.
8. Propounded the formulation of the main conjecture in Iwasawa Theory.
9. Discovered new reciprocity laws for abelian fields.
10.Coined the term ‘Iwahori algebra’.

Born 11 September 1917, Shinshuku-mura (near Kiryu), Gumma Prefecture, Japan. Died 26 October 1998, Tokyo, Japan.
