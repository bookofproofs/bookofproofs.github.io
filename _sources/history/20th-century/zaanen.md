### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His parents were Pieter Zaanen and Ariaantje de Bruin.
* Aad Zaanen was brought up in Rotterdam where he attended the secondary school (hogere burgerschool).
* After completing a first degree in Mathematics and Physics in 1935, Zaanen continued his studies at Leiden undertaking research with Johannes Droste as his advisor.
* After completing his doctoral studies, Zaanen became a secondary school teacher in Rotterdam, teaching mathematics.
* Zaanen married Jacoba (Ada) van der Woude in 1943; they had four sons.
* After three years in Indonesia, Zaanen returned to the Netherlands where he was appointed as Professor of Analysis in the Technical University of Delft in 1950.
* On the other hand it reflects Zaanen's mathematical career over more than forty years.
* During this period Zaanen made essential contributions to several parts of mathematics, mainly in functional analysis, integration theory and Riesz space theory.
* Through these four decades Zaanen established his own school of thought with its centre of gravity in Leiden and with its representatives abroad.
* When he retired Zaanen gave the address Looking back: farewell lecture at the University of Leiden on 3 December 1982.
* An important contribution by Zaanen was the texts that he published.
