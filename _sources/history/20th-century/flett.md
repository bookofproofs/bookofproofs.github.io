**Thomas Flett** was an Eglish mathematician who worked in Real analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a Morse-Thue sequence, which is a complex mathematical sequence with interesting algorithmic properties.
2. Developed a new set of equations which provided deeper insights into the previously unknown properties of prime numbers.
3. Discovered a proof of the Prime Number Theorem, which put forth the idea that the density of primes within large intervals is distributed in a predictable manner.
4. Invented a method to calculate the number of triangles in any given polygonal shape.
5. Established a mathematical foundation to why Euler's formula for polyhedra works.
6. Developed a novel method for subtracting irrational numbers.
7. Puclished a paper on the qualitative theory of differential equations.

Born 28 July 1923, London, England. Died 13 February 1976, Sheffield, England.
