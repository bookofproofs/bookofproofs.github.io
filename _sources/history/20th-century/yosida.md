**Kosaku Yosida** was a Japanese mathematician who worked in the field of functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed the Yosida Operator, a basic tool in mathematics used to study the convergence and stability of approximate solutions to differential equations.
2. He was a pioneer in the field of numerical analysis, having published the first detailed account of numerical methods for solving differential equations in 1955.
3. Advocated the concept of the Banach fixed-point theorem for solving nonlinear equations in 1960.
4. Proved a major theorem concerning Dirichlet’s problem in the theory of partial differential equations in 1962.
5. Also made significant contributions to the theory of differential and integral equations, functional analysis and probability theory.

Born 7 February 1909, Hiroshima, Japan. Died 20 June 1990, Tokyo, Japan.
