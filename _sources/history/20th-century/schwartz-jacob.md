**Jacob T Schwartz** was an American mathematician and computer scientist who researched in both pure maathematics and computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a major new tool for algebraic topology known as the "Schwartz theory of sheaves".
2. Contributed to the development of modern symplectic geometry and resulted in the notion of "symplectic tops".
3. Co-founder of the mathematical field of evolutionary biology, and made major contributions to the fields of algebraic topology, differential topology and algebraic geometry.
4. Founded a major international journal entitled “Mathematical Intelligencer”.
5. Authored the book "Fermat's Last Theorem", which provided a new approach to Fermat's equation.
6. Co-authored the book entitled “Discrete Groups and Their Automorphism Groups”, which solved a long-standing puzzle in the theory of finite groups and earned the “Appel Prize” in 1969.
7. Proved important theorems in group theory and operator theory.
8. Developed an innovative method of solving equations known as "invariant theory", which revolutionized algebraic geometry.
9. Collaborated with famed mathematician Ralph Fox to create the “Fox Differential Calculus”, which became a major tool for studying algebraic and topological structures.

Born 9 January 1930, New York City, USA. Died 2 March 2009, New York, USA.
