**Richard Rado** was a German-born British mathematician who worked on combinatorics and graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Development of the theory of subgroups of abstract groups, which led to the introduction of the term ``radical'' for the maximal solvable normal subgroup. 
2. Pioneering the study of algebraic groups with the notion of Chow-Riemann geometry. 
3. Introduction of the automated reasoning system FORTRAN. 
4. Creating the theory of finite recursive functions and related recursive set theory. 
5. The seminal proof that every countable model of set theory has a countable transitive model. 
6. Application of ordinal logic, a variant of order theory, to find solutions to undecidable problems in a finite number of steps. 
7. Definition of ordinal arithmetic, a generalization of natural number arithmetic, to simplify and systematize subrecursive hierarchies, fast-growing hierarchies, and the theory of well-orderings. 
8. Formulation of the notion of relative interpretability, a tool for the study of models of set theory and fragments of arithmetic. 
9. Development of the theory of antichains, which provided a bridge between algebra and order theory.

Born 28 April 1906, Berlin, Germany. Died 23 December 1989, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England.
