**Richard Rado** was a German-born British mathematician who worked on combinatorics and graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Richard, his parents' second son, made a decision while at school to choose between being a concert pianist or a mathematician.
* Rado's thesis, entitled Studies on combinatorics, earned him a doctorate in 1933.
* They had one son, Peter Rado, born in 1943.
* Rado was interviewed in Berlin by Lord Cherwell for a scholarship given by the chemist Sir Robert Mond which provided financial support to study at Cambridge.
* Rado entered Fitzwilliam House, University of Cambridge, and completed a second Ph.D. in 1935 under Hardy's supervision on Linear transformations of sequences.
* While at Cambridge Rado was influenced by many mathematicians working there at the time including Hardy, Littlewood, Hall, Besicovitch and Bernhard Neumann.
* Rado also worked with Heilbronn and Davenport and, at around this time, he began to correspond with Erd≈ës.
* In 1936 Rado was appointed to the University of Sheffield where, after Mirsky was appointed in 1942, the two became close friends.
* In 1947 Rado moved to King's College, London, moving seven years later to a chair at the University of Reading.
* Rado's work covered a wide range of mathematics but his most important work was in combinatorics.
* These important combinatorial results were in the area of Hall's theorem, Ramsey's theorem, the Rado selection principle, matroids and theory of transversals, and partitions.
* Rado received many honours for his contributions.
* Rado was the kindest and gentlest of men.

Born 28 April 1906, Berlin, Germany. Died 23 December 1989, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England.
