**Jacques Dixmier** is a French mathematician who worked on  C*-algebras and other operator algebras.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered Dixmier mapping, a tool for understanding the decomposition of Lie algebras.
2. Developed the Dixmier-Douady theory of C*-algebras.
3. Proved the Dixmier-Moegelin theorem, a result in abstract representation theory.
4. Co-authored the landmark book on abstract harmonic analysis, Les C*-Algèbres et leurs Représentations.
5. Proved the Mackey Borel-Dixmier theorem, a result in abstract representation theory.
6. Introduced the concept of the envelope of a C*-algebra.
7. Developed a new approach to the study of Lie algebras based on the theory of enveloping algebras.
8. Discovered the Dixmier-Moegelin theorem, a result in abstract representation theory about the decomposition of Lie algebras.

Born 1 January 1924, Saint-Étienne, France.
