**Dudley Ernest Littlewood** was a British mathematician known for his work in group representation theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He entered Trinity College where his undergraduate tutor was J E Littlewood (who was not related to Dudley).
* Littlewood was a very successful mathematics undergraduate being awarded College prizes and the Yeats prize.
* Littlewood's first appointment was as a school teacher, but, in 1928, he found a post as a temporary part-time lecturer at University College Swansea.
* Although his research flourished in Swansea, Littlewood was keen to return to Cambridge and, when the chance came in 1947, he accepted a post as university lecturer.
* Until Littlewood's appointment to Swansea he had no definite research interests.
* Another reason was certainly the work of Hilbert, but Littlewood tried to remedy the "tensor reason" in a series of papers on tensors and invariant theory.
* Littlewood's main work, however, began in 1934 after Richardson had suggested that Littlewood study papers by Frobenius and Schur.
* Above all, this paper is renowned for its statement of a rule for multiplying S-functions, now universally called the Littlewood-Richardson rule (this had to wait a further thirty-five years for a rigorous proof).
* This marks the beginning of Littlewood's investigation of group characters, in particular the characters of the symmetric group.
* Littlewood had a great love for the works of Frobenius, Schur and Weyl - these were mathematicians who produced the kind of usable formulae which he could and did appreciate.
* In 1970 Littlewood retired from the chair at Bangor, but he continued to live at Llandudno on the North Wales coast.
* Around the time of his 76th  birthday, Littlewood fell and broke a leg.

Born 7 September 1903, London, England. Died 6 October 1979, Llandudno, Wales.
