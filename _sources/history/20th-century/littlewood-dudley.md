**Dudley Ernest Littlewood** was a British mathematician known for his work in group representation theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the Littlewood-Richardson Rule, a method of solving the enumeration problem in algebraic combinatorics.
2. Developed a theorem addressing the generalized Schur functions, now known as the Littlewood-Richardson Rule.
3. Solved the Cassels-Griessmon Hypothesis using his work on the Littlewood-Richardson Rule.
4. Proposed the Peter-Weyl Theorem, which states that for any compact group, its characters form a basis for a group algebra.
5. Developed the Littlewood-Offord Theorem, which relates the number of nonzero elements of a matrix to the probability distribution of its eigenvalues.
6. Constructed the theory of infinite series of the number theory, now known as the Littlewood-Offord Theory.
7. Researched and developed effective methods in probability theory, culminating in the Littlewood-Offord Theory.
8. Established asymptotic formulas for the number of integer lattice points contained in a given region.
9. Devised a scheme of exponential sums, which later became known as the Littlewood Polynomials.
10. Contributed to the theory of numbers, with research on the structure of the prime numbers using Diophantine equations.

Born 7 September 1903, London, England. Died 6 October 1979, Llandudno, Wales.
