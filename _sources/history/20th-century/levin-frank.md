**Frank Levin** was an American mathematician who worked mainly in infinite group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Because Julie lacked a father, Frank was forced to be the father substitute, which he did well, so that his sister was always grateful to him.
* It turned out the chief had given Frank the wrong data to begin with.
* On his frequent trips to Belgrade, Frank took the opportunity of stopping in London, where he worked with me.
* (Not surprisingly, the long intervals when he and Ossia were separated were not good for the marriage.) Frank had no children with Ossia, but did have a son Marc with Elke.
* On retiring, Frank moved with his wife to Swansea in Wales, where Elke's children lived.
* Frank was one of those few mathematicians who never gave up working on mathematics when he retired, and indeed, he was still working on a paper with Narain Gupta on the fateful day when he had a stroke.
* It was a blessing that before his death, Frank saw his granddaughter, now aged 6 months.
* Frank was a very quiet, modest man.
* Frank did not swear, mainly because he had no violence in his make-up.
* He did not even curse when he told me about a friend who had used Frank to guarantee a loan, and then decamped leaving the debt to Frank.

Born 19 June 1927, Dayton, Ohio, USA. Died 2 October 2011, Swansea, Wales.
