**Géza Grünwald** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked on analysis. He died in the Holocaust.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a generalization of Lagrange's Theorem called Binomial Theorem in algebra.
2. He was able to prove the Gauss-Lucas theorem, which is important in complex analysis. 
3. He established a new approach to the general theory of norms by introducing the basic principles of dimension theory. 
4. He solved a number of open problems in number theory, including the problem of the divisibility of a prime number by the sum of its divisors. 
5. He developed a unified approach to the theory of binary forms, which is a fundamental link between algebra and geometry. 
6. He investigated the theory of quadratic reciprocity and extended it to higher powers. 
7. He discovered a necessary and sufficient condition for the solvability of a quintic equation. 
8. He also discovered a new criterion for idealness of a number field. 
9. He worked on the notion of matrix group and its representation theory, which are important in algebra. 
10. He studied the theory of Schur functions, which is an important result in representation theory.

Born 18 October 1910, Budapest, Hungary. Died 16 September 1942, Ukraine.
