**Linards Reiziņš** was a Latvian mathematician who specialised in the field of differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was into this independent Latvia that Reiziņš was born and brought up, but that independence ended while he was still at high school.
* During this extremely difficult period Reiziņš continued his studies at the Gymnasium in Riga.
* Reiziņš had been attending a sport camp at Burtnieki Lake in the north of the country when the German armies entered Riga.
* The roads to the capital were blocked so Reiziņš, together with other young men from the Second Gymnasium who had been at the camp, went first to Valmiera about 40 km south of Burtnieki, then they decided to head north towards Estonia.
* The group of young men scattered in their attempt to avoid being detained by the Germans, but Reiziņš was taken prisoner and returned to Riga which was now under German control.
* In the Spring of 1942 the Germans released Reiziņš and allowed him to complete the final high school examinations which he had been unable to take previously.
* Reiziņš was now able to enter the University of Latvia in Riga where he studied mathematics.
* If Reiziņš had fared badly under the German occupation of Latvia, he did not fare much better under the Soviet domination, for in 1949 he lost his position at the University.
* Reiziņš was forced to take a job as a secondary school teacher.
* In 1958 Reiziņš was able to take up the lectureship in mathematics at the University of Latvia which he had been dismissed from in 1948.
* Reiziņš was promoted to associate professor at the University of Latvia in 1969 and ten years later to full professor.
* The Academy had no Institute of Mathematics and Reiziņš campaigned for years for the establishment of such an Institute.
* Of the many other important contributions made by Reiziņš we should mention in particular his work on Pfaff's equations and his contributions to the history of mathematics.

Born 14 January 1924, Riga, Latvia. Died 31 March 1991, Riga, Latvia.
