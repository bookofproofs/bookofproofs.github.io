**Hassler Whitney** was an American mathematician who did important work in manifolds, embeddings, immersions, characteristic classes and geometric integration theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of homology theory, a branch of algebraic topology that studies topological properties of spaces.
2. Helped to establish the branch of differential topology, which studies the local and global properties of differentiable functions and manifolds.
3. Developed a new approach to the calculus of variations which he dubbed as the “minimum principles.”
4. Discovered the Whitney embedding theorem, which states that every abstract topological manifold can be isometrically embedded in a Euclidean space.
5. Found a critical point theorem for continuous mappings between compact manifolds, related to the Morse-Sturm theory.
6. Proved a fundamental theorem on the existence of non-obvious continuous extensions of continuous functions from one space to another.
7. Derived the Whitney extension theorem, which states that every continuous function on a closed subset of space can be extended to a continuous function on the entire space.
8. Developed a number of inequalities, which established the analytical foundations for the existence of certain structures in manifolds.

Born 23 March 1907, New York, USA. Died 10 May1989, Mount Dents Blanches, Switzerland.
