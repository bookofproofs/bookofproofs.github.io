**Hans Meinhardt** was a German scientist who is known for his pioneering work in the field of pattern formation in biology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical model of the developmental processes of marine embryos
2. Developed a numerical method for solutions of partial differential equations, which became known as the Meinhardt Method
3. Authored over 90 publications in the fields of mathematics, physics and biology 
4. Pioneered mathematical formulations for the life-cycle of living creatures in the field of theoretical biology 
5. Developed the foundations of mathematical frameworks for cell motility and cell signalling 
6. Contributed to the understanding ofpattern formation in nature, especially in sea urchins 
7. Advanced the mathematical theory of morphogenesis of the body plan of an organism
8. Established the mathematical basis for the study of biological control systems 
9. Pioneered a new class of discrete dynamical systems, based on cellular automata 
10. Pioneered the use of quadratic programs to solve optimal control problems over time

Born 23 December 1938, Mühlhausen, Thuringia, Germany. Died 11 February 2016, Tübingen, Germany.
