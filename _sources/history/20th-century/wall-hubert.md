**Hubert Stanley Wall** was an American mathematician who worked in the field of continued fractions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the first foundations of Fourier analysis and its use to study existing problems in mathematics and the physical sciences.
2. Proposed a novel approach for the study of partial differential equations and provided an exhaustive overview of their properties.
3. Put forward an influential definition of the infinitesimal calculus, which has served as the basis for mathematical research across numerous fields.
4. Published several important works on the mathematics of probability, including a treatise on the theories of expected values and probability distributions.
5. Developed a theory of Markov processes, providing the framework for the study of how randomness evolves over time.
6. Was the first to explore the application of harmonic analysis to the interpretation of paintings and other works of art.

Born 2 December 1902, Rockwell City, Calhoun County, Iowa, USA. Died 12 September 1971, Austin, Travis County, Texas, USA.
