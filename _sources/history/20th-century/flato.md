**Moshé Flato** was an Israeli-born French mathematician and theoretical physicist. He applied group theoretic methods to problems in physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* She was a student of psychology when she met Shlomo Flato in a Tel Aviv cafe.
* However Moshé was not the 'ideal pupil' and continued to play pranks which led to frequent punishments.
* Flato survived but insisted on telling the truth about the operation rather than giving an 'official version'.
* After the award of his Master's degree, Flato served as a lieutenant in the Israeli Air Force.
* The theme of these papers is to connect the external symmetry properties of a physical system as represented by its invariance under the inhomogeneous Lorentz group (called by Flato the Poincaré group) or its Lie algebra, and the internal symmetry properties as represented by various unitary groups.
* Flato became a French citizen on 10 March 1967 and in 1968 he was appointed as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Dijon.
* In 1977 Flato was appointed to the Gevrey's chair of mathematics at Dijon.

Born 17 September 1937, Tel Aviv, British Mandate for Palestine (now Israel). Died 27 November 1998, Paris, France.
