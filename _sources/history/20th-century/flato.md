**Moshé Flato** was an Israeli-born French mathematician and theoretical physicist. He applied group theoretic methods to problems in physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of partial differential equations in three-dimensional space. 
2. Established the Frobenius theorem for infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and applied it to the study of representations of Lie algebras.
3. Discovered Lie-theoretic and differential geometric methods applicable to the microscopic description of certain physical systems. 
4. Found and studied general solutions for certain types of partial differential equations and related equations of mathematical physics.
5. Helped to develop a framework for understanding quantum mechanics and its application to quantum field theory.
6. Researched the use of nonlocal continuum systems of equations in mathematical physics, hydrodynamics and thermodynamics.
7. Wrote several textbooks on mathematical analysis, including one on nonlinear partial differential equations. 
8. Contributed to the advancement of the field of functional analysis.

Born 17 September 1937, Tel Aviv, British Mandate for Palestine (now Israel). Died 27 November 1998, Paris, France.
