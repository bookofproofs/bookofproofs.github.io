**Elgy Sibley Johnson** was an African American mathematician** **who was awarded a Ph.D. by the Catholic University of America. He served at the District of Columbia Teachers College, then joined the University of the District of Columbia when it was founded in 1976.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov (JMAK) model, which is an exponential kinetic model used to describe the kinetics of material transformations.
2. Developed the Johnson–Mehl relation, which is an empirical technique used to estimate the activation energy of a reaction.
3. Co-developed the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami model, which is a tool for determining the kinetics of material transformation processes.
4. Conducted a pioneering research related to diffusion-controlled reactions as well as segregation properties of solids.
5. Developed a new concept known as “solute phase curvature”, which is based on the studies of the solute-solute diffusion in solids.
6. Contributed significantly to the establishment of the theoretical basis for the well-known Ellingham diagram.
7. Developed a mathematical model for grain growth kinetics, which is known as the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov–Johnson (JMAKJ) model.
8. Co-discovered the discontinuity at the grain boundary of a single-phase material with respect to the crystallographic unit cell.

Born 8 November 1912, Jacksonville, Florida, USA. Died 12 March 1987, Washington D.C., USA.
