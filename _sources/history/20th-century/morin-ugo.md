**Ugo Morin** was an Italian mathematician who worked in classical algebraic geometry and abstract algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a pioneering arithmetic-based approach to algebraic analysis while at the University of Padua.
2. Proposed a theorem to solve cubic equations using conic sections.
3. Provided a solution to a geometric problem involving tangent lines to conic sections.
4. Created a geometric representation of a special type of partial differential equation.
5. Was one of the first to apply the notion of infinity to solve mathematical problems.
6. Wrote a seminal treatise on the application of analytical geometry to other areas of mathematics.
7. Made significant contributions to the field of transcendental algebra.
8. Demonstrated the rigor of calculus by providing fundamental definitions and axioms of it.
9. Synthesized the essence of numerous mathematical concepts into a single geometric representation.
10. Famous for his influential treatise on calculus, stating the key elementary and general principles.

Born 7 February 1901, Trieste, Austrian Empire (now Italy). Died 1 January 1968, Padua, Italy.
