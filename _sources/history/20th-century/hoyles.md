**Celia Hoyles** is a Professor of Mathematics Education at University College London. She has received many honours for her contributions to education such as an OBE, a DBE, and the first Hans Freudenthal Medal by the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We will, however, use the name Hoyles throughout this biography.
* Jane and Celia competed in the Aberdare Cup on more than one occasion.
* After graduating from Loughton County High School in 1964, Hoyles entered the University of Manchester where her main subject was mathematics.
* Also in 1969, while continuing to teach in London schools, Hoyles began studying for a PGCE (the Post Graduate Certificate in Education teaching qualification) at the University of London.
* In 1984 Hoyles was appointed Professor of Mathematical Education at the Institute of Education, University of London (now the Institute of Education, University College London).
* Hoyles co-presented the Yorkshire Television programme 'Fun and Games' for ITV with Johnny Ball beginning in 1987.
* Hoyles and Noss were colleagues who had co-authored many papers from the mid 1980s.
* Let us give a small example of Hoyles' work.
* Section 3 of that paper, written by Hoyles, was entitled The complexity of learning to prove deductively.
* In 2002 Hoyles was appointed Dean of Research and Consultancy at the Institute of Education, University College London.
* During her time in this position Hoyles continued in her professorship at University College London as she also did when, in 2007, she was appointed Director of the National Centre for Excellence in Teaching of Mathematics.
* Hoyles has received many honours in addition to the DBE she received in 2014 which followed the OBE she had received in 2004.
* Celia Hoyles belongs to that special breed of mathematics educators who, even while engaging with theoretical questions, do not lose sight of practice; and reciprocally, while engaged in advancing practice, do not forget the lessons they have learned from theory and from empirical research.
* Celia Hoyles' commitment to the improvement of mathematics education, in her country and beyond, can be felt in every detail of her multi-faceted, diverse professional activity.
* It is thanks to people like Celia Hoyles, with a clear sense of mission and the ability to build bridges between research and practice while contributing to both, that the community of mathematics education has acquired, over the years, a better-defined identity.
* Dame Celia said: "There is a general perception of maths as being something that is hard, boring and irrelevant.

Born 18 May 1946, London, England.
