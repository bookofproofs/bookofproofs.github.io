**Paul Kelly** was an American mathematician who worked in geometry and graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Kelly became Chairman of the Mathematics department at Santa Barbara in 1957.
* Kelly retired in 1982.
* Let us look briefly at some of the Kelly's mathematical papers, which were mainly on topics in geometry and graph theory, and at his books.
* In this paper Kelly proved the conjecture for the case of certain isometries of a class of finite metric spaces.
* Kelly showed that this theorem went over to entire subsets of Minkowski nnn-space.
* Examples of papers by Kelly on graph theory are A congruence theorem for trees published in the Pacific Journal in 1957, On some mappings related to graphs published in the same journal in 1964, and The minimal regular graph containing a given graph co-authored with Paul Erd≈ës and published in 1967.
* We mention three texts written by Kelly, each with a different co-author.
* Kelly's 1979 text Geometry and convexity was written jointly with Max L Weiss.
* The third text we mention is The non-Euclidean, hyperbolic plane : Its structure and consistency which Kelly wrote jointly with Gordon Matthews and published in 1981.
* Paul Kelly had a wonderful sense of language, the comic, the human tragi-comic condition, and the crucial role of timing in any enterprise.
* Paul was also a sports enthusiast who wished he'd been big enough to play football.

Born 26 June 1915, Riverside, California, USA. Died 15 July 1995, Santa Barbara, California, USA.
