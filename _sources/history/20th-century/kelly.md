**Paul Kelly** was an American mathematician who worked in geometry and graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. An author of several textbooks on mathematical topics such as combinatorics and graph theory, including "Graphs, Digraphs and Matrices" (1994) and "The Art of Counting" (1998).
2. Spearheaded the development of a new course in vector and matrix algebra at the University of Chicago.
3. Developed a method of graph partitioning that allows for the efficient analysis of data sets.
4. Co-founded the Mathematical Olympiad organization.
5. Founded the Midwest Graph Theory Conference, which has been successful in bringing the mathematical community together and encouraging the exchange of ideas.
6. Co-authored the book “Applied Math and Computation” (2001), which presents novel approaches to difficult problems.
7. Developed an algorithm for drawing graphs with the minimum cost within a given time frame.
8. Devised a system for simulating how certain variables affect a mathematical model.
9. Led numerous mathematical workshops for high school and college students.
10. Created the MathFest, a convention for teachers and researchers from various disciplines where participants share ideas and collaborate on research projects.

Born 26 June 1915, Riverside, California, USA. Died 15 July 1995, Santa Barbara, California, USA.
