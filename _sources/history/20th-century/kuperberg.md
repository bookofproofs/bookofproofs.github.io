**Krystyna Kuperberg** is a Polish mathematician who works in America. She is known for her work in dynamical systems, geometry and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Krystyna was brought up in Tarnów until she was 15 years old, when the family moved to Gdańsk on the northern coast of Poland.
* Krystyna decided in high school that she would study mathematics at university.
* Borsuk's lectures held another special significance for Krystyna, since a fellow student at these lectures was Wlodzimierz Kuperberg, whom Krystyna married.
* After graduating, Krystyna Kuperberg undertook research at the University of Warsaw under Borsuk's supervision and, in 1966, she was awarded her Master's degree.
* Her husband went on to complete his Ph.D. in mathematics but Krystyna stopped her studies with the Master's Degree.
* Her first child Greg Kuperberg was born in 1967.
* Two years later, in 1969, the Kuperberg family left Poland and went to live in Sweden.
* Krystyna's second child, Anna, was born in 1969 not long after the family moved to Sweden.
* In 1972 the Kuperberg family moved again, this time to the United States and Krystyna took up officially the graduate work she had begun in Warsaw under Borsuk's supervision.
* In 1971 Krystyna and Wlodzimierz published the joint paper On weakly zero-dimensional mappings.
* In 1972, the year Krystyna register as a research student at Rice University in Houston, Texas, she published An isomorphism theorem of the Hurewicz-type in Borsuk's theory of shape in Fundamenta Mathematicae.
* Also in 1974 both Krystyna and her husband Wlodzimierz Kuperberg were appointed to permanent positions on the Faculty at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama.
* Krystyna Kuperberg has remained at Auburn University since she was appointed in 1974.
* In 1988 Kuperberg solved a problem relating to question of Knaster as to whether every homogeneous space is bihomogeneous.
* It was this question to which Kuperberg found a counter-example, announcing it in A homogeneous nonbihomogeneous continuum in 1988, and giving full details in On the bihomogeneity problem of Knaster published in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society.
* Kuperberg's most celebrated result, however, was discovered in 1993 and published in 1994 in A smooth counterexample to the Seifert conjecture in the Annals of Mathematics.
* Having written papers with her husband, Kuperberg went on to write papers with her son Greg who had also become a mathematician.
* In 1996 they published Generalized counterexamples to the Seifert conjecture which improved on Kuperberg's results from two years earlier.
* Kuperberg has already received several awards for her outstanding work and it is certain that she will receive further awards.

Born 17 July 1944, Tarnów, Poland.
