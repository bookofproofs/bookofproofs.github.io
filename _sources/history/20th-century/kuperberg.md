**Krystyna Kuperberg** is a Polish mathematician who works in America. She is known for her work in dynamical systems, geometry and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Krystyna decided in high school that she would study mathematics at university.
* After graduating, Krystyna Kuperberg undertook research at the University of Warsaw under Borsuk's supervision and, in 1966, she was awarded her Master's degree.
* In 1971 Krystyna and Wlodzimierz published the joint paper On weakly zero-dimensional mappings.
* In 1972, the year Krystyna register as a research student at Rice University in Houston, Texas, she published An isomorphism theorem of the Hurewicz-type in Borsuk's theory of shape in Fundamenta Mathematicae.
* Krystyna Kuperberg has remained at Auburn University since she was appointed in 1974.
* In 1988 Kuperberg solved a problem relating to question of Knaster as to whether every homogeneous space is bihomogeneous.
* It was this question to which Kuperberg found a counter-example, announcing it in A homogeneous nonbihomogeneous continuum in 1988, and giving full details in On the bihomogeneity problem of Knaster published in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society.
* Kuperberg's most celebrated result, however, was discovered in 1993 and published in 1994 in A smooth counterexample to the Seifert conjecture in the Annals of Mathematics.
* In 1996 they published Generalized counterexamples to the Seifert conjecture which improved on Kuperberg's results from two years earlier.
* Kuperberg has already received several awards for her outstanding work and it is certain that she will receive further awards.

Born 17 July 1944, Tarn√≥w, Poland.
