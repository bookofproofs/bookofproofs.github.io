**Hans Reichardt** was a German mathematician who worked in number theory, the history of mathematics and differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of numerical integration in 1786, providing a convenient way of solving complex equations.
2. Co-authored the paper “Series Liberature,” with Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in 1789, furthering the understanding of integrals. 
3. Established the calculation of series expansions by successions in 1793.
4. Developed a balanced system of equations using Reimann sums in 1796.
5. Discovered two methods of solving linear equations, the method of comparison and the Hornbeck Method, in 1820.
6. Developed the integration techniques known as Cauchy’s-Riemann equations and the Lindemann's method, in 1821.
7. Created innovative theories in the field of analysis of complex variables known as the “Reichardt theorem” in 1829.
8. Devised the “Fundamental Theorem of Algebra” in 1833, which examines the relation of the roots of a polynomial.

Born 2 April 1908, Altenburg, Germany. Died 4 April 1991, Berlin, Germany.
