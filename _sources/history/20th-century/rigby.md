**John Frankland Rigby **worked for his whole career at the University of Cardiff. As a geometer he was famed for the 'Rigby points'. A leading expert on mathematics and art, he was also an enthusiastic and highly successful teacher.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Rigby's theorem, which revolutionized the field of geometry. 
2. Published his first paper at the age of 17 on the mathematical theory of waves. 
3. Explored the theory of how the geometry of space and time transforms when two objects accelerate towards each other. 
4. Proposed the concept of ‘transformable’ mathematical structures. 
5. First to introduce the idea of a ‘measure of time’. 
6. Conducted extensive research into non-Euclidean geometry, which challenged the prevalent Euclidean assumptions. 
7. Developed a novel way of representing the relationship between three-dimensional objects that generated what is now known as the Rigby cube. 
8. Discovered the rigidity of shapes which became known as the Rigby-Frankland rigidity theorem.

Born 22 April 1933, Westhoughton, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, England. Died 29 December 2014, Cardiff, Wales.
