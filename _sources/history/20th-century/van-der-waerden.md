**Van der Waerden** was a Dutch mathematician best known for his "Modern Algebra" text-book. He also worked on topology and on the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first person to identify and classify the major types of contemporary algebra in his influential book Modern Algebra (1930).
2. He introduced the van der Waerden numbers that measure the extent to which mathematical expressions can be simplified.
3. He proved a mathematical theorem, van der Waerden’s theorem, which states that in any coloring of the edges of the complete graph K_n there is at least one monochromatic triangle.
4. He was the first to show that the first-order logic of the natural numbers could not be both complete and decidable. 
5. He formulated the conjecture which is now known as the van der Waerden conjecture and which states that the largest monochromatic k-term arithmetic progressions with common difference d in the set of natural numbers is given by $$f(k,d) = \left( \frac{k-2}{d} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{k-2}{d} +1\right)$$
6. He made significant contributions to the theory of Lie algebras, linear algebra, and the foundations of geometry.

Born 2 February 1903, Amsterdam, Netherlands. Died 12 January 1996, Zürich, Switzerland.
