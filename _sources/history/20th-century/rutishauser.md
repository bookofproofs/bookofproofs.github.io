**Heinz Rutishauser** was a Swiss mathematician who worked in numerical mathematics and computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Zürich machine, a programmable calculator that was used to evaluate partial differential equations.
2. Created the Interpolation Technique, a method used to accurately compute intermediate values in polynomials.
3. Developed the Gauss–Seidel method, a numerical technique for solving partial differential equations.
4. Proposed the use of recursive algorithms and vector notation, which revolutionized mathematical computation.
5. Developed the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, which reduces the time required to calculate a discrete Fourier transform.
6. Pioneered the use of computers for scientific applications and was one of the first to use computers to study complex data sets.
7. Was a founding member of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the ETH Zurich, where he published several major works on mathematical computation.

Born 30 January 1918, Weinfelden, Switzerland. Died 10 November 1970, Zürich, Switzerland.
