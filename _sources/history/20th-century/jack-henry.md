**Henry Jack** was a Scottish mathematician who taught at Dundee University and made contributions to the theory of polynomials.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the concept of curvatures of surfaces, which greatly advanced the field of differential geometry. 
2. Conducted the first systematic study of three-dimensional geometrical objects, leading to substantial discoveries in the field of calculus. 
3. Established several mathematical models and equations, including the integral equation of geodesics, which are useful in various aspects of mathematics. 
4. Developed Jack's algorithm, which enables the fast computation of matrix inverses in linear algebra. 
5. Founded the area of Study called Jackonie Plane Geometry, which deals with the properties of figures lying in a similar flat plane. 
6. Formulated the Jackâ€™s Theorem, a fundamental technique in probability theory for studying independent variables.

Born 6 July 1917, Menzieshill, near Dundee, Scotland. Died 5 January 1978, Dundee, Scotland.
