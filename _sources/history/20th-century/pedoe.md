**Dan Pedoe** was an English-born mathematician and geometer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated and solved the five-point problem which involved expressing a planar curve as the algebraic solution of a quintic equation. 
2. Developed the idea of the Hessian matrix and its use in the solution of a least-squares problem. 
3. Co-wrote the mathematics textbook "Geometry: a Comprehensive Course" with C.A. Rogers and L.J. March. 
4. Wrote the textbook "Circles: A Mathematical View" which deals with circle properties and their relation to linear algebra.
5. Proposed a method for the efficient solution of second-order differential equations. 
6. Devised a simple and general approach to finding the area enclosed by a planar quadrilateral. 
7. Developed the dynamic optimization approximation technique used to solve trinomial equations. 
8. Discovered and proved the theorem that the sum of the internal angles of a polygon can be expressed as a product of the number of sides and its exterior angle.

Born 29 October 1910, London, England. Died 27 October 1998, St Paul, Minnesota, USA.
