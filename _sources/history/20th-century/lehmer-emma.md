**Emma Markovna Lehmer** was a Russian-born mathematician known for her work on reciprocity laws in algebraic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Although Emma Trotskaia only became Emma Lehmer in 1928 after she married, for the sake of simplicity we will use her married name throughout this article.
* Emma wrote many years later that she lost all interest in returning to the town of her birth after it was given such an unpleasant sounding name as Kuybyshev, but it reverted to its original name of Samara in 1991, a move which doubtless was strongly approved by Lehmer.
* In fact Lehmer spent less than four years in Samara before her father was appointed as the Far East representative of the sugar company and posted to Harbin, Manchuria.
* In Harbin, Lehmer was tutored at home until she was 14 when a new community school opened.
* It was at this school that Lehmer first developed her love of mathematics, encouraged by a superb mathematics teacher who had been an engineer in Moscow.
* On the one hand this led to the creation of the new school, but on the other hand it made Lehmer realise that returning to Russia to study at university was going to be impossible.
* This enabled Lehmer to save enough money to make her education in the United States possible.
* Lehmer applied to Berkeley for entry: a university which had already accepted other students from Harbin, and she was offered a place for entry in 1924.
* Her favourite mathematics lecturer at Berkeley was Derrick Norman Lehmer and as well as taking several of his courses she did a research project with him on finding pseudosquares.
* It was at this time that she met his son Derrick Lehmer.
* She graduated with a B.A. degree with honours in Mathematics in 1928 and in the same year she married Dick Lehmer (as Derrick Lehmer was called).
* Emma and Dick then set out on a tour which began in the redwood forest, went on to Japan, and then let Dick meet Emma's family before returning to Berkeley.
* While her husband progressed to obtaining this Ph.D. from Brown University, Emma continued working on her Master's Degree while she helped Dick by typing his thesis and working with him reading mathematics papers.
* The two Lehmers' life over the next few years involved moving from place to place as Dick Lehmer sought a permanent university post in the particularly difficult times of the Depression.
* Lehmer's first child Laura was born in 1932.
* After a spell at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, they moved to Lehigh University in Pennsylvania where Lehmer's second child Donald was born.
* While at Lehigh, Lehmer translated Pontryagin's important book Topological Groups from Russian into English.
* The Lehmers remained at Lehigh until 1940 except for the year 1938-39 which they spent in England visiting both the University of Cambridge and the University of Manchester.
* Emma Lehmer did not teach throughout this period as university rules prevented a husband and wife teaching in the same Department.
* An exception was made for a short time during the war years when the rule was relaxed and Lehmer did some teaching.
* Lehmer found that not having to teach was an advantage to her in giving her more time to work on her research.
* In fact her collaboration began as a three way one with Lehmer working with both her husband and her father-in-law.
* For example around 1930 the Lehmers had applied to the Carnegie Institution for funds to construct a computer to factorise numbers.
* Another joint project which Lehmer undertook with her husband was assisting Vandiver with his work on Fermat's Last Theorem, and together the Lehmers computed many Bernoulli numbers which Vandiver required in his work.
* As an example of other contributions Lehmer made to Fermat's Last Theorem she published On a resultant connected with Fermat's Last Theorem in 1935, then, jointly with her husband, On the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem in 1941.
* One topic which especially interested Lehmer was reciprocity laws.
* Lehmer was never unhappy with the role she played.
* This meeting will remain a lasting tribute to the Lehmers.

Born 6 November 1906, Samara, Russia. Died 7 May 2007, Berkeley, California, USA.
