**Emma Markovna Lehmer** was a Russian-born mathematician known for her work on reciprocity laws in algebraic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored over 65 mathematical papers, including fundamental work in the field of number theory.
2. Developed the Lehmer sieve, an algorithm for the prime number theorem.
3. Investigated the Riemann hypothesis and cyclicity of biquadrates.
4. Received the Mathematical Association of America Fowler Award for her "beautiful applications of elliptic functions." 
5. Made contributions to Bauer's prime number theorem and to linear forms in logarithms. 
6. Founded the Amelia Lehmer Prizes for outstanding miniconsultations at the Emory University mathematics competition. 
7. Developed the Lehmer code, a recursive sequence, in her 1990 paper “A Generating Function for the Number of Prime Divisors of a Number.” 
8. Discovered irreducible polynomials in finite fields which are now known as Lehmer polynomials.

Born 6 November 1906, Samara, Russia. Died 7 May2007, Berkeley, California, USA.
