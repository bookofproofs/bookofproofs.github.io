**Mollie Orshansky** was an American economist and statistician who developed the Orshansky Poverty Thresholds, used for measuring household incomes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the poverty thresholds used by the United States government to measure poverty levels.
2. Implemented the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) for the US government which incorporates additional components like taxes, child support, out-of-pocket medical costs, and other factors not considered in the poverty thresholds.
3. Conducted extensive analysis of the Social Security System including models to measure and analyze its long-term effects.
4. Developed the Orshansky Index as an easy-to-use measure of poverty used throughout the American welfare system.
5. Utilized multiple mathematical models to determine the prevalence of poverty and its effects on various populations.
6. Pioneered research in the area of how specific social factors play into the occurrence and persistence of poverty.
7. Constructed an actuarial model to analyze health and retirement programs used by the US.
8. Published articles in The American Statistician and Journal of the American Statistical Association on poverty measurement and income distribution.
