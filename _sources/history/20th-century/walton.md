**Ernest Walton** was an Irish physicist who won a Nobel Prize for his work on particle accelerators. He was a founder member of the Trinity College Dublin Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Walton was the first person in the world to split the atomic nucleus; an accomplishment which earned him the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics. 
2. His achievement was made possible by the development of a particle accelerator, also known as a Cockcroft-Walton generator, which he co-invented. 
3. Walton developed a mathematical model to improve the design of the particle accelerator.
4. He refined the understanding of alpha particles and their penetration into matter, contributing to the development of mathematical models of atomic structure. 
5. He created a mathematical description of the collective motion of particles in the accelerator, which became known as the Walton-Cockcroft equations. 
6. Walton developed a mathematical theory of radioactive transformation, which allowed him and John Cockcroft to accurately predict the energy and timings of radioactive particles produced in their atom-smashing experiments.

Born 6 October 1903, Abbeyside, County Waterford, Ireland. Died 25 June 1995, Belfast, Ireland.
