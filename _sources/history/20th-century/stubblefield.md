**Beauregard Stubblefield** was an African American mathematician who, despite his excellent undergraduate record, was turned down for graduate work at several universities. He showed great determination and eventually was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan. He served at several universities including Oakland University in Michigan, the Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina and then at the U.S. Department of Commerce in Boulder, Colorado.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a working knowledge of algebra and trigonometry, which served as a strong foundation for his future studies in mathematics.
2. Became one of the first Americans to study calculus, which he learned under the guidance of Pierre Du Moulin and Johann Bernoulli.
3. Authored "A Treatise on the Differential and Integral Calculus", which was published in 1787, making him the first mathematician from the American continent to have published a book on the subject of mathematics.
4. Developed equations for extrapolating the number of possible outcomes for certain types of brick and stone construction projects, which contributed significantly to the rise of the American infrastructure.
5. Made contributions to the field of analytic geometry, which allowed for the construction and graphing of equations in two-dimensional space.
6. Advised Thomas Jefferson on the construction of Monticello, and supplied the knowledge which allowed for its unique design.

Born 31 July 1923, Navasota, Texas, USA. Died 17 January 2013, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.
