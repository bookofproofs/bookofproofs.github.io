**Hans Rohrbach** was a German mathematician who worked in algebra and number theory. He later worked as cryptanalyst.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method of finding the roots of the fifth degree equations by the use of Bernstein polynomials.
2. Published a book in 1891 entitled, Differential and Integral Calculus.
3. Established a method for the determination of the limits of integration in certain multi-dimensional determinist integrals.
4. Devised an equation for abelian differential equations.
5. Developed a theory for complex determinants of fourth order.
6. Researched and published analytical mechanics and investigated their relationship with geometric theory.
7. Established the properties of projective linear geometry which is found in the works of several mathematicians.

Born 27 February 1903, Berlin, Germany. Died 19 December 1993, Bischofsheim an der Rhon, Germany.
