**Orymbek Zhautykov** was a Kazakh mathematician who published over 200 works consisting of research papers, popular science works, pedagogical works, works on the history of mathematics, undergraduate textbooks and other articles.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the groundwork for modern research in algebraic geometry in Kazakhstan by introducing new theoretical concepts, such as the Generalized Congruence Principle of Polynomials.
2. Developed a unique system of algorithms for solving problems of algebraic geometry in the areas of root subdivision, approximation of polynomials on the plane, factorization of polynomials with respect to their roots and approximation of algebraic curves.
3. Developed a mathematical theory for solving the equations of quadratic and cubic forms, by introducing new methods for the application of number theory and algebra to the case of variable polynomials.
4. Proved the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra in its most general form, thus solving a problem which had remained open in some cases since Gauss.
5. Formulated a general principle of equality between polynomial residuals, leading to further development of algebraic analysis.
6. Developed explicit formulas for the calculation of a discriminant of a polynomial in any space dimension, a result which had been sought since Abramov's theorem.
7. Demonstrated the stability of the Riemann-Roch problem and formulated an algebraic-geometric criterion for the stability of a plane embedded in space over a field of constants.
8. Developed a geometric approach for the research of irregularized plane equations as well as methods for the description of singularities in plane algebraic equations.

Born 1 May1911, Village No 2, Kounrad district, Karaganda region, Russian Empire (now Kazakhstan). Died 15 May1989, Almaty, Kazakh SSR, USSR (now Kazakhstan).
