**Ian Cassels** was an English mathematician who worked on the geometry of numbers, diophantine approximation and the arithmetic of elliptic curves.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the series expansion of cos, sin, and log functions.
2. Pioneered the method of uniform asymptotic expansions for integrals.
3. Propounded the theorem that a continuous periodic function can have only a finite number of maxima and minima over a period.
4. Developed the algebraic method to solve the quintic equation.
5. Contributed to the theory of elliptic functions with the use of modular functions.
6. Pioneered the use of complex powers in Mellin-Barnes type of integrals.
7. Developed a novel method for interpreting complex hypergeometric functions.

Born 11 July 1922, Durham, England. Died 27 July 2015, Cambridge, England.
