**Peter Henrici** was a Swiss mathematician best known who worked in the field of numerical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* By this time Henrici was working in the United States.
* In 1951 Henrici had gone to the United States where he obtained a position at the American University in Washington, D.C, and also was a visitor at the National Bureau of Standards.
* Let us look briefly at some of the classic texts that Henrici published.
* Another impressive text by Henrici Elements of numerical analysis appeared in 1964.
* These texts were rightly praise as remarkable achievements, but the high point of Henrici's writings must he the three volume work Applied and computational complex analysis.
* In 1964 Henrici was an invited plenary speaker at the sixteenth British Mathematical Colloquium held in Leicester and he lectured to the Colloquium on Some applications of the quotient-difference algorithm in classical analysis.
* Peter Henrici the man - his personality, his warmth and humour and modesty - will remain in our memories, as will for some of us his passion for music, the experience of listening to or playing with an extraordinarily gifted pianist.
* A Prize has been established to honour Henrici.
* This Prize is given to honour Peter Henrici who was such an eminent figure in Applied Mathematics and Numerical Analysis.

Born 13 September 1923, Basel, Switzerland. Died 13 March 1987, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.
