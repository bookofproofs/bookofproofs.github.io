**Peter Henrici** was a Swiss mathematician best known who worked in the field of numerical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Peter Henrici developed numerical methods such as the Henrici polynomials and the mesh selection process, which are used to solve partial differential equations efficiently. 
2. He made significant contributions to the study of nonlinear differential equations.
3. He played a role in successful efforts to rigorously quantify the stability of numerical methods.
4. He developed algorithms which allowed the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large matrices.
5. He made significant progress in the field of numerical analysis by introducing a new method for numerically solving hyperbolic partial differential equations.
6. He worked on pioneering applications of computers to mathematics, such as automatic differentiation.
7. He worked on developing computerized versions of mathematical theorems and formulas, which allowed for the easier transmission of complex mathematical ideas.

Born 13 September 1923, Basel, Switzerland. Died 13 March 1987, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.
