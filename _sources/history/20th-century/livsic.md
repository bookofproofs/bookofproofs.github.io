**Moshe Livsic** was a Ukrainian-born mathematician who worked in functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The family were Jewish and Livsic brought up in a very religious household.
* Livsic graduated from school in 1931 and, with a school friend, planned his future studies.
* However to be successful in the physical sciences Livsic and his friend would first have to become knowledgeable in mathematics.
* Livsic began studies at Odessa technical College aimed at his becoming a radio technician but, in 1933, he entered the Department of Physics and Mathematics at Odessa State University.
* Livsic took part in the functional analysis seminar and studied analytic functions.
* After working at Kirovograd, Livsic returned to Odessa to teach at the Hydrometerological Institute which was a minor institution.
* From 1957 until 1962 Livsic was head of mathematics at Kharkov Mining Institute, joining Akhiezer at Kharkov State University in 1962.
* His recent breakthroughs in the theory of characteristic functions for several commuting operators indicate that in spite of his seventy years, mathematically Moshe is still a young man.

Born 4 July 1917, Pokotilova (near Uman), Ukraine. Died 30 March 2007, Beâ€™er Scheva, Israel.
