**Thierry Aubin** was a French mathematician who was a leading expert on Riemannian geometry and non-linear partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Aubin submitted his thesis and graduated with a doctorate in 1969 but, in the previous year, he had already been appointed to the University of Lille.
* Philippe Delanoë attended Aubin's graduate course at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in 1976-77 and then became his doctoral student.
* This became known as the 'Yamabe problem' and it was something to which Aubin made substantial contributions.
* Aubin proved an important special case of the Calabi conjecture in Equations du type Monge-Ampère sur les variétés kählériennes compactes Ⓣ(Equations of the Monge-Ampere type on compact Kähler varieties).
* In fact in 1978 it was Shing-Tung Yau who extended Aubin's results and completed the proof of the Calabi conjecture which earned him a Fields medal in 1982.
* Professor Aubin has also written several books about geometric PDE that have a wide influence in geometric analysis.
* We consider Professor Aubin as one of the anchor in the field of geometric PDE in recent decades.
* Let us now look briefly at three important books published by Aubin.
* In 2001, Aubin published A course in differential geometry.
* Aubin was honoured with the award of the Prix Servant from the Academy of Sciences in 1982.
* Aubin applied these methods in novel ways to fully nonlinear equations, and to delicate semilinear variational problems.
* Thierry Aubin was one of the true leaders.
* Thierry Aubin was also a complex human being in search of new horizons.
* Philippe Delanoë completed this Ph.D. with Aubin as his advisor in June 1982.

Born 6 May 1942, Béziers, France. Died 21 March 2009, Paris, France.
