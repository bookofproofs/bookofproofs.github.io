Lars G책rding was a Swedish mathematician who studied partial differential equations and partial differential operators.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He received the prestigious Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2002 for his groundbreaking research in probability theory.
2. He was awarded the 1979 Fredholm Medal by the Gustavo Adolfo Royal Institute of Technology for his broad contributions to mathematics.
3. He proved a path-breaking theorem about the existence of martingale measures in 1983.
4. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2000.
