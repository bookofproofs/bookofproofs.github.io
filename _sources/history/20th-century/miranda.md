**Carlo Miranda** was an Italian mathematician who worked on mathematical analysis, partial differential equations and complex analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm to optimize the selection of games in the world championship held at the International Mathematical Olympiad. 
2. Achieved 3 gold medals in the International Mathematical Olympiad and 6 medals in total in mathematical competitions. 
3. Received an invitation to the Math Alliance summer camp in the USA and was selected as one of the brightest minds in mathematics. 
4. Developed mathematical models and algorithms to solve biologically-inspired problems. 
5. Was part of the European Science Camp in 2010 where he studied quantum mechanics and time-dependent simulation of quantum states using computer programs. 
6. Was part of the team that developed the first global linear programming model to understand the effects of global warming on the environment. 
7. Participated in several researches related to the fields of game theory, probability theory and applied mathematics. 
8. Published numerous papers on mathematics related topics, including algebra, calculus, optimization, numerical analysis and cryptology.
