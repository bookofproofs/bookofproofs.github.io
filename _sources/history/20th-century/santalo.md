**Luís Antoni Santaló** was a Spanish mathematician who worked on on convex sets and wrote some important Spanish text-books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a definition of affinely invariant measure on convex sets, now known as Santaló's measure. 
2. Correlated natural afﬁne invariance with Euclidean structure of convex sets.
3. Established a foundation for differential geometry of convex and related bodies. 
4. Pioneered in the field of kinematic geometry, or the geometry of planar and spatial motions. 
5. Proofed the equivalence of Brunn-Minkowski's theorem in the realm of integral geometry. 
6. Deﬁned several convex geometric notions, including Santaló's approximate centroid, Santaló's mean width, and Santaló's center of symmetry. 
7. Introduced the properties of cylindrical sets, which are fundamental concepts in the construction of formulas in integral geometry. 
8. Contributed to finite and integral calculus of variations, and developed a canonical representation for convex surfaces. 
9. Developed analytic formulas and estimates for integral geometry, including strict convex bodies and spherical convex bodies.
10. Proved a solution of Hausdorff's Problem in integral geometry, among other important results.

Born 9 October 1911, Girona, Spain. Died 22 November 2001, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
