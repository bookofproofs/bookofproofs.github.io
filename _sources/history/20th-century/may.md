**Kenneth May** was an American mathematician and historian of mathematics best known for founding the journal _Historia Mathematica_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Samuel May had married Eleanor Ownsworth Parkin in 1913 and they had two sons, Kenneth being the younger of the two.
* After the First World War Samuel May studied political science and was appointed as an instructor at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, before being appointed to the political science department at Berkeley in 1921.
* Eleanor, Kenneth's mother, had been born in England.
* Kenneth attended the Music Education School in Portland, Oregon, before his father was appointed to Berkeley.
* After the family moved to Berkeley in 1921, Kenneth attended several schools there.
* May entered the University of California, Berkeley, intending to major in mathematics but also taking a wide range of subjects.
* Evans had spotted May's talents soon after becoming the Head of Department and encouraged him to think about research in applying statistics to problems of national economic planning.
* This was an area that interested both Evans and May, so May studied for his Master's Degree in session 1936-37 with this in mind, taking courses in mathematics, economics and physics.
* His father, who was a professor of political science at Berkeley, approved of May taking up this fellowship.
* May fitted these criteria well and he was given the task of studying how science and technology was funded and organised in Russia, and what impact science and technology had on the economy and on politics.
* This would provide an excellent background to the topic that May was intending to research for his doctorate.
* This is the first sign that May was becoming interested in the history of mathematics, the topic for which he is best remembered today.
* The relationship was made more difficult since May's father and Ruth's father had disliked each other for years and also Ruth McGovney was six years older than her husband.
* May resigned his fellowship but, since his new wife was in Europe for a year on academic leave, they decided to continue to remain in Europe for the duration of her leave.
* Kenneth and Ruth May spent the winter of 1938-39 in Paris where May continued his studies of statistics and economics at the Sorbonne.
* In the summer of 1939 they left Paris on a visit to the Soviet Union and May discussed his ideas with academics in Moscow, Kiev and Kharkov.
* After returning to Berkeley, May was appointed as an assistant at the University teaching courses on financial mathematics, analytic geometry and calculus.
* May's role in the Communist Party led to a bitter dispute with his father.
* May now became fully occupied in Communist activities.
* May tried to enlist but his Communist affiliations made the authorities reluctant to see him serve in the U.S. army.
* On 19 May 1944, while home on leave, he married Jacqueline Bromley whom he had met around 1940 while working for the Communist Party.
* Sent to Italy with the U.S. Army, May served with great bravery and courage.
* From 1946 May published on mathematical economics with papers such as The aggregation problem for a one-industry model (1946),Probabilities of certain election results (1948), Economics and technology: Production functions (1950) and Econometric models of the national economy (1952).
* In 1964 May left Carleton College and spent two years at Berkeley where he was appointed as a visiting scholar and research mathematician.
* In 1968 May attended the International Congress on the History of Science in Paris and discussed with Rene Taton and Adolph Pavlovich Yushkevich the need for a specialist journal on the history of mathematics.
* Indeed at the following International Congress on the History of Science in Moscow in 1971, a commission was set up and May was elected as chairman.
* May was the editor and, remarkably, his efforts had produced about 700 subscribers to this first issue from 39 countries.
* May wrote the paper What is good history and who should do it?
* In the same year that Historia Mathematica was founded, May founded the Canadian Society for History and Philosophy of Mathematics.
* Sadly, however, May's health took a turn for the worse.
* Despite taking these precautions, May died from a heart attack in December 1977.

Born 8 July 1915, Portland, Oregon, USA. Died 1 December 1977, Toronto, Canada.
