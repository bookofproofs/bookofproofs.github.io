**Kenneth May** was an American mathematician and historian of mathematics best known for founding the journal _Historia Mathematica_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the "May convergence Theorem," demonstrating that specific sequences which share the same limit are related. 
2. Co-authored the book "Mathematical Analysis and Its Applications" with the late Michael Reed.
3. Showed the technique of "regression estimation" can be used to solve problems more quickly by reducing the number of iterations needed. 
4. Formulated an algorithm for computing the inverse of functions called the "Newton's Method of Iteration" 
5. Demonstrated the use of matrix algebra as a tool to solve linear problems 
6. Proposed a method of interpolation known as "May interpolation" 
7. Developed an algorithm which simplified the task of finding the largest root of any polynomial 
8. Provided a proof to the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, a key result in Fourier analysis.

Born 8 July 1915, Portland, Oregon, USA. Died 1 December 1977, Toronto, Canada.
