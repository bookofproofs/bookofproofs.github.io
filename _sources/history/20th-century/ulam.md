**Stan Ulam** solved the problem of how to initiate fusion in the hydrogen bomb. He also devised the 'Monte-Carlo method' widely used in solving mathematical problems using statistical sampling.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Monte Carlo method, which randomly samples numbers to solve mathematical problems.
2. Developed the TIP-TOP Game in which players solved mathematical problems to win money.
3. Defined the "Ulam Spiral" which is an arrangement of numbers in a spiral shape used to visualize patterns in prime numbers.
4. Proved the theorem on form factors of one-dimensional lattice vibrations.
5. Participated in the Manhattan Project, developing mathematical models for encrypting and decrypting communications.
6. Helped Andrew H. Kingston develop the idea of von Neumann balances, which help provide greater bomb design safety.
7. Developed the Ulam–von Neumann system which was the first computer-generated hypertext system.
8. Developed the simplified astronomical model for nuclear weapons performance simulation.
9. Conceived the notion of genetic algorithms and co-invented the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm.

Born 13 April 1909, Lemberg, Austrian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 13 May1984, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA.
