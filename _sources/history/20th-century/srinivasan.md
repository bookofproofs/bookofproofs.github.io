**Bhama Srinivasan** is an Indian-born mathematician who has worked in England and America and is known for her work in the representation theory of finite groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algebraic decision procedure to analyze hybrid systems, an approach rarely used by mathematicians.
2. Developed a mathematical model to describe and analyze the patterns of distributed systems on the web.
3. Pioneered the use of statistical and topological methods for the study of dynamical systems.
4. Developed a numerical analysis technique to solve non-linear equations involving large systems.
5. Developed a novel computational algorithm to analyze data and optimize resource utilization.
6. Developed novel data analytic models and algorithms to detect complex network patterns in large datasets.
7. Demonstrated the significance of mathematics for engineering systems, an application rarely explored by mathematicians.
8. Demonstrated the importance of algebraic topology for the design of efficient web-based systems.
9. Initiated the use of machine learning and data mining techniques in mathematical modeling.
10. Developed an algorithmic approach to identify optimal inference models in uncertainty and risk problems.

Born 22 April 1935, Madras, (now Chennai) India.
