**Taro Morishima** was a Japanese mathematician who worked in algebra and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* There was a major earthquake and fire in 1923 and when Morishima entered the Department of Mathematics of the College of Science of the university it had been reconstructed.
* Morishima had been very active in mathematical research from the time he graduated in 1928.
* All his papers are full of good ideas but they are extremely difficult to read since Morishima did not present enough detail.
* Morishima's high research activity seems to have greatly lessened after 1935.
* In 1942 Morishima was appointed as professor at the Army Military Academy.
* We mentioned above that Morishima published one paper on Fermat's Last Theorem in 1952.
* Finally let us mention Morishima's 1966 paper On the second factor of the class number of the cyclotomic field.

Born 22 April 1903, Wakayama, Japan. Died 8 August 1989, Tokyo, Japan.
