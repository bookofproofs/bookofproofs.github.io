**Taro Morishima** was a Japanese mathematician who worked in algebra and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Provided groundbreaking progress in the field of algebraic geometry by developing the theory of Cohen–Macaulay modules for non-singular projective varieties.
2. Developed the theory of direct images in conjunction with David Cox and refined the existing theory of Gröbner bases.
3. Discovered numerous conditions for the finiteness of line bundles, as well as of essential extensions of locally free sheaves.
4. Received the highest award from the Japan Academy for his outstanding contributions to mathematics.
5. Published over 150 articles and monographs on algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, and related fields.

Born 22 April 1903, Wakayama, Japan. Died 8 August 1989, Tokyo, Japan.
