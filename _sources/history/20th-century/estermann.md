**Theodor Estermann ** was a German mathematician who worked in the field of analytic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Leo and Rachel Estermann had two children, the eldest being Immanuel who was born in Berlin on 31 March 1900.
* Immanuel Estermann (1900-1973) became an outstanding physicist.
* Leo Estermann was a Zionist, a passionate believer in the formation of a state of Israel, and strongly opposed to the integration of Jews into the societies in which they lived.
* In fact he had named his son Theodor after Theodor Herzl (1860-1904) who is considered as the founder of Zionism.
* Theodor's first schooling was in Hamburg where, from 1908, he attended the Talmud-Torah School, the oldest Jewish school in Hamburg founded in 1805.
* Theodor felt happier in the state primary than he had in the Talmud-Torah School.
* The Estermanns became Turkish subjects and both their children attended school in Jerusalem.
* Immanuel attended a school where he was able to undertake practical science experiments in laboratories but the school that Theodor attended did not have such facilities for science.
* It seems that this difference between the schools may have led to Immanuel becoming fascinated by chemistry (he later moved to physics) while Theodor developed a passion for mathematics.
* Because of this, Leo Estermann arranged for his son Theodor to be apprenticed to a farmer after he graduated from the Hamburg high school.
* He persuaded Estermann's father that he should let his son attend university.
* Estermann entered the University of Göttingen, the leading German university for mathematics, and there he attended courses by David Hilbert and Edmund Landau.
* Estermann, however, missed his family and after a few months, arranged to continue his studies of mathematics at the University of Hamburg.
* Theodor Estermann's brother Immanuel became a lecturer in physics at the University of Hamburg in 1922 and Theodor undertook research towards his doctorate advised by Rademacher.
* Now although Rademacher was by this time turning towards number theory and Estermann's interests were in that area after attending Edmund Landau's lectures in Göttingen, Rademacher still did not feel confident enough to suggest a number theory topic to Estermann; instead, he suggested a problem in measure theory.
* Estermann was awarded his doctorate in 1925 for his thesis Über Carathéodorys und Minkowskis Verallgemeinerungen des Laengenbegriffs Ⓣ(On Carathéodory's and Minkowski's generalizations of quantity terms) and, in the same year, he published a paper with the same title as his thesis.
* While Estermann worked for his doctorate at Hamburg, his father had returned to Palestine which was by this time being administered by the British.
* After he completed his doctorate, Estermann joined his father in Palestine.
* Now Estermann had relatives in England for his mother's sister Sarah Brenner, who was also a corset maker, was living in London.
* In fact Estermann had visited her for a holiday in 1924 while he was a research student at Hamburg.
* This was a highly productive period for Estermann  with papers: Über den Vektorenbereich eines konvexen Körpers Ⓣ(On the vector field of a convex body) (submitted September 1927); On the Representations of a Number as the Sum of Three Products (submitted April 1928); and On the Divisor-Problem in a Class of Residues (submitted July 1928).
* Although mathematically this had been a highly productive period for Estermann, he found it difficult to live on the small amount of money that his father was able to send him.
* Back in Hamburg before taking up the position in London, Estermann sent off his paper On the Representations of a Number as the Sum of Two Products (a 2-part paper, the first part submitted June 1929, second part November 1929).
* Being a Jew, Estermann's brother Immanuel lost his position at the University of Hamburg in 1933 when the Nazi party came to power.
* Theodor Estermann was an invited speaker at the Colloquium on the 'Theory of Numbers' held at the University of Bristol in June 1935.
* This was an important occasion for him since the lectures given at this meeting by Hans Heilbronn on Waring's problem led to Estermann making some important contributions over the following years, see for example his paper On Waring's problem for fourth and higher powers (1937).
* Estermann married Tamara K E Pringsheim towards the end of 1936; they had five girls and one boy.
* Estermann published Introduction to Modern Prime Number Theory in 1952.
* Estermann published the undergraduate text Complex Numbers and Functions in 1962.
* It must be difficult for readers who have never met Estermann to appreciate the author's personality.
* very inadequate and marred by serious misconception.' Such language might remind one of a certain type of political polemicist, but when uttered by Estermann it sounded more like an apology, addressed to us students by a mathematician, for the shortcomings of his co-workers.
* Klaus Roth recalls from his research student days that his supervisor, Dr Estermann, could still demonstrate faultless handstands with the same facility with which he made his many erudite (but apt) quotations from Shakespeare and Gothe.
* In 1965, four years before he retired, University College London promoted Estermann to professor.

Born 5 February 1902, Neubrandenburg, Germany. Died 29 November 1991, London, England.
