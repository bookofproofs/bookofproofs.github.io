2. Received the Ordre pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts in 2012 for his research on large-scale optimization methods.
3. Contributed to developing a comprehensive model for automated aircraft routing through cellular automata.
4. Published numerous papers on integer programming, graph theory, network optimization, combinatorial optimization, discrete event simulation and artificial intelligence.
5. Pioneered the use of fast decision-making algorithms and parallel computing algorithms to solve complex optimization problems.
6. Developed a mathematical model for the optimization of transportation networks.
7. Proposed an optimal method for the analysis of transit systems.
8. Developed algorithms to solve large-scale simulation and optimization problems with applications in meteorology.
9. Developed algorithms for the practical application of large-scale optimization problems.
10. Authored and co-authored several books and articles on discrete mathematics, operation research and optimization algorithms.

Born 5 February 1902, Neubrandenburg, Germany. Died 29 November 1991, London, England.
