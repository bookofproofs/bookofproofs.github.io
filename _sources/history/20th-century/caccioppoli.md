**Renato Caccioppoli** was an Italian mathematician, known for his contributions to mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the weak- and strong-type convergence criteria in the study of quasilinear partial differential equations. 
2. Pioneered the introduction of notions of weak derivatives in functional analysis.
3. Introduced and developed the notion of special type of solutions of partial differential equations, called approximate solutions.
4. Co-authored a foundational book on the “Calculus of Variations and its Applications.”
5. Dealt comprehensive studies to the theories of nonlinear hyperbolic systems and equations.
6. Discovered and introduced new approaches to the integration of integer valued functions of several variables.
7. Proposed a new mathematical method for studying the stability of solutions of Volterra equations.
8. Pioneered the notion of concentration functions in the analysis of nonlinear equations.

Born 20 January 1904, Naples, Italy. Died 8 May1959, Naples, Italy.
