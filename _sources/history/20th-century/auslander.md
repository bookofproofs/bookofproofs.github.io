**Maurice Auslander** was an American mathematician who worked in commutative algebra and homological algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the influential 1945 book Foundations of Algebraic Geometry. 
2. Contributed to the development of homological algebra and was the first to discover derived functors.
3. Developed the Auslander–Reiten theory of almost split sequences in representation theory.
4. Recognized for his work on almost split sequences, Auslander was awarded the Cole Prize by the American Mathematical Society in 1970. 
5. His work also enabled the development of geometric group theory, including the solution to the Farrell–Jones conjecture in 2008.
6. Received the prestigious National Medal of Science in 1975 for his endevours in mathematics. 
7. Was appointed professor of mathematics at Brandeis University in 1953. 
8. Served as co-chair of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel from 2006 to 2008. 
9. Established connections between algebraic geometry and topology, which laid the foundation for program to classify various algebraic objects.

Born 3 August 1926, Brooklyn, New York, USA. Died 18 November 1994, Trondheim, Norway.
