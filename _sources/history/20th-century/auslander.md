**Maurice Auslander** was an American mathematician who worked in commutative algebra and homological algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Both Charles Auslander and Ida emigrated to the United States in 1907 when they were babies.
* Maurice had a younger brother Louis, born in Brooklyn, New York, on 12 July 1928.
* Louis Auslander also became a prominent  mathematician and has a biography in this archive.
* Maurice Auslander was educated in Brooklyn, New York, where he completed both his primary and secondary education.
* After a year as an Instructor at Chicago University, Auslander was appointed as an Instructor at the University of Michigan.
* Auslander's two papers in this series contain the now standard result that the global dimension of a ring can be computed from knowledge of the cyclic modules.
* In 1957 Auslander was appointed as an Assistant Professor at Brandeis University.
* After holding this post for a year, Auslander was awarded an NSF Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship which enabled him to spend the academic year 1961-62 at the University of Paris.
* Auslander was invited to give a special lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm in 1962.
* Returning to Brandeis in 1962, Auslander was promoted to full Professor in 1963, a position that he held until his death in 1994.
* Travel was one of Auslander's loves and he spent time in many different parts of the world holding visiting positions at many universities.
* In 1978-79 Auslander made the first of several visits to the University of Trondheim in Norway, on this occasion as a Guggenheim Fellow.
* It is interesting to note that half of Auslander's publications have a co-author from Trondheim.
* It is fitting that Auslander ended his days while travelling.
* When Maurice Auslander entered representation theory he was already a widely known mathematician with important contributions in commutative and homological algebra.
* The influence of Maurice Auslander was not limited to his papers.
* They show clearly the insight and influence of Auslander on the directions and developments of representation theory of Artin algebras.
* We list Auslander's books: Anneaux de Gorenstein, et torsion en alg√®bre commutative (1967), (with Mark Bridger) Stable module theory (1969), Representation dimension of Artin algebras (1971), Representation theory of Artin algebras (1972), (with David A Buchsbaum) Groups, Rings, Modules (1974), Categorical methods in the representation theory of Artin rings (1975), and (with Idun Reiten and Sverre O Smalo) Representation theory of Artin algebras (1995).
* The main aim of this book is to illustrate how the theory of almost split sequences (Auslander-Reiten sequences) is used in the study of finitely generated modules over Artin algebras.
* Smalo and Oyvind Solberg, contain most of the articles and some monographs by the well-known algebraist Maurice Auslander, who died in 1994.
* One should thank the editors, all of whom were longstanding collaborators of Auslander, for the work involved in editing these volumes.
* They are a must for any algebraist working in the areas mentioned above to see all the important contributions by Auslander, most of them very timely even today, and some of them more timely than when they were written.
* In 1987 the journal Communications in Algebra devoted the first two parts of volume 15 to papers honouring Auslander's 60th  birthday.
* The Maurice Auslander Memorial Conference was held at Brandeis University in 1995 and the proceedings of the 1994 conference 'Representation theory of algebras' was dedicated to his memory when published in 1996.

Born 3 August 1926, Brooklyn, New York, USA. Died 18 November 1994, Trondheim, Norway.
