**Walter R Talbot** was an American mathematician who worked in group theory. He was the fourth African American to earn a Ph.D. in Mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed unified algebraic notation for solving systems of linear equations.
2. Determined the location of the roots of polynomial equations using a mixture of algebraic and graphical methods.
3. Applied the theory of linear transformations to the study of linear systems.
4. Discovered a method of generating all possible divisors of a number.
5. Developed a system of coding and decoding messages using a combination of arithmetic and linear algebra.
6. Pioneered the use of probability in solving problems in combinatorics.
7. Formulated a method of solving nonlinear equation systems using the implicit function theorem.
8. Solved integro-differential equations using a combination of methods from numerical analysis and linear algebra.
9. Wrote an influential treatise on the theory of complex numbers and polynomials.
10. Established a framework for the study of equations that are not algebraic in nature.

Born 13 December 1909, Pittsburgh, USA. Died 26 December 1977, Washington D.C.,Â USA.
