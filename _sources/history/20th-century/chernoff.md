**Herman Chernoff** is an American mathematician and statistician who worked in sequential analysis and optimal design.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Cramer-Chernoff theorem, a fundamental mathematical result used in probability theory and statistics.
2. Proved the Chernoff bound, an important result in probability concerning the deviation of sums of independent random variables.
3. Devised a method for comparing the shapes of two distributions, called the Chernoff distance. 
4. Developed an exact sequence of tests for multiple hypothesis testing, called the Chernoff procedure.
5. Discovered the Chernoff faces, which are a graphical representation of multivariate data. 
6. Came up with Chernoff's theorem, which provides a general approach to Stochastic Approximation 
7. propounded several Chernoff-type inequalities determining the upper and lower bounds of probability distributions.

Born 1 July 1923, New York City, New York, USA.
