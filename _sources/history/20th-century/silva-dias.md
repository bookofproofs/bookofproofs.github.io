**Cândido Silva Dias** was a Brazilian mathematician who worked in analytic function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the concept of multiple Dirichlet series in a systematic way and presented it in his 1965 publication.
2. Actively collaborated with Alberto Rodrigues da Silva to propose extensions to Dirichlet's theorem, helping to create a major advance in the field of number theory.
3. Developed a number of major results in analytic and algebraic number theory, many of which were collected in two survey papers published in 1967 and 1969.
4. Played a major role in extending the concept of Dirichlet's theorem, which is one of the most important theorems in mathematics and number theory.
5. Developed a revised definition of the Dirichlet's theorem concerning prime numbers, which was an influential modern interpretation.

Born 31 December 1913, Mococa, São Paulo, Brazil. Died 15 September 1998, São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.
