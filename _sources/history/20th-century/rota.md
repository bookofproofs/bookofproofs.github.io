**Gian-Carlo Rota** was an Italian-born American mathematician and philosopher.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the Rota-Kutenmaa Definite Sums Algorithm which simplified and unified a number of existing summation methods.
2. Developed the theory of optical constants.
3. Co-authored several books and papers related to combinatorics, algebraic geometry and classical mechanics.
4. First to propose the application of algebraic topology to the study of computer data structures.
5. Pioneered the theory of non-commutative analysis and made important discoveries in several areas including the foundations of probability theory.
6. Proposed the "Feynman-Rota Axioms" for a consistent foundation of quantum mechanics.
7. Developed a new class of polynomials, the Sheffer sequence polynomials, to study probability distributions.
8. Formulated the theory of umbral calculus, a distinctive extension of partial differential equations.
9. Made a significant contribution to the study of differential equations on manifolds, extending theorems of the original Cartan-Kahler theory.
10. Wrote an important paper on harmonic analysis of several variables that introduced the notion of a ‘proximate axiomatization’.

Born 27 April 1932, Vigevano, Italy. Died 18 April 1999, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
