**Gian-Carlo Rota** was an Italian-born American mathematician and philosopher.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Giovanni Rota was a prominent anti-fascist and his name appears on a death list constructed by Mussolini.
* Gian-Carlo was born into a talented family in Vigevano, many members of his family had achieved fame in their areas of expertise, for example one of Gian-Carlo's uncles, Flaiano, wrote scripts for Federico Fellini's films, including La Dolce Vita.
* Gian-Carlo was educated in Italy up to the age of thirteen in 1945.
* Giovanni Rota took his family to northern Italy where they hide for a time before crossing the border into Switzerland.
* The family eventually escaped to Ecuador where Gian-Carlo completed his secondary school education.
* The positive side to this remarkable escape story was that Rota was fluent in English, Italian, Spanish and French.
* Rota entered the United States in 1950 at the age of eighteen to undertake his university studies.
* After graduating, Rota entered Yale University where he studied for his Master's Degree in Mathematics which was awarded in 1954.
* In this same year that he was awarded his doctorate, Rota married Teresa Rond√≥n and he received a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to undertake research at the Courant Institute at New York University.
* After spending the year 1956-57 in New York, Rota was appointed as Benjamin Peirce Instructor at Harvard University.
* With the exception of two years, 1965 to 1967, when he was at the Rockefeller University, Rota remained at MIT for the rest of his career.
* Rota was given the title Professor of Applied Mathematics at MIT but in 1972 his title was changed to Professor of Applied Mathematics and Philosophy.
* Rota had a long association with the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory where he enjoyed being with his friend Ulam and collaborating with him.
* Rota was also a consultant with the Rand Corporation from 1966 to 1971 and with the Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1969 to 1973.
* As we have indicated above, Rota worked on functional analysis for his doctorate and, up to about 1960, he wrote a series of papers on operator theory.
* These papers seem to have led Rota away from operator theory and into the area of combinatorics.
* His first major work on combinatorics, which was to change the direction of the whole subject, was On the Foundations of Combinatorial Theory which Rota published in 1964.
* Rota received the Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society in 1988.
* Rota observes that combinatorics is providing the essential continuing link between mathematics and the sciences: biology (structure of large molecules), linguistics (context-free languages, automata theory), physics (statistical mechanics, phase transition problems, elementary particles).
* Rota received many awards for his outstanding contributions to numerous areas.
* Rota died in his sleep and was found in bed on the afternoon of 19 April 1999.

Born 27 April 1932, Vigevano, Italy. Died 18 April 1999, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
