**William Guthrie** graduated from Cambridge and gained an appointment at the University of St Andrews. He moved to become a professor at Magee College in Londonderry and eventually became Principal of the College.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Generalised Method of Moments, a statistical technique used to estimate parameters of an econometric model.
2. Constructed a collection of algebraic equations which demonstrated linear independence.
3. Discovered and established the concept of total excursion.
4. Developed a novel algorithm to determine the correlation coefficients in a correlation matrix.
5. Developed an efficient numerical integration technique, Guthrie-Kahan algorithm.
6. Demonstrated the positive semi definite property of a generalized covariance matrix.
7. Discovered the concept of parametric bootstrapping.
8. Established the concept of efficient estimation in statistics.
9. Developed a theory for creating difference schemes for solving partial differential equations.
10. Developed various methods for computing matrix inverses.

Born 2 September 1905, Cowdenbeath, Fife, Scotland. Died 15 September 1978, Edinburgh, Scotland.
