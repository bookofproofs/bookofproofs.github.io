**Mikhail Postnikov** was a Soviet mathematician who worked in algebraic and differential topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Postnikov's classification theory, which provides an algebraic description of the integrability of Hamiltonian systems.
2. Advanced the study of multidimensional integrable systems and their solutions by means of matrix algebra.
3. Made contributions to the core theory of integrable systems, including the formulation of the Hamilton-Jacobi theorem.
4. Established the theory of extremal curves on multidimensional manifolds, known as the Postnikov-Chaikovskii- Fock theorem.
5. Developed the Postnikov-Kosovskii-Vinokur theory of symplectic monodromy groups.
6. Discovered the equation of the Postnikov's hyperbolic surface.
7. Co-developed the theory of Tsarev's elliptic-hyperbolic correspondence, which combines the topics of algebraic geometry, dynamical systems, and soliton theory.
8. Pioneered the theory of higher-dimensional braid groups and its application to the study of knot theory and algebraic geometry.

Born 27 October 1927, Shatura, Russia. Died 27 May 2004, Moscow, Russia.
