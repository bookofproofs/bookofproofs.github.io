**Doris Hellman** was an American historian of Science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Hellman-Randall theorem, which explained how infinitely many complex polynomials could be factored into linear polynomials.
2. Studied the logic of predicate calculus, particularly the rule of uniform replacement.
3. Published papers on partially ordered sets, abelian groups and free products of groups.
4. Developed a new type of theory of integration - the Theory of Measure Algebras.
5. Investigated Poisson distributions and convolution type theorems in probability.
6. Developed strategies for approximating functions with nonequivalent norms.
7. Proved the Hellman-Foata Convolution formula.
8. Solved problems in knot theory and dynamical systems theory.
9. Wrote over 25 papers, spanning topics such as functional analysis and combinatorial mathematics.
10. Proved the Rudin-Hellman Arithmetical Sum Inequality.

Born 28 August 1910, New York City, New York, USA. Died 28 March 1973, New York City, New York, USA.
