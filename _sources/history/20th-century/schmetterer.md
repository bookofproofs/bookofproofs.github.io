**Leopold Schmetterer** was an Austrian mathematician who worked on analysis, probability and statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His mother was Gisela Busch and it was mainly through her efforts that Leopold survived when a baby during a period of extreme hardship and poverty.
* Schmetterer attended lectures by Wolfgang Gröbner, Hans Hornich, Karl Mayrhofer and Karl Strubecker.
* Schmetterer had been a research assistant from October 1940, but in September 1941, after the award of his doctorate, he had to undertake military service.
* Johann Radon was appointed to Vienna in 1946, and he influenced strongly the direction of Schmetterer's research.
* On 21 April 1947 Schmetterer married Elisabeth Schaffer who had been a mathematics student: they had four children, sons George (born 1948), Victor (born 1951) and Leopold (born 1964) and a daughter Eva (born 1955).
* Schmetterer's interests turned towards probability.
* The outcome of this teaching was Schmetterer's book Einführung in die mathematische Statistik Ⓣ(Introduction to Mathematical Statistics) (1956).
* Hamburg at this time contained a host of leading mathematicians, and Schmetterer's colleagues included Helmut Hasse, Heinrich Behnke, Wilhelm Blaschke, Ernst Witt, Emil Artin, Emanuel Sperner, Lothar Collatz and Hans Zassenhaus.
* The famous algebraists in this group were a major influence on Schmetterer who attended lectures by Artin and started research on probability on algebraic structures.
* Radon had died in 1956, the year Schmetterer took up his appointment at Hamburg, and in 1957 Schmetterer was offered the chair in Vienna to succeed Radon.
* Schmetterer was elected to the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 1970, to the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1971, to the Academy of Sciences of Saxonia in 1983 and to the Academy of Sciences of Bavaria in 1984.
* He received many prizes and honours, including the Boltzmann prize, the Schrödinger prize of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the Medal of Merit Leopoldina as well as an honorary degree from the University of Clermont-Ferrand.
* In 1990 Schmetterer retired.
* However, she fell and, in order to get help, Schmetterer flagged down a passing car and asked the driver to take him to the nearest village to get assistance.

Born 8 November 1919, Vienna, Austria. Died 23 August 2004, near Vienna, Austria.
