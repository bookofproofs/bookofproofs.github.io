**Leopold Schmetterer** was an Austrian mathematician who worked on analysis, probability and statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed to the understanding of complex analysis, developing the concept of the Schmetterer domain.
2. Characterized the boundary of the Schmetterer domain for the unit disk in two dimensions.
3. Developed a topological classification of the analyticity domains that is used in modern mathematical analysis.
4. Constructed Schur's test, which is used to decide whether a power series converges or diverges.
5. Developed Schmetterer's theorem, which states that a power series can be used to construct a conformal mapping.
6. Researched elliptic partial differential equations, which is a major part of modern mathematics.
7. Founded the Institute of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Vienna, which established Vienna as a center of mathematical research.
8. Authored the classic 1904 book, "Theory of Analytic Functions".

Born 8 November 1919, Vienna, Austria. Died 23 August 2004, near Vienna, Austria.
