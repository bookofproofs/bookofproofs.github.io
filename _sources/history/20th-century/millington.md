**Margaret Millington** was an English-born mathematician. She made important contributions to modular forms, but died very young.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* By the time that Ashworth studied there it no longer served as an orphanage school but simply as a good grammar school.
* Clearly Ashworth's performance meant that a research career beckoned.
* Ashworth went with Atkin spending the year at these two universities working on various problems related to modular forms.
* In 1968, the year in which she completed her doctorate, Ashworth married Lieutenant A H Millington of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.
* Then Lieutenant Millington was given a two-year posting to Germany and Margaret Millington went with him teaching mathematics at an Army Education Centre.
* Margaret Millington had little opportunity to make a significant mathematical contribution.
* In Subgroups of the classical modular group Millington gives a classification of subgroups in terms of their cusp split and shows that that certain arithmetically possible combinations of type and cusp split do not occur for any subgroup.
* Millington continued her research while holding the Science Research Council Fellowship but her illness prevented her from classifying the new forms introduced by Atkin and Lehner.

Born 22 March 1944, Halifax, Yorkshire, England. Died 5 March 1973, Hanover, Germany.
