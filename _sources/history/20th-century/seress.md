**Akos Seress** was a Hungarian mathematician specialising in combinatorics and group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Seress went to the United States to obtain a doctorate.
* While working at the Alfred Renyi Institute of Mathematics in Budapest, Seress entered the field of algorithmic group theory with the paper On the degree of transitivity of permutation groups: a short proof.
* It was the first in a series of joint papers with László Babai on the complexity of permutation group algorithms, some others being On the diameter of Cayley graphs of the symmetric group (1988) and the three author papers Permutation groups (1987) and Fast management of permutation groups (1988) which had Seress, Babai and E M Luks as authors.
* In 1989 Seress returned to The Ohio State University where he was appointed as an Assistant Professor in the College of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
* He continued his work in computational group theory with a series of important papers on the statistical theory of finite simple groups with Bill Kantor and others; this line of work contributed to a recent definitive result on the complexity of algorithms for matrix groups over finite fields by Seress and coauthors.
* this monograph by Akos Seress, one of the leaders in the field, is a welcome contribution.
* Motivated by the theoretical results on algorithms for permutation groups, Seress pioneered the implementation of these algorithms in the GAP computational algebra system.
* Developed in the 1990s, with the cooperation and support of the RWTH Aachen group based at Lehrstuhl D für Mathematik, Seress's packages delivered, for the first time, practical performance backed up by theoretical analysis.
* More recently Seress and Max Neunhoeffer have developed efficient implementations of a suite of algorithms for matrix groups.
* Seress has been a tireless builder of communities, his own work and example demonstrating the bridge between the "red-hats," those who create "paper-algorithms" with proven asymptotic performance guarantees, and the "green-hats," the computational group theorists who demand working code to study the structure of concrete groups.
* Seress, along with Bill Kantor, has been a chief organizer of a series of meetings that brought these two communities together.
* Seress spent most of his professional career at the Ohio State University where he was promoted to Associate Professor in 1995 and to full Professor in 2000.
* To meet Akos was to make a friend and collaborator for life.

Born 24 November 1958, Budapest, Hungary. Died 13 February 2013, Columbus, Ohio, USA.
