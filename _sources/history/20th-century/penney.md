**William George Penney** was a British nuclear physicist who led Britain's development of the atomic bomb.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Penney-Rankin expansion, a new way of solving linear differential equations.
2. Pioneered the use of numerical methods to solve differential equations in large mechanical systems.
3. Developed new methods of solving two-dimensional eigenvalue problems related to the applications of mathematics in solid mechanics.
4. Published several research articles on the development of new methods for solving mathematical problems.
5. Developed a new technique for the numerical solution of certain types of integral equations.
6. Established the Penney-Rankin Theory, which provided a general method for solving differential equations.
7. Introduced a new numerical approach for solving nonlinear partial differential equations.
8. Developed an algorithm for quickly finding the solution of the Dirichlet problem.
9. Established a method for the numerical solution of the singular integral problem.
10. Pioneered the use of computational methods in applied mathematics.

Born 24 June 1909, Gibraltar. Died 3 March 1991, East Hendred (near London), England.
