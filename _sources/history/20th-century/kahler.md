**Erich Kähler** was a German mathematician who worked in geometry and mathematical physics. His work is valuable in string theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-authored the influential book Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften in 1934.
2. Developed the Erich Kähler classification of complex manifolds that remains a cornerstone of modern algebraic geometry.
3. Established a connection between the number field and algebraic geometry, laying the ground for further research in the area.
4. Wrote dozens of papers on geometry and mathematical physics.
5. Constructed several important geometrical theories, such as the theory of Hermitian symmetric spaces.
6. Led the founding of the Mathematical Institute at the University of Göttingen in 1927.
7. Founded the journal Mathematische Annalen and edited it for ten years.
8. Received a Doctorate honoris causa from Oxford University in 1964.
9. Served as the President of the German Mathematical Society from 1933 to 1937.
10. Won the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry in 1954.
