**Kollagunta Ramanathan** was an Indian mathematician who worked in number theory and was important in developing mathematical research and teaching in India.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published ground breaking work on analytic number theory including the Ramanathan Theorem, which is an asymptotic estimate of prime numbers. 
2. Made significant contributions to the study of linear and integral equations, as well as to the development of new methods of mathematical analysis. 
3. Discovered the Ramanathan Function, which gives the best possible lower bound of the number of primes up to a given number. 
4. Developed the theory of invariants from symmetric functions and its applications to analysis. 
5. Authored numerous papers in the Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences and the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society. 
6. Recommended for the Indian Mathematical Society's gold medal in 1951 for his work on linear integral equations.

Born 13 November 1920, Hyderabad, India. Died 10 May1992, Bombay, (now Mumbai) India.
