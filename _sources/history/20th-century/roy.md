### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an entirely new mathematical system, which was used to theoretically estimate the mass of a star.
2. Developed a theory of gravitation which later became an important part of the general theory of relativity.
3. Solved a range of complicated problems in mathematical physics, including topics on energy and motion of stars.
4. Published several groundbreaking papers on new mathematical techniques in international scientific journals.
5. Received recognition from the Indian Mathematical Society for his outstanding work on mathematics. 
6. Was the first Indian to be elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of London in recognition of his mathematical discoveries.
