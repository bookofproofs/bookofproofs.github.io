### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Kali Nath Roy was brought before the Martial Tribunal under Lieutenant Colonel Irvine and was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for two years and a fine of Rs 1,000.
* All this occurred while Samarendra Nath was studying at the Khulna District School.
* After completing work for his Master's Degree, Roy was appointed as a Research Associate in the Applied Mathematics Department of Calcutta University to work on cosmology with N R Sen.
* Roy was allowed to use the computing facilities in the Indian Statistical Institute, which were the only such facilities available in Calcutta.
* The Institute was run by P C Mahalanobis and soon Roy became interested, not only in solving his cosmological problems, but also in the statistical work of the Institute.
* Roy soon gained important positions within the Statistical Institute and the Statistics Department, being assistant director of the former from 1946 to 1949 and acting Head of the Statistics Department during 1947-48.
* Roy travelled to the United States in the spring of 1949 to take up a Visiting Professorship of Statistics at Columbia University in New York.
* He published Some aspects of multivariate analysis in 1957, a book which brought together many of the ideas Roy had published.
* Roy received many honours for his outstanding contributions.
* In 2007 a special issue of the Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference was published in celebration of the centennial of the birth of Samarendra Nath Roy.
