**Linda Keen** is an American mathematician who is known for her work in hyperbolic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Graduating from the Bronx High School of Science, Goldway she entered the City College of New York, gaining a B.S. in 1960.
* Her doctoral supervisor was Lipa Bers who had worked at the Courant Institute for about 10 years before he began to supervise Keen.
* He left the Institute in 1964, the year in which Keen was awarded her Ph.D. Her research involved studying the interplay between the analytic and geometric aspects of classifying Riemann surfaces.
* Keen defined the set of parameters for this space in terms of the hyperbolic structure of a given surface determined by the conformal structure.
* After receiving her Ph.D. Keen spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
* In it Keen showed that for each standard fundamental region for a finitely generated Fuchsian group, acting on the unit disk, there exists a convex Fricke polygon which has the same set of generators.
* After spending 1964-65 at the Institute for Advanced Study, Keen took up posts in the City University of New York.
* It became a fully coeducational autonomous College of the City University of New York in 1964, shortly before Keen took up her post there.
* When Lehman College split from Hunter College, Keen joined it and has remained on the staff since that time.
* We should mention some more important work undertaken by Keen.
* Using powerful techniques developed by Thurston that involve hyperbolic three-manifolds, Keen and Series gave a geometric interpretation to Maskit's parameters.
* Much of Keen's work has been done in collaborations with other mathematicians and after her work with Caroline Series she teamed up with Paul Blanchard, Robert Devaney, and Lisa Goldberg to produce important results on dynamical systems.
* Keen, working with Nikola Lakic, wrote the book Hyperbolic geometry from a local viewpoint which was published in 2007 by Cambridge University Press in the London Mathematical Society Student Texts series.
* Keen served as President of this organisation during 1985-1986.
* Among other contributions made by Keen, we should mention her editorial work with publications such as the Journal of Geometric Analysis, the Annales of the Finnish Academy of Sciences, and the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society.

Born 9 August 1940, New York City, New York, USA.
