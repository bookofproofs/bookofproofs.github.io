**Henry Scheffé** worked in several different areas of Statistics, including linear models, analysis of variance and nonparametrics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical concept of ‘H-distribution’, a powerful tool used to develop reliable inferences from data. 
2. Pioneered the use of the techniques of ‘comparison of means’ and ‘t-tests’ in order to make reliable inferences from data sets. 
3. Coined the term ‘canonical analysis’ which remains a popular statistical mathematical technique used to assess correlations among multiple variables. 
4. Developed a new mathematical statistics course at the Harvard University that taught powerful concepts such as ‘analysis of variance’, ‘multivariate normal distributions’, and ‘item response curves’.
5. Authored two popular and acclaimed mathematical books, ‘The Analysis of Variance’ and ‘Permanent Linear Spaces’.

Born 11 April 1907, New York, USA. Died 5 July 1977, Berkeley, California, USA.
