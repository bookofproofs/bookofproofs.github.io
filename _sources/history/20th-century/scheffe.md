**Henry Scheffé** worked in several different areas of Statistics, including linear models, analysis of variance and nonparametrics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* When he was three years old Henry suffered a broken nose; it affected his appearance throughout his life.
* Mathematics was not the first area to interest Scheffé and, after graduating in 1924, he began studying electrical engineering by attending night classes at the Cooper Union Free Night School for the Advancement of Science and Art.
* Immediately after completing his doctorate, Scheffé began a career as a university teacher and, having trained as a pure mathematician, it was naturally that subject which he taught.
* While at Oregon State University, Scheffé discovered that some of the results he had included in his thesis, believing them to be new, had actually been proved by Gauss.
* Scheffé went to Berkeley to meet with Jerzy Neyman and discussed possible statistical problems that he might work on.
* In 1941, Scheffé's interests having moved from pure mathematics to statistics, he joined Samuel Wilks at Princeton where a statistics team had grown up.
* By the time Henry left Berkeley at the end of his Guggenheim year, the outline of the work was clear, and it was possible to elaborate the details by correspondence and occasional visits back and forth.
* His appointment as Assistant Director of the Statistical Laboratory had been made by Neyman with the expectation that Scheffé, who had shown much interest in applications, would contribute substantially to the running of the Laboratory.
* Scheffé earned much respect for his fair-minded approach to these student problems.
* Scheffé, perhaps not surprisingly given his route into statistics, was interested in the more mathematical areas of statistics.
* After 1950 Scheffé's research was concerned with aspects of linear models, particularly the analysis of variance.
* His mixture designs were of fundamental importance and led to a major theory of mixtures being built later on Scheffé's work.
* Scheffé was in the middle of revising this book for a new edition when he died.
* Scheffé was elected to many statistical societies.

Born 11 April 1907, New York, USA. Died 5 July 1977, Berkeley, California, USA.
