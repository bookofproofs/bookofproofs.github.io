**Jacques Neveu** was a Belgian mathematician who worked in France, specialising in probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Neveu went to France for university studies and continued to live in France for the rest of his life.
* Neveu was awarded his doctorate in 1955 for his thesis Etude des semi-groupes de Markoff Ⓣ(Study of the Markoff semi-groups).
* It was in Paris that Neveu worked for the whole of his career beginning at the Faculty of Science.
* Neveu became a lecturer at the Collège de France in 1962.
* We will discuss these below but first we look at various visits that Neveu made to the United States in the 1960s.
* Neveu was in Berkeley to attend the Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability held in 1965-66.
* At that time, my discussions with Jacques revolved around what would happen to this still planned university, to which Bruhat would devote ten years of his life.
* One day we meet Jacques and his wife, Monique, at the baker's! The Neveus had bought a beautiful property in this Burgundy village, three kilometres from us.
* In the living room, Jacques had installed a magnificent fireplace built to his plans, in which he liked to burn tree trunks of good size, for the great joy of his guests when the weather was cool.
* It was in this context that Jacques discovered a new passion.
* Other academics, scientists: some renowned archaeologists, physicists, curators of the Louvre Museum, chose to buy a second home in Mailly-le-Château and found themselves around the Neveus.
* With the coming of age and the accumulating fatigue, Jacques had to call on a professional to execute the heavy work in his gardens.
* Monique died of cancer and Jacques followed soon after her.
* Neveu was honoured with being elected to the Inaugural Class of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society in 2013.

Born 14 November 1932, Watermael-Boitsfort, near Brussels, Belgium. Died 15 May 2016, Paris, France.
