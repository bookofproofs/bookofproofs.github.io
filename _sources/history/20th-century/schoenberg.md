**Isaac Jacob Schoenberg** was a Romanian-born American mathematician best known for his discovery of splines.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Schoenberg-Whitney Theorem, which provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial of a certain degree to be equal to the sum of two or more other polynomials.
2. Developed the Schoenberg-Weierstrass Theorem which characterized polynomials of degree n with an arbitrary given continuous real-valued root system.
3. Proved that general discrete systems of polonomials, satisfying certain assumptions, have algebraic numbers as their roots.
4. Developed Schoenberg punctuated interpolation, that interpolates from the dots located anywhere on a given graph.
5. Developed the Schoenberg-Koetz Theory which uses polonomials and their coefficients with respect to their degree in order to prove their unique character.

Born 21 April 1903, Galatz, Romania. Died 21 February 1990, Madison, Dane, Wisconsin, USA.
