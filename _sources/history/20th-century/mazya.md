**Vladimir Maz'ya** is a Russian mathematician who works in mathematical analysis and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Maz'ya was lucky to be able to leave the besieged city at this time.
* After the war, Maz'ya entered the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics of Leningrad State University when he was eighteen years old.
* As Maz'ya did not make this a secret, his fellow students all decided not to submit their solutions.
* Maz'ya had found the topics of his dissertations by himself, while Mikhlin taught him mathematical ethics and rules of writing, refereeing and reviewing.
* By the time Maz'ya graduated from Leningrad State University in 1960 he already had published a paper.
* After graduating, Maz'ya was appointed as a Junior Research Scientist at the Mathematics and Mechanics Institute of Leningrad University.
* Also in 1962 Maz'ya was awarded the prize for the best junior mathematician by the Leningrad Mathematical Society.
* In 1964 Maz'ya was promoted to the post of Senior Research Scientist and in the following year he was awarded a D.Sc. in mathematics from Leningrad State University.
* In addition to his position at the Mathematics and Mechanics Institute of Leningrad University, Maz'ya was appointed as professor in the Department of Mathematics of the Leningrad Shipbuilding Institute in 1968.
* In 1990 Maz'ya moved to Sweden to become the equivalent of an associate professor in the Department of Mathematics at Link√∂ping University.
* In January 2004 Maz'ya was appointed as Professor of Mathematics at Ohio State University in the United States and in addition he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Liverpool University in England in September of the same year.
* Maz'ya lists his mathematical interests as: linear and non-linear PDEs; asymptotic and numerical methods for PDEs, including homogenization and boundary elements; spectral theory; harmonic analysis; approximation theory; wavelets; elasticity theory; function spaces; ill-posed problems; non-linear potential theory; fluid mechanics; and the history of mathematics.
* One feature of Maz'ya's approach is that he summarises his work on a particular theme by writing a book on the topic bringing together results appearing in various papers.
* In collaboration with S A Nazarov and B A Plamenevskii, Maz'ya published Asymptotic behavior of solutions of elliptic boundary value problems under singular perturbations of the domain  in 1981.
* In 1985, together with Tatyana O Shaposhnikova, Maz'ya published Theory of multipliers in spaces of differentiable functions  which was based on results discovered by the authors in 1979-80 and published in a number of papers.
* We should remark at this point that Tatyana Shaposhnikova is Maz'ya's wife.
* One year later, in 1999, Maz'ya, together with Vladimir Kozlov, published Differential equations with operator coefficients with applications to boundary value problems for partial differential equations.
* Very high quality books by Maz'ya continue to appear, adding greatly to the mathematical literature.
* Maz'ya has received, and continues to receive, numerous awards for his remarkable contributions.
* Maz'ya was seventy years old on the last day of 2007 and two conferences were organised in 2008 to honour him for his 70th  birthday.
* In addition the American Mathematical Society published Perspectives in Partial Differential Equations, Harmonic Analysis and Applications: A Volume in Honor of Vladimir G Maz'ya's 70th  Birthday in their Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics series.
* One should certainly not imagine that Maz'ya's scientific activity has decreased.

Born 31 December 1937, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
