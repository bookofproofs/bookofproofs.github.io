**Vladimir Maz'ya** is a Russian mathematician who works in mathematical analysis and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Vladimir Maz'ya is a noted Russian mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of operator classes and pseudodifferential equations.
2. He is known for his pioneering work on the Sobolev embedding theorem and its applications, which have been influential in the development of modern analysis.
3. He established the theory of Besov spaces and the Maz'ya multiplier theorem.
4. He also developed a new approach to potential theory which is now known as Maz'ya potential theory.
5. He published several important works about the Sobolev extension problem, which has wide applications in mathematics and engineering.
6. He introduced the concept of capacity and developed tools to assess it, and provided an interpretation of the capacity in terms of pseudodifferential and integral operators.
7. He was a central figure in the development of functional analysis and of its applications in partial differential equations.
8. He provided a deep study of general elliptic boundary value problems, with applications to problems involving transmission conditions and non-linear equations.

Born 31 December 1937, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
