**Cecily Tanner** was the daughter of the mathematicians William Henry Young and Grace Emily Chisholm. She published excellent papers on Riemann-Stieltjes integrals, then she became interested in the history of mathematics. Her efforts led to Thomas Harriot's work being much more widely known and understood.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In fact she was known as Cecily and, to avoid confusion with other Youngs, we will call her Cecily throughout this biography.
* In fact her publications appear with the names R C Young, R Cecily Young or Rosalind Cecily Young until he marriage in 1953 after which she published under the name R C Tanner.
* Cecily's mother Grace Chisholm undertook research at Göttingen, Germany, advised by Felix Klein and in 1895 she obtained a Ph.D. for her thesis which applied Klein's group theory to spherical trigonometry.
* Felix Klein's daughter, Luise Klein (1879-1961), acted as Cecily's unofficial godmother (Luise could not be her official godmother because she was not a member of the Church of England).
* Let us give a few details about Cecily Young's siblings.
* This book is interesting here because it shows how the Youngs used non-conventional ways of teaching mathematics to Cecily and their other children.
* Two further children's books authored by Grace Young, written to introduce Cecily and her other children to science, were Bimbo (1906), and Bimbo and the Frogs (1907).
* Cecily had begun her primary schooling in Göttingen before the family moved, but from 1908 continued her education in Geneva.
* In 1915 the family moved to Lausanne where Cecily completed the two final years of her schooling and entered the University of Lausanne in 1917.
* These were four years in which Cecily was studying for her licence at the University of Lausanne but in fact she was in Aberystwyth for much of these four years acting as an unofficial assistant to her father.
* It is worth noting that the Preface to the book was written by William Young but nowhere in the book is Cecily Young's help acknowledged.
* Cecily published her first paper in 1925, namely Les fonctions monotones et l'intégration dans l'espace à n dimensions Ⓣ(Monotonic functions and integration in n-dimensional space) which was published in L'Enseignement Mathématique.
* After completing her degree in Lausanne, Cecily matriculated at Girton College, Cambridge to undertake research for a Ph.D.; her mother, Grace Chisholm, had been an undergraduate at Girton.
* He was working on writing his first book The theory of integration and Cecily assisted him, typing out the text.
* As well as translating French texts to English, Cecily translated texts from German to English, for example while studying at Cambridge she translated Konrad Knopp's Theorie und Anwendung der unendlichen Reihen Ⓣ(Theory and application of infinite series) and her translation was published as Theory and Application of Infinite Series (1928).
* During the years 1928-32, Cecily published a number of papers related to the work of her thesis.
* During the time Cecily was writing these papers she held a fellowship at Girton College.
* Cecily attended several of the International Mathematical Congresses.
* By the time she attended the 1958 Congress, Cecily was R C H Tanner, for she had married Bernard William Tanner (1881-1954) in the Holy Trinity Church in Wallington, Surrey on 3 September 1953.
* Bernard Tanner, who was 72 years old, had been an electrical engineer and the chief maintenance engineer at Imperial College, London.
* Their marriage only lasted nine months since Bernard Tanner died on 12 June 1954 at The War Memorial Hospital Carshalton, Surrey.
* We mentioned that Cecily became interested in the history of mathematics but she had a particular passion to make the work of Thomas Harriot better known.
* It was the study of inequalities that made Cecily enthusiastic about making Thomas Harriot's contributions better known.
* We now give two quotes by Cecily.

Born 6 February 1900, Göttingen, Germany. Died 24 November 1992, Croydon, England.
