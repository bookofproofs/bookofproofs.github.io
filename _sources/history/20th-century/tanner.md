**Cecily Tanner** was the daughter of the mathematicians William Henry Young and Grace Emily Chisholm. She published excellent papers on Riemann-Stieltjes integrals, then she became interested in the history of mathematics. Her efforts led to Thomas Harriot's work being much more widely known and understood.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In fact she was known as Cecily and, to avoid confusion with other Youngs, we will call her Cecily throughout this biography.
* In fact her publications appear with the names R C Young, R Cecily Young or Rosalind Cecily Young until he marriage in 1953 after which she published under the name R C Tanner.
* Let us give a few details about Cecily Young's siblings.
* It is worth noting that the Preface to the book was written by William Young but nowhere in the book is Cecily Young's help acknowledged.
* Cecily published her first paper in 1925, namely Les fonctions monotones et l'intégration dans l'espace à n dimensions Ⓣ(Monotonic functions and integration in n-dimensional space) which was published in L'Enseignement Mathématique.
* He was working on writing his first book The theory of integration and Cecily assisted him, typing out the text.
* During the years 1928-32, Cecily published a number of papers related to the work of her thesis.
* During the time Cecily was writing these papers she held a fellowship at Girton College.
* Cecily attended several of the International Mathematical Congresses.
* Bernard Tanner, who was 72 years old, had been an electrical engineer and the chief maintenance engineer at Imperial College, London.
* Their marriage only lasted nine months since Bernard Tanner died on 12 June 1954 at The War Memorial Hospital Carshalton, Surrey.
* We mentioned that Cecily became interested in the history of mathematics but she had a particular passion to make the work of Thomas Harriot better known.
* It was the study of inequalities that made Cecily enthusiastic about making Thomas Harriot's contributions better known.
* We now give two quotes by Cecily.

Born 6 February 1900, Göttingen, Germany. Died 24 November 1992, Croydon, England.
