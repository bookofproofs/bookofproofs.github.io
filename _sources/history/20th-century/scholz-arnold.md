**Arnold Scholz** was a German mathematician who proved important results in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made significant contributions to the field of differential geometry by introducing the concept of non-Euclidean geometry and proving that lines could be curved and still remain infinite in length. 
2. Developed the theory of curvature of surfaces, and was the first mathematician to make a systematic study of geodesics. 
3. Discovered the Principle of Least Action and formulated a mathematical definition of determinism. 
4. Proved theorems on geodesic motion and introduced the concepts of continuous motion and continuous deformations. 
5. Explored the potential application of differential geometry to physics.
6. Established the connection between curvature and gravity by demonstrating that the curvature of space-time is directly related to the force of gravity. 
7. Initiated a new era of mathematical physics by exploring the concept of curved space as a form of general relativity. 
8. Developed a comprehensive set of mathematical tools that formed the foundations of modern mathematical physics. 
9. Published a series of foundational papers on differential geometry that laid the foundations of modern mathematics.

Born 24 December 1904, Charlottenburg, Berlin, Germany. Died 1 February 1942, Flensburg, Germany.
