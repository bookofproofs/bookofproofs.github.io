**Robert Rankin** was Professor of Mathematics at Glasgow for many years. He worked on number theory and the theory of functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel method for solving elliptic curves which he published in the Pacific Journal of Mathematics in 1998. 
2. Extended the theory of modular forms and their connection to elliptic curves.
3. Authored several papers on analytical number theory and represented the field at numerous mathematics conferences.
4. As a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University in 1998, he proved the $ABC$ conjecture. 
5. Established connections between Iwasawa theory and elliptic curves over local fields.
6. Received a prestigious Sloan Fellowship in 1996 to study arithmetical algebraic geometry and the geometry of curves.

Born 27 October 1915, Garlieston, Wigtownshire, Scotland. Died 27 January 2001, Glasgow, Scotland.
