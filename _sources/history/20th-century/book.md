**Ron Book** was an American mathematician who worked in theoretical computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Another early work by Book on languages was the paper On languages accepted in polynomial time which he published in 1972.
* A survey of where the theory of formal languages stood in 1972 was presented by Book in Topics in formal language theory.
* Book was appointed to Harvard and later he moved to Yale.
* Ron indeed liked this place ...
* In 1977 Book was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
* In the following year Book published When is a monoid a group?
* He is to be lauded for carrying out his research on a broad front, maintaining an interest in several different research questions, developing his own thoughts and paying careful attention to the results of others.
* The main results which Book proved on rewriting systems are contained in his important book String-rewriting systems (1993) on which he collaborated with Fred Otto.
* However Book worked on other topics at the same time as he studied rewriting systems.
* This work has strongly influenced the direction of research in relativization.
* In all Book published over 150 articles on algebra and theoretical computer science.
* In 1970-71 he was a member of the Executive Committee of SIGACT (Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory), he was Chairman of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Technological Committee on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science from 1977 to 1981, and served on the Council of EATCS (European Association for Theoretical Computer Science) from 1977 to 1985.
* Book suffered from multiple sclerosis and his death at the age of sixty was a result of complications arising from that disease.
* it is certainly difficult to forget Ron's smile, Ron's gentleness from which he never departed whoever he was talking to and which hid an iron will to understand and to grow, theorem after theorem, nice scientific crops.

Born 5 March 1937, Los Angeles, California, USA. Died 28 May 1997, Santa Barbara, California, USA.
