**Igor Shafarevich** was a Russian mathematician who worked in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. He was an important dissident during the Soviet era.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He was born in 1923, the son of Rostislav Stepanovich Shafarevich and Yulia Yacovlevna Vasileva.
* However, he had gone through some extremely difficult times in the years before Igor Rostislavovich was born.
* Igor's mother, Yulia Yacovlevna, had a degree in philology from the Bestuzhev Institute for Women in St Petersburg.
* The Richter family were close friends of the Shafarevich family, and Igor and Sviatoslav spent much time together as they were growing up.
* At the time that Igor was born, his father was working in Moscow and the family lived in a room in a communal apartment there.
* Sviatoslav Richter, like Igor, was born Zhytomyr which was the Richter's home town.
* Igor and his mother soon returned to their room in the Moscow apartment and it was in Moscow that Igor was brought up.
* As a child, Igor was taught by his parents so when it came time for him to attend school he could already read and write, so was put straight into the second class.
* Shafarevich's first love was history and literature.
* Reading was easy for Shafarevich since his parents had many books in their apartment.
* The dean, realising that he had a very talented youngster in front of him, suggested that he could enrol Shafarevich as an external student even though he was still a schoolboy.
* He then sent Shafarevich to Boris Nikolaevich Delone who examined him in analytic geometry.
* Now Shafarevich's parents worried that his school studies would suffer if he spent all his time on university level mathematics so they only agreed to him undertaking these mathematical studies on the condition that he studied geometry in English and algebra in German.
* Shafarevich left school in 1939 after completing the ninth grade and never took the examinations for his high school diploma but, having taken most of the university examinations, went straight into the final undergraduate year at Moscow University.
* And when he saw Shafarevich's, the chief of police couldn't conceal his surprise: 'What's all this, then?
* The university was evacuated to Tashkent in Uzbekistan, so Shafarevich went there.
* This may have been fortunate since late in 1941 Sviatoslav Richter's father, who was living at the Shafarevichs' home, was arrested and shot as a German collaborator.
* When the Shafarevichs' home was searched, they found German mathematics books that Shafarevich had studied and took them away as evidence but later they were returned and the Shafarevichs had no serious problems from the secret police.
* Shafarevich spent time in both these places, in particular during the time that the university was in Ashkhabad in 1942 he was awarded his candidate's degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.).
* By 1944 Shafarevich had begun teaching in the Mechanics and Mathematics Department (Meh-Mat) of Moscow University.
* Shafarevich was reinstated in 1953.
* Shafarevich, a son of a professor, was a well-educated man who knew French and German.
* However, it was clear to me that Shafarevich had negative feelings for Communism.
* At that time, Dostoevskii was not easily available in Russian, but Shafarevich quoted the very negative depiction of revolution from the famous novel 'Devils'.
* During his long mathematical life Shafarevich published no more than 50 research papers, but the influence of many of them on the development of number theory, group theory and algebraic geometry is difficult to overestimate.
* The highlights of Shafarevich's contribution to these fields can be briefly summarized as follows.
* His students report that their association and supervision by Shafarevich were among the happiest of their professional careers.
* In addition to his election to membership of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, Shafarevich has been elected to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Royal Society of London, the German Academy Leopoldina, the Italian Accademia dei Lincei and the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.
* We have already indicated that Shafarevich loved history, literature and music.
* Shafarevich was married to Nina Ivanova, who taught at the Moscow State Engineering Physics Institute.
* They had a son Andrei Igorevich Shafarevich, born in 1963, who is a physicist.

Born 3 June 1923, Zhytomyr, Ukraine. Died 19 February 2017, Moscow, Russia.
