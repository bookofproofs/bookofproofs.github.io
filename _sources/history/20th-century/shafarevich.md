**Igor Shafarevich** was a Russian mathematician who worked in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. He was an important dissident during the Soviet era.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of algebraic groups, which laid the foundations for modern algebraic geometry and abstract algebra.
2. Developed a theory of quadratic forms, which has made important contributions to the theory of abelian varieties.
3. Proposed the Sobolev inverse transformation, an early example of a practical application of abstract algebraic methods.
4. Formulated the Riemannâ€“Roch theorem in algebraic geometry.
5. Established a theory of correspondences, which is now important in the study of algebraic varieties.
6. Contributed to the theory of braid groups and the theory of automorphisms of algebraic curves.
7. Proposed several methods of describing topological properties of algebraic varieties, including Shafarevich's theorem and the graded ring of a variety.
8. Wrote a widely cited book on algebraic geometry, Algebraic Geometry and Complex Multiplication.

Born 3 June 1923, Zhytomyr, Ukraine. Died 19 February 2017, Moscow, Russia.
