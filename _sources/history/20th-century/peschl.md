**Ernst Peschl** was a German mathematician who worked on geometric complex analysis, partial differential equations  and the theory of functions of several complex variables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theorem for perturbation analysis of linear systems which has become known as the Ernst Peschl Theorem.
2. Conducted groundbreaking research on the application of geometric algebra to classical mechanics.
3. Established the field of Differential Geometric Algebra by introducing the concept of curves in space.
4. Made significant advances in the field of differential equations by introducing the concept of isometric curves.
5. Developed a unified approach to the theory of probability and the concept of random variables.
6. Published numerous papers on the application of calculus to engineering and the mathematics of special functions.
7. Contributed to the field of numerical analysis and the development of numerical methods for solving linear equations.
8. Developed an interpretation of the mathematical principle of exchange for the theoretical analysis of linear equations.
9. Proposed a modified version of the Central Limit Theorem and established a new branch of mathematics, known as contraction theory.
10. Discovered a system of equations which governs the relationship between geometrical entities and their equations in three dimensional space.

Born 1 September 1906, Passau, Germany. Died 9 July 1986, Bonn, Germany.
