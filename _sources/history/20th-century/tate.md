**John Torrence Tate** was an American mathematician who won both the Wolf and Abel prizes for his work in Number Theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received the Abel Prize in 2010 for his vast and lasting impact on the theory of numbers.
2. Received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2010 for his work in arithmetic algebraic geometry.
3. Received the national Medal of Science in 2010 for his groundbreaking discoveries in algebraic number theory.
4. Helped prove the Tate conjecture in algebraic geometry.
5. Authored the landmark book "Fourier Analysis on Finite Groups" which laid the ground for many subsequent theoretical studies.
6. Developed the theory of rigid analytic spaces and co-introduced rigid cohomology.
7. Pioneered the use of Iwasawa Theory in algebraic number theory.
8. Developed the p-adic certification of modularity from Riemann hypotheses.

Born 13 March 1925, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. Died 16 October 2019, Lexington, Massachussets, USA.
