**George Lusztig** is a Romanian-born mathematician who works on geometric representation theory and algebraic groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the theory of constructible sheaves for finite group actions.
2. Developed the theory of base change for reductive groups.
3. Introduced the notion of toroidal embeddings, a tool in the study of algebraic varieties over finite fields.
4. Developed a program to automate the computation of representation theory for reductive groups.
5. Discovered a cohomological characterization of conjugacy classes of semisimple elements in reductive groups, which led to the development of the geometric Satake correspondence.
6. Awarded the Fields Medal in 1984 for his contributions to algebraic geometry, representation theory, and low-dimensional topology.

Born 20 May 1946, Timi≈üoara, Romania.
