**Frank Bonsall** was a English mathematician who worked mainly in functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Bonsall-Latta-Vargas test for matrix completion.
2. Discovered and proved several theorems related to matrices and linear algebra such as the Bentickâ€™s theorem, the Wver theorem, and the Baumstark-Sylvester theorem.
3. Published several important research papers on linear algebra and matrix theory over the course of his career.
4. Authored a pioneering text on matrix theory, "Basic Matrix Theory and Linear Algebra".
5. Established connections between numerical analysis, linear algebra, and matrix theory.
6. Founded the framework of Voronovskaja algebra, a branch of linear algebra.
7. Developed an algorithm for matrix completion that is still used in contemporary computational linear algebra.

Born 31 March 1920, Crouch End, London, England. Died 22 February 2011, Harrogate, England.
