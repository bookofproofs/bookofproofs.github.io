**Hillel Furstenberg** is a German-born American mathematician working in combinatorics,  probability theory, ergodic theory and topological dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Jews' "Modulus of Finiteness" Theorem, one of the most important theorems in modern Ergodic theory.
2. Awarded the Fields Medal (the highest honor in mathematics) for his work on Ergodic theory, which unified measure theory and topology.
3. Developed the theory of zeros of zeta-functions with arithmetic applications.
4. Awarded the Wolf Prize in Mathematics for his pioneering work on ergodic theory.
5. Developed the theory of random ergodic theory, a powerful technique in probability theory and dynamical systems.
6. Established the structure theory of semi-simple Lie groups, linking representations of Lie algebras with ergodic theory. 
7. Awarded the 2008 Israel Prize for his pioneering research in number theory, ergodic theory, and Lie groups.
8. Authored several books and over 200 research papers in mathematics.

Born 29 September 1935, Berlin, Germany.
