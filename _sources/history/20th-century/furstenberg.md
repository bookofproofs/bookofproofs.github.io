**Hillel Furstenberg** is a German-born American mathematician working in combinatorics,  probability theory, ergodic theory and topological dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1955 Furstenberg graduated from Yeshiva College having been awarded both a B.A. and an M.Sc. He had already published a number of papers with Note on one type of indeterminate form (1953) and On the infinitude of primes (1955) both appearing in the American Mathematical Monthly.
* Furstenberg went to Princeton University to study for his doctorate, supervised by Salomon Bochner.
* At this time Bochner was interested in probability, having published his classic text Harmonic Analysis and the Theory of Probability in 1955, the year in which Furstenberg began research.
* After submitting his thesis Prediction Theory in 1958, Furstenberg was awarded his doctorate.
* After a year 1958-59 as an Instructor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Furstenberg worked at the Mathematics Department in the College of Science, Letters, and Arts of the University of Minnesota.
* In 1963 the two University of Minnesota Departments of Mathematics were merged into the School of Mathematics in the Institute of Technology and in the following year Furstenberg was appointed a full professor.
* Furstenberg remained at the Hebrew University until he retired in 2003.
* Many important results due to Furstenberg are presented in his classic monograph Recurrence in ergodic theory and combinatorial number theory (1981).
* The Israel Prize, an award made by the State of Israel that is regarded as the state's highest honour, was presented to Furstenberg in 1993.
* Professor Furstenberg has taught and guided many students studying towards advanced degrees in his field of research and in other, wider fields - thus ushering a new generation of mathematicians who today serve as professors at institutions of higher learning in Israel and abroad.
* In topological dynamics, Furstenberg's proof of the structure theorem for minimal distal flows, introduced radically new techniques and revolutionized the field.
* In his study of stochastic processes on homogenous spaces, he introduced stationary methods whose study led him to define what is now called the Furstenberg Boundary of a group.
* In ergodic theory, Furstenberg developed the fundamental concept of dynamical embedding.
* In addition to these honours, Furstenberg has been elected to the Israel Academy of Sciences and the United States National Academy of Sciences.
* In 2003, on the occasion of Furstenberg's retirement, the Israel Science Foundation organised a research workshop Conference on Probability in Mathematics in his honour.
* Finally we note that Furstenberg was a plenary speaker at the British Mathematical Colloquium at Bristol in 1984 when he gave the lecture Ergodic theory and Diophantine problems.

Born 29 September 1935, Berlin, Germany.
