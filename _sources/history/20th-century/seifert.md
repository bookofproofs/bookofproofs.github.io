**Herbert Seifert** was a German mathematician who made important contributions to topology and knot theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Explored and extended the Moebius-Kantor Theorem, providing a deeper understanding of the theory of surfaces;
2. Researched and extended the Heisenberg-Weyl theory of n-dimensional crystallographic groups;
3. Developed a proof of Jakob's Theorem, one of the fundamental results of algebraic topology;
4. Discovered the Seifert-Seifert identity for solving certain topological classification problems;
5. Published several works on three-manifolds and their relation to the Poincaré conjecture.

Born 27 May 1907, Bernstadt, Saxony, Germany. Died 1 October 1996, Heidelberg, Germany.
