**Ott-Heinrich Keller** was a German mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the concept of "algebraic invariants" as a means of classifying polynomial equations. 
2. Developed the “Keller Method”, a systematic process of algebraically manipulating equations. 
3. Solved complex cubic equations using the method of undetermined coefficients.
4. Established a formula for solving quartic equations.
5. Advanced the study of rational trinomials by developing new equations.
6. Investigated and proved the existence of nine algebraically distinct types of equations of degree seven. 
7. Wrote foundational texts outlining the principles of algebra. 
8. Established the concept of ‘cardinality’ of a system of equations. 
9. Contributed to theories related to the development of group theory.

Born 22 June 1906, Frankfurt (Main), Germany. Died 5 December 1990, Halle, Germany.
