**Ott-Heinrich Keller** was a German mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Keller then went to the Technical University of Charlottenburg in Berlin where he was appointed as assistant to George Hamel.
* In 1949 he published Zu einem Satze von H W E Jung über ganze birationale Transformationen der Ebene Ⓣ(On a theorem of H W E Jung on all birational transformations of plane) and, by a strange coincidence, following the retirement of Heinrich W E Jung  from the chair of mathematics at Halle, Keller was appointed to Jung's chair at the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg in 1951.
* In 1954 Keller published his first book Geometrie der Zahlen Ⓣ(Geometry of numbers)  which contained many of his contributions to the topic.
* Keller retired in 1971 from his professorship in Halle.

Born 22 June 1906, Frankfurt (Main), Germany. Died 5 December 1990, Halle, Germany.
