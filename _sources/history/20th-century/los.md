**Jerzy Łoś** was a Polish mathematician, logician, economist, and philosopher. He is especially known for his work in model theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a reputation as one of the leading algebraists of the 20th century.
2. Developed the Łoś theorem, a key result of model theory.
3. Developed nonstandard semantics for first-order logic, laying the foundation of infinitesimal analysis.
4. Made fundamental contributions to the theory of reducts and ultraproducts, and worked in inverse problems in algebra and algebraic geometry. 
5. Introduced a novel approach to the study of infinite-dimensional manifolds.
6. Led teams of mathematicians in oder to study abstract topological spaces and measure spaces in great detail.
7. Discovered and developed the concept of transitive models, an important tool in model theory.
8. Made significant contributions to stability theory. 
9. Developed certain criteria and theorems concerning graphs and lattices, that are universally referenced by other mathematicians. 
10. Established a number of research groups that investigated the exact relationships between spaces and measurable sets.

Born 22 March 1920, Lwów, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 1 June 1998, Warsaw, Poland.
