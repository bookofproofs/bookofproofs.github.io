**Nicolaas Kuiper** was a Dutch mathematician who made important contributions to operator theory as well as to topology and statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Schoenflies theorem which describes the topology of surfaces in four-dimensional space.
2. Developed the Kuiper's test which is used to test the uniformity of a sample in statistical data analysis.
3. Proposed the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy planetary bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune.
4. Discovered the co-variant variance and proved the invariance of the second order of derivatives of arc length.
5. Played a major role in identifying the relation between algebraic and differential geometry in the work "Principes de Géométrie Analytique" (Principles of Analytical Geometry).
6. Advanced the notion of a polar coordinate and established a negative upper bound for the number of solutions of an equation.
7. Constructed a revolutionary mathematical system for formulating theorems and proving their correctness in a rigorous manner.

Born 28 June 1920, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Died 12 December 1994, Heteren, The Netherlands.
