**Alfred Tarski** made important contributions in many areas of mathematics, including metamathematics, set theory, measure theory, model theory, and general algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Tarski-Grothendieck set theory, which unified logic, mathematics, and set theory.
2. Formulated the Tarski–Vaught test, which can determine if two formulas in a theory are equivalent.
3. Developed the concept of abstract model theory and the semantic concepts of satisfaction and consequence.
4. Showed that an equational system has a model if and only if it is consistent.
5. Proved that undecidable sentences of first-order logic exist.
6. Developed the theory of Boolean algebras.
7. Introduced the concept of “definability” in logic and proving theorems regarding the definability of sets.
8. Pioneered model theory, the study of the structures of mathematics and other science.

Born 14 January 1901, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 26 October 1983, Berkeley, California, USA.
