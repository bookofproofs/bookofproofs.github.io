**Ida Rhodes** was born in the Ukraine but emigrated to the United States as a teenager. She studied mathematics and had a variety of jobs before joining the Mathematical Tables Project in New York City. She did important work on the development of computers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the "Man-Month Library System," a FORTRAN library for the IBM 704 computer; the first ever user-friendly library of mathematical and statistical routines.
2. Wrote the "Computerizing Mathematics Libraries" article for the 1957 Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, pioneering the implementation of computers in mathematics research libraries.
3. Developed the Mathematical Tables Project (MTP), a collection of computational algorithms for general-purpose computers.
4. Determined the accuracy of the frequentist sampling distribution for the t-test.
5. Developed early ideas of object-oriented programming in her "Modular Discrete Series System."
6. Collaborated with colleagues on the United States Air Forceâ€™s Navigational Modular Computer System, which designed the first operational on-board computer analysis of satellite orbits.
7. Developed important work related to algebraic codes, cyclic linear codes, and error correction theory as part of the MTP.
8. Pioneered applications for programming languages for computing symbolically.

Born 15 May1900, Kamianets-Podilskyi, Ukraine. Died 1 February 1986, Rockville, Maryland, USA.
