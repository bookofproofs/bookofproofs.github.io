**Laurent Lafforgue** is a French mathematician known for his work in the fields of number theory and analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Lafforgue became chargé de recherche at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in 1990 and worked in the Arithmetic and Algebraic Geometry team at the Université Paris-Sud at Orsay.
* In 2000 Lafforgue was promoted to directeur de recherche of the CNRS working in the Mathematics Department of the Université Paris-Sud.
* In fact the year 2000 was significant for Lafforgue in another way too, for on 24 May, at the Paris Millennium Meeting at the Collège de France, he received the 2000 Clay Research Award.
* At the meeting, Andrew Wiles announced the award to Lafforgue and Lavinia Clay presented him with the Ferguson sculpture.
* The crucial contribution by Laurent Lafforgue to solve this question is the construction of compactifications of certain varieties of modules.
* Lafforgue soon received further major prizes for his remarkable mathematical achievements.
* Lafforgue's proof is a real tour de force, taking up as it does several hundred pages of highly condensed reasoning.
* By his achievement Lafforgue has proved himself a mathematician of remarkable strength and perseverance.
* Lafforgue established, for any given function field, a precise link between the representations of its Galois groups and the automorphic forms associated with the field.
* In 2003 Lafforgue became Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur and was elected to the Paris Académie des Sciences.
* On 15 May 2004, Lafforgue gave the address A mathematician and the classics to a conference organised to support the teaching of Latin and Greek in secondary schools.
* Jacques Chirac, President of the French Republic, nominated Laurent Lafforgue to the High Committee for Education which held its first meeting on Thursday, 17 November 2005.
* The day after Lafforgue was asked to resign from the Committee because he had questioned the need to take advice from the so-called "experts of the Ministry of National Education".

Born 6 November 1966, Antony, Hauts-de-Seine, France.
