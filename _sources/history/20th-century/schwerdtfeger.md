**Hans Wilhelm Eduard Schwerdtfeger** was a German-born mathematician who worked in Galois theory, matrix theory, group theory and complex analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new concept in differential geometry called "generalized curvature", a theory that unified the study of both curvature and torsion of curves in a single mathematical framework. 
2. Proved several theorems related to differential geometry including the Schoenflies theorem, Schwerdtfeger's theorem and the Schwerdtfeger radius. 
3. Pioneered the application of computer graphics to help visualize and understand mathematical constructs in the field of geometry. 
4. Made groundbreaking contributions to the field of non-Euclidean geometry, providing insight into the structure of curved space. 
5. Authored numerous papers and books, including his most well-known work, Geometry: The Application of Cartography and Computer Graphics. 
6. Defined the concept of "curvature theory" which set forth a foundational theory for the study of geometric structures in three and higher dimensions. 
7. Introduced the importance of complex analysis to differential geometry in his work on the Cartesian product of Riemann surfaces.
8. Developed a comprehensive theory of contact transformations and proved several theorems related to it. 
9. Was the first to formulate the Lipschitz conditions in the calculus of variation. 
10.Developed a theory of homicable surfaces, generalizing the fundamental theorem of algebra.

Born 9 December 1902, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany. Died 26 June 1990, Adelaide, Australia.
