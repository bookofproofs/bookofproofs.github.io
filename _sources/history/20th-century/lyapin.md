**Evgeny Sergeevich Lyapin** was a Ukranian mathematician who worked in algebraic systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Because his health was poor, Sergey Evgenyevich, who had been born in St Petersburg, had been sent to Yalta in the Crimea when he was a young boy.
* It was in Odessa that Sergey Evgenyevich's son, Evgeny Sergeevich, was born.
* Evgeny Sergeevich was interested in mathematics, physics, economics and history when at high school.
* Not accepted for the subject of his first choice, Evgeny Sergeevich decided that he would study history.
* This, it was explained to Evgeny Sergeevich, would open doors to him and allow him to study at university.
* In 1936 Lyapin graduated from Leningrad State University but continued to undertake research there under the supervision of V A Tartakovskii.
* At this time Lyapin's research was on the theory of groups and he published his first papers on this topic in 1936-37.
* During the siege Lyapin remained in Leningrad but had to give up his mathematical research and contribute to the war effort.
* Lyapin began to publish papers on semigroups, the first of these appearing in 1947.
* Lyapin worked extensively on partial groupoids and the results from his many papers were put together to form a monograph written jointly with A E Evseev  and published in Russian as Partial algebraic actions in 1991.
* Yet, if a faculty member would come to inform him of some negative aspects in the work of a colleague, Lyapin would always stop such conversation demanding that both faculty members meet and discuss the matter between them.

Born 19 September 1914, Odessa, Russian Empire (now Ukraine). Died 13 January 2005, St Petersburg, Russia.
