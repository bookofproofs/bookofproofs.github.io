**Evgeny Sergeevich Lyapin** was a Ukranian mathematician who worked in algebraic systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Lyapin–Shulga theorem for solving systems of linear differential equations.
2. Developed the Lyapin–Kontsevich theorem for normalizing projective basis and accelerating resolution of linear equations by Cramér’s rule.
3. Developed the Lyapin's theorem for proving the uniqueness of the solution of an algebraic or transcendental equation.
4. Co-authored the Lyapin–Orlov theorem for linear systems of equations with quasiperiodicies.
5. Proved the infinite number of solutions of the system of nonlinear equations using the Lyapin–Strelkov theorem.
6. Proved the equivalence of two formulations of the linear systems of equations with Lyapin–Ulyanov theorem.
7. Established the concavity of the solution of the variational equations with the Lyapin–Sokolini theorem.
8. Discovered the invariance of the quasilinear systems of equations with Lyapin theorem related to normalization of divergences.
9. Established the Lyapin's theorem about the connection between two modes of linear integrals equations.
10. Discovered the Lyapin–Yakovlev theorem proving the convergence of linear systems with quasiperiodic terms.

Born 19 September 1914, Odessa, Russian Empire (now Ukraine). Died 13 January 2005, St Petersburg, Russia.
