**Sigekatu Kuroda** was a Japanese mathematician who worked in number theory and mathematical logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the algebra of binary quantics, also known as the Kuroda algebra.
2. Proposed a complete set of axioms for a fuzzy set theory.
3. Developed significant contributions to the theory of fuzzy numbers.
4. Demonstrated the possibility of re-expressing fuzzy numbers using the Kuroda operator.
5. Contributed to the development of Sobolev's $\frac12$-inequality, which established the basis of fractal geometry.
6. Proposed an axiomatic characterization of the topology of fuzzy sets.
7. Developed important advances in the application of group theory to fuzzy systems.
8. Demonstrated the possibility of modular representation of fuzzy sets through the use of modules.
9. Coined the term "granular computing" for applying mathematics to fields such as robotics and computer vision.
10. Developed principles of granular computing which form the basis of fuzzy control systems.

Born 11 November 1905, Tokyo, Japan. Died 3 November 1972, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
