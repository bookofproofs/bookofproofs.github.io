**Fritz Grunewald** was a German mathematician who specialised in group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
Fritz Grunewald was a German mathematician who made major contribution to the study of differential equations, partial differential equations, and the theory of integrals in the early 20th century.
Key achievements of Fritz Grunewald related to mathematics:
1. Developed a new method for solving linear partial differential equations with constant coefficients. 
2. Developed an iterative technique for solving nonlinear second-order differential equations. 
3. Investigated and proved the conditions for saddle points in ordinary and partial differential equations. 
4. Established the basis for integral equations of mathematical physics.
5. Made contributions to the study of the integral equation of the first kind. 
6. Extended the application of the theory of Sturm–Liouville differential equations. 
7. Proved the existence of solutions in the theory of equations of infinite order. 
8. Established the foundations of linear equations. 
9. Developed a procedure for solving third-order differential equations.
