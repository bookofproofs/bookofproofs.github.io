**Fritz Grunewald** was a German mathematician who specialised in group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Helene and Friedrich Grunewald only had one child, Fritz (the subject of this biography), and they separated when he was only two years old.
* Helene and Fritz then went to live on the family farm at Lambsheim where the boy was brought up.
* Kinkel disapproved of Grunewald senior, while Fritz naturally wanted to maintain contact with his father.
* He felt the resulting tension throughout his childhood; by the time he was sixteen the tension proved excessive and Fritz and his father broke off all contact.
* By this time Grunewald senior had remarried; his daughter Ulrike has fond memories of her older half-brother, and recalls the pain of losing touch with him when she was only seven.
* It took twenty years for Fritz to re-establish contact with his father and with Ulrike; the long-separated siblings became close friends.
* Fritz attended the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium in Frankenthal, about 8 km east of Lambsheim, and graduated in 1968.
* An outstanding pupil, Fritz obtained the best marks in his Abitur of any of his classmates.
* One of his lecturers was the group theorist Jens Mennicke who soon gave Grunewald a love of group theory; it became a topic on which he would undertake research throughout his life.
* Mennicke left Göttingen when he was appointed to a chair at Bielefeld University in 1971 and Grunewald followed him there to complete his undergraduate studies.
* In his doctoral thesis Grunewald studied the Burnside group with two generators and exponent 8.
* In fact, perhaps hoping for even further progress, it was some years before Grunewald published papers based on the results he had obtained in his doctoral thesis.
* After his doctoral studies, Grunewald spent the year at 1973-74 at Queen Mary College, London.
* Grunewald had met Barbara Gernhuber (born 1951 in Bonn) when she was studying law in Bielefeld.
* Barbara had graduated from the Uhland-Gymnasium in Tübingen in 1970 and, after studying at Bielefeld University joined Grunewald during his year in London.
* Barbara and Fritz married in 1974 and continued their studies at Bielefeld.
* where Grunewald was appointed as an assistant.
* Grunewald habilitated at Bielefeld in 1979 and his wife Barbara was awarded her doctorate by Bielefeld in the following year for her thesis Grenzziehung zwischen der Rechts- und der Sachmängelhaftung beim Kauf Ⓣ(The boundary between the right and the liability for defects when purchasing).
* The award of a prestigious Heisenberg scholarship allowed Grunewald to move with his family to the University of Bonn.
* Barbara's distinguished career as a law professor ran alongside his own, and Fritz always took his share of domestic and parental responsibilities, arranging his work around the imperatives of childcare, shopping and cooking.
* In 1992 Grunewald made his final career move when he was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the Heinrich-Heine University of Düsseldorf.
* Grunewald wrote the important book Groups Acting on Hyperbolic Space(1998) in collaboration with Jürgen Elstrodt and Jens Mennicke.
* Grunewald died from a sudden heart attack one week before his 61st  birthday.
* Sadly Grunewald died before the special issue appeared as Volume 5, Part 2, in 2011.
* Two honours which Grunewald received should be mentioned.

Born 28 March 1949, Bad Kreuznach, Germany. Died 21 March 2010, Düsseldorf, Germany.
