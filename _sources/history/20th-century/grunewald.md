**Fritz Grunewald** was a German mathematician who specialised in group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Fritz attended the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium in Frankenthal, about 8 km east of Lambsheim, and graduated in 1968.
* An outstanding pupil, Fritz obtained the best marks in his Abitur of any of his classmates.
* One of his lecturers was the group theorist Jens Mennicke who soon gave Grunewald a love of group theory; it became a topic on which he would undertake research throughout his life.
* Mennicke left Göttingen when he was appointed to a chair at Bielefeld University in 1971 and Grunewald followed him there to complete his undergraduate studies.
* In his doctoral thesis Grunewald studied the Burnside group with two generators and exponent 8.
* In fact, perhaps hoping for even further progress, it was some years before Grunewald published papers based on the results he had obtained in his doctoral thesis.
* After his doctoral studies, Grunewald spent the year at 1973-74 at Queen Mary College, London.
* Grunewald had met Barbara Gernhuber (born 1951 in Bonn) when she was studying law in Bielefeld.
* Barbara had graduated from the Uhland-Gymnasium in Tübingen in 1970 and, after studying at Bielefeld University joined Grunewald during his year in London.
* where Grunewald was appointed as an assistant.
* In 1992 Grunewald made his final career move when he was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the Heinrich-Heine University of Düsseldorf.
* Grunewald wrote the important book Groups Acting on Hyperbolic Space(1998) in collaboration with Jürgen Elstrodt and Jens Mennicke.
* Grunewald died from a sudden heart attack one week before his 61st  birthday.
* Sadly Grunewald died before the special issue appeared as Volume 5, Part 2, in 2011.
* Two honours which Grunewald received should be mentioned.

Born 28 March 1949, Bad Kreuznach, Germany. Died 21 March 2010, Düsseldorf, Germany.
