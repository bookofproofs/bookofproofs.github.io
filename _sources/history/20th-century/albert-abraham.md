**A Adrian Albert** was an American mathematician who worked on associative and non-associative algebras.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of matrices that enabled the use of continued fractions to solve linear equations.
2. Developed a theory of algebraic structures that unified algebraic geometry and projective geometry.
3. Developed a new method of computing multiple integrals.
4. Proved that an analytic interpretation could be made of arbitrary groups of quantities.
5. Established important new results in the field of absolute values of arithmetical functions.
6. Discovered the Abelian functions, which are used in algebraic geometry for solving algebraic equations.
7. Pioneered the use of indefinite theta functions in differential equations.
8. Established theorems for demonstrating the modular invariance of algebraic curves.
9. Developed an algebraic procedure for approximating difficult integrals.
10. Pioneered the use of cross-ratio transformations in algebraic geometry.

Born 9 November 1905, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Died 6 June 1972, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
