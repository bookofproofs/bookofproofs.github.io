**Alexander Grothendieck** was a German mathematician and Fields medal winner. He made important contributions in topology, algebra and logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the field of homological algebra and its concrete applications in algebraic geometry.
2. Created the modern framework for generalising algebraic geometry to different categories, allowing abstract concepts like schemes.
3. Developed topos theory and its applications to analytic geometry.
4. Wrote the multi-volume treatise “Elements of Algebraic Geometry”, widely considered to be the modern definition of the field.
5. Received the Fields Medal in 1966 for his work in algebraic geometry and was named the Grand Master of the Academy of Sciences of Informatics in 1984.
6. Developed the theory of Grothendieck rings, which are used to study properties of algebraic varieties.
7. Posed a proof of the Weil Conjecture in 1964, which was generalised as the Grothendieck's Riemann-Roch theorem.
8. Proved the existence of “absolute Galois groups”.
9. Conducted groundbreaking research into Functional Analysis and its applications in arithmetic geometry.
10. Advanced the theory of algebraic cycles, which link a variety's homology to the properties of its algebraic structure.

Born 28 March 1928, Berlin, Germany. Died 13 November 2014, Saint-Girons, France.
