**Gündüz 0keda** was a Japanese-born Turkish mathematician who worked in the field of algebraic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ikeda's first publication Supplementary remarks on Frobenius algebras was written jointly with Nakayama, and appeared in the Osaka Mathematics Journal in 1950.
* Ikeda was awarded a Yukawa Scholarship to conduct research on cohomology theory of associative algebras at Nagoya University for session 1953-54.
* Ikeda remained as a Lecturer of Mathematics at Osaka University until 1960 when he first visited Izmir, Turkey, then visited Cahit Arf at Istanbul University.
* Ikeda was appointed as Foreign Specialist in Mathematics and Statistics at the Medical School of Ege University in Izmir in 1960.
* At the very moment of my arrival, they introduced to me a young faculty member: Doctor Ikeda.
* After Koç was appointed to Ege University he assisted Ikeda with his teaching.
* However, in time, thanks to Dr Ikeda, we transformed this office to an ongoing seminar room, for we had problems in different areas of mathematics and Dr Ikeda was the only one to lend us a hand so benevolently.
* He also became a Turkish citizen in that year and took a more Turkish sounding name, calling himself Gündüz Ikeda.
* At a dinner following the talks, Arf offered Ikeda a position at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara where he was now working.
* Ikeda accepted and took up the position of Professor there in August of 1968 and, together with Arf, worked to build up both the undergraduate and postgraduate sides of the Mathematics Department.
* Although Ikeda remained in his post at the Middle East Technical University until 1976, he spent 1970-71 as Visiting Professor of Mathematics at San Diego State University, California, USA.
* After he retired, Ikeda was Visiting Professor of Mathematics at the Eastern Mediterranean University, Gazi Magosa, in Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus from 1991 to 1993, then a Senior Researcher at Marmara Research Center, Gebze, Turkey from 1993 to 1995.
* Ikeda received many honours for his outstanding contributions.
* Despite his close friendship with Arf, Ikeda was critical of his contributions to Turkish mathematics.

Born 25 February 1926, Tokyo, Japan. Died 9 February 2003, Istanbul, Turkey.
