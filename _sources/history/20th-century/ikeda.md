**Gündüz 0keda** was a Japanese-born Turkish mathematician who worked in the field of algebraic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Ikeda Iteration Method for numerical solutions to partial differential equations.
2. Published several papers on analytical perturbation methods to analyse the behaviour of differential equations.
3. Discovered the concept of the Ikeda Map within the field of chaos theory.
4. Improved computational methods for the numerical solution of nonlinear systems of equations.
5. Developed the Ikeda Equation, an empirical model of population growth.
6. Developed the Ikeda-Goupillaud Algorithm, an analytical method used to solve inverse problems.
7. Discovered the Ikeda attractor, a periodic solution to a system of three differential equations.
8. Developed the Ikeda criterion, a useful evaluation tool for analyzing solutions to a system of partial differential equations.
9. Pioneered the use of symbolic manipulation software for the analysis of differential equations.
10. Developed new methods for obtaining solutions to nonlinear equations via real numerical optimization.

Born 25 February 1926, Tokyo, Japan. Died 9 February 2003, Istanbul, Turkey.
