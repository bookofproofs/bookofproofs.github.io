**Raymond Lorch** was a Swiss-born American mathematician who worked in general topology and functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father, Henry John Lorch (1868-1957), was born in Brighton, Sussex, England, the son of a German father and English mother.
* Ray's older brother Arthur E Lorch was born in Frankfurt, Germany in 1904.
* Ray's older sister Madeline D Lorch was born in Frankfurt, Germany in 1905.
* In 1916 Henry Lorch emigrated to the United States, leaving his family behind until he was settled.
* In the following year Myrtle, Arthur, Madeline, and Ray left Switzerland to join up with Henry Lorch who was working as a bank clerk in Bergen, New Jersey.
* Lorch attended Columbia University in New York where he studied mathematics and was awarded a Bachelor's degree, summa cum laude, in 1928.
* Obtaining a university position would have been almost impossible for Lorch but, fortunately for him, he was awarded a National Research Council Fellowship to finance a year of postdoctoral study at Harvard University working with Marshall Stone.
* Stone advised Lorch to more deeply study Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces.
* With the Great Depression still causing great worries about future jobs, Lorch applied for an extension to his one-year National Research Council Fellowship to visit the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
* Lorch did not feel that anyone could carry out all the tasks that were expected of the assistant but he said he wouldd think it over.
* Lorch had a productive year with Frigyes Riesz.
* Returning to the United States in May 1935, Lorch was appointed as an Instructor in mathematics at Columbia University.
* In 1941 Lorch was promoted to assistant lecturer at Columbia University.
* Lorch was enthusiastic about visiting European countries and able to deliver lectures in five different languages.
* We noted above that Lorch was divorced from his first wife in 1955.
* Like Lorch, she was divorced from her first husband, Claude Bov√©, in 1955.
* Ray and Maristella Lorch had two daughters Lavinia Edgarda Lorch and Donatella Livia Lorch.
* Between 1958 and 1990, Ray and Maristella de Panizza Lorch worked to enhance links, particularly educational links, between Europe and the United States.
* Lorch was Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at Barnard College from 1948 to 1963, and served as chairman of the committee on instruction in 1961.
* Lorch played an active role in the American Mathematical Society.
* It was music that was Lorch's greatest passion outside mathematics.
* It was fitting that Columbia University's Italian Academy for Advanced Studies, founded in 1991 by Maristella de Panizza Lorch, presented the first annual E R Lorch Memorial Recital on Wednesday, 1 May 2013 with a performance by Italian pianist Emanuele Torquati.
* In May 1989 Ray and Maristella de Panizza Lorch visited Hungary to celebrate Ray's long connections with the country beginning with his doctoral studies there in 1934.
* Lorch died on at St Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center in Manhattan after a long illness.

Born 22 July 1907, Nyon, Switzerland. Died 5 March 1990, Manhattan, New York City, New York County, USA.
