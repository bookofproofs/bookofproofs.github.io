**Raymond Lorch** was a Swiss-born American mathematician who worked in general topology and functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1925.
2. Developed a method of proving theorems in his dissertation, which was later known as “Lorch’s Method”.
3. Authored two significant papers in combinatorial mathematics in 1928 and 1941.
4. Was the first to use the concept of co-ordinates at the basis of rectangle geometry in the U.S.
5. Envisioned mathematics as the “handmaid of natural science” and wrote several books on mathematics for lay-audiences.
6. Authored several elementary mathematics textbooks, designed to introduce young students to the study of mathematics.
7. Developed new teaching methods, such as using physical models to study geometric concepts.
8. Established numerous sources of funding for post-doctoral research in mathematics.
9. Was a charter member of the Mathematical Association of Amercia.
10. Was a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Chicago for over 30 years.
