**J Presper Eckert Jr.** was an American computer pioneer. With John Mauchly he invented ENIAC: the first general-purpose electronic digital computer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Eckert co-designed and developed the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) in 1946, which laid the groundwork for modern digital computers.
2. He co-invented the BINAC computer in 1949, which was the first commercial stored-program computer.
3. Working with John Mauchly, he designed the UNIVAC I in 1951, which was the first full-scale commercial computer for business and government applications.
4. He established Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation in 1947, to develop and market computers.
5. He authored many publications on computing and mathematical topics, including The Design of Calculating Machines (1944) and The Design of Electronic Digital Computers (1949).
6. He also helped create one of the first computer programming languages, the Short Code.
7. He received the National Medal of Science in 1967 for his accomplishments in computing.
8. He was a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). 
9. He was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2000.
