**Bertha Swirles Jeffreys** was an English physicist who carried out research on quantum theory. She co-authored an important text-book on mathematical physics with her husband.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Sadly he died in 1905 when Bertha was only two years old leaving her mother, Harriett Swirles (born Northampton about 1873) the task of supporting her family.
* When Bertha was nine years old her mother left her private school to become a teacher at Stimpson Avenue Elementary School.
* Stimpson Avenue Elementary School was a natural place for Bertha to attend for her primary education which she did for three years until Northampton School for Girls opened in 1915.
* Bertha Swirles had studied both mathematics and physics as an undergraduate, having attended physics courses by Joseph John Thomson and Ernest Rutherford.
* Another of Fowler's research students, Paul Dirac, was a couple of years ahead of Swirles.
* But the person who had the most influence on Swirles's research was another research student Douglas Hartree who suggested the first research problem she attacked, studying the polarizability of atomic cores.
* The Yarrow Fellowship supported Swirles for the two sessions 1925-27, following which her next year was financed by a Hertha Ayrton Research Fellowship which allowed her to spent the year at GÃ¶ttingen in Germany.
* Returning to England in 1928, Swirles was appointed as a assistant lecturer at the University of Manchester.
* Milne had collaborated with Fowler while at Cambridge and he was in a good position to provide Swirles with guidance in her research.
* Swirles left Manchester in 1931, working as an assistant lecturer in Bristol during 1931-32, then as an assistant lecturer at Imperial College, London, in 1932-33.
* The result was a publication of D R Hartree, W Hartree and B Swirles, Self-consistent field, including exchange and superposition of configurations, with some results for oxygen published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1939.
* By the time this paper was in print, Swirles was back at Girton College, Cambridge, where she took up a Fellowship and a Lectureship in Mathematics.
* In 1940 she married Harold Jeffreys who at that time was teaching geophysics at Cambridge.
* It was in this year of 1946 that Bertha Swirles Jeffreys, in collaboration with her husband Harold Jeffreys, published the classic text Methods of Mathematical Physics.
* After her husband was knighted in 1953, she became Lady Jeffreys, better known to some as 'Lady J'.
* At Girton, Bertha Jeffreys continued to undertake research on quantum theory publishing papers such as The classification of multipole radiation (1952), The use of the Airy functions in a potential barrier problem (1956), and The asymptotic approximation (AA) method (1961).
* Mary Cartwright became Mistress of Girton in 1949, and Bertha Jeffreys took over her previous role of Director of Studies in Mathematics and Mechanical Sciences.
* She took a personal and warm interest in all her students and there was often "open house" for them on Sunday evenings at the Jeffreys residence halfway between Girton and the centre of Cambridge.
* This used to involve sampling Bertha's homemade flapjack whilst Sir Harold sat on the floor doing the Times crossword.
* Many a younger child received an imaginatively chosen birthday gift from Auntie Bertha.
* Let us note that she was an editor for four of the volumes of the Collected Papers of Sir Harold Jeffreys on Geophysics and other Sciences (1971-77).
* Also after her husband's death in 1989 at the age of 97, Bertha Jeffreys spent long hours sorting and cataloguing his papers so that they might provide a useful resource for future researchers.
* Throughout much of her life, Bertha Jeffreys was actively involved with the Mathematical Association.

Born 22 May 1903, Northampton, England. Died 18 December 1999, Cambridge, England.
