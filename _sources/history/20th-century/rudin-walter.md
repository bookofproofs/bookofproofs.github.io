**Walter Rudin** was an Austrian-born American mathematician who worked in complex and harmonic analysis and is also known for his mathematical analysis textbooks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He was knighted in 1869 and chose the title von Rudin.
* Aron Pollak von Rudin's son, Alfred, took over the match business.
* Walter did not attend kindergarten but, at age six, entered the Volksschule in Vienna.
* After about six months, Walter's parents managed to get out of Austria and reach Switzerland.
* After being moved camps, Walter was given call-up papers for the French Army and sent to Pontivy.
* The French told Walter that he should run off which he did and managed to reach Saint Jean-de-Luz in the south west of France.
* Rudin spent the war years in England.
* Rudin was awarded a B.A. by Duke University in 1947 and undertook research for his doctorate advised by John Jay Gergen, who had been a student of Griffith Conrad Evans and Szolem Mandelbrojt.
* Rudin was awarded his doctorate in 1949 for his thesis Uniqueness Theory for Laplace Series.
* Rudin published two papers directly based on his thesis.
* During this year at Duke University, Rudin met Mary Ellen Estill who had received a Ph.D. from the University of Texas in 1949 and was then appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics at Duke University.
* Rudin attended the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Cambridge, Massachusetts 30 August to 6 September 1950.
* Rudin was applying for positions in the spring of 1952 which was not easy since academic jobs were scarce.
* Rudin was appointed as a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1959.
* As we have seen, Rudin's early work was on trigonometric series and holomorphic functions of one complex variable.
* Let us look briefly at the other books which Rudin published.
* In the late 1960s, Rudin's interests turned towards questions in the theory of several complex variables.
* At the NSF regional conference from 1-5 June 1970, held at the University of Missouri, St Louis, Rudin gave a series of lecture which were published as Lectures on the edge-of-the-wedge theorem (1971).

Born 2 May 1921, Vienna, Austria. Died 20 May 2010, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.
