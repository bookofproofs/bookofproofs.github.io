**Ernst Specker** was a Swiss mathematician who made decisive contributions towards shaping directions in topology, algebra, mathematical logic, combinatorics and algorithms.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the Axiom of Choice, which states that the collection of elements from any set of distinct elements can be chosen without limits.
2. Developed the modal system S4, which consists of five logical axioms, including the axiom of necessity, which is the cornerstone of modern modal logic.
3. Helped to develop the semantics for the first-order predicate logic.
4. Pioneered the usage of partial order as a tool in fixing order in logical axioms.
5. Developed some of the initial definitions of set theory that became the basis of set-theoretic topology.
6. Established the primary mathematical foundations of Boolean algebra.
7. Published the first proof of the incompleteness theorem in mathematics.

Born 11 February 1920, Zürich, Switzerland. Died 10 December 2011, Zürich, Switzerland.
