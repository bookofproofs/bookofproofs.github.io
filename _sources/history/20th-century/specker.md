**Ernst Specker** was a Swiss mathematician who made decisive contributions towards shaping directions in topology, algebra, mathematical logic, combinatorics and algorithms.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ernst was the middle child of his parents' three sons.
* Ernst's father studied law and worked in the civil service.
* Ernst attended kindergarten in Zürich.
* Ernst was happy at this school but his health broke down when he contracted tuberculosis after beginning secondary school.
* Specker passed his university entrance examinations in the autumn of 1940.
* His father pressed him to study law at university but Specker wanted to study mathematics at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in Zürich.
* Specker's parents were rather unhappy about this but in the end they consented.
* During the Easter vacation Specker returned to his grandmother at Davos and read the Grundzüge der Theoretischen Logik Ⓣ(General theoretical logic)  by Hilbert and Ackermann.
* From 1945 to 1948 Specker was employed as an assistant at ETH, working first for Saxer, then for Hopf and Plancherel.
* He attended Bernays' seminar on Axiomatics and Logistics and one of the topics studied led to Specker's paper Nicht konstruktiv beweisbare Sätze der Analysis Ⓣ(Non-constructively-provable theorems of analysis) (1949).
* Roman Sikorski also attended the seminar and interaction with him led to Specker's paper Sur un problème de Sikorski Ⓣ(On a problem of Sikorski) (1949).
* We noted above that Specker was crippled by the illness he had suffered.
* Specker returned to ETH for session 1950-51 when he substituted for Hopf in teaching a course on linear algebra.
* Specker was promoted to professor at ETH in 1955 and the following year he married Suzanne; they had three children, Dorothea born in 1957, Adrian born in 1959 and Margaret born in 1962.
* In 1987 Specker gave his farewell lecture at the ETH Zürich Postmoderne Mathematik: Abschied vom Paradies?.

Born 11 February 1920, Zürich, Switzerland. Died 10 December 2011, Zürich, Switzerland.
