**Ioan James** is an English mathematician who works in topology and the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm for the numerical integration of equations of motion, which has been adopted as a standard in three-dimensional motion analysis. 
2. Accurately modeled the dynamics of chaotic systems in various complex physical systems.
3. Developed a unique method for deriving exact solutions to a number of mathematical models, including the Lorenz equations. 
4. Developed a novel approach to the study of chaotic systems, combining numerical simulation with analytical methods.
5. Constructed a set of mathematical tools used to study the chaotic behavior of dynamical systems.
6. Developed a general numerical algorithm for solving the equations of non-linear dynamical systems. 
7. Made significant advancements in computational fluid dynamics, leading to new insights into the physics of turbulent flow.
8. Published extensively on mathematical topics, including a number of influential books on numerical analysis and dynamical systems.

Born 23 May1928, Croydon, Surrey, England.
