**Alexander Skopin** was a Russian mathematician who worked in abstract algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Afterwards, the image of Ivan Alexandrovich became an example of a mathematician and professor which inspired Skopin.
* There Skopin passed the high school examinations without attending classes and entered the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Leningrad University where he was an outstanding student.
* Skopin continued his interest in this area up to the early nineteen sixties.
* From the middle of the nineteen sixties until the early seventies Skopin's scientific activity was reduced because of a heavy burden of administrative duties.
* The second key idea introduced by Skopin was the application of linear-algebraic methods, in particular, an analogue of Gaussian elimination, to such calculations.
* Skopin worked as a researcher at the Steklov Institute for the whole of his life and, in addition, he taught algebra in the Leningrad- St Petersburg University throughout his life.
