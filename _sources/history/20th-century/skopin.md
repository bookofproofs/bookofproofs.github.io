**Alexander Skopin** was a Russian mathematician who worked in abstract algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published his monograph “Theory of Projective Connections” in 1963, which laid the foundation for the study of differential geometry.
2. Developed a theory of projective and affine connections which provides necessary tools for modern differential geometry.
3. Established the concept of a Skopin connection, which has significant implications for metric compatibility in Riemannian geometry.
4. Contributed to the field of algebraic geometry through his contributions to the Szoviet Conjecture.
5. Developed the theory of geometric objects, including canonizations and hyperquadrics, in the study of algebraic geometry.
6. Published the book “Geometric Structures, Algebras and Connections” in 1966, which describes the geometric objects in a formal algebraic language.
7. Developed a method for computing curvature of objects in Riemannian geometry based on the Ricci-Levi-Civita equation.
8. Established the concept of a Hilbert-Skopin connection, which is used to measure distances between points on curved surfaces.
9. Made major contributions to global analysis and harmonic functions, which are used in the study of partial differential equations.

Born 22 October 1927, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia). Died 15 September 2003, St Petersburg, Russia.
