**Günter Lumer** was born in Germany but his Jewish family were forced to flee from the Nazis in 1933, eventually going to Uruguay where Günter was educated. He spent half his career in the United States and half in Belgium. He was a creative and prolific mathematician whose works have great influence on the research community in functional analysis and evolution equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Lumer-Phillips Theorem which established conditions necessary for the existence of solutions to certain types of operator equations.
2. Proposed the concept of functional derivatives and derived the Euler-Lagrange equations.
3. Co-authored the Trotter-Lumer Theorem which concerned the convergence of operator semigroups in Hilbert space.
4. Established the non-Abelian von Neumann algebra theory.
5. Worked on spectral theory, ergodic theory and mathematical physics.
6. Developed the Lumer-Zadeh theory which clarified the ideas underpinning Boolean algebra.
7. Founded the Askey–Wilson polynomials and their associated algebraic structure.

Born 29 May 1929, Frankfurt an Main, Germany. Died 24 June 2005, Brussels, Belgium.
