**Alexander Dinghas** was a Greek mathematician who worked in function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Alexander attended primary school in Smyrna and began his secondary schooling there.
* In 1922 his parents moved from Smyrna to Athens and Alexander moved with the family to complete the last three years of his secondary schooling there.
* In 1931 Dinghas began his studies at Berlin.
* However, many other talented mathematicians and theoretical physicists were also at Berlin and influenced Dinghas.
* It was the teaching of Schmidt in particular which convinced Dinghas that mathematics rather than physics was the subject for him to pursue.
* Right from the time he began his studies in 1931, Dinghas became interested in Nevanlinna theory.
* He attended lectures on the topic given by Schmidt and it was these lectures which Schmidt gave "with almost religious enthusiasm" which turned Dinghas from an engineer/physicist into a mathematician.
* Dinghas produced a series of papers on isoperimetric problems in spaces of constant curvature.
* His work here was much influenced by Schmidt who also produced important results which Dinghas used in his work.
* Although Dinghas had a wonderful feel for mathematics, he frequently waved his hands somewhat when he gave a proof.
* Dinghas felt the man's hunger and got the waiter to send him food and drink which Dinghas paid for.
* Dinghas received many honours for his work.

Born 9 February 1908, Smyrna (now Izmir), Turkey. Died 19 April 1974, Berlin, Germany.
