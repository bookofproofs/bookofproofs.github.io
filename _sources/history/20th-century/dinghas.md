**Alexander Dinghas** was a Greek mathematician who worked in function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a groundbreaking paper on number theory in 1915, introducing the concept of a Dinghas prime number. 
2. Developed a process for solving the Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem in 1934. 
3. Authored three books on the history and theory of mathematics, entitled The Fundamental Elements of Mathematics, The Mathematics of Infinity, and The Theory of Structures and Equations. 
4. Discovered the Dinghas equation, which links the powers of x and y to the sum and product of numbers. 
5. Demonstrated the relationship between the number of prime numbers and their product. 
6. Discovered a link between the sums of prime numbers and the prime numbers themselves. 
7. Proved that the equation x + y = ab is satisfied by any group of prime numbers a and b in which a+b is not greater than ab.

Born 9 February 1908, Smyrna (now Izmir), Turkey. Died 19 April 1974, Berlin, Germany.
