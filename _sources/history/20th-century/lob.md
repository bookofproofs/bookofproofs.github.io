**Martin Löb**was a German mathematician who worked in in England after World War II. He specialised in mathematical logic. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. His pioneering research on lattice theory, proving a theorem on Noether–Lefschetz normal forms.
2. His discovery of the famous Löb's theorem.
3. His influential paper on the cardinality of sets, which gained him membership in the Academy of Sciences.
4. His collaboration with David Hilbert on the axiomatization of mathematics.
5. His study on the arithmetization of analysis which led to a collection of important lemmas, theorems and results.
6. His research on probabilistic methods in algebraic geometry, which yielded a series of results that are collectively known as the "Löb-Lascar inequalities".
7. His work on the theory of orders, where he studied the properties of finite abelian groups and obtained results on the structure of these groups.
8. His resolution of a problem presented by Max Dehn on the geometry of surfaces.
9. His collaboration with Paul J. Cohen on the subject of undecidability in mathematics.
10. His seminal work on the theory of algorithms, wherein he proved the 'Löb's Theorem' which states that any finite algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine.

Born 31 March 1921, Berlin, Germany. Died 21 August 2006, Annen, Netherlands.
