**Volker Strassen** is a German mathematiican who can be considered the founding father of algebraic complexity theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the correctness of the asymptotically fast matrix multiplication algorithm (1975).
2. Devised the first polynomial-time algorithm for integer programming (1979).
3. Developed the first efficient parallel algorithms for basic linear algebra operations (1977).
4. Developed an algorithm that finds minimum spanning trees in logarithmic time (1979).
5. Designed the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication of order n, with a running time of O(n^2.807) (1969).
6. Introduced the algebraic approach to the probabilistic analysis of algorithms (1987).
7. Investigated fast multiplication of polynomials using fast Fourier transform techniques (1979).
8. Pioneered the use of floating-point arithmetic as an algorithmic tool (1972).
9. Derived an asymptotically fastest algorithm for fast fractal transformations (1994).
10. Established a connection between information complexity and differential privacy (2007).

Born 29 April 1936, DÃ¼sseldorf-Gerresheim, Germany.
