**Otto Schreier** worked in combinatorial group theory, particularly on subgroups of free groups and on knot groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored many papers on complex analysis and the theory of analytic functions.
2. Published a pioneering work in the field of Abstract Algebra, introducing the concept of minimal polynomials.
3. Developed the Schreier's Criterion for Decomposability which allowed the use of finite fields in the study of abstract algebra.
4. Discovered diophantine equations and congruences, a fundamental principle in number theory.
5. Explored topics such as the structure of groups and fields, as well as lattice theory in algebra.
6. Contributed to the development of the calculus of variations and the use of probability theory in logic and set theory.
7. Established the field of combinatorial group theory, which led to the study of the symmetries of objects.
8. Conducted groundbreaking research on the Linear Differential Equation, which helped in the development of modern control systems.
9. Developed the Schreier Graphs, which are used for understanding the structure of finitely generated groups.
10. Authored a seminal textbook on the Theory of Invariants which was the first to connect complex analysis to abstract algebra.

Born 3 March 1901, Vienna, Austria. Died 2 June 1929, Hamburg, Germany.
