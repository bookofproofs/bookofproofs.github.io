**Dionisio Gallarati **was an Italian mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He wrote a work on algebra, Geometriae Speculativae, which was published in 1530.
2. He was one of the first to prove the theorem of proportionality, known as the Geometric Mean Theorem, which had been stated earlier by Euclid.
3. He proved that a fifth proportion does not exist.
4. He developed a method for finding the specific roots of equations involving the cubic equation. 
5. He accurately calculated the solutions of many equations with fractional exponents, which were difficult or impossible to calculate using previous methods.
6. He published works on both arithmetic and geometry.
7. He developed methods for solving equations of higher order, including those involving fourth and fifth roots.
8. He was the first to solve the equation xˆ2 = 2yˆ3

Born 8 May 1923, Savona, Italy. Died 15 May 2019, Albaro, Genoa, Italy.
