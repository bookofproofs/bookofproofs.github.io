**Dionisio Gallarati **was an Italian mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Gallarati undertook research at the l'Instituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica (The National Institute of Higher Mathematics) in Rome.
* Gallarati was appointed to the University of Genova in 1947 and he remained there until he retired in 1987.
* This was one of Gallarati's most important mathematical contributions.
* It is worth noting that some of lower bounds obtained by Gallarati for the maximal number of nodes of surfaces of degree nnn were not improved until comparatively recently and for large values of nnn the exact maximal number of nodes of surfaces of degree nnn is still unknown despite much recent work on this topic.
* Gallarati extended the results to the case of tangent spaces of varieties of arbitrary dimensions, to arbitrary curves in Grassmannians corresponding to nondegenerate scrolls, and to complexes of higher degree.
* Gallarati studied properties of varieties whose tangent spaces meet certain linear subspaces along spaces of dimension higher than expected.
* Another particularly notable research contribution was made by Gallarati in his work on multiple contacts of surfaces along a curve.
* Other work by Gallarati included a classification of Fano varieties of the second kind, a study of irregularity of double spaces, and the finding of bounds for the class of a surface with ordinary singularities in terms of its degree.

Born 8 May 1923, Savona, Italy. Died 15 May 2019, Albaro, Genoa, Italy.
