**Hendrik Douwe Kloosterman**  was a Dutch mathematician, known for his work in number theory and representation theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a generalization of the reciprocity law for rational functions in 1937.
2. Proved the Mordell–Weil theorem on the torsion points of elliptic curves in 1929.
3. Developed a theory of Kloosterman sums which eventually led to the Fourier transform and the spectral theory.
4. Discovered the Kloosterman zeta function, which was an achievement in automorphic representation and the trace formula.
5. Demonstrated the Kloosterman-Selberg method, which has become a basic technique in the analytic number theory.
6. Conducted early work on the distribution of prime numbers.

Born 9 April 1900, Rottevalle, The Netherlands. Died 6 May 1968, Leiden, The Netherlands.
