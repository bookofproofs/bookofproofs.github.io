**Mark Kac** pioneered the modern development of mathematical probability, in particular its applications to statistical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the idea of probability theory, which is the core of modern statistics. 
2. Developed the idea of random walks, which has important implications in quantum mechanics.
3. Proved the additivity and continuity of Bernoulliâ€™s law of large numbers (LLN).
4. Re-established the mathematical theories of entropy and phase transitions. 
5. Developed the Multi-scale Analysis (MSI) method in ergodic theory.
6. Advanced the theory of orthogonal polynomials and the application of special functions in probability.
7. Founded the field of mathematical neuroscience and its related research, including the brain-wave concept.
8. Solved the classical Anzac Problem and studied the iterating function theory. 
9. Advanced the theories of decision-making and neural networks.
10. Showed that the thermodynamic order and chaos exist in chaos dynamics.

Born 3 August 1914, Krzemieniec, Poland, Russian Empire, (now Ukraine). Died 26 October 1984, California, USA.
