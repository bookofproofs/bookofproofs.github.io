**Stone** is best known for the Stone-Weierstrass theorem on uniform approximation of continuous functions by polynomials.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father, Harlan Fiske Stone, was a distinguished lawyer who served as dean of Columbia Law school from 1910 to 1923 and was on the supreme court for 21 years, serving as chief justice for the last five of these from 1941 to 1946.
* The family tradition would have had Marshall follow his father's into a law career and while he attended public schools in Englewood, New Jersey, it was assumed that he would become a lawyer.
* During the period that he was an instructor Stone's interests followed very much those of his research supervisor Birkhoff.
* In 1928 Stone was promoted to associate professor at Harvard.
* Although he would return to Harvard again in 1933, Stone first accepted a post as associate professor at Yale from 1931 to 1933.
* During these years Stone's research took a number of different directions.
* Stone's book is very different in spirit, in aim, in tone, in style, in timeliness, and in applicability.
* The work was begun in 1928, when Stone was 25; it was published when he was 29.
* This article included the celebrated Stone-von Neumann uniqueness theorem.
* These papers contain what today is called Stone-ÄŒech compactification theory.
* One particularly important result proved by Stone during this period was a substantial generalisation of Weierstrass's theorem on uniform approximation of continuous functions by polynomials.
* This result is now known as the Stone-Weierstrass theorem.
* This did not happen easily for Stone negotiated for a year with Robert Maynard Hutchins, President of the University of Chicago, before taking up the appointment.
* Stone did an outstanding job in returning this famous research school to the eminence it had previously known.
* Stone won the argument, the offer was made to Whitney, but he turned it down preferring to remain at Harvard.
* Again Stone won the argument and this time the offer was accepted.
* Stone continued to appoint leading mathematicians.
* This last appointment proved the hardest to get past the Chicago administration and Stone threatened to resign in a bid to get his own way.
* From 1952 Stone stepped down as head of department in favour of Mac Lane but he remained at Chicago until he retired in 1968.
* Stone received many honours for his outstanding achievements.
* Stone was elected president of the International Mathematical Union in 1952-54 and he was president of the International Committee of Mathematical Instruction from 1961 to 1967.
* Marshall Stone was a man with a very broad outlook and a wide range of interests who seems to have thought rather deeply about a number of issues.

Born 8 April 1903, New York, USA. Died 9 January 1989, Madras (now Chennai), India.
