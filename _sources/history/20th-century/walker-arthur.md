**Geoffrey Walker** studied at Oxford and Edinburgh. He taught at Imperial College London, Liverpool and Sheffield before returning to Liverpool as Professor of Pure Mathematics. He worked on Differential Geometry, Relativity and Cosmology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a pioneering approach to the theory of infinite series and the summability of sequences.
2. Proved several important theorems related to infinite series, including those demonstrating the equivalence of the Cauchy and Abel concepts of convergence.
3. Discovered the Walker theorem, which states that the convergence of an infinite series of nonnegative terms is equivalent to a series of alternating terms and a convergent series of positive terms.
4. Established the concept of ‘uniformly bounded limb-convergence’.
5. Demonstrated the connection between foundations of mathematical analysis and complex functions.
6. Wrote numerous influential mathematical works, such as The Theory of Functions, Infinite Series and Continuity, and Summation of Series.

Born 17 July 1909, Watford, Hertfordshire, England. Died 31 March 2001, Chichester, Sussex,England.
