**Howard Aiken** was a pioneer designer of early computers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Development of the Harvard Mark I automatic computing machine, one of the first true computers, in 1944.
2. Design and implementation of the Harvard large-scale differential analyzer, the first general-purpose analog computer in 1930.
3. Application of Boolean logic to large-scale circuits to simplify, optimize and validate designs in 1940.
4. Pioneering the concept of Harvard programming languages, including algorithmic development and control circuits in 1942.
5. Proposing the merit of the use of computers for the execution of long computations in the paper "The Use of High-Speed Vacuum Tube Devices for Calculating" in 1937.
6. Development of computing-machine language, a simplified instruction language for the simplified use of existing computing machines in 1951.
7. Inventing a number of devices, such as the Aiken Relay and Resonator, to improve the accuracy and speed of calculations with computers and other devices.

Born 9 March 1900, Hoboken, New Jersey, USA. Died 14 March 1973, St Louis, Missouri, USA.
