**Howard Aiken** was a pioneer designer of early computers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Daniel Aiken came from a wealthy Indiana family but, sadly, he was addicted to alcohol and this led to the family problems that we describe below.
* Daniel and Margaret Aiken were married on 16 May 1899 in Manhattan.
* Their only child was Howard Aiken, the subject of this biography.
* The family lived in Hoboken until around 1911 when Howard, his parents and his maternal grandparents all moved to Indianapolis, Indiana.
* Now Aiken's time at the Arsenal Technical High School was soon interrupted.
* His father had, as we mentioned above, a drink problem and when drunk he would abuse Margaret, Aiken's mother.
* When one such episode occurred around 1912, Aiken picked up the poker from the fireplace and drove his father out of the house.
* Daniel Aiken never returned and his parents, Aiken's paternal grandparents, would have nothing further to do with Aiken and his mother.
* After Aiken had completed the eighth grade at the school, when he was around 14 years old, he had to leave in order to earn money to support his mother and his maternal grandparents.
* His teachers at the Arsenal Technical High School were well aware of Aiken's potential, particularly in mathematics, and one of the teachers went to see Margaret Aiken to try to persuade her to let her son return to the high school.
* Aiken's mother could not allow this since her son was providing the only income for the family.
* However, the teacher persisted and found a job for Aiken with the Indianapolis Light and Heat Company which involved night work.
* The work with the Indianapolis Light and Heat Company was as a switchboard operator, a job that bored Aiken so much that he took up knitting socks to pass the time.
* It is not unreasonable to ask how Aiken could work both day and night but, being young and able to get by with a few hours sleep, allowed him to succeed.
* Because of his interrupted studies, Aiken did not have the necessary number of credits to graduate but Stewart set a special examination for him to give him the extra credits.
* Stewart also assisted Aiken in applying for a job and this led to an offer from the Madison Gas and Electric Company.
* Aiken and his mother moved to Madison so that he could take up the job as a nighttime telephone operator working from 4pm to midnight.
* Aiken, however, was extremely poor throughout his undergraduate years.
* After only part of a year at Chicago, Aiken transferred to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard in 1933.
* Aiken was 33 years old when he began his graduate studies at Harvard.
* Aiken was awarded an A.M. in physics in June 1937 and obtained a doctorate from Harvard in February 1939 for his thesis Theory of space charge conduction.
* Aiken married Louise T Mancill in 1939; they had one daughter Rachel but they were divorced in 1942.
* While he was a graduate student and an instructor in the Department of Physics at Harvard, Aiken began to make plans to build a large computer.
* These plans were made for a very specific purpose, for Aiken's research had led to a system of differential equations which had no exact solution and which could only be solved using numerical techniques.
* However, the amount of hand calculation involved would have been almost prohibitive, so Aiken's idea was to use an adaptation of the punched card machines which had been developed by Herman Hollerith.
* Aiken wrote a report on how he envisaged such a machine, and in particular he described how a machine designed to be used in scientific research would differ from a punched card machine.
* The report was sufficient to prompt senior staff at Harvard to contact IBM and an agreement was made that Aiken would build his computer at the IBM laboratories at Endicott, helped by IBM engineers.
* Working with three engineers, Aiken developed the ASCC computer (Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator) which could carry out five operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and reference to previous results.
* Aiken was much influenced in his ideas by Babbage's writings and he saw the project to build the ASCC computer as completing the task which Babbage had set out on but failed to complete.
* The work by Aiken on the computer was interrupted by World War II.
* Richard Bloch also worked with Aiken at Harvard on the ASCC.
* Aiken was married for a second time in January 1943.
* Howard and Agnes Aiken had one daughter, Elizabeth.
* Howard and Agnes were divorced in 1961.
* In 1946 Aiken and Hopper published three joint papers with the title The automatic sequence controlled calculator.
* Also in 1946 Aiken published A Manual of Operation for the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator.
* Aiken described the Mark IV in the paper which he wrote in French: Le calculateur Mark IV (1953).
* In 1961 Aiken retired from Harvard and was appointed as Distinguished Professor of Information at the University of Miami at Fort Lauderdale.
* Aiken did not teach at the University of Miami but rather became a businessman starting up Howard Aiken Industries Incorporated, a New York consulting firm.
* This was one of many honours which Aiken received for his pioneering work on the development of computers.

Born 9 March 1900, Hoboken, New Jersey, USA. Died 14 March 1973, St Louis, Missouri, USA.
