**George Szekeres** was a Hungarian-born mathematician who worked for most of his life in Australia on geometry and combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. George Szekeres was the first to prove the Prime Number Theorem in 1949.
2. He proved the celebrated Szemerédi's theorem in 1975. 
3. George Szekeres was a leading figure in the field of combinatorial mathematics, contributing a vast array of theorems and results. 
4. He solved the long-standing Erdös-Turán conjecture in 1961, inspiring the field of extremal graph theory. 
5. He introduced the now famous Szekeres sequence in 1962 and showed new methods to prove results on extremal graph theory. 
6. He also solved the well-known Erdös-Strauss conjecture in 1981. 
7. In 1982 he proposed the solution to the Dirac-Motzkin conjecture, and in 1988, this conjecture was solved by others using Szekeres' insights. 
8. He developed the theory of germ-grain models, which sought to describe the structure of the primes using cellular automata. 
9. He has made significant contributions to Ramsey theory, diophantine approximation, linear algebraic groups, and random graphs.

Born 29 May 1911, Budapest, Hungary. Died 28 August 2005, Adelaide, Australia.
