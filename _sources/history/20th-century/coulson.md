**Charles Coulson**'s main area of interest was molecular physical chemistry, but he contributed to many other areas.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Shortly after their marriage the couple moved to Dundee where Coulson was appointed as senior lecturer in mathematics at Queen's College, part of the University of St Andrews.
* As a devout Methodist, Coulson was a conscientious objector during World War II.
* In 1941 Coulson published Waves.
* Clearly D E Rutherford, who taught applied mathematics at St Andrews, had assisted Coulson who expresses his thanks to him in the Preface.
* In 1945 Coulson was appointed as a lecturer in mathematics at University College, Oxford, where he was also a fellow at the Physical Chemistry Laboratory.
* Coulson thanks E T Copson in the Preface of the book for his help in preparing the text.
* Coulson left his chair in London in 1952 when he was appointed Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford where he was also made a fellow of Wadham College.
* In 1970 Coulson underwent an operation for cancer of the prostate.
* In fact Coulson was elected President of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications in 1972 and held this position until his death.
* Coulson was a talented expositor and this is demonstrated in all his works such as Waves and Electricity which we made special mention of above, and also his best-selling work Valence published in 1952.
* Many honours were thrust on Coulson for his outstanding contributions to mathematics and chemistry.
* However, one must not think that, because Coulson undertook such a massive amount of scientific work, he would have no time for other activities.

Born 13 December 1910, Dudley, near Birmingham, England. Died 7 January 1974, Oxford, England.
