**Charles Coulson**'s main area of interest was molecular physical chemistry, but he contributed to many other areas.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the classical and semi-classical molecular orbital theories, providing an explanation to the distribution of electrons in a molecule.
2. Developed and calculated the first accurate values of the electron densities in molecules using his semi-classical molecular orbital theory. 
3. Developed a two-dimensional mathematical representation of the behaviour of electrons around the nucleus of atoms and molecules.
4. Established a connection between classical and quantum chemistry and pioneered the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics.
5. Discovered the correlation between the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit.
6. Popularized the famous Coulson-Fischer Integral theorem which not only greatly improved the accuracy of molecular computations, but also allowed for their mathematical formulation and calculation.
7. Developed the mathematical framework behind the Excited State Theory that informs modern studies into the orbitals and geometries of molecules.
8. Formulated the resonance theory which states that a molecule can have multiple resonance structures that cannot be accurately represented by only one bond structure.

Born 13 December 1910, Dudley, near Birmingham, England. Died 7 January 1974, Oxford, England.
