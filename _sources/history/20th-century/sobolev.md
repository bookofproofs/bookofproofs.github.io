**Sergei Sobolev** was a Russian mathematician who worked on mathematical analysis and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for finding integer solutions to algebraic equations of higher order.
2. Developed an algorithm for solving the Perron integral equation.
3. Developed the Fomin-Sobolev inequality, an inequality in higher dimensions.
4. Developed Sobolev's embedding theorem, which served as the foundation for modern Sobolev spaces theory.
5. Discovered the Sobolev–Milnor theorem, which established the connection between groups, manifolds, and Lie algebras.
6. Solved the Gel'fand-Leray problem and introduced a class of topological invariants.
7. Established a method for the local integration of analytic systems of equations with algebraic coefficients.
8. Provided an essentially new and most useful method, connection formulae, for constructing solutions of linear differential equations with constant coefficients.

Born 6 October 1908, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 3 January 1989, Moscow, USSR.
