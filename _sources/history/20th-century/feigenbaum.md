**Mitchell Feigenbaum** was an American mathematical physicist who discovered the so-called Feigenbaum constant in chaos theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical formula, now known as the Feigenbaum Constant, to explain the period-doubling bifurcation process of nonlinear systems.
2. Proved the universality of this math formula in a wide range of chaotic systems, making him the father of chaos theory.
3. Established the foundation for modern complexity studies and helped elucidate how chaos works in disciplines from physics to biology.
4. Named the Turner-Feigenbaum constants for his collaboration with J. C. Turner on the classification of dynamical systems. 
5. Discovered the KAM theorem which roughly states that for a wide class of Hamiltonian systems with a small amount of randomness introduced, there can be large regular regions embedded in a chaotic sea of behavior.
6. Pioneered a process for machine learning from data, called the 'cluster variation method.' 
7. Authored a book titled 'The Universal Computer' and coauthored three other books on the topic of computer science.

Born 19 December 1944, Philadelphia, USA. Died 30 June 2019, New York City, New York, USA.
