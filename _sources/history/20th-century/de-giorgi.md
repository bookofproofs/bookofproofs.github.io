**Ennio De Giorgi** was an Italian mathematician who worked on partial differential equations and the foundations of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the theory of functionals of bounded variations and gave the first existence proof of a solution to the partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
2. Developed a direct proof of the weak convergence of orthogonal series in the theory of Sobolev spaces.
3. Developed the monotonicity method and the associated Mountain Pass Theorem.
4. Established the fundamental theorem of calculus for a new class of functions, known as "Sobolev functions".
5. Introduced the topological method of De Giorgi–Nash–Moser for evolution equations.
6. Put forward the notion of gamma-convergence. 
7. Established the existence of solutions in the calculus of variations and stability theory.
8. Received the Crafoord Prize for Mathematics in 1983.

Born 8 February 1928, Lecce, Puglia, Italy. Died 25 October 1996, Pisa, Italy.
