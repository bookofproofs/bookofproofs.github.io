**Karl Gruenberg** was an Austrian mathematician who worked in finite group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The Kindertransport allowed Karl to be sent to England in March of 1939 but life was not easy for the ten year old German speaking boy.
* At first Karl attended Shaftesbury Grammar School in Dorset.
* Soon Gruenberg flourished, achieving excellent school grades, and his broad international based views meant he became very happy with his new life.
* By this time Gruenberg had become a British citizen, all the procedures being completed by 1948.
* Before the award of his doctorate Gruenberg had published a number of papers such as Some theorems on commutative matrices (1951), A note on a theorem of Burnside (1952), Two theorems on Engel groups (1953), and Commutators in associative rings (1953).
* Back in England after his two years in the United States, Gruenberg returned to Queen Mary College where he was appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics.
* Gruenberg's first research topic led him to a study of Engel groups.
* Results of many mathematicians such as Burnside, Thompson, Serre, Mac Lane, Magnus, Fox, Iwasawa, Golod, Safarevic, Roquette, and Gasch√ºtz are discussed, but large parts of the work was based on results by Gruenberg himself.
* In addition to these research level texts, Gruenberg also published an undergraduate level text (written jointly with A J Weir) Linear geometry.
* Gruenberg was always encouraging to his mathematical colleagues, and he showed particular kindness to those embarking on a mathematical career.
* Kurt Hirsch and Karl Gruenberg sat in the front row and both made encouraging and helpful comments to me after my talk.

Born 3 June 1928, Vienna, Austria. Died 10 October 2007, London, England.
