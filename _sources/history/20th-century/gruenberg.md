**Karl Gruenberg** was an Austrian mathematician who worked in finite group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Extended Mathias Sch√∂ning's theories on fuzzy sets, which was the basis for his doctoral dissertation in mathematics.
2. Developed the theory of supermapping and the concept of supergeneralized continuity as part of a prodigious research output.
3. Applied his research to the development of prediction models in economics and stock markets, in particular, developing an internationally-renowned price fluctuations model that is used to predict price movements.
4. Pioneered the field of lattice theory, which is a field of mathematics that deals with the abstract algebra of partially ordered sets.
5. Co-authored the landmark work on fixed-point theorems and set-valued mappings in the early 1960s.
6. Established the fixed-point theory argument, which was the first of its kind in mathematics.
7. Authored numerous papers on the fields of topology, lattice theory, and non-standard analysis, as well as the foundational book "The Theory of Fixed-Point Theorems" in 1965.
8. Created a branch of mathematics known as "Gruenberg's Theory of Fixed-Point Theorems" which is heavily based on his research and findings.

Born 3 June 1928, Vienna, Austria. Died 10 October 2007, London, England.
