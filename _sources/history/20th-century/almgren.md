**Frederick Almgren** was an American mathematician who worked in geometric measure theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established new research methods in geometric measure theory, which combines aspects of differential geometry, analysis and partial differential equations. 
2. Demonstrated properties of boundaries of arbitrary sets.
3. Developed mathematical proofs regarding the behavior of sets of arbitrary finite perimeter. 
4. Discovered new geometric measure theory techniques which can be applied to characterize the evolution of sets over time.
5. Wrote over 50 scientific publication related to functional analysis and geometric measure theory.
6. Served as editor of the American Mathematical Society's journal Real Analysis Exchange.
7. Developed and implemented new mathematical interpretations of area and surface area.
8. Solved difficult problems in analysis and geometry.
9. Published a monograph titled, The Theory of Generalized Functions and its Applications in Mathematical Physics. 
10. Developed the Almgrenâ€“Taylor isoperimetric theorem.

Born 3 July 1933, Birmingham, Alabama, USA. Died 5 February 1997, Princeton, USA.
