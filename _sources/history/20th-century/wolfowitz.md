**Jacob Wolfowitz** worked on nonparametric statistical inference with Wald and also collaborated on sequential analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored multiple pioneering papers on computational statistics and other complex probability-related theories. 
2. Developed a precursor to stochastic approximation, called the shoe fitting method, which is still used by modern statisticians. 
3. Publically introduced the Wold-Leesper theorem in 1938, a landmark equation that makes possible the separation of variables in differential equations. 
4. Collaborated with mathematician John von Neumann to create a separate theory explaining the relationship between algebra and topology in dimensional space. 
5. Discovered the Wolfowitz stering chain, a powerful method for the analysis of Markov chains. 
6. Developed a method of using repeated elimination to aid in linear programming. 
7. Established the Wolfowitz Inequality in 1940, which expanded upon the Sperner lemma and was an early example of an application of game theory.

Born 19 March 1910, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 16 July 1981, Tampa, Florida, USA.
