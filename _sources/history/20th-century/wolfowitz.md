**Jacob Wolfowitz** worked on nonparametric statistical inference with Wald and also collaborated on sequential analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Jacob attended High School in New York and, having graduated, entered the College of the City of New York.
* While Wolfowitz was in the middle of his undergraduate course the Great Depression began.
* When Wolfowitz graduated in 1931 there was little prospects of good employment so he spent the next ten years teaching mathematics in a number of different high schools while he worked towards his doctorate.
* In 1934 Wolfowitz married Lillian Dundes; they had one daughter, born in 1941 and a son Paul, born in 1943.
* Paul Wolfowitz became the Deputy Secretary of Defense (sic) for the USA in March 2001.
* In fact the first paper which Wolfowitz wrote was a joint one with Wald.
* Wolfowitz's earliest interest was nonparametric inference and the joint paper we just mentioned presents ways of calculating confidence intervals which are not necessarily of fixed width, on a distribution function FFF based on the empiric independent identically distributed observations on FFF.
* It is in a paper by Wolfowitz in 1942 that the word 'nonparametric' appears for the first time.
* Wolfowitz obtained his doctorate from New York University in 1942 and that year joined the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University.
* Wald and Wolfowitz were both attached to the Statistical Research Group at Columbia and they led the research project to develop a theory for sequential analysis.
* Wolfowitz produced work on sequential estimators of a Bernoulli parameter, and results on the efficiency of certain sequential estimators.
* At the end of the war Wolfowitz left the Columbia research group and took up a position as associate professor at University of North Carolina.
* We have mentioned Wolfowitz's work on nonparametric inference and his work on sequential analysis.
* Wolfowitz looked at many aspects of the maximum likelihood method.
* Information theory, which had been started by Shannon, was another area to which Wolfowitz made important contributions.
* It contains the core of the ideas of Wolfowitz's papers and of research influenced by him, which already means that the main stream of present research in this theory is covered.
* Wolfowitz received many honours for his outstanding contributions to statistics.

Born 19 March 1910, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 16 July 1981, Tampa, Florida, USA.
