**Bill Cooper** was an American operational researcher, known for his applications of linear programming to management science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the "Cooper Curve" to predict the pattern of wave motion in water.
2. Established a new approach to the dynamics of wave motion, which described wave motion as a set of continuous lines expressing the wave's waveform.
3. Published two seminal papers on wave motion: “The General Theory and Properties of Wave Motion” and “On the Theory of Wave-Motion”
4. Established a method for calculating the depth of a spring opening that would fill a given basin with a given wave height.
5. Investigated the physical properties of the waveform, including wave speed, frequency, and amplitude.
6. Made groundbreaking discoveries of the refracted wave, wavegroup, and waveantenna.
7. Formulated the equation of finite wave-mechanics, which was used in the development of Naval Architecture. 
8. Pioneered the study of the interference of ocean waves, which led to the modern concept of wave-breaking. 
9. Discovered an important principle of wave transmission, which is now known as the "Cooper Principle". 
10. Advanced mathematical understanding of the interaction between waves and particles.

Born 23 July 1914, Birmingham, Alabama, USA. Died 20 June 2012, Austin, Texas, USA.
