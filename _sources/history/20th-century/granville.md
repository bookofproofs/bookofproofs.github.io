**Evelyn Boyd Granville** was only the second African-American woman to receive a PhD in mathematics from an American University. She worked in computing.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The Great Depression began in 1929 when Granville was five years old, and by 1932 one quarter of the workers in the United States were unemployed.
* Granville attended elementary school, junior high school, and high school in Washington D.C. She was happy at school and was an outstanding pupil.
* It was an academically oriented school for black students which aimed to send their pupils to the top universities and there Granville was strongly encouraged by two of her mathematics teachers Ulysses Basset and Mary Cromwell.
* Granville graduated with distinction in 1945 and was awarded a scholarship from the Smith Student Aid Society of Smith College to undertake studies for her doctorate.
* After completing her Ph.D. from Yale, Granville spent a postdoctoral year at the New York University Institute of Mathematics working on differential equations with Fritz John.
* In December 1955 Granville left the National Bureau of Standards and she began work for IBM in January of the following year.
* In the 1967 Granville's marriage broke up and she returned to the academic world, accepting a teaching post at California State University in Los Angeles.
* Still Granville did not want to leave the academic world and she taught at the University of Texas at Tyler, where she held the Sam A Lindsey Chair, and retired in 1997.
* Granville gave her views on the current problems of teaching mathematics in American schools in a lecture at Yale University.

Born 1 May 1924, Washington D.C., USA.
