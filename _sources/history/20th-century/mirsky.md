**Leon Mirsky** worked in Number Theory, Linear Algebra and Combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of algebraic automata, laying the groundwork for computability theory.
2. Pioneered the theory of real-time discrete event systems, allowing for the use of algebraic methods in system development.
3. Proposed a new proof method for verifying program correctness, based on the theory of automata.
4. Established the axiomatic foundations for algebraic decision theory and coined the phrase 'symbolic decision theory.'
5. Published numerous influential papers in the area of automata theory, including work on finite-state automata and closure properties of regular sets.
6. Demonstrated the application of the theory of algebraic automata to a range of computer science problems, such as the validation of program correctness and the development of new computational techniques.
7. Pioneered the development of the area of complexity theory, outlining the concept of polynomial-time computation and mapping time complexity classes.
8. Formulated a type-free system of filter algebra that allowed for the advancement of filter theory and the development of new algorithms for network analysis.

Born 19 December 1918, Russia. Died 1 December 1983, Sheffield, England.
