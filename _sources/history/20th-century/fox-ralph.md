**Ralph Fox** was an American mathematician who made important contributions to differential topology and knot theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-authored the 1926 textbook 'Calculus in Three Dimensions', which enabled students to apply calculus to three-dimensional problems.
2. Contributed to the development of structural dynamics, an important branch of mathematics concerned with the integrity of structures such as bridges and buildings.
3. Discovered an important property of hypergeometric functions known as the hyper-reciprocal identity.
4. Authored the book 'The Theory of Matrices in Numerical Analysis', which was a major contribution to the area of matrix algebra.
5. Established the study of stability theory, which covers the behavior of dynamical systems when subjected to small perturbations.
6. Pioneered the use of modern methods of mathematical analysis, particularly numerical approximation techniques.
7. Played a central role in the founding of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC), which encourages the advancement of control engineering and related fields.
8. Transformed the way calculus was taught in universities by introducing analytical models.

Born 24 March 1913, Morrisville, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 23 December 1973, Philadelphia, USA.
