**Harold Davenport** worked on number theory, in particular the geometry of numbers, Diophantine approximation and the analytic theory of numbers. He wrote a number of important textbooks and monographs including _The higher arithmetic _ (1952).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established and formalised the use of Hardy–Littlewood circle method in number theory.
2. Received the De Morgan Medal in 1947 for his work on abstract algebra.
3. Showed that the Riemann hypothesis could be derived from the zero-free regions of the zeta function.
4. Developed an accurate heuristic for the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers.
5. Pioneered research into problems of Hardy and Waring's formulas.
6. Proved the conjecture of B.J. Birch concerning the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions.
7. Established a link between the initial behaviour of the prime number theorem and the Riemann Hypothesis. 
8. Was part of the team that developed the 'Davenport– Heilbronn' method for computing the real zeros of the zeta function.

Born 30 October 1907, Huncoat, Lancashire, England. Died 9 June 1969, Cambridge, England.
