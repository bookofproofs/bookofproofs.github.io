**Lars Ahlfors** was a Finnish mathematician who made important contributions to Complex Analysis and was one of the first recipients of a Fields Medal.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* For the first three years of his life, Lars was looked after by two of his aunts on the Aland Islands.
* Civil war followed, food was scarce and Axel Ahlfors was taken prisoner by the Reds.
* However, with German support for the White army, the Reds were quickly defeated and Axel Ahlfors was released.
* Lars Ahlfors was educated at a private Swedish language high school, the Nya Svenska Samskolan.
* Ahlfors had little interest outside his school work during these years.
* Ahlfors suddenly became known internationally when he solved this conjecture.
* After Zürich, Ahlfors went to Paris with Nevanlinna for three months before returning to Finland.
* In the year 1930-32 Ahlfors made a number of visits to Paris, supported by a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation, and to other European centres.
* In 1935, Constantin Carathéodory, whom Ahlfors had met in Munich during his travels, recommended him for a post at Harvard in the United States.
* Ahlfors agreed to a three year trial period.
* The main direction of Ahlfors's work was to return to the foundations of the subject, and view it from a more geometric (and differential geometric) point of view.
* In 1938 Ahlfors was offered a chair in mathematics at the University of Helsinki and, being rather homesick, he accepted this rather than remain permanently at Harvard.
* Ahlfors remained in Helsinki where the university was closed because there were too few male students.
* Two years after taking up the appointment at Harvard, Ahlfors was elected Chairman of the Mathematics Department.
* In the spring of 1947 Ahlfors gave a course on the method of the extremal metric, which was then in its infancy.
* Ahlfors did not conduct a regular seminar at any time during my stay.
* This was the text recommended to me by Edward Copson who taught me complex analysis and it is indeed a tribute to Ahlfors that Copson, who had himself written a superb book on complex analysis, should recommend Ahlfors' book rather than his own.
* Ahlfors received many honours for his outstanding contributions to mathematics.
* Ahlfors celebrated finiteness theorem for Kleinian groups, and his work on the limit set, revitalized an important area of research.
* Ahlfors' influence was pervasive and beneficial.

Born 18 April 1907, Helsingfors, Finland, Russian Empire (now Helsinki, Finland). Died 11 October 1996, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, USA.
