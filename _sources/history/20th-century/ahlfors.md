**Lars Ahlfors** was a Finnish mathematician who made important contributions to Complex Analysis and was one of the first recipients of a Fields Medal.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Ahlfors won the Fields Medal in 1936 for his work in complex Hadamard theory and conformal mappings.
2. He was awarded the Wolf Prize in 1980.
3. Ahlfors made significant breakthroughs in number theory. He proved the Denjoy conjecture and developed the concept of quasiconformal mappings in the plane.
4. Ahlfors introduced the notion of Teichmüller spaces and made important contributions to hyperbolic geometry.
5. He was one of the founders of the theory of discrete groups and their relation to Teichmüller spaces.
6. Ahlfors wrote a highly influential textbook on complex analysis and published groundbreaking research in many areas of mathematics.
7. His work on Riemann surfaces and covering spaces played an important role in topology and algebraic geometry.
8. Ahlfors and was a leading figure in the development of Nevanlinna theory and quasiconformal mappings.
9. Ahlfors' paper on conformal invariants, now known as the Ahlfors–Schwarz lemma, which was a key step in the proof of open mapping theorem.
10. Ahlfors also made major contributions to the theory of holomorphic functions of several complex variables.

Born 18 April 1907, Helsingfors, Finland, Russian Empire (now Helsinki, Finland). Died 11 October 1996, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, USA.
