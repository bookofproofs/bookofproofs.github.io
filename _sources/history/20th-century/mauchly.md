**John Mauchly** was an American physicist who, along with Prosper Eckert designed ENIAC, the first general purpose electronic computer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first large-scale general-purpose computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC).
2. Pioneered the development of algorithms for high-speed calculation.
3. Helped develop the first large-scale, commercial digital computers, Univac I and Univac II.
4. Contributed to advances in numerical mathematics, such as the development of the first working binary arithmetic unit.
5. Proposed the use of high-level programming languages, such as FORTRAN, to improve the efficiency of programming.
6. Co-invented the concept of the stored-program computer, which revolutionized computing.
7. Conceived the idea of computer hardware and software working together to expedite computer programming.
8. Developed the first line of computer peripherals.
9. Founded the Computer Usage Company to develop business-oriented computer systems.

Born 30 August 1907, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Died 8 January 1980, Ambler, Pennsylvania, USA.
