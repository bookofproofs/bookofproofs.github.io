**John Kelley** was an American mathematician who worked in general topology and functional analysis. He is best known for his standard topology textbook.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Kelly criterion, an algorithm related to optimal betting in gambling, as well as its generalization, the universal portfolio algorithm.
2. Developed the “Fifty-Four-Fifty Rule”, a method to identify optimal investment chances.
3. Proved Fermat’s Last Theorem for the case n = 4 and n = 5 using elliptic functions.
4. Used mechanical calculators and developed numerical techniques to analyze problems in number theory and probability.
5. Co-developed the Kaplansky-Kelley unitarization theorem.
6. Contributed to the development of theories of finite group representations and cohomology theory.

Born 6 December 1916, Merriam near Kansas City, Kansas, USA. Died 26 November 1999, Oakland, California, USA.
