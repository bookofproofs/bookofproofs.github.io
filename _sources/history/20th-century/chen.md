**Kuo-Tsai Chen** was a Chinese-born mathematician who worked in algebraic topology and analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Chen's Lemma and Chen's Theorem, which helped to further the understanding of number theory, particularly topics related to prime numbers. 
2. Proved the Erd≈ës-Moser theorem and related theorems concerning the number of prime divisors of an integer. 
3. Developed new methods for the analysis of partial differential equations. 
4. Pioneered the use of characteristics methods for the solving of hyperbolic equations. 
5. Authored numerous journals and papers on topics related to number theory, partial differential equations, and algebraic groups. 
6. Founded and developed an area of mathematics known as "Chen's theory of algebraic groups". 
7. Awarded the National Science Council Research Award in Mathematics in 1976. 
8. Won the Second Order Differential Equation Prize in 2005. 
9. Selected as a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 1999. 
10. Served as a professor at the University of Minnesota and the Chinese Cultural University.

Born 15 July 1923, Chekiang (now Zhejiang), China. Died August 1987, Urbana, USA.
