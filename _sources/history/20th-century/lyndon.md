**Roger Lyndon** was an American mathematician who worked in topology and group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1.  Solved Hilberts Tenth Problem, which led to a deeper understanding of algorithms, as well as giving mathematicians the opportunity to answer a centuries-old open problem.
2. Demonstrated that the word problem for groups is computable, which was the first proved instance of an algorithm that can solve a problem about a certain class of groups.
3. Discovered the Lyndon-Ullman theorem, which provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a solvable equation to be solvable by radicals.
4. Established the Lyndon-Schützenberger Theorem, which is a fundamental tool used to analyze combinatorial objects, including words, trees, and strings.
5. Constructed the Lyndon-S human-readable notation for writing computer algorithms, which is still widely used today.
6. Published numerous mathematical papers, helping to advance the field of mathematics.

Born 18 December 1917, Calais, Maine, USA. Died 8 June 1988, Ann Arbor, Washtenaw, Michigan.
