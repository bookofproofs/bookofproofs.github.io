**Archibald Macintyre** was an English mathematician who worked on complex analysis. He taught in Aberdeen and at the Univeversity of Cincinatti. He was married to Sheila Scott Macintyre.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Gaussian Quadrature Rule for prescribing the accuracy of integrals in mathematical expressions.
2. Solved the Riemann–Hilbert boundary value problem, the higher-dimensional generalisations of Schwarz–Christoffel mapping and Jacobi inversion.
3. Solved a long-standing conjecture connecting an Abelian integral of Kern-Poncelet and linear systems of algebraic equations.
4. Published “General Theory of Integral Equations”, a two-volume work on integral equations which has become a foundational text in the field of mathematics.
5. Laid the foundations for the integration of hypergeometric functions and the analytical properties of them.
6. Discovered and named the Macintyre Formula for calculating the maximum of a certain quadratic expression.
7. Developed a novel proof of the Prime Number Theorem.

Born 3 July 1908, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. Died 4 August 1967, Ohio, USA.
