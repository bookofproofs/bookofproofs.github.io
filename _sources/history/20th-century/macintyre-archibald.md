**Archibald Macintyre** was an English mathematician who worked on complex analysis. He taught in Aberdeen and at the Univeversity of Cincinatti. He was married to Sheila Scott Macintyre.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* William Macintyre, who used his middle name of Archibald, was born in 1878 in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, and was a schoolmaster at a public elementary school in Sheffield.
* They were married in Sheffield in June 1905 and their first child, Kathleen Mary Macintyre, was born the following year in Ecclesall Bierlow, in Sheffield.
* She was two years older than Archibald, the subject of this biography.
* Archibald Macintyre was educated at the Central Secondary School, Sheffield.
* The school opened on 10 March 1880 as the Central Higher Grade School in the centre of Sheffield, and re-located to its present site at High Storrs (and renamed High Storrs Grammar School) in 1933, a few year Macintyre had completed his studies there.
* Macintyre spent the academic year 1929-30 undertaking research at Cambridge advised by Edward Collingwood.
* In fact Collingwood, although seven years older than Macintyre, had a rather unusual route to teaching at Cambridge.
* After one year of research at Cambridge, Macintyre was appointed as a temporary Assistant Lecturer attached to the Mathematics Department of Swansea University College.
* Archibald Read Richardson had been appointed as professor of mathematics at Swansea in 1920 and was head of department at this time.
* Macintyre moved to Sheffield in 1931 where he was appointed as an Assistant Lecturer in the Mathematics Department.
* Through an introduction by Edmund Whittaker, Macintyre met the mathematician Sheila Scott.
* Macintyre and Scott were married on 27 December 1940 and, in the following year, Sheila Macintyre was appointed as an assistant lecturer in the same department as her husband in the University of Aberdeen.
* The Macintyres had two children, Alister William Macintyre (born 8 February 1944) and Susan Elizabeth Macintyre (born March 1950).
* A third child, a boy named Douglas Scott Macintyre, died from enteritis in March 1949 at the age of two years.
* Archibald and Sheila Macintyre undertook some joint mathematical work.
* In volume 23 of the Journal of the London Mathematical Society (1948) there are two papers by the Macintyres.
* The first, by Sheila Scott Macintyre, is an 8-page entitled A functional inequality while the next paper, by Archibald Macintyre, is a 3-page paper entitled Note on the preceding paper.
* Sheila Macintyre proved two new theorems attacking Wright's question while Archibald Macintyre used one the lemmas in Sheila Macintyre's paper to generalise a theorem proved by Wright in an earlier paper.
* A few years later, in 1952, the two Macintyres published a more conventional type of joint paper, namely the 2-author work Theorems on the convergence and asymptotic validity of Abel's series which was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
* Archibald Macintyre was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 3 March 1947.
* At Aberdeen, Macintyre was thesis advisor to James Clunie.
* In 1958 Macintyre and his wife accepted visiting research professorships at the University of Cincinnati in the United States.
* They returned to Aberdeen in 1959 but, on 30 September of that year, Archibald Macintyre resigned his Senior Lectureship at Aberdeen so that he could take up a permanent post as Research Professor in Mathematics at Cincinnati.
* Sheila Macintyre resigned her Lectureship at the same time and was also appointed as a professor in the Mathematics Department at Cincinnati where she taught until her early death from breast cancer in March 1960.
* In 1963 Macintyre was named Charles Phelps Taft Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cincinnati.
* Although Macintyre is best known for his work in pure mathematics, he did have interests in applied mathematics and physics.
* Finally, let us record that Macintyre was a member of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, the London Mathematical Society and the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.

Born 3 July 1908, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. Died 4 August 1967, Ohio, USA.
