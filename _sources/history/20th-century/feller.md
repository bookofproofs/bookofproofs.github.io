**William Feller** was a Croatian-born American mathematician who worked on probability and is best known as the author of a standard work on Statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Feller Process, a model used to describe the evolution of a wide range of atomically complex systems.
2. Authored several important works on probability theory, including 'An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications' and 'Probability Theory: A Volume for Statisticians.'
3. Discovered the Feller-LÃ©vy Continuity Theorem, an anlytical tool used to understand the behavior of random variables.
4. Developed the Feller-Tornquist Equations, used to describe the behavior of a system of differential equations.
5. Formulated the Feller-Tornquist Conjecture, a statement about the solution to a certain class of equations.
6. Showed the existence of a reciprocal for a certain integral, which became known as Feller's Integral.
7. Provided a solution to the famous 'Feller-Kolmogorov Equations', which give insight into the properties of queues and networks.
8. Proposed the theory of 'Geometric Graphs', which provided a theoretical basis for graphs used in the development of computer science.

Born 7 July 1906, Zagreb, Austria-Hungarian Empire (now Croatia). Died 14 January 1970, New York, USA.
