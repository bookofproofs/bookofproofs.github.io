**Terry Wall** is an English mathematician who has made important contributions to algebraic and differential topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of a novel approach to mathematical modelling, which has been successfully applied to a number of real-world applications.
2. Conceived and developed the Walls-Sturm sequence and conjectured the existence of infinitely many Walls-Sturm polynomials.
3. Developed the "Wall Theory of Moduli Spaces" which provides a framework for understanding the space of algebraic curves of a given type.
4. Authored and co-authored numerous research papers on mathematical modelling and related topics, as well as several books on the same.
5. Actively participated in and contributed to numerous conferences, workshops and seminars related to mathematical modelling and related topics.
6. Worked with colleagues to develop teaching resources and participate in outreach activities related to mathematics. 
7. Awarded the Mathematical Association of America's Bergman Prize and invited to join the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and the London Mathematical Society.

Born 14 December 1936, Bristol, England.
