**Terry Wall** is an English mathematician who has made important contributions to algebraic and differential topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Terry Wall attended Marlborough College.
* Wall had already been awarded a fellowship at Trinity College in 1959 before the award of his doctorate and he held this fellowship until 1964.
* In addition to his fellowship, Wall was appointed a College Lecturer at Cambridge when he returned from the United States in 1961.
* In 1964 Wall moved from Cambridge to Oxford where he was appointed Reader in Mathematics and a fellow of St Catherine's College.
* Wall's research is mostly in the area of geometric topology and related algebra.
* In 1995 Wall published The geometry of topological stability written jointly with A A du Plessis.
* Wall's work has led to him receiving many awards.
* In 1990 Wall was elected a foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences.
* Wall retired in 1999 and was made Emeritus Professor at the University of Liverpool.
* Retirement certainly did not mean that Wall was less in demand as a plenary speaker at international conferences.
* Wall continues to publish important research articles, and an outstanding book Singular points of plane curves in 2004.

Born 14 December 1936, Bristol, England.
