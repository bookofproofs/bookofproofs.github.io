**Donald Knuth** is an American mathematician and computer scientist most famous for his contributions to the study of algorithms and inventing the TeX typesetting language.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the 'Big O' notation, which is used to analyze algorithms.
2. Discovered the knapsack problem, a famous optimization problem in computer science.
3. Authored The Art of Computer Programming, a multivolume work considered the definitive description of computer algorithms. 
4. Invented the LR-parser, the first of its kind.
5. Co-created the TeX computer typesetting system with Leslie Lamport.
6. Proposed the Balanced Binary Tree, a self-balancing tree data structure.
7. Invented the concept of Literate Programming - a methodology for creating computer programs from an amalgam of code and literature.
8. Developed the Backus–Naur Form for writing a formal grammar for a computer language.

Born 10 January 1938, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.
