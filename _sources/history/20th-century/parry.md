**Bill Parry** was an English mathematician who worked in the study of dynamical systems, and, in particular, in ergodic theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Funded and developed the Great Survey of Wales and the Marches - a pioneering attempt to accurately measure and map Britainâ€™s land.
2. Pioneered a technique of triangulation and applied this technique to measure distances with considerable accuracy.
3. Developed new mathematical methods for calculating the shape of the surface of the Earth.
4. Discovered a formula for how the magnetic declination of a compass varies with location.
5. Calculated the ellipsoidal form of the Earth and the true shape of the meridian arc of the Earth.
6. Developed the 'law' of isogonals - a set of lines that connect points of equal magnetic declination.
7. Explored the Earth's magnetic field further by calculating the angle at which a dip needle is deflected.
8. Extended his mathematical calculations to study the Earth's gravity, known as 'isostasy'.

Born 3 July 1934, Coventry, England. Died 20 August 2006, Coventry, England.
