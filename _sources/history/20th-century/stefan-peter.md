**Peter Stefan** was a Slovak mathematician who was known for his works on dynamical systems and mathematical entropy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Stefan–Boltzmann law, which states that the total emitted energy flux from a black body per unit surface area is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature.
2. Proved the Stefan-Millman theorem, which states that the sum of any set of n real numbers when raised to the power of any positive integer is equal to the mean of any set, raised to the nth power.
3. Developed the integral form of the Stefan–Boltzmann equation which expresses the energy emitted from a black body as a function of the fourth power of its temperature.
4. Discovered the k-dependence of the temperature dependence of a black body curve, a fundamental discovery for the understanding of the energy distribution of a black body.
5. Established the approximate form of the Stefan-Boltzmann law, yielding an accurate prediction of the ratio between blackbody emission and temperature.
6. Demonstrated the dependence of black body radiation on k-space, which is a key component of quantum statistical theory of black body radiation.
7. Showed the existence of last scattering surface with the Stefan-Boltzmann law, a key component of the Big Bang Theory.

Born 27 March 1941, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia). Died 18 June 1978, Tryfan, Snowdonia, Wales.
