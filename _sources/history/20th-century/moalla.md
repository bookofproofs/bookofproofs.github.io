**Fatma Moalla** is a Tunisian mathematician who has undertaken research on Finsler spaces. In 1961 she became the first Tunisian to have been awarded the Agrégation in Mathematics in France and, in 1965, the first Tunisian woman to be awarded a doctorate in mathematics in France.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* During the next three years, from 1957 to 1960, Moalla studied at the Institut des Hautes Études de Tunis which is situated at 8 Rue de Rome.
* Moalla was not satisfied with stopping her studies at this level and she was very keen to obtain a doctorate in mathematics.
* Moalla spent one year in which she prepared for CAPES, the Certificate for teaching in secondary education, and the Agrégation.
* Moalla sat the oral examination in July 1961 at a most difficult time since she was a Tunisian in France and the two countries were fighting each other.
* Moalla was appointed as a mathematics teacher in the Lycée de la Rue du Pacha, the school which she had herself attended, teaching there for the year 1961-62.
* In 1964 Moalla published Espaces de Finsler complets Ⓣ(Complete Finsler Spaces) in Comptes rendus des séances de l'Académie des sciences de Paris Ⓣ(Records of the sessions of the Paris Academy of Sciences).
* Moalla continued to publish in Comptes rendus and her third paper was Espaces de Finsler sans points conjugués Ⓣ(Finsler spaces without conjugate points) (1965).

Born 14 January 1939, Tunis, Tunisia.
