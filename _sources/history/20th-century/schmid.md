**Hermann Ludwig Schmid**  was a German mathematician who worked in algebra and algebraic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the "Göttingen-Darmstadt Lemma" (which presented a sufficient condition for a function to be linearizable).
2. Founded "Schmidssche Theorie der algebraischen Formen" (which dealt with the concept of invariant forms).
3. Published important works such as "Erläuterungen zur Theorie der Invarianten" (which explained invariant theory).
4. Discovered a connection between the linearization problem and hyperelliptic curves.
5. Authored the book "Der rechnerische und graphische Aufbau der Invariantentheorie" (which laid out a computational and graphical framework for the theory of invariants).
6. Was the first to prove that invariants can always be represented by homogeneous polynomials.
7. Demonstrated how the action of an algebraic group on a variety can be used to study invariants and the equations of classical varieties.
8. Developed the structure theorem of invariant theory and the Fried?Schmid theorem.
9. Pioneered new methods of using computers in mathematics.

Born 26 June 1908, Göggingen near Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany. Died 16 April 1956, Würzburg, Germany.
