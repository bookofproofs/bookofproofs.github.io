**Irving John Good** was an English mathematician who worked at Bletchley Park and at GCHQ and later went on to work with computers and statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His parents were Morris Edward Good (1885-1958) (also known by the Yiddish name Moshe Oved) and Sophia Polikoff.
* Morris Good was born in Poland at a time when it was part of the Russian Empire, He learnt the trade of a watchmaker before emigrating to England at the age of seventeen.
* Jack Good showed remarkable mathematical talents when he was still a child.
* Good entered Jesus College, Cambridge where he attended lectures by A E Ingham, J C Burkill, F P White and G H Hardy.
* He played a lot of chess, particularly with John Francis O'Donovan who played board one for Ireland.
* Good won the Cambridgeshire Chess Championship in 1939.
* One of those who interviewed him for the position at Bletchley was Hugh Alexander, who had twice been British Chess Champion and who Good knew, having played chess with him.
* At first Good worked in Hut 8 headed by Alan Turing but after a year Turing moved to a different area and Hugh Alexander became head of Hut 8.
* In 1943 Good moved to the "Newmanry", working under Max Newman.
* The main users at first were Newman, Michie and Good, and some months later about twenty mathematicians.
* Good was a main user and produced more than half the theory for the use of the Colossi.
* After the war ended, Good was appointed as a lecturer in Pure Mathematics at the University of Manchester working for Max Newman who had been appointed as professor.
* While at Manchester, Good was also involved in the project to develop an electronic computer.
* One reason for Good leaving Manchester was that his book Probability and the Weighing of Evidence had been rejected by a publisher.
* Good worked at GCHQ from 1948 until 1959.
* In 1959 Good resigned from his position at GCHQ when offered a chair at the University of Chicago.
* We mention two further books: (jointly with David B Osteyee) Information, weight of evidence, the singularity between probability measures and signal detection (1974) and Good thinking.
* This last mentioned book collects together many of Good's more philosophical and less mathematical papers.
* Good retired and was made Professor Emeritus in July 1994.
* Good died of natural causes at the age of 92.

Born 9 December 1916, London, England. Died 5 April 2009, Radford, Virginia, USA.
