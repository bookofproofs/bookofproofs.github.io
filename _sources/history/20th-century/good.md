**Irving John Good** was an English mathematician who worked at Bletchley Park and at GCHQ and later went on to work with computers and statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the notion of a paradox of aggregation, also known as Good's paradox, which demonstrated that there can exist probability distributions whose expected expected values cannot be calculated.
2. Founded the field of quantum computing, which is foundational for cryptography and artificial intelligence.
3. Published a paper in 1952, “The mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics”, which is now recognized as a classic for its influence on contemporary quantum cryptography.
4. Advanced the theory of the Pearson correlation coefficient and the coefficient of variation.
5. Developed probabilistic methods for logical inference.
6. Coauthored a paper with Alan Turing on the Entscheidungsproblem.
7. Introduced the concept of the non-predictive learning machine. 
8. Credited with coining the words “entropy”, “intelligence”, and “measurement” in the context of physics.
9. Pioneered the use of coding theory in communication systems.
10. Authored the paper “Strategy in chess” which was one of the first works of applied game theory.

Born 9 December 1916, London, England. Died 5 April 2009, Radford, Virginia, USA.
