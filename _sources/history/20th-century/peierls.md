**Rudolf Peierls** was one of the most influential of the German mathematical physicists who migrated and settled in Britain during the Nazi era.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the field of quantum field theory while developing the Renormalization Group method and providing the foundations of modern statistical mechanics.
2. Produced influential works on the scattering and diffraction of radiation by a crystal lattice, oxygen production and nuclear fission.
3. Proposed Novel methods for computing atomic cross sections and elucidated the Peierls barrier.
4. Developed a system of equations used to compute the structure of atoms and molecules.
5. Authored a book detailing the mathematics of group theory and played a role in its application to physics.
6. Successfully solved the three-body scattering problem for low energies and proposed a meson theory for nuclear forces.

Born 5 June 1907, Berlin, Germany. Died 19 September 1995, Oakenholt, near Oxford, England.
