**Abigail Thompson** is an American mathematician who studies combinatorial methods in 3-dimensional topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Thompson undertook research at Rutgers University in New Jersey where she was advised by Martin George Scharlemann and Julius L Shaneson.
* What is known is that many classes of knots do have property PPP and, in her thesis, Thompson added two further classes.
* Following the award of her doctorate Thompson spent the academic year 1986-87 at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the leading university in Israel.
* The work described by Thompson in this lecture related to her paper (with Joel Hass and William Thurston) Stabilization of Heegaard splittings (2009).
* There are other aspects of Thompson's contributions which we wish to highlight in this biography.
* Thompson is married with three children and first became aware of the educational problems when her daughter started attending state education in Davis.
* But Thompson not only pointed out problems with education reforms in California but she made considerable efforts to improve the situation by helping to launch "Starting With Math", a University of California at Davis programme aimed at strengthening teachers' knowledge of mathematics.
* Finally we look at the considerable contribution that Thompson has made to the American Mathematical Society.

Born 30 June 1958, Norwalk, Connecticut, USA.
