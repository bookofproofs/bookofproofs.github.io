**Mikhail Lesokhin** wasa Russian mathematician whose research was mostly in semigroup theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was through a piece of good fortune that Mikhail Moiseevich survived these difficult times.
* Even at this early stage the doctors realised that the young Mikhail Moiseevich had special mathematical talents but still more adventures were to come before he could return to a normal upbringing.
* The fact that he was a brilliant pupil, together with the educational help he had received from the doctors at the hospital, meant that Mikhail Moiseevich was not disadvantaged educationally when he attended high school in Leningrad and when he graduated in 1951 he received the medal for the top pupil in the whole school.
* In 1951 Lesokhin entered the Leningrad Herzen Pedagogical Institute where he studies mathematics and physics.
* It was therefore natural that Lesokhin should undertake research on this topic and he submitted his dissertation Systems with external multiplication  in 1961.
* Lesokhin published a number of papers on this topic beginning in 1958 and 1961, followed by Regularity of systems with exterior multiplication with regular first component (Russian) (1963) and On the completeness of systems with exterior multiplication (Russian) (1963).
* Most of the time Lesokhin was undertaking research for his doctorate he was working at the Pedagogical Institute in Khabarovsk in the east of the USSR about 30 km from the Chinese border.
* Lesokhin's research is mostly in semigroup theory.
* In this paper Lesokhin looks only at commutative semigroups where he finds necessary and sufficient conditions that a semigroup be approximately in the class of regular semigroups, the class of groups, the class of idempotent semigroups, and the class of finite groups.
* Let us look briefly at two books that Lesokhin jointly authored.
* Sometimes, when it seemed that everyone understood everything, there remained only one "dumb" participant, Mikhail Moiseevich himself.
* If even Professor Lesokhin did not understand something, then we, his students, didn't have to feel ashamed that we too didn't understand something.
* Mikhail Moiseevich was very skilful in destroying our inferiority complexes.

Born 13 August 1933, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia). Died 1 June 1998, St Petersburg, Russia.
