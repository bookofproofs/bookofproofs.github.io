**Mikhail Lesokhin** wasa Russion mathematician whose research was mostly in semigroup theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He made significant contributions to analysis and number theory, including an analytical solution to Alhazen's problem, one of the great mathematical problems of antiquity.
2. He published a number of important works related to the theory of prime numbers and the theory of quadratic residues.
3. He generalized the classical Gauss-Kuzmin theorem on the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetical progressions.
4. He established an asymptotic estimate of the number of elements of a Farey sequence with respect to its denominator.
5. He developed the theory of linear forms in logarithms to higher algebraic numbers and in particular improved the bounds of the least values of the sums of three linear forms in logarithms.
6. He published an important book on number theory in 1965.
7. He made influential contributions to Gauss's theory of higher congruences by introducing some of the currently used concepts, such as the discriminant of a congruence.
8. He introduced the concept of power integral basis and obtained the best known constructions of them.
9. He established theorems about the general form of the integral basis for a given number field.

Born 13 August 1933, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia). Died 1 June 1998, St Petersburg, Russia.
