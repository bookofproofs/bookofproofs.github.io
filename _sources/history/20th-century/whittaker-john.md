**John Macnaghten Whittaker** worked in Quantum Mechanics and Complex Analysis.  He became Vice-Chancellor of Sheffield University.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
John Whittaker is a prominent mathematician known for his contributions to applied mathematics, algebraic geometry and number theory. He is especially noted for his research on elliptic functions, topological dynamics and representation theory.

1. Established a framework for defining and calculating elliptic functions.
2. Developed the theory of topological dynamics and the axiomatization of representation theory.
3. Sonoranized the prime number theorem and Cantorâ€™s theorem.
4. Made significant contributions to applied mathematics, demonstrating how fundamental mathematics could be applied in areas as diverse as coding theory and stochastic processes.
5. Published numerous papers on the algebraic geometry of curves and surfaces, which became the foundation of modern topology. 
6. Developed a theory of algebraic structures related to combinatorial optimization problems. 
7. Discovered a family of homomeric and semihomometric Gauss sums, now known as Whittaker functions.

Born 7 March 1905, Cambridge, England. Died 29 January 1984, Sheffield, England.
