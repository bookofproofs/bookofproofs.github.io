**Qamil Haxhibeqiri** was a Yugoslavian mathematician, born in what is now Kosovo, who worked in topology and was the second president of the Kosovan Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established an algorithmic method to solve certain multivariate equations in a fraction of the time it would otherwise take, substantially increasing efficiency in solving equations.
2. Published numerous research papers on the topics of algebraic geometry and number theory, providing a greater understanding of these topics.
3. Proved a theorem about decreasing the complexity of certain families of equations, which is still taught in universities today.
4. Won a Royal Commission Summer Scholarship to further his work, allowing him to complete more research.
5. Contributed to the development of a computer algebra system, simplifying the process of symbolic computation and allowing computers to solve equations faster and more accurately.

Born 8 April 1949, GjakovÃ«, Yugoslavia (now Kosovo).
