**Benjamin Moiseiwitsch** was an English mathematician who worked on differential and integral equations and was interested in connections between art and mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His parents were Jacob Moiseiwitsch and Chana Kotlerman.
* Let us say a little about Daniel Moiseiwitsch at this point.
* As we will see below, although Benjamin became an applied mathematician, he also had an interest in art, in particular in the connections between art and mathematics.
* Benjamin grew up in Romford where he attended the Royal Liberty School, a grammar school in Upper Brentwood Road, founded in 1921.
* Moiseiwitsch entered the school in 1940 and, after proving to be an outstanding pupil, graduated in 1946.
* One of Moiseiwitsch's fellow students, also interested in mathematics and theoretical physics, was Alexander Dalgarno (1928-2015).
* When Moiseiwitsch began his studies at University College London it was only one year after the war had ended and everything was still in a poor state.
* Moiseiwitsch was awarded a B.Sc. from University College London in 1949 and continued studying there for a Ph.D. advised by Harrie Massey.
* In 1950 Massey and Moiseiwitsch published The Scattering of Electrons by Hydrogen Atoms in the Physical Review.
* This short paper announced results which they stated would be published later in full and, indeed, in August 1950, Massey and Moiseiwitsch submitted the paper The Application of Variational Methods to Atomic Scattering Problems.
* In 1952 Moiseiwitsch graduated from University College London with a Ph.D. awarded for his thesis on quantum theory The Application of Variational Methods To Collision Problems.
* Julian Moiseiwitsch studied dental surgery at University College London and was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
* Nicholas Moiseiwitsch studied electronic engineering at the University of Southampton and became Head of Engineering Policy at the Institute of Electrical Engineers.
* Moiseiwitsch was promoted to Reader in Applied Mathematics at the Queen's University, Belfast in 1962 and Professor in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics in 1968.
* Moiseiwitsch was elected to the Royal Irish Academy in 1969.
* Two projects by Moiseiwitsch after he retired are well worth mentioning.

Born 6 December 1927, Romford, London, England. Died 16 September 2016, Belfast, Ireland.
