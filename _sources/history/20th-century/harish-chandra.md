**Harish-Chandra ** was an Indian-born mathematician and physicist who worked mainly in America and did fundamental work in representation theory, especially on Lie groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He established a new model of Automorphic Forms by showing how to combine algebra with analysis.
2. He constructed an important new invariant for all measurable group actions that lead to the averaging techniques in representation theory.  
3. He gave an analytic proof of the Riemann-Weyl integration theory and developed a powerful new geometry of symmetric spaces.
4. He proved a profound theorem known as the Harish-Chandra Character formula which gave new insight into the nature of group representation.
5. He formulated the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber Integral, a fundamental planar integral which is used widely in mathematics and physics.
6. He was one of the first to apply algebraic methods to the proof of existence of unitary representations of semisimple Lie groups.

Born 11 October 1923, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India. Died 16 October 1983, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
