**Cheryl Praeger** is an Australian mathematician who has applied the ideas of symmetry to a wide variety of mathematical problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After leaving school Praeger enrolled in the University of Queensland and completed her four year B.Sc. degree in 1969.
* Between her third and fourth years Praeger spent eight weeks at the Australian National University.
* After completing her undergraduate course Praeger was offered a scholarship to undertake research at the Australian National University but she was also offered a Commonwealth Scholarship to study at the University of Oxford in England.
* At Oxford, Praeger was in St Anne's College and assigned Peter Neumann (son of Bernhard Neumann and Hanna Neumann) as a supervisor for her research.
* At ANU Praeger lived at University House and there she met a statistics research student John Henstridge.
* In 1982 Praeger was promoted to Senior Lecturer, then to Professor of Mathematics less than a year later.
* Praeger has one of the most stunning publication records of any mathematician.
* Examples of papers in which Praeger looked at groups acting on structures are Symmetric graphs and a characterization of the odd graphs (1980) which investigates graphs with large groups of automorphisms.
* Another topic to which Praeger had made major contributions is Computational Group Theory.
* Praeger was immediately interested and she began an important line of research which has made major contributions to Computational Group Theory.
* One of Praeger's most popular lecture topics at a lower level is on mathematics and weaving.
* Praeger has received many honours for her mathematical contributions.

Born 7 September 1948, Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia.
