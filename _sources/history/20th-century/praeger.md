**Cheryl Praeger** is an Australian mathematician who has applied the ideas of symmetry to a wide variety of mathematical problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Both Cheryl's parents, however, encouraged their children to educational achievements.
* Cheryl's mother always had an ambition that her children would be able to benefit from a university education.
* When Cheryl was born her father was working for the Commercial Bank of Australia and this led to the family moving from one town to another as Cheryl was growing up.
* After one year at high school in Nambour, Cheryl's family moved again, this time to Brisbane, because her father had changed career and wanted to open an office there as a chiropractor.
* After leaving school Praeger enrolled in the University of Queensland and completed her four year B.Sc. degree in 1969.
* Between her third and fourth years Praeger spent eight weeks at the Australian National University.
* After completing her undergraduate course Praeger was offered a scholarship to undertake research at the Australian National University but she was also offered a Commonwealth Scholarship to study at the University of Oxford in England.
* At Oxford, Praeger was in St Anne's College and assigned Peter Neumann (son of Bernhard Neumann and Hanna Neumann) as a supervisor for her research.
* At ANU Praeger lived at University House and there she met a statistics research student John Henstridge.
* In early 1976 they moved to the University of Western Australia in Perth where Praeger had been offered a temporary two-year position and her husband was offered a one year tutorship which would allow him to complete his doctorate.
* In fact Praeger wrote one joint paper with her husband, Note on primitive permutation groups and a Diophantine equation, which was published by the journal Discrete Mathematics  in 1980.
* In 1982 Praeger was promoted to Senior Lecturer, then to Professor of Mathematics less than a year later.
* Praeger has one of the most stunning publication records of any mathematician.
* Examples of papers in which Praeger looked at groups acting on structures are Symmetric graphs and a characterization of the odd graphs (1980) which investigates graphs with large groups of automorphisms.
* Another topic to which Praeger had made major contributions is Computational Group Theory.
* Praeger was immediately interested and she began an important line of research which has made major contributions to Computational Group Theory.
* One of Praeger's most popular lecture topics at a lower level is on mathematics and weaving.
* Praeger has received many honours for her mathematical contributions.

Born 7 September 1948, Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia.
