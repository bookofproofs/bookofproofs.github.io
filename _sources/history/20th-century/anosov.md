**Dmitri Anosov** was a  Russian mathematician who worked in dynamical systems theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He proved the Anosov closing lemma, which is of vital importance in ergodic theory.
2. He developed a qualitative theory of Lorenz attractors in 1967, which has since become a cornerstone of chaos theory.
3. He initiated the study of hyperbolic dynamical systems, a field of mathematics valuable in understanding physical processes, in 1960.
4. He formulated the Anosov-Hopf theorem, which links topology, geometry, and dynamics and is regarded as a fundamental work of modern geometry.
5. He developed a theory of robust structural stability, a fundamental concept in dynamical systems theory.
6. He demonstrated that periodic orbits of hyperbolic systems are dense in parts of the phase space and showed exponential instability of homoclinic orbits in hyperbolic systems in 1969. 
7. He discovered the special type of hyperbolic attractor known as the Anosov-Bowen-Franks attractor.
8. He created the Anosov-Kashevskaya theorem, which describes the existence of two recurrent directions in a hyperbolic flow with two-dimensional surfaces. 
9. He formulated the Anosov-Tunyev genericity theorem, and developed the concept of uniform approximability in dynamical systems.

Born 30 November 1936, Moscow, Russia. Died 7 August 2014, Moscow, Russia.
