**Nassim Taleb** is a Lebanon-born American mathematician and statistician whose work concerns problems of randomness, probability and uncertainty.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored several mathematical works, including the modern classic “Dynamic Hedging: Managing Vanilla and Exotic Options” and the groundbreaking “Fooled by Randomness”.
2. Developed the “black swan theory” which explains the concept that large, one-off events have an outsized impact on markets.
3. Developed the “Min Max” risk management strategy which seeks to minimize losses while maximizing gains.
4. Published articles in several mathematical journals and provided highly technical advice to fund managers and banks in regards to their investment strategies.
5. Co-created the Taleb Distribution, a random number generator that aims to simulate randomness in human decision-making.
6. Developed the “barbell strategy” for portfolio diversification, which guides investors to allocate large portions of their portfolio to either very safe or very risky investments with very little in between.
7. Demonstrated an expertise in probability theory, stochastic calculus and statistics which has been applied to many of his theories.
8. Theory of Extremistan, a concept that states that certain areas of life and markets are subject to high levels of rare and unpredictable incidents. 
9. Introduced the concept of “antifragility” which emphasizes the idea that it's not enough to be resilient to uncertainties, but that it's important to seek out opportunities to capitalize on them.

Born 12 September 1960, Amioun, Lebanon.
