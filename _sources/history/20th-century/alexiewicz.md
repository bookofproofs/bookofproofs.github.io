**Andrzej Alexiewicz** was a Polish mathematician, born in what is now Ukraine, who was an expert at functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Alexiewicz-Orlicz Space Theory, an important part of modern functional analysis.
2. Proposed an extension of Moore's theorem of infinite-dimensional spaces and created a new theory of Lebesgue-type spaces.
3. Wrote several papers on abstract algebra and the theory of banach derivatives.
4. Developed the “Alexiewicz Representation Theorem” for functionals defined on locally convex spaces.
5. Established several foundational theorems on topological algebras.
6. Solved two major unsolved problems in the theory of locally convex spaces.
7. Was the first to prove a general theorem of the topology of locally convex spaces.
8. Solved a problem regarding metrizable spaces and proved three original theorems about measurable cardinals.
9. Established new theories around groups and rings of characteristics 0 which then became widely applied.
10. Conducted research which laid the foundation for the modern theory of integration and differentiation.

Born 11 February 1917, Lwów, Poland, Austria-Hungarian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 11 July 1995, Poznań, Poland.
