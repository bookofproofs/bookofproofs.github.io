**Alberto Calderón** was an Argentinian mathematician who cooperated with Zygmund to found the Chicago school of "hard analysis".

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of singular integral operators, introducing the concept of the "Calderón–Zygmund singular integral operator" and the "Calderón–Zygmund kernel".
2. Gave the definitive proof of the existence of solutions of elliptic equations using the "maximum principle". 
3. Established the link between probability and Fourier analysis with his Uniqueness theorem for harmonic functions. 
4. Introduced the Calderon-Vaillancourt Theorem for splitting a Fourier series into a regular and singular part.
5. Presented the "Fefferman-Phong inequality" for characterizing the smoothness of regular functions.
6. Wrote one of the earliest papers on pseudodifferential equations, introducing the concept of the Calderón-Shubin pseudodifferential operator. 
7. Put forward an innovative mathematical framework for the study of singular integral equations, based on his work on the Calderón reproducing formula.
8. Conducted important early work on scattering theory and its applications.

Born 14 September 1920, Mendoza, Argentina. Died 16 April 1998, Chicago, USA.
