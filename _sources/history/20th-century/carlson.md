**Don Carlson** was an American mathematician who worked in mechanics and elasticity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Don Carlson developed the Carlson elliptic integral, which is used in calculus, computer graphics and other complex mathematics.
2. Don Carlson formulated the Carlson symmetric form, which is a method for solving elliptic integrals without the need for numerical approximations.
3. Don Carlson provided mathematical interpretations for the integral of inverse trigonometric functions and studied their numerical algorithms.
4. Don Carlson discovered a method for computing the hyperbolic arc length, leading to important insights into how to accurately calculate the lengths of arcs in hyperbolic space.
5. Don Carlson wrote more than 100 seminal papers in the field of mathematical analysis, which have been widely recognized and adopted as the standard for sophisticated mathematical problem solving.
6. Don Carlson developed and proved a series of theorems known as the Carlson Measurement Theory, which resolves a long-standing problem in the field of differential geometry.
7. Don Carlson formulated a method to solve certain classes of higher order linear and nonlinear differential equations and established a connection between elliptic periodic functions and elliptic integrals.
8. Don Carlson worked on the computation of definite integrals in multiple dimensions and developed the Lloyd-Carlson-Shanker algorithm for efficiently evaluating multi-dimensional integrals.

Born 8 March 1938, Tampico, Illinois, USA. Died 21 August 2010, St Louis, Missouri, USA.
