**Alan Turing**'s work was fundamental in the theoretical foundations of computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the concept of a Turing Machine which laid the groundwork for modern computers.
2. Developed the functional and mathematical foundations of theoretical computer science, mainly in his work of 1936, On Computable Numbers and Papertossing.
3. Introduced the binary number system in mathematics which revolutionized Computer Science. 
4. Developed fundamental methods and techniques in areas such as mathematical logic, artificial intelligence, and cryptography. 
5. Suggested the Turing Test as a way of determining a computerâ€™s ability to think. 
6. Developed the Turing-Church thesis, which proposed that all logical and mathematical functions could be solved using a computer.

Born 23 June 1912, London, England. Died 7 June 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire, England.
