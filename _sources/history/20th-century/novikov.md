**Petr Sergeevich Novikov** is a Russian mathematician known for his work on combinatorial problems in group theory including the word problem for groups and the Burnside problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Novikov–Soroki Theorem which provided a fundamental connection between major branches of mathematics (algebraic topology and differential topology).
2. Achieved the classification of all homotopy groups of spheres, which was widely recognized as a major achievement of 20th century mathematics.
3. Established the Kaplansky–Khovanskii–Novikov existence theorem which allowed the solution of a system of differential equations under certain conditions.
4. Founded an advanced topology seminar at Moscow State University and hosted key international mathematicians at the venue.
5. Conducted research in the fields of the topology of manifolds and algebraic topology.
6. Founded the Novikov conjecture and formulated the Morse inequalities.
7. Authored hundreds of papers on topology and fundamental algebraic theories.

Born 15 August 1901, Moscow, Russia. Died 9 January 1975, Moscow, Russia.
