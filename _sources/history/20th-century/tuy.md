**Hoàng Tụy** was a Vietnamese mathematician who was one of the founders of higher education in Vietnam. He was the first secretary of the Vietnamese Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first mathematician in Vietnam to prove an analytical geometry theorem for circles. 
2. He was the first to calculate the radius of an ellipse and its foci, as well as determine the area of curvilinear figures. 
3. He established the trigonometric theorem of equal hyperbolas. 
4. He wrote the text book Analytic Geometry, the first of its kind in Vietnam, which has had success in many educational institutions. 
5. He was the first to prove the Pythagorean theorem in the context of analytic geometry. 
6. He developed a mathematical model of thermodynamics. 
7. He authored several articles on the geometry of curves and surfaces, as well as other research topics in mathematics.
