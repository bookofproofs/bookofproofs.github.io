**Detlef Gromoll** was an German mathematician who worked in America.  He worked in differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the characterization problem for 3-dimensional compact Riemannian manifolds that admit a metric of non-negative scalar curvature.
2. Researched on a particular submanifold, now known as the Gromoll-Meyer manifold.
3. Published a review article on the Gibbons-Hawking Ansatz in four dimensions.
4. Developed ISCO-index, which is a numerical invariant from smooth structures of 4-manifolds.
5. Proved the Cheeger-Gromoll Splitting Theorem.
6. Formulated the Constant Rank Theorem, which gives a complete classification of Riemannian manifolds.
7. Leveraged Morse theory to define the splitting of a Riemannian manifold into two parts.
8. Established an early step towards understanding Ricci flow.

Born 13 May1938, Berlin, Germany. Died 31 May2008, Stony Brook, New York, USA.
