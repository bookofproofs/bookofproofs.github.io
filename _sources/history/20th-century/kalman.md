**Rudolf Kalman** was a Hungarian-born American mathematician best known for his work in control theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Kalman Filter and Kalman Gain, fundamental contributions to the field of estimation and control theory and for the engineering applications of these concepts.
2. Constructed the underlying mathematics for the Differential Motion Estimator, the first practical continuous-time linear filter used in navigation systems.
3. Established the foundation of the Wiener filter, a mathematical tool for establishing optimal linear estimators from noisy observations.
4. Improved the theory of linear quadratic control, a core concept in control engineering, providing the foundation for a series of state estimation techniques for linear dynamic systems.
5. Demonstrated the mathematical basis of uncertainty in dynamical systems, and provided a range of tools to propagate, track and reduce the effects of such uncertainty.
6. Pioneered the Diffusion-LMS adaptive filter applied in audio signal processing, allowing the estimation and removal of noise from audio signals.
7. Demonstrated the fundamental importance of linear matrix inequality (LMI) in many areas of mathematical system theory.
8. Shifted the focus of control engineering from open-loop systems with predetermined trajectories to closed loop systems with variable state estimations and feedback.

Born 19 May 1930, Budapest, Hungary. Died 2 July 2016, Gainesville, Florida, USA.
