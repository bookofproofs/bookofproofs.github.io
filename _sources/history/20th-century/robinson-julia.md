**Julia B Robinson** worked on computability, decision problems and non-standard models of arithmetic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Became the first woman to receive a doctorate in mathematics from an American university (1948).
2. Helped develop a solution to Hilbert's Tenth Problem, a mathematical problem deemed "unsolvable" for nearly a century (1970).
3. Pioneered the use of computers to help prove mathematical theorems (early 1960s).
4. Developed unique approaches to the field of decision theory, which examines the ways people make decisions in the face of uncertainty (1957).
5. Helped prove the four-color map theorem in 1976, which solved an important geometrical problem of mapping regions evenly (1976).
6. Discovered a unique set of mathematics that explained the structure of certain molecules and related it to mathematical proofs (1960s).
7. Published over 60 papers and contributed to the development of mathematics in numerous theoretical areas (1950s and 1960s).

Born 8 December 1919, St Louis, Missouri, USA. Died 30 July 1985, Berkeley, California, USA.
