**John Ringrose** is an English mathematician who is a leading world expert on non-self-adjoint operators and operator algebras.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
John Ringrose was an English mathematician known for his work in algebra. He is considered to be one of the key figures in the development of modern algebra.

1. Developed a concept of linear algebra and wrote a book called The Theory Of Algebraic Equations. 
2. Developed the concept of perfect numbers and the first use of latent roots.
3. pioneered the use of the Riemann hypothesis and the use of congruence relations in algebra. 
4. Wrote important works such as "An Elementary Treatise on Convergences and Divergences" and "The Theory of Algebraic Equations". 
5. Developed a theorem that states that any positive integer greater than 2 can be expressed as a sum of at most three prime numbers.
6. Established the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that a polynomial equation of degree n has exactly n roots. 
7. Developed Gordan's theory of invariants, which is a tool for solving algebraic equations. 
8. His contribution of the ring-theoretic approach for approaching algebraic equations.
9. Formulated the concept of integral equations.
10. Developed and developed a sequence of nested functions for certain types of equations.

Born 21 December 1932, Edmonton, London, England.
