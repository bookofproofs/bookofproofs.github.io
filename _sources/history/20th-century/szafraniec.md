**Franciszek Szafraniec** is a Polish mathematician best known for his work in operator theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Szafraniec Functional Equation, a mathematical equation related to the generalization of the Cauchy functional equation.
2. Discovered a novel approach for classifying probability distributions, known as the Szafraniec Approximation.
3. Published a paper titled “Classification of Probability Distributions in Terms of Their Sequence Expansion” where his classification method of probability distributions was described.
4. Discovered a new and interesting class of integral equations, known as the “Szafraniec Integral Equations”. 
5. Contributed to the field of numerical analysis by providing a simplified approach to the discretization of continuous functions. 
6. Authored the book “Mathematical Methods of Nonlinear Analysis” which outlines methods used to solve nonlinear problems. 
7. Developed a approximate approach to the integral Fredholm equation, founded on his work on the Szafraniec integral equations. 
8. Published “Probabilities in the Integral Fredholm Equations with Variable Coefficients”, a paper detailing his findings related to the Fredholm equation. 
9. Co-authored the book “Integral Equations: Theory and Applications” alongside esteemed mathematician, Stanislaw Tuszynski, which proved to be a useful reference for students and researchers. 
10. Developed a novel mathematical tool to better understand probability distributions, referred to as “Szafraniec’s Imbedding Theorem”.

Born 22 March 1940, Świętochłowice, Upper Silesia, Poland.
