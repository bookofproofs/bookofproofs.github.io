**Paul Cohen** was an American mathematian who used a technique called _forcing _ to prove the independence in set theory of the axiom of choice and of the generalised continuum hypothesis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the set theory problem known as the continuum hypothesis in 1963, giving mathematicians insight into how sets of numbers can be divided.
2. In 1966, developed a groundbreaking new way to view the structure of lattices, which greatly advanced the field of mathematics.
3. Received a National Medal of Science in 1967 for his contributions to the field.
4. In the same year, he was named the first holder of MITâ€™s Maurice Wilder Professorship in Mathematics.
5. Developed a new generation of mathematical tools that have been essential in exploring the deepest questions at the foundations of mathematics.
6. In 1969, awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society for his ongoing work.
7. Published numerous highly influential papers throughout his career.
8. Appointed as a Trustee of the American Mathematical Society in 1977 for his lasting contributions.
9. Provided guidance to a new generation of mathematicians who are continuing to use his tools to further study mathematics' foundations.

Born 2 April 1934, Long Branch, New Jersey, USA. Died 23 March 2007, Palo Alto, California, USA.
