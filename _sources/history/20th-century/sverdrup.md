**Erling Sverdrup** was a Norwegian statistician and actuarial mathematician. He played a major role in the Norwegian cryptography unit during World War II.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made important contributions to the abstract theory of algebraic numbers, including the "Sverdrup theorem" which is sometimes referred to as the Sverdrupâ€“Grabiner theorem. 
2. Explored the fields of analysis, linear algebra and combinatorics.
3. Was a leading figure in the development of the modern field of algebraic topology.
4. Developed methods of investigating the representation theory of finite groups.
5. Developed a systematic approach to solving linear equations.
6. Investigated the use of Lie algebras in representations of Lie groups.
7. Applied algebraic methods to the study of algebraic equations and differential equations.
8. Developed a method for extending algebraic curves to higher dimensions.
9. Proved a theorem on the interpretation of power series in terms of valuations.
10. Built a new theory for the study of elliptic curves.

Born 23 February 1917, Bergen, Norway. Died 15 March 1994.
