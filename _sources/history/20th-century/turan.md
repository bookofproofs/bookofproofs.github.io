**Paul Turán** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed Ortogonalitási elv, a technique used to prove theorems in number theory.
2. He solved several open problems in number theory, as well as established new approaches to solving such problems.
3. His greatest achievement was solving Szemerédi's theorem in 1936.
4. He was the first mathematician to find a proof of the Riemann hypothesis. 
5. He developed a unified approach to bounding integrals with trigonometric polynomials.
6. He made significant advances in Ramsey Theory.
7. He also made notable contributions to classical analysis, including Turán's inequalities and the Turán point.
8. He provided key insights in the field of analytic number theory.
9. He was awarded the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1983. 
10. He is credited with popularizing the study of graph theory among Hungarian mathematicians.

Born 18 August 1910, Budapest, Hungary. Died 26 September 1976, Budapest, Hungary.
