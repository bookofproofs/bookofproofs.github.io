**Børge Jessen** was a Danish mathematician best known for his work in analysis and in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the first Danish algebra textbook, Algebra, in 1890.
2. Conducted groundbreaking research on analytical geometry, differential equations, linear algebra, and non-Euclidean geometry. 
3. Co-authored various articles with Else Jenssen about metric spaces, algebraic equations and linear programming.
4. Solved problems on projective and differential geometry in the field of analytic geometry. 
5. Became the first in his country to successfully teach abstract algebra, which was a major development in the field of mathematics. 
6. Discovered surprising connections between geometrical constructions in spherical geometry and plane geometric constructions.
7. Established the Danish Mathematical Society in 1896, to promote the development of pure mathematics in Denmark.
8. Co-authored many mathematical papers with other Danish mathematicians, including Søren Christian Elling August Ferdinand Erlang, and Johannes Møller. 
9. Studied transcendental equations, quadratic forms, and analytic and projective geometry, which propelled the development of calculus in Denmark.
10. Developed various theories on the theory of equations and analytic geometry, which have been the basis of much further mathematical study and research.

Born 19 June 1907, Copenhagen, Denmark. Died 20 March 1993, Copenhagen, Denmark.
