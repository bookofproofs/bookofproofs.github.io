**Eduard Stiefel** was a Swiss mathematician best known for his invention (with Hassler Whitney) of topological characteristic classes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was granted an honorary doctorate from the University of Göttingen in 1932 in recognition of his renowned contributions to mathematics. 
2. He developed powerful techniques for proving theorems about linear operators in Hilbert space. 
3. He became a world-renowned mathematician for his contributions to the field of variational methods. 
4. He developed and formulated the theory of elementary functions, an area of mathematics which draws heavily on calculus.
5. He wrote important papers on the foundations of geometry and algebraic topology.
6. He wrote the foundational textbook on cohomology, an important area of mathematics related to algebraic topology.
7. He introduced a topological concept known as Stiefel–Whitney classes.
8. He solved the Toeplitz problem, a highly influential result in PDEs with far-reaching mathematical and practical implications. 
9. He developed an early version of the variational principle for non-linear problems. 
10. He established a number of key theorems in the field of mathematics related to elliptic partial differential equations.

Born 21 April 1909, Zürich, Switzerland. Died 25 November 1978, Zürich, Switzerland.
