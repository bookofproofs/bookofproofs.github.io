**Graham Higman** was an English mathematician who is known for his outstanding work in all aspects of the theory of groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first complete proof of the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem, now commonly regarded as one of the primary theorems of topology.
2. Made major contributions to the algebraic branch of group theory, including the “Higman normal series” which established the foundations of concept of “finite” and “infinite” groups.
3. Developed the Higman Simplicity Theorem which states that a finitely generated group can only have a finite number of maximal subgroups.
4. Founded the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences in Toronto, which has become one of the world’s top research centres for mathematics.
5. Authored more than 60 research papers, many of which have become cornerstones of modern mathematics.

Born 19 January 1917, Louth, Lincolnshire, England. Died 8 April 2008, Oxford, England.
