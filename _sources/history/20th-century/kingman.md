**John Kingman** is an English mathematician known for his work in statistics, queuing theory and mathematical genetics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed and published his first calculator in the early 1970s.
2. Pioneered the use of computer algebra systems for symbolic manipulation in mathematics.
3. Created the theory of abstract algebraic curves in the mid-1970s.
4. Established an algorithm for solving linear equations, which was published in 1978.
5. Developed an algorithm for finding minimum-cost paths in networks.
6. Demonstrated the connection between algebra and geometric shape.
7. Achieved groundbreaking contributions to the classification of algebraic varieties. 
8. Established a framework for the definition of integration, called ‘Riemann integration’. 
9. Found a new way to define curvature of curves, through the so-called Cartan–Kähler theorem. 
10. Discovered a method to study polynomial equations in two and three variables, which is known as Kingman’s theorem.

Born 28 August 1939, Beckenham, Kent, England.
