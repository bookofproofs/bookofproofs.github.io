**Jacques Herbrand** was a French mathematician who died young but made contributions to mathematical logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However, Herbrand had already made major breakthroughs in the topic while an undergraduate so his success in the area was well established.
* In October of the same year Herbrand joined the army for his military service.
* After his spell in the army, Herbrand was awarded a Rockefeller fellowship to allow him to study at various places in Europe.
* From Berlin, Herbrand went to Hamburg where he spent the month of June working with Artin.
* After leaving Göttingen, Herbrand decided on a holiday in the Alps before his intended return to France.
* See the newspaper reports of the accident in the article Herbrand's accident.
* It is incredible how much Herbrand achieved in the short time he had to undertake mathematical research.
* He made contributions to mathematical logic where Herbrand's theorem on the theory of quantifiers appears in his doctoral thesis.
* Herbrand's theorem establishes a link between quantification theory and sentential logic which is important in that it gives a method to test a formula in quantification theory by successively testing formulas for sentential validity.
* Since testing for sentential validity is a mechanical process, Herbrand's theorem is today of major importance in software developed for theorem proving by computer.
* Herbrand also worked on field theory considering abelian extensions of algebraic number fields.
* In the few months on which he worked on this topic, Herbrand published ten papers.
* Herbrand also generalised some of the results by these workers in class field theory as well as proving some important new theorems of his own.
* For more information about Chevalley writings on Herbrand's thought see the article Chevalley on Herbrand.

Born 12 February 1908, Paris, France. Died 27 July 1931, La Bérarde, Isère, France.
