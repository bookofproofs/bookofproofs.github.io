**Jacques Herbrand** was a French mathematician who died young but made contributions to mathematical logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He provided foundational work in mathematical logic and was a major contributor to Gödel's incompleteness theorems.
2. Proved Herbrand's theorem, an important result in first-order logic.
3. Formulated and applied the concept of Herbrand models in the study of the completeness and decidability of theories in first-order logic.
4. Developed a completeness theorem for first-order predicate logic that was later expanded upon by Alfred Tarski.
5. Showed in his doctoral dissertation how the Cut Elimination Theorem can be used for proving the normalization theorem for first-order logic.
6. Formulated Herbrand Disjunction which states that any formula of first-order logic can be written as a disjunction of a finite number of clauses.
7. Showed how any Boolean function can be expressed as a finite disjunction of clauses.

Born 12 February 1908, Paris, France. Died 27 July 1931, La Bérarde, Isère, France.
