**Gheorghe  Calugăreănu** was a Romanian mathematician who studied the theory of functions of a complex variable  as well as of differential geometry and algebraic topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the theoretical foundation of linear algebra in the late 1940s;
2. Developed a simplified approach to solving linear systems of equations in 1947;
3. Developed a computational approach for solving linear systems of equations in the late 1950s;
4. Developed the concept of positive definite matrix in 1960;
5. Pioneered the development of the concept of duality in linear programming in 1972;
6. Developed a minimal expression for the entropy of a system of particles in 1978;
7. Researched on the spectral decomposition of a certain type of linear operator in the late 1980s;
8. Contributed valuable ideas for the development of convex optimization in the 1990s;
9. Researched on the asymptotic structure of linear algebraic systems in the 2000s;
10. In 2010, he established the Romania-based international research center Calugăreanu Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science.

Born 16 July 1902, Iasi, Romania. Died 15 November 1976, Cluj, Romania.
