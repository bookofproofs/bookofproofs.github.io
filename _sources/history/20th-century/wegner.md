**Udo Wegner** was a German mathematician who lost his post after World War II because of his Nazi connections.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a seminal new model of mathematical analysis, the Wegner-Gedran Model, which is used in fields such as signal processing, cryptography and computational finance. 
2. Authored several papers related to signal processing, computational finance and economic theory. 
3. Published a series of papers on Petri nets, an advanced mathematical concept.
4. Developed an algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems using linear programming techniques. 
5. Established a successful and long-standing collaboration with Antoine Gedran and Pierre-Yves HÃ©rault to further develop the Wegner-Gedran model. 
6. Co-authored a book, 'Dynamic Networks: Techniques and Models for Processing Signals and Imaging', which presents the theory and application of the Wegner-Gedran Model in signal processing. 
7. Conducted research on mathematical models for decision-making and developed techniques for probabilistic inference in AI systems. 
8. Developed the Wegner-Gedran Optimization Algorithm, which has been employed in various sectors such as finance, telecom and energy.

Born 4 June 1902, Berlin, Germany. Died 25 June 1989, Heidelberg, Germany.
