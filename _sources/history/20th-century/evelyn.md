**Cecil John Alvin Evelyn** was an amateur mathematician who produced some works on number theory and geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* John Harcourt Chichester Evelyn was a pupil at the leading independent school Eton College before studying at Christ Church, University of Oxford.
* It was at Eton that Evelyn became fascinated by mathematics, particularly by number theory and geometry.
* At Oxford he had become friendly with Hubert Linfoot who was one year older than Evelyn.
* Both Evelyn and Linfoot were interested in number theory at this time and they worked together on some problems which we now describe.
* Between 1929 and 1933, Evelyn and Linfoot produced six joint papers, all with the title On a problem in the additive theory of numbers.
* After the joint papers with Linfoot, Evelyn did not publish any further mathematics papers for over 30 years.
* We also note Evelyn's address on his papers.
* A book was to be Evelyn's final mathematical publication.
* We mentioned above that Evelyn had many interests in addition to mathematics.
* Evelyn called it a tragedy "to mislead the readers," as he says in his Preface.
* Evelyn later produced a 'Comedy of Faust'.

Born 25 August 1904, London, England. Died 24 May 1976, Deptford, Kent, England.
