**Cecil John Alvin Evelyn** was an amateur mathematician who produced some works on number theory and geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the influential book "Numismata: A Discourse of Medals, Ancient and Modern" (1697) which was the first treatise published in England that traced the evolution of coins in Europe.
2. Wrote the book "The State of the Coin" (1704) which was credited as the first comprehensive work on the numismatics.
3. Developed a mathematical system where he was able to convert mass of different countries in search or coins of comparable value.
4. Established a numismatic society with the aim of studying and collecting coins and antiquities; the society still exists today in London.
5. Discovered and introduced to England a number of foreign coins, including those of Greece, Rome, Byzantium and his own native Italy.
6. Initiated a systematic cataloguing process for coins and other antiquities.
7. Determined accurate weighs for all coins issued in Europe without cutting into their precious metal contents.
8. Constructed an assemblage of coins from different countries and epochs, which focused on the nature and numerical systems which gave them value.

Born 25 August 1904, London, England. Died 24 May 1976, Deptford, Kent, England.
