**Cecil John Alvin Evelyn** was an amateur mathematician who produced some works on number theory and geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* John Harcourt Chichester Evelyn was a pupil at the leading independent school Eton College before studying at Christ Church, University of Oxford.
* He had married Frances Edith Ives on 27 January 1902 and they had three children, Susanna Frances Evelyn, Cecil John Alvin Evelyn (the subject of this biography), and Peter George Evelyn (1909-1945).
* Peter George Evelyn, like his father, became a military man rising to major in the Grenadier Guards.
* Let us note that the aristocratic Evelyn family were descended from the famous diarist John Evelyn (1620-1706).
* John Evelyn, the subject of this biography, was known to his friends as Jack.
* It was at Eton that Evelyn became fascinated by mathematics, particularly by number theory and geometry.
* At Oxford he had become friendly with Hubert Linfoot who was one year older than Evelyn.
* Both Evelyn and Linfoot were interested in number theory at this time and they worked together on some problems which we now describe.
* Between 1929 and 1933, Evelyn and Linfoot produced six joint papers, all with the title On a problem in the additive theory of numbers.
* Evelyn had no need to look for employment since his family fortune provided him with an income which allowed him to live the life of a gentleman of leisure devoting himself to those pursuits that interested him.
* After the joint papers with Linfoot, Evelyn did not publish any further mathematics papers for over 30 years.
* We also note Evelyn's address on his papers.
* A book was to be Evelyn's final mathematical publication.
* We mentioned above that Evelyn had many interests in addition to mathematics.
* Evelyn called it a tragedy "to mislead the readers," as he says in his Preface.
* Evelyn later produced a 'Comedy of Faust'.

Born 25 August 1904, London, England. Died 24 May 1976, Deptford, Kent, England.
