**Graham Allan** was an English mathematician who specialised in functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Graham attended Minchenden Grammar School in Southgate and his outstanding mathematical achievements led to him being awarded an exhibition in mathematics to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, at the age of eighteen.
* For the two years 1955-57 Allan served with the Royal Air Force, spending most of the time stationed in East Anglia at a radar station.
* After completing his doctorate, Allan was elected a Fellow and Director of Studies of Churchill College, Cambridge.
* Allan was appointed to lead and build up a group in modern mathematical analysis; he was very successful in leading the development of a new undergraduate syllabus, and in building up a strong research team.
* In order to gain further understanding of why Allan wished to return to Cambridge, we should look at this point at his leading mathematical contributions.
* Between 1976 and 1983 only one of Allan's papers was published, so it become easy to understand how he wished to return to an environment where he could concentrate more on the research he loved.
* Allan had over 20 research students, including include John Rennison (Kent), Ian Craw (Aberdeen), Garth Dales (Leeds), Peter McClure (Manitoba), Peter Dixon (Sheffield), Ghotsi Haghany (Isfahan), Thomas Ransford (Laval), Michael White (Newcastle), Frederic Gourdeau (Laval) and Thomas Vils Pedersen (Copenhagen).
* Always Graham was kind, quiet, thoughtful, and considerate; he inspired great affection in his research students and others; he was very modest about his own achievements.

Born 13 August 1936, Southgate, Middlesex, England. Died 9 August 2007, Cambridge, England.
