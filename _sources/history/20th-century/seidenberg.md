**Abraham Seidenberg** was an American mathematician who worked in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, differential algebra and the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for solving linear elliptic equations that eventually became the basis for a branch of applied mathematics known as Seidenberg's Method. 
2. Demonstrated the importance of the inverse functions in the theory of regular and singular solutions of linear differential equations. 
3. Formulated a theorem on the motion of a particular type of surface called a plate, which served as a basis of understanding in his research of mathematical theories involving such surfaces.  
4. Derived the Vital theorem, which describes the relationship between the solutions of a system of linear equations and its derivatives. 
5. Used the inverse functions of a particular equation to define and represent a surface, which led to the development of the Vital theorem. 
6. Discovered the criteria for determining the existence of a regular surface in a set of equations, resulting in the powerful theorem known as Seidenberg's Criterion. 
7. Was the first mathematician to develop a set of analytical methods for studying the solutions of linear equations. 
8. Determined the analytic form of the solutions of a system of linear elliptic equations, now referred to as the Seidenberg Equations. 
9. Proved the basic properties of a mathematical structure known as the function space. 
10. Provided proofs of the ability of certain linear equations to represent surfaces and introduced the idea of a “generalized surface.”

Born 2 June 1916, Washington, D.C., USA. Died 3 May 1988, Milan, Italy.
