**Joan Birman** is an American mathematician who worked in in braid theory and knot theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the first use of finite groups and finite fields for studying topology.
2. Developed the theory of non-Zariski decompositions of algebraic surfaces.
3. Proved a theorem in knot theory known as the “Birman-Hilden Theorem”.
4. Established the “Birman Exact Sequence”, a tool that is central to the study of 3-manifolds.
5. Founded the Center for Research in Topology at Columbia University, the first such center in the US. 
6. Showed that some classical Knot Theory results such as Dehn’s Lemma and the Four Color Theorem were provably true using modern algebraic topology. 
7. Was one of the first mathematicians to study the combinatorics of braids. 
8. Authored over 50 research papers during her career in Mathematics.

Born 30 May 1927, New York City, New York, USA.
