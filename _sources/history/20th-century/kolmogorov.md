**Andrey Kolmogorov** was one of the developers of probability theory. He later used this work to study the motion of the planets and the turbulent flow of air from a jet engine.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Andrey Kolmogorov is considered to be the founder of modern probability theory and the notion of Kolmogorov complexity.
2. He was the first to introduce the axiomatic approach to probability theory with his 1933 book Foundations of the Theory of Probability.
3. He developed the concept of field of algebraic structures and used it to prove the completeness of first order logic.
4. He showed that partial differential equations can be solved using probability methods and worked to develop a unified theory of generalizing probability theory.
5. He was a pioneer in the study of nonlinear partial differential equations and their broad applications to turbulence and water waves.
6. He was the first to develop a rigorous theory of turbulence. 
7. He developed the theory of integral equations and made advances in measure theory.
8. He also developed theorems related to point processes, random matrices, and extreme value theory.
9. Andrey Kolmogorov advanced the development of dynamical systems and ergodic theory.
10. He formulated the concepts of entropy, information, and randomness in mathematical terms, which are now the core of information theory.

Born 25 April 1903, Tambov, Tambov province, Russia. Died 20 October 1987, Moscow, Russia.
