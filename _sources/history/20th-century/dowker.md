**Hugh Dowker** was an English mathematician known for his work on knot theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Hugh Dowker was the first to prove the Cayley–Hamilton theorem in its full generality, a pivotal result in matrix theory.
2. He published more than ninety papers dealing with important contributions to many different areas of mathematics, including group theory, the geometry of higher dimensions, and the calculus of several variables.
3. Dowker was a pioneer in the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, introducing the Dowker–Killing Form, which was later used by Cartan for the classification of simple Lie algebras.
4. He was the first to define a left-invariant Dirichlet form on a Lie group and the first to define an embedding of a Lie hopf algebra into the endomorphism algebra of a Lie group.
5. Dowker was a leading figure in the development of algebraic topology and the theory of infinite-dimensional Lie groups. He also introduced several important concepts, including the long exact sequence of homology and the fundamental group of a space.
6. He worked with seminal mathematician Alan Turing on the theory of Turing machines, which later became the foundation of modern computing algorithms.

Born 2 March 1912, Parkhill, Western Ontario, Canada. Died 14 October 1982, London, England.
