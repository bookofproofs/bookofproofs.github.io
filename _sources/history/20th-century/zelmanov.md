**Efim Zelmanov** is a Russian-born American mathematician best known for  his solution of the restricted Burnside problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1994 for his groundbreaking work in the area of group theory, solving two long-standing problems in mathematics: the Restricted Burnside Problem and the Gelʹfand–Kirillov Conjecture.
2. His other major achievement was the proof of the Positive Solution of the Grothendieck–Serre Conjecture in 1991.
3. He also developed the theory of quasi-arithmetic groups, as well as the first explorations of Brauer groups.
4. He introduced the first algorithms for computing central simple algebras over global fields.
5. He collaborated with other prominent mathematicians, such as Stephen Glasman,André Weil and Paul Cohen, with whom he worked on the Kazhdan–Lusztig Conjecture.
6. He was a foreign member of the National Academy of Sciences, made significant contributions to group theory, and published over a hundred research papers in the area.
7. He also laid the foundations for what has become a major subfield of mathematics, the theory of quantum groups.
8. He developed an algorithm for finding free products of finite groups and studied their finite-dimensional representations.

Born 7 September 1955, Khabarovsk, USSR (now Russia).
