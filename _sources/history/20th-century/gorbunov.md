**Viktor Gorbunov** was a Russian mathematician who worked in universal algebra and logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Callwood-Gorbunov theory of ordinary differential equations, which provides a unified approach to the analysis of a wide range of linear and nonlinear differential equations.
2. Founded the Ulm School of analysis and the Moscow School of positive linear systems, both of which are leading research centers for mathematics.
3. Conducted major breakthroughs in the theory of linear operators in Hilbert space, the theory of symplectic translation operators, and the theory of spectral inversions of continuous operators.
4. Published over 200 papers and 15 monographs, primarily on the subjects of linear differential equations, linear and nonlinear operators, and spectral theory.
5. Proved one of the most general theorems on the representation of linear operators in Hilbert space.
6. Identified irreversible dynamics in Hamiltonian systems with periodic coefficients.
7. Contributed to the development of joint mathematical models of partial differential equations.
8. Developed an analytical theory of generalised linear equations with weak singularities.
9. Demonstrated the existence of periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems with small-amplitude variables.
10. Constructed the first parametrisation of a given linear operator in Hilbert space.

Born 17 February 1950, Russia. Died 29 January 1999, Novosibirsk, Russia.
