**Imre Lakatos** was a Hungarian philosopher of mathematics and science, who moved to Britain after the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1953.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Proofs and Refutations, a book that reinterpreted and extended the work of Immanuel Kant and Karl Popper, revolutionizing the field of logic and critical thinking.
2. Formulated the so-called "Lakatosian Program," which helped to create a bridge between the two scientific research approaches of classic Popperian falsification and Thomas Kuhn's paradigm analysis.
3. Invented the concept of progressive and regressive scientific research programs as a way to explain and reframe the progress of scientific discovery.
4. Coined the term 'problem shift', which identified the route science follows during its development.
5. Pioneered the method of mathematical proof analysis in order to better understand how mathematical statements are constructed.
6. Contributed significantly to the development of formal axiomatic systems from the ZF and ZFA axiomatic systems.
7. Wrote several books including Proofs and Refutations and Mathematics, Science and Epistemology.
8. Proposed a new version of the Riemann hypothesis in 1972, which is still being investigated today.

Born 9 November 1922, Debrecen, Hungary. Died 2 February 1974, London, England.
