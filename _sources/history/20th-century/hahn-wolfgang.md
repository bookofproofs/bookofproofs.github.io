**Wolfgang Hahn** was a German mathematician who worked on special functions, in particular orthogonal polynomials.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wolfgang Hahn made several major contributions to the development of mathematics, including the introduction of a new mathematical concept known as the "Hahn decomposition." 
2. He also conducted significant research on fractional calculus, complex analysis, and differential equations. 
3. He was one of the founders of the International Mathematical Union, and served as its first president.
4. He was a pioneer in the development of the calculus of variations, and is credited with introducing the concept of integral differential equations.
5. He authored the book “The Variational Principles of Mechanics” and “Vector Functions in Analytical Geometry”, which helped shape the current understanding of vector calculus. 
6. He coined the term "equipollence" and introduced the concept of proportional functionals.
7. He is best known for his work on Hahn polynomials and his studies of numerical series, which are commonly known as the Hahn series.
8. He is also credited with developing Hahn's theorem, a mathematical theorem concerning numerical series.

Born 30 April 1911, Potsdam, Germany. Died 10 January 1998, Kassel, Germany.
