**Alexander Andreevich Samarskii ** was a Ukranian-born mathematician who worked in mathematical physics, applied mathematics, numerical analysis and mathematical modelling.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Finite Difference Method in the 1950s, which is still used today for numerically solving partial differential equations.
2. Helped develop the Monte Carlo method for solving mathematical problems, which is commonly used to simulate physical phenomena in fields such as physics, engineering, and finance.
3. Introduced the concept of net stability analysis, introducing the Samarskii Index which is still used in the stability analysis of numerical schemes.
4. Developed the concept of abstract boundary conditions, which are now standard in boundary value problems.
5. Invented mathematical functions to describe shock waves and nonlinear currents in electrical networks, which are still used to this day.
6. Coined the term "computational mathematics"
7. Pioneered the use of computers in mathematics, starting in the 1950s.
8. Authored around 500 scientific articles and published 7 monographs in the field of mathematics.

Born 19 February 1919, Amvrosiivka, Donetsk, Ukraine. Died 11 February 2008, Moscow, Russia.
