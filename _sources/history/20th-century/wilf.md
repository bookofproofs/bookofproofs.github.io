**Herbert Wilf** was an American mathematician who worked in combinatorics and graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Alexander Wilf (1904-1980) had a profitable business in Philadelphia selling rugs, carpets and appliances.
* Herbert had a younger sister Gladys, born in 1939.
* Alexander Wilf, known as Alex, had right-wing Zionist views and was a passionate supporter of the idea of creating a Jewish state in the middle east.
* Alexander Wilf was involved in smuggling refugees and arms into Palestine, using ships in which he had invested most of his wealth.
* Alex Wilf also put money into the Altalena which sailed for Tel Aviv in June 1948 with 940 fighters and a large quantity of arms and ammunition.
* Herb Wilf completed his schooling in 1948 and, following his father's advice, applied to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
* Before he had begun his studies, however, with the state of Israel now set up, Alexander Wilf decided to take his family to Israel and start up a newspaper.
* Wilf was awarded a B.S. in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1952.
* After graduating from MIT, Wilf went to Columbia University where he studied for a Ph.D. supervised by Herbert Ellis Robbins, who was the Professor of Mathematical Statistics.
* While he was undertaking graduate studies at Columbia University, Wilf married Ruth Tumen; they had a daughter Susan (who became a Chinese scholar), and two sons David (who became a lawyer) and Peter (who became a palaeontologist).
* With a wife and young family to support, Wilf needed to earn money and took on a number of jobs such as designing jet engines with the Fairchild Engine Division in 1954 and as head of the Computing Section of Nuclear Development Associates 1955-59.
* Wilf was awarded his Ph.D. in 1958 and, in the following year, he was appointed as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of Illinois.
* After three years in this position, Wilf was appointed as Associate Professor of Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania.
* In January 1998 Wilf was named Thomas A Scott Professor.
* Even before the award of his doctorate, Wilf had written a remarkable range of papers: (with M Kalos) Monte Carlo solves reactor problems (1957); An open formula for the numerical integration of first order differential equations (1957); An open formula for the numerical integration of first order differential equations.
* Wilf's most memorable contribution in this area is now known as 'WZ theory'.
* For this work Wilf and Zeilberger were jointly awarded the Leroy P Steele Prize by the American Mathematical Society at the January 1998 meeting of the Society in Baltimore.
* The remarkably simple idea of the work of Wilf and Zeilberger has already changed a part of mathematics for the experts, for the high-level users outside the area, and the area itself.
* We must also mention Wilf's contributions to mathematics teaching.
* Let us look briefly at the books that Wilf has published, in addition to Mathematics for the Physical Sciences (1962) which we mentioned above.
* This book describes the work by Wilf and Zeilberger which led to them receiving the Leroy P Steele Prize by the American Mathematical Society and was jointly authored by Wilf, Marko Petkovsek and Doron Zeilberger.
* Finally we mention that Wilf founded two journals, The Journal of Algorithms in 1980 with co-founder Donald Knuth, and The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics in 1994 with co-founder Neil Calkin.
* Wilf died of a progressive neuromuscular disease.
* The Herbert S Wilf Award, recognising outstanding student achievement, is being set up at the Department of Mathematics, The University of Pennsylvania.

Born 13 June 1931, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 7 January 2012, Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, USA.
