**Herbert Wilf** was an American mathematician who worked in combinatorics and graph theory. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered a new connection between the Fibonacci numbers and Bernoulli numbers.
2. Developed the super-exponential algorithm for computing binomial coefficients.
3. Found analytic formulas for certain partitions of partitions.
4. Proved the resolution of the alternating groups A_n and the symmetric groups S_n into simple groups.
5. Contributed to the development of the theory of generating functions.
6. Proved Cohn's conjecture concerning the structure of integral Sturm–Liouville systems.
7. Found a new necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to be hamiltonian.
8. Explaned the structure of apolarity groups.
9. Discovered new connections between the stochastic matrices and the Fibonacci numbers.
10. Developed new methods of computing the coefficients of power series expansions.

Born 13 June 1931, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 7 January 2012, Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, USA.
