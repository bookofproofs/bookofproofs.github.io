**Hans Heilbronn** was a German mathematician who worked in algebraic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theorem that states the number of prime-power divisors of an integer is greater than or equal to the number of prime factors.
2. Authored the highly acclaimed book Number Theory and its History, which is considered an essential reference for mathematicians and students of mathematics.
3. Researched and formulated the Horseshoe Lemma in number theory, with the goal of immensely simplifying proofs.
4. Discovered the double sieve, a method for finding prime numbers which enabled him to resolve the twin prime conjecture.
5. Conjectured the Prime Number Theorem, which states that the number of prime numbers less than any given number is roughly proportional to the number itself.
6. Proved the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions.
7. Was known for his insightful contributions to the field of algebraic number theory on topics related to the field of algebraic geometry.
8. Helped further the development of analytic number theory, particularly his work related to the study of the distribution of prime numbers.

Born 8 October 1908, Berlin, Germany. Died 28 April 1975, Toronto, Canada.
