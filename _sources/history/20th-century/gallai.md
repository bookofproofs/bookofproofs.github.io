**Tibor Gallai** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in combinatorics and graph theory. He was a friend and collaborator of Paul Erdős.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Gallai-Edmonds structure theorem, a fundamental tool in the study of graph theory and combinatorial optimization.
2. Established and solved the Gallai-Hasse-Roy-Vitaver theorem, which describes the relationship between the number of edges and vertices of a graph.
3. Discovered the Gallai-Ramsey numbers, which are upper bounds on the number of edges of a graph that contain a prescribed number of cliques.
4. Solved the Erdős-Gallai problem, a difficult problem in graph theory which gives a formula for estimating the maximum degree of a graph.
5. Made significant contributions to the theory of fixed points and convexity.
6. Formulated the opinion dynamics model, which describes the opinion change of individuals in a social network.
7. Won a Mathematical Association of America Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics.

Born 15 July 1912, Budapest, Hungary. Died 2 January 1992, Budapest, Hungary.
