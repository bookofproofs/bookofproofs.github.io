**Hajer Bahouri** was born in Tunisia and is an expert in partial differential equations. She became Director of Research at the National Centre for Scientific Research and the Laboratory of Analysis and Applied Mathematics at the University Paris-Est-Créteil-Val-de-Marne.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After the award of her first degree, Bahouri went to France to continue her mathematical studies in Paris.
* Advised by Serge Alinhac, Bahouri was awarded her Doctorat 3ème cycle in 1982 for her thesis Unicité et non unicité du problème de Cauchy pour des opérateurs à symbole principal réel Ⓣ(Uniqueness and nonuniqueness of the Cauchy problem for operators with a real main symbol.).
* After completing her Doctorat 3ème cycle, Bahouri went to the École Polytechnique, in Palaiseau (a southern suburb of Paris), being appointed as a researcher in 1982.
* In August 2002 the International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Beijing, China, and Bahouri was an invited participant.
* Bahouri continued to hold the professorship in the Faculty of Science at Tunis but, in 2002-2004, she also taught courses at the École Polytechnique, Palaiseau.
* In 2016 Bahouri was awarded the Paul Doistau-Émile Blutet Prize of the French Academy of Sciences.
* Finally let us look at the book Fourier analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations which Bahouri wrote in collaboration with Jean-Yves Chemin and Raphaël Danchin.

Born 30 March 1958, Tunis, Tunisia.
