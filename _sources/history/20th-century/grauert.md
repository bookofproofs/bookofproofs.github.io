**Hans Grauert** was a German mathematician who made important contributions to the theory of functions of several complex variables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the Theorem of Grauert-Remmert, which provides a powerful theoretical foundation for non-Archimedean analytic geometry. 
2. Developed the Foliation Theory which uses global partial differential equations to study complex geometry.
3. Established the Grauert Tube, which is a way to analyze the structure of vector and analytic bundles in complex analysis.
4. Published foundational works in the area of Sheaf Theory and Cohomology Theory. 
5. Introduced his theory of Direct Images in the study of holomorphic functions of several complex variables.
6. Solved the complex analytical problem of direct image and proved the Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing theorem. 
7. Developed the Codimension Theory, which is used to describe the geometry of singular varieties.
8. Established the GAGA Theorem, which provides a corresponding duality between algebraic and analytic varieties.

Born 8 February 1930, Haren-Ems, Niedersachsen, Germany. Died 4 September 2011, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany.
