**Hermann Bondi** was an Austrian-born scientist who made contributions to a wide variety of areas in mathematics and physics and was associated with the "Steady-state" theory of the universe.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the steady-state cosmological theory, which challenged the prevailing belief that the universe was in constant change. 
2. Proposed an axiomatic approach to the theory of relativity, which subsequently became known as the Bondi–Metzner–Sachs (BMS) group.
3. Constructed a metric of spacetimes that admit a Killing vector field, which is now known as the Bondi–Sachs metric. 
4. Wrote a foundational book entitled Relativity and Common Sense, which provided a comprehensive and accessible introduction to special and general relativity. 
5. Identified a conserved energy associated with the radiative field in asymptotically flat spacetimes, which is now known as the Bondi energy. 
6. Published a seminal paper on the balance equations, which highlighted the role of mass conservation in gravitating systems. 
7. Developed a new approach to the geometry and topology of the universe, which formed the basis for modern cosmology. 
8. Contributed to a groundbreaking paper that described the behavior of null geodesics in curved spacetime.

Born 1 November 1919, Vienna, Austria. Died 10 September 2005, Cambridge, England.
