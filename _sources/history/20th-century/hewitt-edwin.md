**Edwin Hewitt** made fundamental contributions to functional analysis, measure theory, and topology as well as Diophantine approximation, the structure of semigroups and abstract harmonic analysis. He is well-known for his discovery, in collaboration with Leonard Jimmie Savage, of the Hewitt-Savage zero-one law.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed theory of abstract vector spaces, including the development of the foundations of functional analysis and topology.
2. Proved the Hewitt-Marczewski-Pondiczery theorem.
3. Discovered Hewitt's extension theorem which extended von Neumann's concept of measure theory to a more general setting.
4. Established the equivalence of classic integration and measure theory.
5. Pioneered the development of operator algebras.
6. Founded the field of algebraic K-theory.
7. Founded the research area of harmonic analysis, co-inventing Radon-Nikod√Ωm's theorem.
8. Constructed the modern theory of Banach algebras.
9. Worked on the proof of the Banach-Alaoglu theorem.
10. Introduced modern topological vector spaces.

Born 20 January 1920, Everett, Snohomish, Washington, USA. Died 21 June 1999, Seattle, Washington, USA.
