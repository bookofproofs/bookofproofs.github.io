**Edwin Hewitt** made fundamental contributions to functional analysis, measure theory, and topology as well as Diophantine approximation, the structure of semigroups and abstract harmonic analysis. He is well-known for his discovery, in collaboration with Leonard Jimmie Savage, of the Hewitt-Savage zero-one law.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Irenaeus Hewitt, born in Lexington, Dawson, Nebraska to Thomas Jefferson Hewitt (1837-1886) and Fanny Augusta Rockwood (1842-1915) on 5 December 1879, was a Navy Supply Officer at Puget Sound Naval Yard who married Margaret Guthrie in Omaha, Douglas, Nebraska on 16 February 1915.
* Margaret, born in Cheyenne, Laramie, Wyoming to William Eugene Guthrie and Margaret S Hewitt on 19 April 1889, was a teacher of English to adults and a co-author of An outline of vocabulary building; a course for adult Americans.
* Irenaeus and Margaret Hewitt had three children, William Guthrie Hewitt (1916-1983), Helen Margaret Hewitt (1918-1953) and Edwin Hewitt (1920-1999), the subject of this biography.
* At the time of the 1930 US Census, the Hewitt family are living in Everett, Snohomish, Washington and Edwin's father is still working at the Puget Sound Naval Yard.
* Edwin, 10 years old at this time, is attending school.
* Edwin Hewitt, of 5016 Ellis Avenue, Chicago, Ill., Leelanau School, Glen Arbor, Michigan.
* We get some information about Hewitt from the 1940 US Census.
* Hewitt's father was an Assistant Personal director of the Candy Manufacturing Company and his mother was a teacher at a private school.
* Hewitt was awarded a first degree in 1940 and continued to undertake postgraduate studies for his Master's Degree which was awarded in 1941.
* Hewitt undertook research with Marshall Stone as his thesis advisor.
* Mr Hewitt was graduated from Harvard in 1940, where he received his master's degree in 1941 and his Ph.D. in 1942.
* The College records her address as 79 Chilton Street, Belmont, Massachusetts and her "not-so-secret passions are mountains, mathematicians, pretzels, and poetry." The date of their marriage is given as 4 March 1944 but that does not quite work with the fact that Hewitt returned to the United States on 10 August 1944.
* Edwin and Carol Hewitt had two daughters: Elizabeth Hewitt and Margaret Hewitt.
* Later, in April 1962, they were divorced and Hewitt married 30 year old Pamela Jones Meyer on 28 May 1964.
* Hewitt taught at Bryn Mawr College for the year 1946-47, then moved to Chicago where he had two half-time jobs, one in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Chicago, the other on a military research project Chicago Ordnance Research.
* Hewitt spent the whole of his career at the University of Washington but spent time away on teaching visits, research visits and sabbatical leave: Uppsala, Sweden (1951-52), Australian National University, Canberra (1963; 1970; 1976, Mathematics Institute of Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia (1969-70; 1973; 1976), Erlangen and Passau, Germany (1975-76; 1986), the University of Texas (1972-73), the University of Fairbanks, Alaska (1982), Hokkaido University, Japan (1982), University of Passau, Federal Republic Germany (1986), University of Singapore (1988).
* His definitive departure at the age of 35 from topological research in favour of harmonic analysis and locally compact abelian groups has been much noted and discussed by Hewitt-watchers and interested amateur historians.
* Hewitt loved mathematics, music and, above all, travelling.
* Edwin Hewitt is in this last group.

Born 20 January 1920, Everett, Snohomish, Washington, USA. Died 21 June 1999, Seattle, Washington, USA.
