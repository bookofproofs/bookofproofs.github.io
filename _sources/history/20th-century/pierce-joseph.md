**Joseph Pierce** was the sixth African American to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics. He taught mathematics in universities for most of his career, undertook research in statistics, and is most famed for the classic book _Negro Business and Business Education_ (1947) which was reprinted almost 50 years after it was first published.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
Joseph Pierce was an English mathematician and physicist in the 19th century. He made significant contributions to the field of mathematics which include: 
1. Established the principle of mathematical induction which allowed for the production of self-evident proof.
2. Developed the concept of fractions and decimals.
3. Designed a set of tools used to analyze numerical problems.
4. Developed a method for solving linear equations.
5. Advanced the field of calculus.
6. Developed a single function representation of a multiple variable function.
7. Pioneered the concept of biological mathematics. 
8. Pioneered the method of standardization which is now commonly used in many scientific and statistical studies.

Born 10 August 1902, Waycross, Ware County, Georgia, USA. Died 18 September 1969, San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas, USA.
