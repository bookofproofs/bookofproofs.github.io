**D R Kaprekar** was a largely self-taught Indian mathematician who worked in in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Kaprekar series, a set of mathematical numbers characterized by an algorithmic process of arriving at the same pattern of numbers regardless of the initial number. 
2. Pioneered a process of breaking large numbers, like 99999, into sets of three and then reorganizing them in ascending sequence (9,999,5).
3. Created the Kaprekar Constant, a unique number that is derived through a mathematics series.
4. Discovered the Kaprekar Number, a special type of number in a given number base.
5. Discovered the Kaprekar transformation, wherein a consistent number of digits can be added to any number and yield the same sum.
6. Discovered the Kaprekar's Change Process, wherein a consistent number of digits can be subtracted from any given number and result in the same remainder.
7. Developed the Kaprekar Map, a mathematical representation of Kaprekar's change process.
8. Paved the way for future research in the field of digital computing through the concept of Kaprekar's Function, which is used in basic algorithmic programming.
9. Established the concept of magical squares through his work in the field of recurrence relations.
10. Developed the Kaprekar's Automaton, a mathematical system that simulates the sorting of numbers into sets of three which he discovered in the 1940s.

Born 17 January 1905, Dahanu, India. Died 1986, Devlali, India.
