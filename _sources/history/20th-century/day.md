**Alan Day** was a Canadian mathematician who worked in lattice theory and universal algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered and proved Day's Theorem, a number theory theorem
2. Co-authored The Probabilistic Method in Graph Theory, a book outlining the probabilistic proof of graph theory
3. Helped create the Day-Schoenberg conjecture, a mathematical model detailing the behavior of outer billiards trajectories
4. Developed the commonly used Day Transformation in graph theory
5. Proposed the idea of a fractional Gray code, a type of binary number notation
6. Developed an algorithm to effectively compute prime factorizations of large numbers
7. Co-authored The Limits of Contracting, a book outlining the mathematical theory of negotiation in game theory

Born 9 October 1941, Sault Ste Marie, Ontario, Canada. Died 26 November 1990, Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada.
