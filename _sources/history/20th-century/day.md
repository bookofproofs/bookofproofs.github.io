**Alan Day** was a Canadian mathematician who worked in lattice theory and universal algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was in North Bay that Alan attended primary and then secondary school.
* From 1959 to 1963 Day studied mathematics at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.
* Indeed Day quickly demonstrated that he had outstanding research potential.
* Some of Day's early papers are: Injectives in non-distributive equational classes of lattices are trivial (1970), A note on the congruence extension property (1971), Injectivity in equational classes of algebras (1972), Splitting algebras and a weak notion of projectivity (1973), Filter monads, continuous lattices and closure systems (1975), and Splitting lattices generate all lattices (1975).
* Day made many major contributions to lattice theory.
* This paper introduced Day famous doubling construction.
* Of course, everyone does, and it was for that reason that Alan was particularly proud of his doubling construction.
* It is a subject to which Alan kept returning to the end.
* Day wrote papers on splitting modular lattices, frames and coordinate rings, critical configurations for the Arguesian identity, modular congruence varieties, and application of modular lattices to database theory.
* Alan Day was certainly a leader in the new wave of computer enthusiasts.

Born 9 October 1941, Sault Ste Marie, Ontario, Canada. Died 26 November 1990, Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada.
