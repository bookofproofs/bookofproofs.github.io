**Alonzo Church** made important contributions to mathematical logic and theoretical computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. First to develop Lambda calculus, a mathematical calculus of functions and arguments, demonstrating that mathematics could be used to express computation.
2. Developed the Church–Turing thesis, a hypothesis which states that any calculation that could be done could be done with an algorithm running on a Turing machine.
3. Developed the Frege–Church ontology, a formal treatment of the notion of ‘set’.
4. Worked on the decision problem, creating a mathematical structure to encode computations.
5. Demonstrated the existence of undecidable problems, showing that mathematics is not complete—specifically that there cannot be an algorithm to decide all mathematical truths. 
6. Contributed to the foundations of computational complexity theory, introducing the concept of ‘problems with no effective solution’.
7. Proved the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem, presenting a rigorous proof of the impossibility of a universal algorithm.
8. Developed small scale programming languages, including the algebraic language TL/LISP.

Born 14 June 1903, Washington, D.C., USA. Died 11 August 1995, Hudson, Ohio, USA.
