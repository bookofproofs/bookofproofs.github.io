**Tom Cowling** graduated from Oxford and worked at Imperial College London. He lectured at Swansea, Dundee and Manchester and became a professor at Bangor and Leeds. He worked on theoretical astronomy and stellar physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* George and Edith Cowling had four sons, Thomas being the second.
* Milne agreed on condition that Cowling work on an astronomical topic.
* Milne did not have a problem in mind for Cowling to work on, so he asked Chapman at Imperial College, London.
* Cowling found difficulties at first because of Chapman's suggested approach, but soon adopted a different approach solving the problem.
* The result of this was that after Cowling completed his doctorate in 1930, Chapman offered him a position as a demonstrator in the Mathematics Department at Imperial College where he worked for three years before being appointed as an assistant lecturer in mathematics at Swansea University.
* In 1945 Cowling was appointed Professor of Mathematics at University College Bangor, moving to a similar post in Leeds in 1948.
* Cowling's main contributions were in the areas of stellar structure, cosmical magnetism, kinetic theory and plasma-physics.
* Cowling's second paper On a point-source model of a star (1930) began his publications on stellar structure.
* Cowling received many honours throughout his career.

Born 17 June 1906, Hackney, London, England. Died 16 June 1990, Leeds, England.
