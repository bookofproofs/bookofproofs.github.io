**Laurence Chisholm Young** was a German-born mathematician who worked in measure theory, the calculus of variations, optimal control theory and potential theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Laurence attended the Gymnasium in Lausanne and completed his studies two years early.
* It was a difficult period for Laurence, ready intellectually to be studying at university, but held back by the illness.
* Young was Isaac Newton Student at Cambridge in 1930, was awarded an MA in 1931 after studying with Fowler and Littlewood, and he was elected to a fellowship in 1931.
* Young first met Joan Elizabeth Mary Dunnett in 1927 when he was asked by Geoffrey Miller to come with him when he went to have tea with his cousin Elizabeth.
* Young remained at Wisconsin-Madison for the rest of his career, retiring in 1975 at the age of 70.
* In 1969 Young published Lectures on the calculus of variations and optimal control theory.
* This book is based on the theory of generalised curves, a topic which Young himself founded.
* Another important book written by Young was Mathematicians and their times: History of mathematics and mathematics of history published in 1981.
* This book is an outstanding one based on Young's reading of the original source material.
* The book also tells us a great deal about the way Young himself approached mathematics.
* Of course to read original sources requires a great knowledge of languages and this Young certainly possessed.
* After he retired, Young taught students at the University of Campinas in Brazil for many years.

Born 14 July 1905, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany. Died 24 December 2000, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.
