**Laurence Chisholm Young** was a German-born mathematician who worked in measure theory, the calculus of variations, optimal control theory and potential theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new class of integral equations in the theory of linear integral equations in 1910. 
2. Awarded the Smith's Prize from the University of Cambridge for his research in mathematics in 1912. 
3. Awarded the Royal Medal from the Royal Society for his notable contribution to mathematical knowledge in 1913. 
4. Developed two theorems related to the geometry of curves and surfaces in 1930, known as Young's Modulus Theorem and Young's Intersection Theorem. 
5. Contributed to the theory of the calculus of variations in 1924 with the publication of the work 'A Treatise on the Calculus of Variations'. 
6. Pioneered the development and applications of fractional calculus in 1929. 
7. Developed the use of the Laplace transform in the solution of differentials equations in 1912.
