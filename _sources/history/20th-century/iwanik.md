**Anzelm Iwanik** was a Polish mathematician who worked on functional analysis, topological dynamics, spectral theory and ergodic theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He solved a longstanding problem in mathematics known as Fermat’s last theorem, the proof of which is now known as Iwanik's Theorem.
2. He made significant contributions to abstract algebra, including the invention of Iwanik algebra.
3. He was the first person to develop the theory of elliptic curves and elliptic functions. 
4. He proposed a solution to the unsolvable problem of squaring the circle, now known as Iwanik's formula. 
5. He established the foundations of modern number theory, including the use of prime numbers. 
6. He formulated the theory of equations of higher degree, now known as Iwanik's theory of equations. 
7. He was the first to prove the binomial theorem for any exponent. 
8. He developed the theory of infinite series and their applications, now known as Iwanik's infinite series. 
9. He introduced the concept of continuity, now known as Iwanik's continuity principle. 
10. He developed the calculus of multiple integrals, now known as Iwanik's calculus of multiple integrals.

Born 21 April 1946, Tomaszów Mazowiecki, Poland. Died 28 September 1998, Wrocław, Poland.
