**Herbert Robbins** was an American mathematician and statistician who worked in topology, measure theory, statistics,and other fields.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed to the development of mathematical statistics and pioneered the use of linear programming for solving optimization problems.
2. Pioneered the field of computational complexity and developed the concept of NP-completeness. 
3. Wrote extensively on metric space topology, probability theory, and statistical inference.
4. Established the Institute for Mathematical Statistics, which works to strengthen the links between statistics and mathematics.
5. Authored nine books and over 120 research articles and several joint monographs, achieving wide-ranging recognition for his work and advancing the field of mathematical statistics.
6. Was the first to apply the theory of mathematical programming to economics.
7. Devised the celebrated “Robbins-Monro Algorithm” which is used to find even complex numerical solutions to stochastic approximation problems.
8. Developed the “Robbins Stopping Rule” which helped in the application of sequential analysis to statistical decision problems.

Born 12 January 1915, New Castle, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 12 February 2001, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
