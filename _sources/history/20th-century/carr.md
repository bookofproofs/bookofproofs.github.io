**Jack Carr** was a Scottish mathematician who worked in differential equations and dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In addition to his day job with the Post Office, Carr studied at night school.
* Carr took up the offer and studied mathematics at the University of Bath.
* It was a very new university when Carr began his studies there having only received university status in 1966 and many buildings were under construction on its new campus on the hill of Claverton Down outside Bath.
* Carr graduated in 1971 with a first class honours degree in mathematics and his performance had been so good that he was offered a place at the University of Oxford to study for a Master's Degree.
* at the University of Oxford at the same time as Carr and her thesis was on a similar topic to that of Carr, namely Some topics in functional differential equations (1973).
* Carr and Dyson published three joint papers in 1974-1975, one being in the proceedings of the conference Ordinary and partial differential equations held at the University of Dundee, Scotland, in 1974 and the other two in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
* While at Oxford, Carr met Teresa; they later married and had three children, Sam, Nancy and Emily.
* In 1974 Carr was appointed as a lecturer in mathematics at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland.
* In 1981 Carr published the book Applications of centre manifold theory.
* In 1982, the year following the publication of this book, Carr wrote two papers in collaboration with Robert G Muncaster: The application of centre manifolds to amplitude expansions.
* Carr published many important papers throughout his career and we will only give here the titles of a small number: (with Oliver Penrose) The Becker-Döring cluster equations: basic properties and asymptotic behaviour of solutions (1986); (with John M Ball) Coagulation-fragmentation dynamics (1987); (with John M Ball) Asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the Becker-Döring equations for arbitrary initial data (1988); (with John M Ball) The discrete coagulation-fragmentation equations: existence, uniqueness, and density conservation (1990); Asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the coagulation-fragmentation equations.
* John Macleod Ball was at Heriot-Watt from 1972 to 1996 before being appointed Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Oxford.
* In 1999, in collaboration with Julian Hunt, professor of mathematics, University of Cambridge, Carr wrote Mathematics for the 21st Century which was printed in the Times Higher Education Supplement.
* Jack Carr did not only use his many skills in research, conference organising, and teaching undergraduates and postgraduates.
* There are other ventures that Carr took part in which we should mention at this point.
* Carr was a curator of Scholarpedia.
* Carr made several research visits abroad.
* Carr received several honours for his broad contributions to mathematics.

Born 29 August 1948, East Heddon, Northumberland, England. Died 14 July 2016, Edinburgh, Scotland.
