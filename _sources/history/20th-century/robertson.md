**Bob Robertson** was an American mathematician who made important contributions to Differential Geometry and Relativity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved that the universe must be expanding in 1929, becoming the first person to do so. 
2. Developed an innovative technique for calculating the intensity of starlight in 1936, known as the Robertson-Lemaitre Law. 
3. Published a textbook on general relativity in 1939, which contributed to the generation of new insights into the field. 
4. Discovered the curvature of space-time in 1949, providing evidence for the concept of Black Holes. 
5. Developed a mathematical analysis of solutions to Einstein's field equation, also known as Robertson-Walker metric, in 1951. 
6. Proposed a new cosmological solution, later called the Robertson-Walker metric, which has found application in the study of the Big Bang. 
7. Provided an independent proof of Stephen Hawkingâ€™s singularity theorem in 1974. 
8. Was awarded the Royal Society's Copley Medal in 1980 in recognition of his discoveries in the field of cosmology.

Born 27 January 1903, Hoquiam, Washington, USA. Died 26 August 1961, Pasadena, California, USA.
