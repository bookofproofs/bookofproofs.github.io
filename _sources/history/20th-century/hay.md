**Louise Szmir Hay** was a French-born American mathematician who worked on recursively enumerable sets and computational complexity theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The reader may well ask at this point - who is Louise Szmir?
* Is this not a biography of Louise Schmir Hay?
* Szmir is not a misprint, rather Szmir was the Polish-Jewish family name which she got through her father who had emigrated to France from Poland between the wars.
* Louise's mother was also a Polish Jew who had left Poland to live in France.
* Later the family would change their name from Szmir to Schmir, and later still Louise would marry John Hay - hence the puzzle over her name.
* To add one further twist to the name question, she divorced John Hay and still later married the mathematician Richard Larson.
* However, she was not known by the name of Larson, all her mathematical publications being under the name of Louise Hay.
* Louise's father Samuel Szmir was in the clothing business.
* Samuel and Marjem had two children, Gaston who was born in 1933 and then Louise who was born two years later.
* Louise would never know her mother for Marjem died when she was only three years old.
* In March 1944 Gaston, who was Louise's older brother, together with Louise, escaped from occupied France and managed to get to the neutral country of Switzerland which was a safe haven.
* It is at this time that they changed their family name from Szmir to Schmir.
* Louise Schmir's family were struggling financially in the United States and Rosenbaum arranged for Louise to take up private mathematics tutoring so that she could help support the family financially.
* Money was still tight while at College but Louise was able to earn money during the summer vacation, and again the Westinghouse prize helped her to find useful summer jobs.
* While still an undergraduate at Swarthmore College Louise married John Hay, also an undergraduate at the time, who was studying experimental psychology.
* Louise Hay graduated from Swarthmore College in 1956 and, despite being married, fully intended to undertake graduate studies.
* In fact John Hay graduated from Swarthmore College with a Master's Degree a year before his wife graduated, so the choice of university for their doctoral study had to be made before Hay entered her final year at Swarthmore.
* Louise Hay remained at Swarthmore College to complete her undergraduate year while her husband moved to Ithaca to begin research.
* At Cornell Hay's thesis was supervised by J Barkley Rosser.
* Being apart again did not really seem an option to Hay who terminated her studies at Cornell early, writing up what she had at that point for a Master's Degree.
* Hay was awarded an M.A. in 1959, then also managed to get a job at Oberlin.
* It was not that good a programme, for Hay found a counter-example to one of the results she had been told to prove.
* For the next few years Hay had a number of posts as she basically followed her husband round the country.
* Both Hay and her husband worked for the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in Buffalo for a year, then Hay had a part-time teaching post before working at Mount Holyoke College for three years as an instructor.
* In 1968 she was appointed as an Associate Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and in the same year her marriage with John Hay ended.
* Hay spent the rest of her career in Chicago at the University of Illinois.
* We still have to give a brief account of some of Hay's mathematics.
* From 1980 until 1988 Hay became Head of the Mathematics Department.
* The annual presentation of this award is intended to highlight the importance of mathematics education and to evoke the memory of all that Hay exemplified as a teacher, scholar, administrator, and human being.

Born 14 June 1935, Metz, France. Died 28 October 1989, Oak Park, Illinois, USA.
