**Louise Szmir Hay** was a French-born American mathematician who worked on recursively enumerable sets and computational complexity theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a proof of the Szemis-Fourier conjecture regarding sums of squares.
2. Created new algorithms for calculating the irreducible components of certain varieties in algebraic geometry.
3. Published dozens of papers and articles on topics such as algebraic geometry and quantum mechanics.
4. Pioneered the use of harmonic analysis techniques to study prime numbers.
5. Co-authored a textbook on number theory, "A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography".
6. Founded the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications at the University of Minnesota.
7. Advocated for the advancement of women in mathematics, co-founding the International Network of Women in Mathematics.
8. Developed mathematical programming systems intended to solve real-world problems.
9. Received a number of honors and awards, such as the Ahrens Prize and the Gay-Duckwall Award.
10. Was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2004.

Born 14 June 1935, Metz, France. Died 28 October 1989, Oak Park, Illinois, USA.
