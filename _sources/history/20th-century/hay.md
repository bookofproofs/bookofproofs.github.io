**Louise Szmir Hay** was a French-born American mathematician who worked on recursively enumerable sets and computational complexity theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The reader may well ask at this point - who is Louise Szmir?
* Is this not a biography of Louise Schmir Hay?
* However, she was not known by the name of Larson, all her mathematical publications being under the name of Louise Hay.
* Money was still tight while at College but Louise was able to earn money during the summer vacation, and again the Westinghouse prize helped her to find useful summer jobs.
* At Cornell Hay's thesis was supervised by J Barkley Rosser.
* Being apart again did not really seem an option to Hay who terminated her studies at Cornell early, writing up what she had at that point for a Master's Degree.
* Hay was awarded an M.A. in 1959, then also managed to get a job at Oberlin.
* It was not that good a programme, for Hay found a counter-example to one of the results she had been told to prove.
* In 1968 she was appointed as an Associate Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and in the same year her marriage with John Hay ended.
* Hay spent the rest of her career in Chicago at the University of Illinois.
* We still have to give a brief account of some of Hay's mathematics.
* From 1980 until 1988 Hay became Head of the Mathematics Department.
* The annual presentation of this award is intended to highlight the importance of mathematics education and to evoke the memory of all that Hay exemplified as a teacher, scholar, administrator, and human being.

Born 14 June 1935, Metz, France. Died 28 October 1989, Oak Park, Illinois, USA.
