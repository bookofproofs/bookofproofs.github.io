**Roy Kerr** is a New Zealand mathematician who found a solution to Einstein's field equations which describes a rotating black hole.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Kerr developed a new solution of the Einstein field equations of general relativity which describes rotating black holes, now known as the Kerr metric. 
2. He independently solved the relativistic two-body problem in 1965. 
3. Kerr's solution of the two-body problem provided the mathematics for the orbits of quasars and the rotation curves of galaxies. 
4. He developed the foundations for quantum gravity and thermodynamics. 
5. He proved Einstein’s general theory of relativity was stable. 
6. He mathematically derived astrophysically interesting solutions of Einstein’s equations.
7. Kerr developed mathematical models for the formation and structure of stars. 
8. He published a major work on the mathematics of black holes. 
9. Kerr proposed a mechanism for explaining around 30% of the gamma-ray burst phenomenon. 
10. He was the first to realize and describe the new conservation laws in general relativity of energy, momentum, and angular momentum.

Born 16 May 1934, Kurow, New Zealand.
