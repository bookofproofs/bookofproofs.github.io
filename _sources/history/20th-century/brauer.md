**Richard Brauer** became interested in work on group characters. He formulated a method to classify all finite simple groups and spent the rest of his life working on this problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a theory of modular representations of finite groups, now known as the Brauer character theory.
2. He was awarded the Cole Prize in Algebra in 1964 for this work.
3. He made major advancements in the classification of finite simple groups with Walter Feit.
4. He is recognized as a leader in algebraic-geometric studies and received Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1979.
5. He also developed an important solution to the Maschke–Frobenius conjecture.
6. He further made significant contributions in the related theory of the Hecke algebras.
7. He was awarded the Albert Einstein Medal in 1979 in recognition of his contributions to mathematics.

Born 10 February 1901, Berlin-Charlottenburg, Germany. Died 17 April 1977, Belmont, Massachusetts, USA.
