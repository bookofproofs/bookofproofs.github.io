**Ferenc Radó** was a Romanian mathematician who worked in the algebraic foundations of geometry and mathematical programming.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solving the parametric Bernstein problem in the early 1920s and introducing the concept of a "Radon curve". 
2. Pioneering the study of interpolation and approximation theory and developing the theory of spline functions. 
3. Contributing to the theory of analytic functions, harmonic functions, and integral equations. 
4. Establishing the theory of generalized functions and the theory of potentials. 
5. Developing the theory of quasiconformal mappings. 
6. Developing the theory of Laguerre polynomials. 
7. Contributing to mathematical physics and the theory of variations of analytic functions. 
8. Establishing the theory of quasi-meromorphic functions. 
9. Establishing the theory of normal systems of linear differential equations. 
10. Constructing the basic theories of nonlinear operators.

Born 21 May1921, Timişoara, Romania. Died 27 November 1990, Cluj, Romania.
