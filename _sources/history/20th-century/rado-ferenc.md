**Ferenc Radó** was a Romanian mathematician who worked in the algebraic foundations of geometry and mathematical programming.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was therefore a Romanian city when Ferenc was born and it was in Timișoara that he grew up.
* Radó, just having commenced his university course, was prevented from continuing with his university studies.
* As far as Radó was concerned, however, the new government proved beneficial for he was allowed to continue his education.
* Following the educational reforms, Radó taught at a state school in Timișoara.
* Cluj (known also by its German name, Klausenburg, and its Hungarian name, Kolozsvár) had, with the rest of Transylvania, been incorporated into Romania in 1919, two years before Radó was born.
* It was here that Radó had studied for his degree, gaining his teacher's qualification in 1946.
* In 1959 the Babeș University and the Bolyai University in Cluj joined to became the Babeș-Bolyai University and Radó continued to teach there.
* Let us now look briefly at Radó's mathematical contributions.
* First we note that as well as publishing under the name Ferenc Radó, he also published papers under the names Francisc Radó and François Radó.
* After this Radó's interests turned towards the algebraic foundations of geometry.
* Finally we note Radó's contributions as on the editorial board of the Journal of Geometry and Aequationes Mathematicae.

Born 21 May 1921, Timişoara, Romania. Died 27 November 1990, Cluj, Romania.
