**Edward Witten** is an American mathematician who won a Fields Medal for his work on quantum field theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received the Fields Medal in 1990 for his work in mathematics.
2. Received the Crafoord Prize in 2008 for his work in fields of mathematics and physics.
3. Awarded the National Medal of Science in 1999 for his contributions in mathematics and physics.
4. Founded the proposal of M-theory in 1995, which is a theory that unifies all the five superstring theories.
5. Solved a three-decade-old mathematical dilemma using a theory based on a combination of algebraic geometry and topology.
6. Constructed the solution of the Calabiâ€“Yau Manifold Transformation. 
7. Introduced a new perspective on the orthodox formulation of quantum field theory in the early 1980s. 
8. Contributed significantly to the current understanding of quantum gravity.

Born 26 August 1951, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
