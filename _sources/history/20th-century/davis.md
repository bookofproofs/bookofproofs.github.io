**Martin Davis** was an American mathematician, known for his work on Hilbert's tenth problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Modeled a significant portion of the theory of algorithms, showing how computers can solve mathematical problems.
2. Produced a particularly useful algorithm for effectively encoding Boolean functions.
3. While his dissertation was theoretical, it was the first to demonstrate a theorem-proving program that was able to prove simple theorems in symbolic logic.
4. Developed a formal definition of computability, known as the Davis-Putnam algorithm.
5. Published an edition of the work of Alan Turing's, which described in detail the architecture of a practical digital computer.
6. Instituted the “machine tableaus” system and developed the “Davis-Putnam Algorithm" for theorem proving. 
7. Established the complexity class “NP-complete” which seeks to characterized the class of computational problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine. 
8. He is one of the founders of the field of computational complexity theory.

Born 8 March 1928, New York City, New York, USA. Died 1 January 2023, Berkeley, California, USA.
