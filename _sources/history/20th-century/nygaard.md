**Kristen Nygaard** was a Norwegian computer scientist, programming language pioneer, and politician. He was the co-inventor of object-oriented programming and the language _Simula_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Won the Turing Award in 2001 "for seminal contributions to the establishment of object-oriented programming and a founding contribution to the usage of Simula."
2. Developed several algorithms related to compiling, interpretive programming, and debugging.
3. Proposed early versions of the programming language Smalltalk and was the first to use Simula for object-oriented programming.
4. Started a program whereby Norwegian students are able to pursue their studies in mathematics and informatics at the same time.
5. Developed the programming language Eiffel - a language for software component specification, design, and implementation.
6. Created one of the earliest functional programming languages - pure Simula, which led to the development of the subsequent language, Simula 67.
7. Published books and papers on informatics, programming languages, and Algol 68.
8. Represented Norway in the ISO-standardization of programming languages.

Born 27 August 1926, Oslo, Norway. Died 10 August 2002, Oslo, Norway.
