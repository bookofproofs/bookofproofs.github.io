**James Vanstone** was a Canadian mathematician who dealt with differential geometry and multilinear algebra, especially in connection with the theory of relativity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed algorithms that implemented digitally corrected waveforms which allowed accurate control of power supplies in medical imaging equipment.
2. Created waveforms that enabled substantially improved imaging resolution for medical ultrasound equipment.
3. Improved the performance of medical X-ray imaging systems by applying numerical methods to waveform designs.
4. Developed methods for accurately determining the X-ray energy spectrum on medical imaging systems.
5. Developed mathematical models to predict and optimize the performance of high voltage power supplies.
6. Discovered a novel relationship between the ionization chamber current, temperature, and pressure in X-ray imaging systems.

Born 12 August 1933, Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada. Died 9 April 2001, Florida, USA.
