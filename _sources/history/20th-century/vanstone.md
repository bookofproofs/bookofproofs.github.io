**James Vanstone** was a Canadian mathematician who dealt with differential geometry and multilinear algebra, especially in connection with the theory of relativity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Hanno Rund had been appointed as an Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of Toronto in 1954 and Vanstone attended courses that Rund taught.
* Vanstone also attended courses on geometry given by Donald Coxeter.
* On their return they will reside at 9 Harbord Street in Toronto, where Mr Vanstone is studying for a postgraduate degree in mathematics.
* Travelling to Toronto, Vanstone took up an appointment as a lecturer in mathematics in October 1959.
* We note that Dipak K Sen was a colleague of Vanstone's at the University of Toronto with interests in relativity and gravitation, and mathematical physics.
* In 1961 Vanstone was promoted to Assistant Professor and then, in 1965, was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure.
* Vanstone was on the programme committee of the Thirteenth Biennial Seminar of the Canadian Mathematical Congress which was devoted to differential topology, differential geometry and applications.
* The programme committee, consisting of A E Fekete, W H Greub, Ngo Van Que, H Rund, U Suter and J R Vanstone was supplemented by A J Tingley the chairman of the mathematics department of Dalhousie University, the host institution.
* Vanstone's most famous work was the 3-volume, three author monograph Connections, curvature, and cohomology.
* Vanstone's co-authors were Werner H Greub and Stephen Halperin.
* Although he remained on the Faculty at the University of Toronto throughout his career, where he was a full professor from 1973,Vanstone did spend time in other institutions as a visiting professor.
* Vanstone served the Canadian Mathematical Society in several different capacities over many years.
* Vanstone retired in 1995.

Born 12 August 1933, Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada. Died 9 April 2001, Florida, USA.
