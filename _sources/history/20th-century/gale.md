**David Gale** was an American mathematician and economist who worked in  mathematical economics, game theory, and convex analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1950 Gale published a number of papers with various coauthors.
* We mention one further paper which in many ways is typical of the delightfully simple yet deep questions that Gale often investigated.
* Following the award of his doctorate from Princeton, Gale spent the year 1949-50 as an Instructor in Mathematics at Princeton.
* Let us look now at some of Gale's books since this gives a good overview of both his research interests and of courses he taught.
* In 1960 Gale published The theory of linear economic models.
* Gale wrote the Mathematical Entertainments column of The Mathematical Intelligencer from 1991 to 1997.
* Gale received many honours and prizes for his outstanding contributions.
* Gale's research is known for its mathematical elegance.
* Many paid tribute to Gale after his death.
* Alvin Roth, professor of economics at Harvard University, had nominated Gale for the Nobel Prize in economics.
* But David's work will be remembered for generations to come, in books and journal articles and seminars and workshops, as well as in the very concrete allocation procedures that have been built upon his insights.
* Throughout his life, Gale would insist that visitors look at the newest puzzle he was working on.
* In addition to his fascination with mathematical puzzles, Gale had several hobbies.

Born 13 December 1921, Manhattan, New York, USA. Died 7 March 2008, Berkeley, California, USA.
