**David Gale** was an American mathematician and economist who worked in  mathematical economics, game theory, and convex analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Gale-Shapley algorithm for matching in two-sided markets, notably in the field of matching medical students to hospitals.
2. Researched and wrote extensively on the game of matching pennies, and his work clarified the mathematics behind the difference between cooperative and non-cooperative games.
3. Discovered the relationship between the Gale-solitary game and linear programming to bridge economic theory with models of social choice.
4. Developed the stable roommates problem and its associated solution algorithm, which provided a major optimization tool for industries.
5. First introduced the concept of a differential game and its mathematical solution, as well as co-founded the field of potential games theory. 
6. Established the theory of voting games, which provided a mathematical framework for analyzing fair and effective voting mechanisms. 
7. Established the Shapley value to measure the effectiveness of different voting systems, which is used in computational social choice. 
8. Inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Econometric Society for his contributions to mathematics.

Born 13 December 1921, Manhattan, New York, USA. Died 7 March 2008, Berkeley, California, USA.
