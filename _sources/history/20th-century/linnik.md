**Yuri Linnik** was a Ukranian-born mathematician who worked on number theory, probability theory and mathematical statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He obtained the Moscow Mathematical Society's Aleksandrov Prize for original papers in higher mathematics in 1951.
2. He co-authored the first comprehensive exposition of Kolmogorov complexity and its applications to probability theory and analysis.
3. He became a Professor of the Moscow State University in 1954.
4. He invented the Linnik ergodic method which was applied in information theory and probability theory.
5. He developed new methods of probability theory and its application to statistics, inspired by the works of Aleksandr Khinchin.
6. He introduced an innovative approach to the central limit theorem in probability theory.
7. He founded the first Soviet periodicals devoted to probability theory and statistics.
8. He formulated the "multiplicative Lattice Theorem" which was widely used in number theory. 
9. He introduced a series of innovative methods to bound probability distributions. 
10. He solved several difficult problems in number theory, including the Lehmer problem and the Elliottâ€“Halberstam conjecture.

Born 21 January 1915, Belaya Tserkov, Ukraine. Died 30 June 1972, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
