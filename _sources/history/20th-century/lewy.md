**Hans Lewy** was a Polish-born American mathematician who worked on partial differential equations and on functions of several complex variables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Fourier–Legendre pseudospectral method of approximating solutions of partial differential equations.
2. Published a paper on the calculation of solution of Dirac's equation.
3. Established the theory of multiple Fourier Integrals for certain domains.
4. Developed the Abramowitz–Stegun algorithm for the generation of numerical tables of mathematical functions.
5. Generated the celebrated Lewy extension of the Cauchy–Riemann equations.
6. Published a definitive paper on the fundamental principles of the quantum theory of matter.
7. Discovered the use of pseudodifferential operators in solving partial differential equations.
8. Gained recognition for work relating to the expansion of partial differential equations in terms of linear combinations of eigenfunctions.

Born 20 October 1904, Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 23 August 1988, Berkeley, California, USA.
