**Eugene Alexander Graham Jr** was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in the Italian campaign of World War II. He was the first African American to study for a Ph.D. in mathematics outside the United States. Because of discrimination in the United States, he spent most of his career in France.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed and successfully implemented an innovative algorithm for calculating integrals.
2. Developed a method for solving nonlinear equations using linear systems of algebraic equations.
3. Pioneered the use of numerical analysis to obtain numerical solutions for differential equations.
4. Developed mathematical models for the atmospheric pressure measurements of the International Radiosonde Observation System.
5. Published the Grahamâ€“Carr Cyclic, a theorem relating to the undetermined number of complex integrators in a system of equations. 
6. Proved the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, which describes the interrelationship between roots of polynomials and their field extensions. 
7. Discovered the Graham-Lobner Theorem, which describes the conditions necessary for a system of equations to have a finite number of solutions.

Born 25 March 1925, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 15 April 1997, Orly, Val-De-Marne, France.
