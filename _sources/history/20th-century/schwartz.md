**Laurent Schwartz** was a French mathematician who is best known for his work in the theory of distributions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1950, in recognition of his work in both pure and applied mathematics, particularly concerning the theory of distributions.
2. He was the first to solve the Cauchy problem and came up with a general solution over two variables that filled in precision to the so-called Euler equations.
3. He was the first to use methods of functional analysis to study partial differential equations, establishing a firm foundation to the theory of distributions.
4. He argued that solutions to mathematical problems should be addressed through solutions of more fundamental equations.
5. He applied his method of analysis to the field of mathematical physics, creating a new area.
6. He also worked on the mathematical theory of shock waves, developing shock wave solutions that could be used in aerodynamics.
7. He created the Schwartz space, an example of a nuclear space in a Hilbert space, and studied it for applications in physics.
8. He received the prestigious Prix Bordin from the French Academy of Sciences in 1960.
9. He was awarded the Crafoord Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1974 for his fundamental research in mathematics.
10. In 1981, he received the Grand Cross of the Légion d'honneur for his contributions to mathematics and mathematical physics.

Born 5 March 1915, Paris, France. Died 4 July 2002, Paris, France.
