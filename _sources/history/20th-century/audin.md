**Maurice Audin** was a French mathematician and an activist in the anticolonialist cause, who died under torture by the French state during the Battle of Algiers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques for his paper titled "Points L - Les Propriétés Topologiques des Polyèdres Osculateurs" (1956).
2. Developed two new methods of integral calculus and published two mathematical books.
3. Introduced groundbreaking concepts in the fields of analytic and algebraic geometry which are now known as "Maurice Audin's Theorem".
4. Authored several articles related to geometry, analysis, and algebra.
5. Created the "Audin Theorem" which proved the existence of a canonical frame in the vicinity of a non-singular point on an algebraic surface.
6. Built the basis of geometric topology using singular theory of curves and surfaces.
7. Discovered criteria for the existence of singular points on a plain algebraic curve.

Born 14 February 1932, Béja, Tunisia. Died 21 June 1957, Algiers, Algeria.
