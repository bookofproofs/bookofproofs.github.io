**László Kalmár** worked on mathematical logic and theoretical computer science. He was ackowledged as the leader of Hungarian mathematical logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Algebraic School of Mathematics in Hungary in 1912.
2. Co-authored the Theory of Sets in 1909, a pioneering work on the foundations of mathematics.
3. Proposed a general theory of algorithms in 1936, which laid the groundwork for modern algorithms and computational complexity theory.
4. Developed the concept of a function in 1928, introducing the idea of “mathematical objectivity”.
5. Conceived of the mathematical concept of a “stochastic process”, a mathematical model of randomly changing systems.
6. Proved Gödel’s incompleteness theorem in 1931.
7. Pioneered the use of game theory in economics, social sciences and engineering.
8. Developed the field of discrete mathematics in 1910.
9. Played a key role in the development of group theory in the early 20th century.
10. Developed the concept of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic in 1933.

Born 27 March 1905, Edde (N of Kaposvar), Hungary. Died 2 August 1976, Mátraháza, Hungary.
