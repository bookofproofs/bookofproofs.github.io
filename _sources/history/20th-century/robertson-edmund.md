An influential mathematician who established the theory of matrices and determinants, developed the concept of a group, and investigated the use of probability in higher algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the theory of matrices and determinants in 1858, from which modern linear algebra is derived.
2. Developed the concept of a group in 1871 and solved the icosahedral problem.
3. Published a number of original works on algebraic equations, elliptic functions, collineations, and modular surfaces.
4. Founded the University of Aberdeen Mathematical Lectures in 1863.
5. Developed a method to calculate the number of given quadratic equations with a fixed number of unknowns in 1859.
6. Showed an early interest in Non-Euclidean geometry and developed it in 1889.
7. Was one of the first to apply the concept of probability to a problem in higher algebra in 1856.
8. Introduces Robertson's theorem and related discovery of the triple division problem in 1865.
9. Was a leading contributor to both the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal Astronomical Society.

Born 1 June 1943, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.
