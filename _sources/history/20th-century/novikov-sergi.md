**Sergei Novikov** is a  Russian mathematician who worked in algebraic topology and soliton theory. He won a Fields medal in 1970 and a Wolf prize in 2005.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Novikov was awarded the Fields Medal in 1970 for his work on the algebraic K-theory of rings.
2. He introduced and developed a theory of algebraic systems called mappings, now known as Novikov mappings.
3. Novikov solved previously unstudied problems in topology concerning Reidemeister torsion, and proposed invariants for classifying manifolds.
4. His work allowed for calculation of cycles and homology groups, which advanced algebraic topology.
5. Novikov studied the Magnus problem and group rings, and made contributions to homotopy theory. 
6. He proved the Novikov Conjecture, a major advance in differential topology and geometry.

Born 20 March 1938, Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod), Russia.
