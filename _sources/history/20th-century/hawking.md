**Stephen Hawking** was one of the world's foremost theoretical physicists famous for his work on black holes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Identified the Second Law of Black Hole Dynamics 
2. Discovered the four laws of black hole mechanics 
3. Researched the nature of singularities within the framework of General Relativity 
4. Proposed the existence of several types of singularities, including naked singularities 
5. Co-authored the Thorne-Hawking-Preskill bet concerning black hole information paradox 
6. Reinterpreted the concept of entropy, providing a connection between thermodynamics, gravity, and cosmology 
7. Developed a mathematical model of the universe exploring the interplay between quantum theory and General Relativity 
8. Explored the implications of Hawking radiation, a theoretical process where black holes emit particles 
9. Achieved groundbreaking results in areas such as quantum field theory, thermodynamics and quantum gravity

Born 8 January 1942, Oxford, England. Died 14 March 2018, Cambridge, England.
