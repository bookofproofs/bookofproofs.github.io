**Lev Landau** was an Azerbaijan-born mathematician who made fundamental discoveries in theoretical physics. He won the Nobel prize for his theory of superfluidity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of errors in quanta, which served as the basis for the theories of quantum mechanics;
2. Developed the theory of superfluidity;
3. Pioneered the Landau-Lifshitz equations of motion for particles and fields;
4. Discovered the Landau pole;
5. Developed the theory of Fermi liquids;
6. Introduced the concept of Landau levels;
7. Used oscillatory integrals to solve problems in classical mechanics;
8. Wrote the classic textbook Course of Theoretical Physics;
9. Developed the Landau-Ginzburg theory of second-order phase transitions;
10. Worked on applications of group theory to solid state and nuclear physics.

Born 22 January 1908, Baku, Azerbaijan, Russian Empire. Died 1 April 1968, Moscow, USSR.
