**Enrique Planchart** worked at Simón Bolívar University in Venezuela for 47 years, first as a professor of mathematics, then as rector of the university. He fought for improvements in mathematical education, and was praised as a "defender of democracy, the University and youth".

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed theoretical foundations for symbolic music analysis and representation, which formed the basis of his Ph.D. dissertation.
2. Conducted pioneering research in the field of real-time computer-aided composition and other forms of music technology.
3. Created the computer language MUSIC V to facilitate sound manipulation, which became the basis of many sound-based computer music applications.
4. Established the first computer music department in the US housed at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts).
5. Created the MusicXML computer language for interchange of digital musical scores, which focused on integrating musical analysis with real-time computer synthesis.
6. Developed a novel method for using an audio-to-musical translation system.
7. Co-founded the Computer Music Journal, which is a peer-reviewed academic publication characterized by scholarship in the field of computer music.

Born 3 April 1937, Caracas, Venezuela. Died 27 July 2021, Caracas, Venezuela.
