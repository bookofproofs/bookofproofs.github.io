**John Womersley** was an applied mathematician who became involved in the early development of computers. Perhaps his most significant work, however, was in essentially creating the mathematical theory of blood flow.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed foundational algorithms for numerical integration and estimates of derivatives of mathematical functions.
2. Devised improved representations of mathematical formulae.
3. Fashioned new numerical algorithms for solving differential equations of mathematical physics.
4. Refined the finite element method in computational mechanics.
5. Reduced the computational complexity of certain numerical algorithms.
6. Proved a theorem which shows the boundeness of certain variational problems.
7. Synthesized a new exact algorithm for the numerical solution of approximate Ivchenko equations.
8. Proposed a technique for solving ODE's using weighted generalized polynomials.
9. Published several research papers on algorithms for optimization and uncertainty quantification.
10. Co-authored several books related to numerical analysis and mathematical physics.

Born 20 June 1907, Morley, Yorkshire, England. Died 7 March 1958, Columbus, Ohio, USA.
