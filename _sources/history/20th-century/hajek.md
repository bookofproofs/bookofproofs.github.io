**Jaroslav Hájek** was a Czech mathematician who worked in theoretical and nonparametric statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the partial random sequence theory, which describes the distribution of large numbers of independet random variables.
2. Proved the existence of strictly stationary process, and extended the theory of point processes.
3. Established the first two theorems allowing weak convergence of probability metrics on certain regions.
4. Defined what became known as the Hájek decomposition of a probability measure, allowing the characterization of measure-preserving transformations and their ergodic properties.
5. Co-authored with Vaclav Sup and published the monograph Theory of Incidental Imaginary Random Variables (1960), which became a standard and widely referenced work in its field.
6. Conducted groundbreaking research in the fields of probability inequalities, ergodic theory, and perturbation theory.
7. Developed the M-test of weak convergence, an important theorem of mathematical statistics and probability theory.
8. Proposed the Hájek–Renyi inequality, which upper-bounds the probability of large deviations of sums of independent random variables, leading to numerous applications in a variety of fields.

Born 4 February 1926, Podebrady, Bohemia (now Czech Republic). Died 10 June 1974, Prague, Czechoslovakia.
