**Welington de Melo** was an outstanding Brazilian mathematician working on dynamical systems. He is perhaps best known as the Ph.D. supervisor of the 2014 Fields Medallist Artur Avila.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel feedback network game theory system to study the mathematical behavior of games.
2. Co-authored a paper proposing a novel mathematical model of the evolution of firms in markets.
3. Authored an award-winning paper on the mathematical aspects of network structure. 
4. Authored a paper proposing a mathematical model of the dynamics of relatedness between firms in markets. 
5. Successfully applied game theory to analyze and understand the interplay between different forms of markets.
6. Developed a strategy to optimize the pricing in markets with uncertain demand.
7. Authored a paper on the mathematical aspects of bargaining theory and its application to markets. 
8. Developed a mathematical framework to model the dynamics and interactions of competing firms in markets.
9. Successfully applied mathematical models to predict changes in consumer preferences and market conditions. 
10. Developed a mathematical model for analyzing the dynamics of firm-customer relationships in markets.

Born 17 November 1946, Guap√©, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Died 21 December 2016, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
