**David Eisenbud** is an American mathematician who is known for his work in algebra, algebraic geometry and symbolic computation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Leonard Eisenbud's parents, Boris and Katherine Eisenbud, were Russian but had emigrated to the United States in 1902.
* Leonard Eisenbud (1913-2004) was a student of Eugene Wigner and together they co-authored the important book Nuclear Structure (1958).
* Eisenbud entered the University of Chicago where he went on to undertake both undergraduate and graduate studies.
* Also in 1970, Eisenbud received his Ph.D. from Chicago for his thesis on non-commutative ring theory Torsion Modules over Dedekind Prime Rings.
* Eisenbud's first paper was not on ring theory, however, but rather on group theory with Groups of order automorphisms of certain homogeneous ordered sets (1969).
* Returning to Brandeis University, Eisenbud was promoted to Associate Professor in 1976.
* David also has a marvelous gift for mathematical collaboration.
* Shortly after his graduate days, David began a joint project with Buchsbaum.
* In the middle 1970s David worked with Harold Levine on the topology of finite Câˆž  map germs ...
* David next became interested in algebraic geometry, beginning a long and important collaboration with Joe Harris.
* During 1982-84, Eisenbud was Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at Brandeis University.
* David has furthered a deliberate policy of outreach into new areas, and MSRI's influence and reputation increasingly extend beyond core mathematics into areas on the boundaries between mathematics and science as well as into applications ranging from imaging to cryptography to finance.
* Eisenbud has published a number of important books.
* This important book earned Eisenbud the 2010 Steele prize from the American Mathematical Society.
* But even more, Eisenbud felt that there was a great need for a book which did not present pure commutative algebra leaving the underlying geometry behind.
* Finally we mention Eisenbud's 2005 book The geometry of syzygies.
* We have noted several honours given to Eisenbud, including the 2010 Steele Prize, but among those we have not yet mentioned is his election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006 and the creation of the Eisenbud Professorship at Berkley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute made possible by a US$10 million gift from the Simons Foundation in May 2007.

Born 8 April 1947, New York City, New York, USA.
