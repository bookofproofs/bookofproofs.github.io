**David Eisenbud** is an American mathematician who is known for his work in algebra, algebraic geometry and symbolic computation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Leonard Eisenbud's parents, Boris and Katherine Eisenbud, were Russian but had emigrated to the United States in 1902.
* Leonard Eisenbud (1913-2004) was a student of Eugene Wigner and together they co-authored the important book Nuclear Structure (1958).
* In 1947, shortly after their son David was born, the Eisenbuds moved to a newly purchased house in Patchogue after accepting the offer to join the new Brookhaven National Laboratory's Physics Department situated on Long Island, Upton, New York.
* David Eisenbud was brought up in Swarthmore where his father worked until 1958 when the State University of New York set up the State University College on Long Island at Oyster Bay, and Leonard Eisenbud was appointed Professor of Physics and Acting Chairman of the Department of Physics.
* So far we have not mentioned the career of David's mother Ruth-Jean Eisenbud (1915-2004) - we should note that she was a childhood polio victim but went on to become a psychotherapist and a professor at New York University and Adelphi University.
* Eisenbud entered the University of Chicago where he went on to undertake both undergraduate and graduate studies.
* On 3 June 1970, Eisenbud married Monika Margarete Schwabe; they had two children David and Alina.
* Also in 1970, Eisenbud received his Ph.D. from Chicago for his thesis on non-commutative ring theory Torsion Modules over Dedekind Prime Rings.
* Eisenbud's first paper was not on ring theory, however, but rather on group theory with Groups of order automorphisms of certain homogeneous ordered sets (1969).
* Returning to Brandeis University, Eisenbud was promoted to Associate Professor in 1976.
* David also has a marvelous gift for mathematical collaboration.
* Shortly after his graduate days, David began a joint project with Buchsbaum.
* David next became interested in algebraic geometry, beginning a long and important collaboration with Joe Harris.
* During 1982-84, Eisenbud was Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at Brandeis University.
* David has furthered a deliberate policy of outreach into new areas, and MSRI's influence and reputation increasingly extend beyond core mathematics into areas on the boundaries between mathematics and science as well as into applications ranging from imaging to cryptography to finance.
* Eisenbud has published a number of important books.
* This important book earned Eisenbud the 2010 Steele prize from the American Mathematical Society.
* But even more, Eisenbud felt that there was a great need for a book which did not present pure commutative algebra leaving the underlying geometry behind.
* Finally we mention Eisenbud's 2005 book The geometry of syzygies.
* We have noted several honours given to Eisenbud, including the 2010 Steele Prize, but among those we have not yet mentioned is his election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006 and the creation of the Eisenbud Professorship at Berkley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute made possible by a US$10 million gift from the Simons Foundation in May 2007.

Born 8 April 1947, New York City, New York, USA.
