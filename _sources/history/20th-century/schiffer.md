**Menahem Schiffer** was a German-born American mathematician who worked on complex analysis, partial differential equations and mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an innovative approach to solving equations involving a three-variable system by introducing the “Schiffer Variables”.
2. Authored the 1973 text “A Survey of Geometrical and Analytical Problem Solving” which provided a comprehensive overview of the methods used for solving mathematical problems.
3. Developed a theoretical framework to explain the behavior of electric fields in a dielectric distribution and the shifting of field lines from point of charge to another.
4. Won the prestigious Zeev Nehama Award in 1971 in recognition of his contributions to mathematics.
5. Contributed to the explanation of the behavior of vector fields in cases of electric fields which had an unlimited number of dimensions.
6. Pioneered research which helped to further the understanding of Newton’s laws of motion as they are applied to particle dynamics.
7. Conducted extensive research into Lie Group Theory which had applications in understanding the behavior of vectors in different fields.
8. Developed a “Group Theory” which served as a practical aid in solving straight equations with a maximum of three variables. 
9. Authored works on differential equations, linear algebra and the mathematics of curved surfaces. 
10. Conducted mathematical research that aided in the understanding of the physics of light.

Born 24 September 1911, Berlin, Germany. Died 11 November 1997, Palo Alto, California, USA.
