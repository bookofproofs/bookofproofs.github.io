**Harvey Greenspan** played an important role in establishing Applied Mathematics as a subject in its own right in the United States. He studied fluid dynamics both from a theoretical and from an experimental perspective, making major contributions to fluid flow, wave motion and bio-fluid dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Greenspan was educated in Brooklyn where after his primary education, his secondary education was at the Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York.
* Harvey graduated from the High School in 1950 and began studying mathematics at the City College of New York.
* Greenspan was awarded a Ph.D. by Harvard University in 1956 for his thesis The generation of edge waves by moving pressure distributions.
* Following the award of his doctorate, Greenspan was appointed as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Harvard University, a position he held from 1957 to 1960.
* Greenspan was appointed as an Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1960.
* This, then, was the problem which Greenspan faced at MIT.
* In 1964 Greenspan was promoted to Professor of Applied Mathematics.
* Another task that Greenspan took on at this time was setting up a computing laboratory.
* In 1968 Greenspan published the monograph The Theory of Rotating Fluids.
* Greenspan had a major impact on the teaching of applied mathematics at MIT, introducing around ten courses himself into the curriculum.
* Greenspan retired from his chair at MIT in 2002 and was made Professor Emeritus.
* We have seen how Greenspan tried over the years to put forward his own ideas about how applied mathematics should be taught.

Born 22 February 1933, Brooklyn, New York, USA.
