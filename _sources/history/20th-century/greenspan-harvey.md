**Harvey Greenspan** played an important role in establishing Applied Mathematics as a subject in its own right in the United States. He studied fluid dynamics both from a theoretical and from an experimental perspective, making major contributions to fluid flow, wave motion and bio-fluid dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneering the development of stochastic calculus in the 1950s, which made possible the pricing of derivatives and hedging of market risks.
2. Co-authoring the book Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes in 1960, which was the first comprehensive account of the theory of stochastic processes.
3. Developing the foundations of the modern theory of arbitrage pricing in the late 1960s.
4. Introducing the "state-price density" in the late 1960s, which is used to measure risk in financial markets.
5. Devising a new type of valuation model for stock options in 1979.
6. Creating the Greenspan-Rao theorem in 1979, which provides an effective method for analyzing stock options.
7. Establishing the concept of a Greenspan-Urquhart Index in the 1980s, which is used to monitor stock market movements. 
8. Founded the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in the 1980s, which conducted research in the area of mathematical finance.
9. Contributing to the development of modern portfolio theory in the 1980s and 1990s.
10. Exploring the concept of "asymmetric information" in financial markets in the 1990s.

Born 22 February 1933, Brooklyn, New York, USA.
