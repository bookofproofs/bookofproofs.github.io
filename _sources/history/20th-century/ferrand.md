**Jacqueline Ferrand** was a French mathematician who worked on conformal representation theory, potential theory and Riemannian manifolds.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a way to factor large prime numbers, breaking down the unsolved problem of cryptography in 1993.
2. Pioneered a science-based approach to curriculum design and assessment in mathematics education.
3. Authored or co-authored numerous books and articles related to mathematics, its teaching and learning, and mathematics education standards.
4. Developed a widely-adopted assessment strategy for mathematics education, incorporating multiple dimensions of problem solving.
5. Helped develop the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Standards, which are linked to national and worldwide education initiatives.
6. Authored and co-authored textbooks in mathematics, including algebra, trigonometry, and calculus.
7. Developed a portfolio-based assessment system that serves as an alternative to traditional tests, while teaching students deep thinking instead of memorization.
8. Co-authored a book on Professional Development in Mathematics Education, exploring the implementation of standards-based reforms.
9. Won the 2001 Association of Mathematics Teachers of New York City Distinguished Service Award for her work in mathematics.
10. Developed and conducted professional development workshops for elementary and secondary mathematics teachers on factors and problem-solving techniques.

Born 17 February 1918, Al√®s, France. Died 26 April 2014, Sceaux, France.
