**Lochlainn O'Raifeartaigh** was an Irish physicist who worked in the field of theoretical particle physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Constructed a mathematical framework for the unification of electromagnetism and gravitation.
2. Developed a mathematical basis for general relativity.
3. Developed a system of equations which unified the theory of gravitation, electromagnetism, and the weak and strong nuclear forces.
4. Pioneered the application of symmetry breaking in the field of gravitational theory.
5. Explained Bose-Einstein condensation in gravitational theories.
6. Introduced the concept of infinite-dimensional group symmetry to assist in describing complex physical phenomena.
7. Development of a unified field theory of gravity and electromagnetism.
8. Principal author of the book ‘Gauge Theories of Weak Interactions’. 
9. Contributed to the mathematical study of nonlinear dynamics and chaos.
10. Developed new non-perturbative methods to analyze nonlinear dynamical systems.

Born 11 March 1933, Clontarf, Dublin, Ireland. Died 18 November 2000, Dublin, Ireland.
