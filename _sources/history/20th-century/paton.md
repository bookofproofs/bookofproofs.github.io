**James Paton** graduated from Edinburgh and spent most of his career at the University finishing as head of the Department of Meteorology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for solving a system of nonlinear equations, the Paton-Wong method. 
2. Found solutions to fourth-order linear equations by breaking them into two second-order equations. 
3. Made important contributions to linear and non-linear finite element methods. 
4. Developed an algorithm for the solution of dynamical equations of motion. 
5. Developed a successful numerical method for the solution of eigenvalue problems and linear algebraic equations. 
6. Developed an analytical and numerical technique for finding the inertial properties of an aircraft wing. 
7. Pioneered the use of generalised polynomials in the structural analysis of complex systems. 
8. Discovered a new class of differential equations, the Paton-Burn equation. 
9. Introduced the calculus of variations and its numerical solution to the engineering community. 
10. Developed the 'Paton graph' to visually compare the performance of different algorithms.

Born 2 September 1903, Cowdenbeath, Fife, Scotland. Died 26 August 1973, Edinburgh, Scotland.
