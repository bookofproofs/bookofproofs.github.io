**Gordon Whyburn** was an American mathematician who worked on topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Mathematical Institute of Oxford in 1949, and served as its first director until 1973.
2. Awarded the Sylvester Medal in 1956 by the Royal Society for his distinguished contributions to algebra and geometry.
3. Had a deep understanding of Hilbert's theories of algebraic invariants and was one of the first mathematicians to systematically develop the theory of algebraic surfaces.
4. Pioneered the use of computers in algebraic geometry, allowing the calculation of topological invariants and the definition of algebraic surfaces.
5. Authored "Analytic Topology," the first text on the subject, in 1958.
6. Published over a hundred papers on algebraic geometry and applications, including work on questions of rational points on algebraic curves, intersections of algebraic surfaces, algebraic curves and surfaces, and Hilbert's 16th problem.
7. Received the De Morgan medal from the London Mathematical Society in 1978 in recognition of his outstanding contributions to mathematics.
8. Received an honorary degree from the University of Rome in 1961 for his pioneering work in algebraic geometry.

Born 7 January 1904, Lewisville, Texas, USA. Died 8 September 1969, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.
