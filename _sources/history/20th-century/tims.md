### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Rex attended a primary school in Watford and then, for his secondary education, studied at Watford Grammar School on Rickmansworth Road in Watford.
* Tims devoted his efforts to teaching and did not publish any mathematical papers for nearly twenty years until he published (with J A Tyrrell) Approximate evaluation of Euler's constant (1971).
* He was, however, the joint author of an excellent undergraduate textbook, namely Mathematical analysis: an introduction, by David Bernard Scott and Sydney Rex Tims (Cambridge University Press, 1966).
* In 1961 Tims was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society, having been proposed by Hermann Bondi.
