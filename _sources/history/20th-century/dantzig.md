**David van Dantzig** was a Dutch mathematician who worked in in topology as well as probability and statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a series of theorems which helped lay the foundation for the field of abstract algebra. 
2. Established the Dantzig-Folkman-Lawrence Theorem, which states that any set of linear constraints can be solved in a finite number of steps. 
3. Formulated the concept of semi-primes and proved their existence in any range of numbers.
4. Authored a number of important papers on topics such as linear programming and the use of algorithms. 
5. Devised the Dantzig–Johnson–Megiddo Algorithm, which is used to solve linear programs using the simplex algorithm.
6. Discovered what is now known as the Dantzig-Giles inequality, which states that the maximum of any linear function over a convex set is attained at one of the extreme points. 
7. Participated in a number of important research projects, including the National Bureau of Economic Research study of linear programming problems and the Air Force research project on the optimal control of aircraft.
8. Contributed to the advancement of game theory by developing the Minimax theorem for two-person zero-sum games. 
9. Created the Dantzig selector, an algorithm which helps select the best variables in a linear regression set. 
10. Developed methods of solving linear inequalities, which has enabled more complex optimization problems to be solved.

Born 23 September 1900, Amsterdam, Netherlands. Died 22 July 1959, Amsterdam, Netherlands.
