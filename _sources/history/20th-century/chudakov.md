**Nikolai Chudakov** was a Russian mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Nikolai showed great interest in mathematics while at school and, after completing his school education, he entered the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of the relatively new Saratov University.
* From 1927 to 1930 Chudakov undertook postgraduate studies at Moscow State University, then, in 1930, he returned to Saratov University where he was appointed as Head of the Department of Higher Mathematics.
* After the award of his D.Sc., Chudakov returned to the University of Moscow where he worked until 1940.
* Chudakov established a number of important results in number theory.
* In 1947 Chudakov published On Goldbach-Vinogradov's theorem in the Annals of Mathematics.
* Chudakov made a substantial contribution to the solution when he proved that all, except possibly a finite number, of even integers greater than 2 can be represented as the sum of two primes.
* Chudakov is also famed as the author of the classic monograph Introduction to the theory of Dirichlet L-functions (1947) which was widely used by number theory experts.

Born 14 December 1904, Lysovsk, Novo-Burassk, Saratov, Russia. Died 22 November 1986, Saratov, Russia.
