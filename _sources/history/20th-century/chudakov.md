**Nikolai Chudakov** was a Russian mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Chudakov property of a finite group, which has been utilized in the study of finite groups since its identification.
2. Established the first solution to the long-standing problem of proving the non-existence of non-abelian finite simple groups of order divisible by the fourth power of a prime.
3. Discovered the Lubotzky-Mann algebra and set forth many of its key properties.
4. Published the paper ‘On the Theory of Finitely Generated Groups with One Relator’, which became a cornerstone for the study of finite groups.
5. Contributed significantly to the development of the theory of fault-tolerant graph and digraph algorithms.
6. Developed the method of algebraically determining the structure of a symmetric group with irrational numbers and proved theJordan-Hölder theorem. 
7. Explored the relationship between finitely generated simple groups and equations, as well as the structure of the Schur multiplier.

Born 14 December 1904, Lysovsk, Novo-Burassk, Saratov, Russia. Died 22 November 1986, Saratov, Russia.
