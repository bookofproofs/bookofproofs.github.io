**René Thom** was a French mathematician who is known for his development of catastrophe theory, a mathematical treatment of continuous action producing a discontinuous result.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical theory of catastrophe theory in the 1960s, which uses topological methods to analyze the qualitative behavior of dynamical systems.
2. Created the concept of inductive structures and attracted attention to dynamical systems with the concept of attractor.
3. Proposed the Thom-Smale Complex in the 1970s, which provided a way to study the complicated behavior of topological dynamical systems.
4. Authored several influential mathematical works, including Structural Stability and Morphogenesis, Semio Physics: A Sketch, and Models of Biological Pattern Formation.
5. Received the Fields Medal in 1958 for his work in topology.
6. Received the Copley Medal in 1975 for his contribution to mathematics.
7. Founded the French Mathematical Society in 1972.

Born 2 September 1923, Montbéliard, Doubs, France. Died 25 October 2002, Bures-sur-Yvette, France.
