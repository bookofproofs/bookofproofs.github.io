**René Thom** was a French mathematician who is known for his development of catastrophe theory, a mathematical treatment of continuous action producing a discontinuous result.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* From 1931 Thom attended Primary School in Montbéliard, the town of his birth in which his parents were shopkeepers.
* It was at this primary school that Thom first showed his academic potential winning a scholarship.
* Thom's parents sent him and his brother south to avoid the conflict although they themselves remained in Montbéliard.
* Thom and his brother eventually reached Switzerland.
* After helping with the harvest near Romont, Thom returned to France being taken to Lyon where he lived with a friend of his mother.
* Thom attended the Lycée Saint-Louis in Paris and applied to enter the École Normale Supérieure but failed to gain entrance in 1942.
* However, mathematically it was an exciting time for Thom who was to be strongly influenced by Henri Cartan and the Bourbaki approach to mathematics.
* In 1946 Thom graduated from the École Normale Supérieure and then moved to Strasbourg, taking a CNRS research post, so that he could continue to work with Henri Cartan.
* The work of the thesis was carried out in Strasbourg but Thom presented it to Paris.
* The foundations of the theory of cobordism, for which Thom later received a Fields Medal, already appear in his doctoral thesis.
* Thom returned to France and taught at Grenoble in 1953-54, then at Strasbourg from 1954 until 1963.
* It is as the inventor of catastrophe theory that Thom is best known but his earlier work had made him well known before he worked on catastrophe theory.
* His work on topology, in particular on characteristic classes, cobordism theory and the Thom transversality theorem led to his being awarded a Fields medal in 1958.
* These ideas have significantly enriched mathematics, and everything seems to indicate that the impact of Thom's ideas - whether they find their expression in the already known or in forthcoming works - is not exhausted by far.
* Thom's theory is an attempt to describe, in a way that is impossible using differential calculus, those situations in which gradually changing forces lead to so-called catastrophes, or abrupt changes.
* Presented by Thom in Structural Stability and Morphogenesis (1972), the theory has since been developed by many mathematicians.
* Thom was awarded the Grand Prix Scientifique de la Ville de Paris in 1974.

Born 2 September 1923, Montbéliard, Doubs, France. Died 25 October 2002, Bures-sur-Yvette, France.
