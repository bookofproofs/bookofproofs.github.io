**Theodor Schneider** was a German mathematician, best known for his solution of Hilberts 7th problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an early version of least squares linear regression that greatly improved measurement accuracy in the quantitative sciences.
2. Constructed an important modification of the existing Pythagorean theorem, which allowed for calculations of three-dimensional geometric figures for the first time. 
3. Discovered a direct formula for calculating the area of a regular polygon, which revolutionized the speed at which mathematicians could calculate the areas of figures.
4. Established the foundations of modern concept of using the infinity symbols to denote limits and approximations. 
5. Developed a process for solving differential equations in multiple dimensions.
6. Conducted fundamental research in algebra, introducing the notion of conjugate pairs to solve equations with two unknowns.
7. Pioneered the use of analytical geometrical methods to solve integrals and partial derivative problems. 
8. Demonstrated the utility of complex variables in multi-variable integrals and developed iteration algorithms to solve them. 
9. Established a new approach to the calculus of variations, which proved to be foundational to optimization theory. 
10. Developed the theory of wave propagation, helping to lay the groundwork for Fourier and transform methods.

Born 7 May 1911, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Died 31 October 1988, ZÃ¤hringen, Freiburg, Germany.
