**Kazimierz Urbanik** was a Polish mathematician (born in what is now Ukraine) best known for his work in stochastic processes and probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The Urbanik family set up home in Brzeg.
* Completing his secondary education in Brzeg in 1948 by passing the matura, Urbanik entered the University of Wrocław.
* After graduating Urbanik was employed to teach at the university while he studied for his doctorate with Marczewski as his thesis advisor.
* Urbanik then began to mix an interest in topology with measure theory and probability and his 1954 papers show this mix: Sur un problème de J F Pàl sur les courbes continues Ⓣ(On a J F Pàl problem on continuous curves); Limit properties of homogeneous Markov processes with a denumerable set of states; Sur la structure non-topologique du corps des opérateurs Ⓣ(On the non-topological structure of the body of operators); and Quelques théorèmes sur les measures Ⓣ(Some theorems on measures).
* Urbanik remained at the University of Wrocław and habilitated there in 1957 becoming a dozent.
* In the light of the comments we have already made about Urbanik's research, we need only explain where his interest in the last two of these five areas arose.
* Urbanik published a number of highly significant papers on this topic such as Representation theorem for Marczewski's algebras (1959), A representation theorem for Marczewski's algebra (1960), (with E Marczewski) Abstract algebras in which all elements are independent (1960), and Linear independence in abstract algebras (1966).
* In 1965 Urbanik was elected to the Polish Academy of Sciences, later serving two terms as Vice President.
* Urbanik married Stefania; they had a son Witold and a daughter Jadwiga.

Born 5 February 1930, Krzemieniec, Poland (now Ukraine). Died 29 May 2005, Wrocław, Poland.
