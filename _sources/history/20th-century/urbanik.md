**Kazimierz Urbanik** was a Polish mathematician (born in what is now Ukraine) best known for his work in stochastic processes and probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Urbanik norm, a method of evaluating the uniformity of a probability distribution in 1964.
2. Co-authored multiple papers concerning the foundations of probability theory and stochastic processes.
3. Proposed a new solution for the exchange of integrals.
4. Authored a paper concerning the Konig-Neumark theorem which resulted in important applications in the field of ergodic theory.
5. Solved a problem in the random selection of samples.
6. Established the inversion formula for Laplace Transforms.
7. Proposed generalized Kolmogorov equations, which are generalizations of the Kolmogorov equations.
8. Demonstrated the existence of a maximally stable distribution in Probability Theory.
9. Rediscovered the Weierstrass-Stone theorem and established its applications in Probability Theory.
10. Proposed an extension of the classical concepts of limits, ergodicity, and recurrence.

Born 5 February 1930, Krzemieniec, Poland (now Ukraine). Died 29 May2005, Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.
