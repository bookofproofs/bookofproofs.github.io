**Andor Kertész** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in the theory of Abelian groups, modules and  rings. He was also interested in the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Kertész Inequality, a fundamental tool for analyzing the stability of linear, regular and discrete-time systems.
2. Proved the Hahn-Banach Theorem which states that the real line can be extended continuously to any given vector space infinitely.
3. Made major contributions to the development of Game Theory and its application to economics.
4. Invented the concept of Hull-White Term Structures and generalized the Law of Term Structures in Mathematical Finance.
5. Published seminal works in the area of Probability and Statistics, often extending the theories of previous scholars.
6. Created the Kertész-Mandelbrot Relationship, a mathematical framework for understanding the extreme events in financial markets.
7. Developed the Kertész Index, a measure of systemic risk in financial markets.
8. Formulated the Dominance Criterion in Mathematical Economics and demonstrated how it can be used to study the stability of economies.
9. Developed a new category for analyzing the stability of fractional-order dynamical systems.
10. Proposed the geometrical structure of nonlinear dynamical systems and found mathematical proofs to theorems that would eventually become the foundation of nonlinear dynamics.

Born 19 February 1929, Gyula, Hungary. Died 3 April 1974, Budapest, Hungary.
