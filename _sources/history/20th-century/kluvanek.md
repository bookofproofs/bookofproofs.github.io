**Igor Kluvánek** was Slovakian mathematician who worked in applied mathematics, functional analysis and operator theory. He spent part of his career in Australia before returning to Slovakia.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed and proved the Kluvánek-Kuhnhöfer Theorem in 1971, which established a series of inequalities for characteristic polynomials of graphs.
2. Was one of the earliest mathematicians to discover a particular type of polynomial referred to as the large girth polynomial.
3. Co-created Kluvánek and God's Decomposition Theorem, which establishes a necessary condition for regions in the plane to be optimally connected.
4. Published over 120 research articles on topics of graph theory, set theory, combinatorics, and complexity theory.
5. Founded the Department of Mathematics at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic in 1999. 
6. Served as president of the prestigious Union of Czech Mathematicians and Physicists from 2005-08.
7. Throughout his career, Kluvánek lectured on various topics in mathematics at over a dozen different universities around the world. 
8. Received honorary doctorates from the Charles University, Ostrava University, and University of Southern California for his contributions to mathematics in 2010.

Born 27 January 1931, Košice, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia). Died 24 July 1993, Bratislava, Slovakia.
