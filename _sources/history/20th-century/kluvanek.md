**Igor Kluvánek** was Slovakian mathematician who worked in applied mathematics, functional analysis and operator theory. He spent part of his career in Australia before returning to Slovakia.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Igor's father was F Kluvánek and we should note, because it is relevant to Igor's life and career, that the family were Roman Catholics.
* Igor had a younger brother Pavol who also went on to become a mathematician.
* Igor studied at the gymnasium at Rimavská Sobota.
* Igor married Eva on 11 November 1952; they had five children, one son and four daughters.
* After graduating from the Gymnasium, Kluvánek entered the Slovak Polytechnic University, Bratislava, where he studied for a degree in electrical engineering.
* We should also note that 1953 was the year in which the Slovak Academy of Sciences was set up in Bratislava and Kluvánek began undertaking research for his C.Sc. degree from the Academy.
* By this time Igor was married but Pavol lived with his family in Bratislava.
* And once he invited two brothers Igor and Pavol Kluvánek.
* Pavol stood modestly in a corner and Igor addressed us in his typical manner.
* In 1956 Kluvánek was promoted to the equivalent of a Senior Lecturer at the Slovak Polytechnic University.
* Kluvánek was a practicing Roman Catholic and this was seen as incompatible with his role as a teacher.
* However, although the authorities discriminated against Kluvánek because of his religion, as they did against others in a similar position, the situation was tolerated.
* Pavol Josef Safarik University was founded in Košice in 1959 and, in 1963, Kluvánek was appointed to the Department of Mathematical Analysis at the new University.
* Some of his friends said that if he went to Australia with his family they were sure he would not return to Czechoslovakia but Kluvánek was adamant that he would not stay more than two years in Australia.
* Links with the outside world were severed and the plane carrying Kluvánek's wife and children landed in Zürich and could not continue.
* However, this was far from the end of Kluvánek's problems.
* In 1975, in collaboration with Greg Knowles, Kluvánek published the monograph Vector measures and control systems.
* In 1988 Kluvánek published the monograph Integration structures.
* To illustrate Kluvánek's views on teaching mathematics, let us quote from his paper What is wrong with calculus?
* Kluvánek's wife Eva died in 1981.
* In 1989, with major changes taking place in Czechoslovakia, Kluvánek returned to Košice.
* Some of our politicians also missed that something was happening, but we just were so absorbed with Igor Kluvánek that we didn't see new Europe beginning.
* Kluvánek, as someone who had been persecuted by the Communist regime, became something of a star in the new Czechoslovakia.
* In ordinary conversation, Igor had a great enthusiasm for ideas, discussion and debate, which he often conveyed with a characteristic emphasis, frequently combined with humour.
* Socially, Igor could be charming and entertaining, and show an interest in people's lives and concerns.

Born 27 January 1931, Košice, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia). Died 24 July 1993, Bratislava, Slovakia.
