**Daniel Gorenstein** was an American mathematician best known for his part in the classification of finite simple groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Borel-Gorenstein-Lescot Theorem, used to evaluate the finiteness of certain structural invariants of finite groups.
2. Wrote a book titled Finite Simple Groups: An Introduction to Their Classification, which laid the foundations for the classification of all finite simple groups.
3. Developed a family of simple Lie groups, now known as the Gorenstein-Williamson Lie algebras. 
4. Proved the Jordan-Gorenstein theorem stating that the order of any finite group can be expressed as the product of three prime factors.
5. Discovered the Brauer embedding theorem, which extended a classical theorem of Richard Brauer.
6. Published the groundbreaking paper titled “On Riemann Surfaces and K3 Surfaces”, which applies to a wide range of topics in algebraic geometry.

Born 1 January 1923, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Died 26 August 1992, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, USA.
