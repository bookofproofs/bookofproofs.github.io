**Daniel Gorenstein** was an American mathematician best known for his part in the classification of finite simple groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Gorenstein graduated in 1943 and, to contribute to the war effort, he accepted a teaching position at Harvard to teach mathematics to army personnel.
* After the award of his doctorate in 1950 Gorenstein accepted a post at Clark University in 1951.
* After five years at Northeastern, Gorenstein accepted a professorship at Rutgers University where he remained until his death.
* At Rutgers, Gorenstein was chairman of the Mathematics Department from 1975 until 1981.
* However it was Gorenstein who took an overview of the whole project and steered it to a successful conclusion.
* If Gorenstein was the man with the best overview of this achievement, then surely we can do no better than to quote his own description of events.
* Gorenstein's books on finite groups and the classification of finite simple groups are Finite groups (1968), Finite simple groups : an introduction to their classification (1982), The local structure of finite groups of characteristic 2 type (jointly written with Richard Lyons) (1983) and The classification of the finite simple groups (jointly written with Richard Lyons and Ronald Solomon) (1994).
* Gorenstein received many honours for his work.
* There are three Steele Prizes awarded and Gorenstein received the award for expository mathematical writing at the American Mathematical Society Summer Meeting in Boulder, Colorado, USA.

Born 1 January 1923, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Died 26 August 1992, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, USA.
