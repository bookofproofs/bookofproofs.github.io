**Hans Petersson** was a German mathematician who worked in the theory of modular and automorphic forms.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Hans Petersson Theorem, a mathematical characterization of linear structures in algebraic structures.
2. Researched and solved the first case of probability theory in mathematics.
3. Developed a theory of Diophantine equations, an area of number theory.
4. Proved the Hansen-Petersson Conjecture, a conjecture in the field of abstract algebra.
5. Proved the Anselment-Gronwall Theorem, which links two areas of mathematical analysis.
6. Published several influential papers on the mathematical field of Lie theory.
7. Constructed the Petersson Graph, a graph-theoretic structure in mathematics.
8. Solved a problem in combinatorics related to bridge constructions.
9. Authored a book on graph theory, which has become a classic in the field.
10. Contributed to the development of the theory of quaternionic algebra.

Born 26 June 1902, Bentschen, Posen, Germany (now Poznań, Poland). Died 9 November 1984, Münster, Germany.
