**Beno Eckmann** was a Swiss mathematician who worked in topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the first homology theory of finite-dimensional algebraic solvable groups.
2. Developed the Eckmann–Hilton argument, a fundamental insight into automatic continuity in topological groups.
3. Proved the Eckmann–Hilton duality, which is an important result in abstract algebra.
4. Conducted foundational work on algebraic topology, including contributions to the Borsuk–Ulam theorem.
5. Contributed to the study of singular homology theory and development of the Lefschetz Fixed Point Theorem. 
6. Pioneered two-dimensional homology, a branch of algebraic topology. 
7. Developed an approach to algebraic geometry commonly referred to as Eckmann's lemma. 
8. Authored the book "Beginnings of Homological Algebra" which remains an important source for the study of homological algebra.

Born 31 March 1917, Berne, Switzerland. Died 25 November 2008, Zürich, Switzerland.
