**Beno Eckmann** was a Swiss mathematician who worked in topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Eckmann graduated with his Master's Degree from the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH) in 1939.
* In 1941 Eckmann was awarded his Dr. sc.
* He submitted a thesis which was judge quite outstanding, even relative to the high standards they had, and Eckmann was awarded the Kern Prize and silver medal for his work.
* The most important person to influence Eckmann during his years at the University of Lausanne was Georges de Rham who was an extraordinary professor there when Eckmann arrived and became full professor in 1943.
* While holding the position in Lausanne, Eckmann visited the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
* In 1948 Eckmann, who had already been promoted to Extraordinary Professor at Lausanne, was offered a full Professorship back at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich.
* An important change in Eckmann's duties in Zürich occurred in 1964.
* Eckmann was appointed as Head of the Institute and he held this position until he retired in 1984.
* In April 1977 a Colloquium was held in Zürich to celebrate Eckmann's 60th  birthday.
* Saunders Mac Lane spoke at the Colloquium about Eckmann's contributions to the founding of homological algebra and category theory.
* Peter Hilton, who had been a personal friend of Eckmann's for many years spoke in detail of Eckmann's research in topology: continuous solutions of systems of linear equations, a group-theoretical proof of the Hurwitz-Radon theorem, complexes with operators, spaces with means, simple homotopy type.
* It was not only with Peter Hilton that Eckmann collaborated.
* Finally we should comment on other roles which Eckmann held and honours which he has received.

Born 31 March 1917, Berne, Switzerland. Died 25 November 2008, Zürich, Switzerland.
