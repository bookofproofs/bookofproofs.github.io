**Leslie Fox** was a British mathematician who specialised in numerical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the H-matrix method for numerical computation of partial differential equations in 1952.
2. Conducted pioneering research into special functions, using them to solve boundary value problems.
3. Developed powerful techniques for solving integral equations and elliptic boundary value problems.
4. Proposed a new technique for numerical solution of singular integrals.
5. Authored a pioneering book on numerical analysis, entitled Numerical Solution of Differential Equations.
6. Studied numerical solution of non-linear equations, producing a unified convergence theory.
7. Pioneered the use of floating-point arithmetic in computers.
8. Developed the numerical method of conjugate gradients to solve linear equations.
9. Developed theoretical work on linear programming, allowing a general approach to mathematical optimization.

Born 30 September 1918, Dewsbury, Yorkshire, England. Died 1 August 1992, Oxford, England.
