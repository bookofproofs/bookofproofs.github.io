**Leslie Fox** was a British mathematician who specialised in numerical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Leslie won a scholarship to the Wheelwright Grammar School in Dewsbury where he became interested in mathematics through excellent mathematics teaching at the school.
* At Oxford, Fox was highly successful in his mathematical studies but also took a full part in university life.
* Although working for his DPhil in computational and engineering mathematics, Fox was also engaged in highly secret war work.
* We should note that Fox was undertaking numerical work solving partial differential equations which arose in engineering problems but which could not be solved by analytic techniques.
* However at this time no electronic computers were in use and Fox had to undertake the numerical calculations using a desk calculator.
* Although Fox produced a considerable amount of material which was publishable, the secret nature of his work in a wartime environment meant that most of his early work was either not published, or at least publication was delayed until after the end of the war.
* After the award of his doctorate in 1942 Fox joined the Admiralty Computing service.
* For example the National Physical Laboratory published Fox's The use and construction of mathematical tables  in 1956.
* Fox was keen to establish rapid convergence for the methods used, describing the auxiliary quantities needed in the table in order to carry out the interpolation.
* In 1963 Fox was appointed as Professor of Numerical Analysis at Oxford also being elected to a professorial fellowship at Balliol College.
* Fox published An introduction to numerical linear algebra  in 1964.
* This was not the only book Fox published in 1968 for he also published Computing methods for scientists and engineers  this time collaborating with D F Mayers.
* Another collaboration between Fox and Mayers led to Numerical solution of ordinary differential equations  published in 1987, four years after Fox retired.
* In addition to these outstanding texts, Fox continued to produce top quality research articles.
* We mention that Fox had been divorced from his first wife early in 1973 and had remarried Clemency Mary Holme Clements on 20 July 1973.
* We also note two further aspects of Fox's career.
* Fox's laboratory at Oxford was one of the founding organisations of NAG in 1970 and he strongly encouraged the development of the group, offering considerable resources from his own Computing Laboratory.
* The second aspect we mention is Fox's association with the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications.
* Fox, who had enjoyed trouble free health up to 1981, continued to suffer from heart problems during his retirement.
* An indication of the high regard he was held in by his friends and colleagues is the enthusiastic response to support the creation of a Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis.

Born 30 September 1918, Dewsbury, Yorkshire, England. Died 1 August 1992, Oxford, England.
