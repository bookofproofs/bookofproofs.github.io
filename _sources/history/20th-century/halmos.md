**Paul Halmos** was a Hungarian-American mathematician who made fundamental advances in the areas of logic, probability, statistics, operator theory and functional analysis. He is best known for some of his text-books and for his collection of mathematicians' photographs.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the definition of equivalence of measure preserving transformations, which is an important concept in modern ergodic theory.
2. Produced important foundational work in the field of probability theory, including martingales.
3. Established the foundations of modern functional analysis by creating a framework of concepts related to operator theory.
4. Formulated an exact definition on the notion of invariant subspaces, which helped fuel research on topics related to operator theory.
5. Paved the way for the creation of a theory of von Neumann algebras.
6. Initiated the work that eventually led to the development of the trace class operators in Hilbert spaces.
7. Pioneered advances in the study of Boolean algebras, a foundational area of mathematics.
8. Published extensively and made revolutionary contributions to the fields of algebra, number theory and the history and philosophy of mathematics.
9. Won numerous awards and honors, including the National Medal of Science, the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and the prestigious Steele Prize.

Born 3 March 1916, Budapest, Hungary. Died 2 October 2006, Los Gatos, California, USA.
