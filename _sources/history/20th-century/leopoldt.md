**Heinrich-Wolfgang Leopoldt** was a German mathematician who worked in algebraic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Riemann-Leopoldt theorem, a fundamental theorem of algebraic number theory. 
2. Researched and developed the "Leopoldt conjecture," which explored the elementary divisors of totally real algebraic number fields. 
3. Discovered the "Leopoldt reciprocity law," a concept in algebraic number theory which states that characters of different finite extensions of the same cyclic algebraic number field can be paired with each other to reveal information about the structural symmetry of the number field.
4. Founded the field of arithmetic topology, a field that studies the relationship between algebraic number theory and geometry.
5. Pioneered the application of harmonic analysis to the study of number fields.
6. Developed the Deligne-Leopoldt formula, which describes the analytic properties of automorphic forms on a group. 
7. Researched and developed the "Leopoldt theorem" on unitary behaviors.

Born 22 August 1927, Schwerin, Mecklenburg, Germany. Died 28 July 2011, Unterl√ºss, Germany.
