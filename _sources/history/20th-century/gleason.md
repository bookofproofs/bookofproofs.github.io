**Andrew Gleason** was an American mathematician who made contributions to many areas of mathematics, including the solution of Hilbert's fifth problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Andrew attended the Berkeley, California, High School then later was a student at the Roosevelt High School in Yonkers, New York.
* Graduating from Yale in 1942 Gleason joined the US Navy as a code breaker.
* Gleason was steadily promoted at Harvard, becoming a full professor in 1957.
* Jean Gleason became Professor of Psychology at Boston University.
* Gleason retired in 1992.
* Andy Gleason is that rare individual who has done all of these superbly.
* Then, in 1952, Gleason's paper Groups without small subgroups  taken together with the results of Montgomery and Zippin, and Yamabe, gave a complete solution to Hilbert's problem.
* Gleason won the Newcomb Cleveland Prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science for his contribution to the solution of the problem.
* Gleason was also interested in combinatorial and finite mathematics.
* In 1966 Gleason published Fundamentals of abstract analysis.
* In 1980 Gleason, together with R E Greenwood and L M Kelly, published The William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition  which gave all the problems and their solutions from the beginning of the competition in 1938 up to 1964.
* Gleason has received many honours for his outstanding contributions to teaching, research, and mathematics in general.
* Gleason died from complications following surgery at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Born 4 November 1921, Fresno, California, USA. Died 17 October 2008, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
