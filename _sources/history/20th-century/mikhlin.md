**Solomon Grigoryevich Mikhlin** was a Belarussian mathematician of who worked in the fields of linear elasticity, singular integrals and numerical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the concept of non-regularity of linear equations, also known as the Mikhlin Theorem.
2. Published the influential book, Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, which established the framework of the current quantum theory.
3. Pioneered the development of the theory of pseudo-differential operators and its applications.
4. Developed the theory of elliptic partial differential equations, including the reversion of Cauchy-Kovalevski theorem.
5. Studied methods for solving non-linear equations and systems of equations.
6. Invented numerical methods for solving differential equations based on finite differences.
7. Established the Mikhlin multiplier theorem and the Mikhlin-Sobolev space theory.
8. Published several books on numerical analysis and approximate computation, in addition to research papers.
9. Led and organized numerous large teams of mathematicians to solve problems and conduct research in applied mathematics.

Born 23 April 1908, Kholmech, Belarus. Died 29 August 1990, St Petersburg, Russia.
