**Władysław Orlicz** was a Polish mathematician who worked in functional analysis and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the notion of a Young function, laying the groundwork for Orlicz spaces which are now used in Functional Analysis.
2. Developed the field of functional equations and inequalities with his 1933 paper “Über unendliche lineare Funktionalgleichungen.”
3. Established the subfield of discriminants of polynomials, the theory of which he extended with the Dual Lemma and Dual Theorem.
4. Constructed Orlicz's theorem which is a generalization of the discrete Hardy's inequaltiy.
5. Discovered the omega-cell lemma, a tool for finding the greatest common divisor of algebraic polynomials.
6. Wrote one of the first texts on non-Euclidean geometry, extending the field to multiple dimensions.
7. Developed the field of Banach space theory and proved the existence of sets of measurable functions that are not absolutely continuous.
8. Found a general solution to the Goursat problem using a combination of linear and non-linear differential equations.

Born 24 May1903, Okocim, Galicia, Austria-Hungary (now Poland). Died 9 August 1990, Poznań, Poland.
