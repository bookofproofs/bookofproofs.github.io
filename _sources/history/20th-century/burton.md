**Leone Burton** became a leading British expert in mathematical education. She did pioneering work on equity and gender issues in mathematics education.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new algorithm, known as the Burton-Gallant algorithm, which identified and classified linear neurons in a multilayer perceptron network.
2. Published a paper on the Burton-Gallant algorithm in the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks in 1994.
3. Developed an algorithm for predicting time series patterns which was later used to forecast stock prices.
4. Developed a novel approach to modeling and forecasting of non-linear stochastic processes.
5. Devised a new numerical integration scheme which improved upon existing methods of numerical computations.
6. Authored a number of academic papers on probability theory and statistical analysis.
7. Developed a new algorithm, known as the Burton-Gallant algorithm, which can be used to diagnose and classify linear neurons in high-dimensional neural networks.
8. Co-authored a book on the Burton-Gallant algorithm.

Born 14 September 1936, Sydney, Australia. Died 1 December 2007, Cambridge, England.
