**Mary Cartwright** was the first woman mathematician to be elected to the Royal Society. She became Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
Mary Cartwright was an English mathematician most famous for her work in the field of analysis. She made significant contributions to analysis, particularly in the fields of differential equations, Fourier analysis, and number theory.

1. She proved a theorem on the boundedness of solutions of ordinary differential equations which is now known as Cartwright's theorem. 
2. She was the first to provide a rigorous proof that the Fourier series could be used to solve certain classes of differential equations and to expand functions of several variables in a trigonometric series. 
3. She made substantial progress in solving the problems of prime number distribution and introduced the first effective methods for estimating the magnitudes of Riemann zeta-functions.
4. She was one of the first scientists to lay a strong emphasis on the importance of numerical experiments in pure mathematics. 
5. Her achievements led to her being the first woman to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1945.

Born 17 December 1900, Aynho, Northamptonshire, England. Died 3 April 1998, Cambridge, England.
