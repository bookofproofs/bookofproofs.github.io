**Abraham Robinson** was a Polish-born mathematician best known for the development of non-standard analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Abraham Robinson senior was also a highly talented man.
* Hedwig Robinson was a teacher and she brought up her two sons in Germany until 1933 when Abraham was fourteen years old.
* Hedwig, Abraham and Saul Robinson avoided the problems that Jews would have in Germany from 1933 by starting a new life in Palestine.
* There Robinson completed his schooling and, in 1935, began studying mathematics under Fraenkel and Levitzki at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
* Robinson was a brilliant student and, after graduating in 1939, he was awarded a scholarship to allow him to study at the Sorbonne in Paris.
* As an undergraduate at the Hebrew University Robinson has been interested in both algebra and mathematical logic.
* By now Robinson was a world leading authority in aerodynamics yet he continued with his interest in mathematical logic.
* A collection of papers Model theory and algebra was published in 1975 as a memorial tribute to Robinson.
* For Robinson was more than an excellent mathematician.
* Robinson was a leading expert in remarkably different areas of mathematics.
* Only one of his books deals with applied mathematics but it may surprise mathematicians who think of Robinson only as a mathematical logician to realise that almost half his papers are on applied mathematics, particularly on aerodynamics.
* Robinson is best known, however, for his work on mathematical logic.
* Robinson's contributions to model theory were developed during his time at the University of Toronto.
* Robinson's most famous invention was non-standard analysis which he introduced in 1961.
* In 1966 Robinson published his famous text Non-standard analysis.
* We end this biography by giving some comments on Robinson's personality.

Born 6 October 1918, Waldenburg, Germany (now Wa≈Çbrzych, Poland). Died 11 April 1974, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.
