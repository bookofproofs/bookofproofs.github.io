**Abraham Robinson** was a Polish-born mathematician best known for the development of non-standard analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the technique of non-standard analysis to solve mathematical problems that were previously not considered possible to solve using traditional methods.
2. Provided the basis for modern model theory, laying the foundations for fields such as mathematical logic and abstract algebra.
3. Published the book on the Model Theory of algebra in 1965, in which he outlined his contributions to the field.
4. Developed the concept of infinitesimals and was the first mathematician to extend calculus to include a full range of infinities.
5. Pioneered the development of syntactic proofs, providing an alternative to proof by contradiction.
6. Devised the technique of abstraction, allowing mathematicians to model any given situation as a formal system, in order to aid with the analysis.
7. Collaborated with Yehoshua Bar-Hillel to extend the theory of models to include decidability and completeness.
8. Established the concept of hyper-primitive recursive functions, a tool used for constructing functions in a recursive manner.
9. Proved the completeness of first-order predicate logic, which was a major advance in the field of logic and mathematics.

Born 6 October 1918, Waldenburg, Germany (now Wa≈Çbrzych, Poland). Died 11 April 1974, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.
