**Georgia Benkart** was an outstanding mathematician who received many honours for her research on Lie algebras and related topics. She served the American Mathematical Society and the Association for Women in Mathematics in severable roles (she was President of the AWM) and was an inaugural fellow of each.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Georgia Benkart made significant advances in Lie theory and representation theory of Lie algebras and is the originator of the “string model” in Lie theory.
2. She is a prominent figure in algebraic combinatorics, having worked in particular on representations of symmetric groups and Schur algebras.
3. She has contributed to the study of algebras, automorphisms, and polynomials in several variables.
4. Georgia Benkart was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994 in Zurich.
5. She served as the managing editor of the Journal of Algebra from 1987 to 1991, and as an editor of the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society from 1997 to 2003.
6. Georgia Benkart received the AMS Moore Award in 2012 for her innovative work in Lie theory and algebraic combinatorics.
7. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2013. 
8. Benkart was the 2019 recipient of the Ruth Lyttle Satter Award in Mathematics from the American Mathematical Society.

Born 30 December 1947, Youngstown, Ohio, USA. Died 29 April 2022, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.
