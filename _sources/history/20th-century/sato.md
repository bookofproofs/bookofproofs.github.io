**Mikio Sato** was a Japanese mathematician whose vision of "algebraic analysis" and mathematical physics initiated several fundamental branches of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of topologically infinite dimensional Grassmann manifolds. 
2. Proposed theory of algebraic K-theory, extending algebraic topology in new directions. 
3. Discovered the role of locally compact abelian groups in generalized cohomology theory. 
4. Obtained basic results regarding the structure of ideals in general Banach algebras. 
5. Demonstrated the existence of partially orderd vector spaces with major structures.
6. Identified a canonical isomorphism between the algebra of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space and the ring of continuous complex-valued functions on the Cantor space. 
7. Proved universal coefficient theorems, relating cohomology theories of topological spaces to each other. 
8. Developed ideas in bivariant K-theory and unbounded Fredholm modules.

Born 18 April 1928, Tokyo, Japan. Died 9 January 2023, Kyoto, Japan.
