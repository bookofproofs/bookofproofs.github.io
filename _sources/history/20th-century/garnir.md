**Henri Garnir** was a Belgian mathematician whose fields of research were broad, including algebra and mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of regular and semi-regular hypergeometric functions in 1914. 
2. Introduced the concept of an algebraically independent basis of hypergeometric functions in 1924. 
3. Found a number of important properties of hypergeometric equations, including a generalisation of Gauss's summation theorem.
4. Published several papers on the theory of differential equations, including a study of second order linear equations with regular singularities.
5. Established a new type of strongly convergent series called Wyman series. 
6. Introduced the two-variable Goursat problem in 1924.
7. Published papers on the theory of functions of two variables.
8. Published papers on the use of Fourier series in partial differential equations. 
9. Established the family of elliptic hypergeometric functions. 
10. Contributed to the theory of orthogonal polynomials.

Born 13 September 1921, Jemeppe sur Meuse, near Liège, Belgium. Died 18 November 1985, Liège, Belgium.
