**Henri Garnir** was a Belgian mathematician whose fields of research were broad, including algebra and mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was in Seraing that Garnir attended high school.
* Garnir obtained his bachelor's degree in physical science in 1943 and a bachelor's degree in mathematical science in the following year.
* Florent J Bureau supervised Garnir's studies for this mathematics degree and he continued to supervise Garnir's doctoral studies, most of which were carried out after Belgium had been freed by the Allies.
* Garnir published a number of papers relating to his research during this period.
* In 1946 Garnir published four articles: Sur la détermination des matrices satisfaisant à un système de relations de la théorie du méson Ⓣ(On the determination of matrices satisfying a system of relations in the theory of mesons); (with J Toussaint) Sur la théorie des valences dirigées Ⓣ(On the theory of directed valences); and the two-part article Une question de théorie des groupes et son application à un problème de vibrations posé par la chimie théorique Ⓣ(Group theory and its application to a vibration problem posed by theoretical chemistry).
* In 1948 Garnir married Noëlly Pierre who was a school teacher; they had two children, Dominique (who became a medical doctor) and Henri-Pierre (who became a university lecturer in physics).
* In year following his marriage, Garnir spent four months undertaking research in Paris.
* Garnir was made Chef de travaux at Liège in 1950.
* As the above quote indicates, Garnir's research interests did not remain in the area of applications of group theory.
* Garnir's research in this area had been strongly influenced by his visit to Laurent Schwartz in Paris.
* In the later part of his career, Garnir became interested in the propagation of singularities of solutions of boundary value problems for evolution partial differential equations.
* Mention of the later part of Garnir's career means that we should indicate how his career developed at the University of Liège.
* With M De Wilde and J Schmets, Garnir published the three-volume text Analyse fonctionnelle Ⓣ(Functional Analysis).
* Essentially, Garnir was a man whose charisma, stability and true goodness were immensely beneficial to all who had the luck to have known him.
* Garnir was in good health and in the middle of many mathematical projects when he was struck by a heart attack from which he died.

Born 13 September 1921, Jemeppe sur Meuse, near Liège, Belgium. Died 18 November 1985, Liège, Belgium.
