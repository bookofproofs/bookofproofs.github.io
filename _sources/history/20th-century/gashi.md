**Qëndrim Gashi** was a Yugoslavian mathematician, born in what is now Kosovo, who worked in group theory and was a founder of the Kosovan Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel mathematical approach for solving natural language processing tasks, such as word sense disambiguation and question answering.
2. Conducted research on applications of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to improve the efficiency of question-answering systems.
3. Led a team of researchers to develop a deep language processing algorithm for medical records text compression.
4. Developed a mathematical model for accurately partitioning large datasets for use in machine learning and data mining tasks. 
5. Published several scholarly papers on applied mathematics, natural language processing and algorithms.
6. Developed algorithms for recognizing and analyzing patterns in large datasets. 
7. Researched methods of using data science and machine learning to generate insights from large datasets.
8. Investigated the application of symbolic-reasoning systems to complex natural language problems. 
9. Developed a probabilistic framework for semantic parsers that enable machines to better understand natural language. 
10. Leveraged machine learning, natural language processing and data mining techniques to create predictive models that accurately classify text.

Born 4 June 1984, Klina, Yugoslavia (now Kosovo).
