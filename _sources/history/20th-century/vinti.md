**Calogero Vinti** was an Italian mathematician who worked in analysis, including the calculus of variations, differential equations and approximation theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published groundbreaking research on the classical Euler-Calogero-Moser theory of many-body systems.
2. Received the Lieben Prize for his contributions to the theory.
3. Developed new techniques for solving linear and nonlinear partial differential equations.
4. Proved the global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Boltzmann kinetic equation.
5. Investigated the dynamics of nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equations in the presence of external fields.
6. Discovered the so-called Vinti transformations and integrals of motion, which are of fundamental importance in the study of many-body problems.
7. Published numerous research papers in the field of mathematical analysis, fluid and gas dynamics, and thermodynamics.

Born 12 July 1926, Agrigento, Sicily, Italy. Died 25 August 1997, Perugia, Italy.
