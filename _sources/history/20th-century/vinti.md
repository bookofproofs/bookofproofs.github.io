**Calogero Vinti** was an Italian mathematician who worked in analysis, including the calculus of variations, differential equations and approximation theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* An important influence in Calogero's early education was an uncle who was a canon in the Cathedral San Gerlando in Agrigento.
* In 1949 Vinti graduated from Palermo with his Laurea.
* The next two publications by Vinti, Una ripartizione del continuo ed una osservazione sulle funzioni continue rispetto ad una e non misurabili rispetto ad un'altra variabile Ⓣ(A division of continuous and an observation on continuous functions with respect to a measurable and not compared to another variable) (1957) and L'integrale di Weierstrass Ⓣ(The integral of Weierstrass) (1957) were single-authored but still greatly influenced by Baiada.
* Vinti, who continued to work in Palermo, was very active in research over the next few years becoming a lecturer in analysis in 1960.
* He was keen for Vinti to join him and, in 1962, Vinti joined the faculty at the University of Modena.
* One of the important developments that Vinti undertook at Perugia was founding the Faculty of Engineering.
* Vinti was married to Marisa whom he first met when they were both students checking their examination results in Rome.
* In addition to writing papers, Vinti also wrote some textbooks on mathematical analysis.
* Let us now quote from some of the references to get a feeling for Vinti's character.
* Vinti received many honours for his mathematical contributions.
* For example, his 70th  birthday was marked by the 'Conferenze in Onore di Calogero Vinti' at the University of Perugia in September 1996.
* After his death, the Italian Mathematical Union set up the "Calogero Vinti Prize" in 1998 to be awarded to a young mathematician who had made significant contributions to one of the fields in which Vinti had worked.

Born 12 July 1926, Agrigento, Sicily, Italy. Died 25 August 1997, Perugia, Italy.
