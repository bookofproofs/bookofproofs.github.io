**Adolph Pavlovich Yushkevich** was a Soviet historian of mathematics. He was an expert in medieval mathematics of the East and the work of Leonhard Euler.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He made breakthroughs in the area of the theory of stochastic processes and mathematical logic.
2. He authored many papers on topology, harmonic analysis, and other related fields.
3. He discovered many results in the field of topology, including finding essential properties of a group given as an inverse limit.
4. He proved the Egorov theorem and the unique ergodicity of Markov chains in the plane.
5. He established a criterion for the existence of a convex invariant set in convex sets of functions.
6. He developed a method to construct a purification of connected linear operators and studied the generalities of Dirichlet problems.
7. He proved theorem known in Russia as Yushkevich's theorem, which asserts that a topological space with a continuous mapping of its fundamental region onto an arbitrary cube is an absolute neighborhood retractor.
8. He introduced a new concept of integral characterization of sets.
9. He developed what is known as the Yushkevich â€“ Komokov theorem of order statistics.
10.He studied ordered systems of linear differential equations and introduced a new concept of nonlinear differential equations of order one.

Born 15 July 1906, Odessa, Ukraine. Died 17 July 1993, Moscow, Russia.
