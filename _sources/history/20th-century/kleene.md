**Stephen C Kleene** was an American mathematician and logician best known his work on recursion theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of regular sets and accomplished significant accomplishments with the idea of recursive functions.
2. Established the foundations of the contemporary theory of computation and algorithmic complexity.
3. Formulated Kleene's theorem, which unified and simplified previous work on the algebraic structures of logic.
4. Awarded the National Medal of Science in 1975 and the Turing Award in 1974 for his contributions to the foundations of theoretical computer science.
5. Pioneered research on the analysis of mathematical notation, mechanisms of mathematical reasoning and the psychological aspects of mathematics.
6. Established the equivalence of Alan Turing's notion of a computable number with the lambda-definable numbers of Alonzo Church.
7. Investigated the existence of algorithms for determining proofs for certain trades in predicate calculus.
8. Introduced the idea of reflexive proteins, a concept that was foundational in the development of modern computer architecture.

Born 5 January 1909, Hartford, Connecticut, USA. Died 25 January 1994, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.
