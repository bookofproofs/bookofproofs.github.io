**Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin** was a French mathematician who worked in fluid mechanics and abstract algebra. She was the second woman in France to obtain a doctorate in pure mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Marie-Louise took the baccalaureate in elementary mathematics and at this stage encountered a particularly good piece of luck.
* Often one piece of good fortune is balanced by bad fortune and in the case of Marie-Louise's study at the Collège de Chaptal this was exactly what happened.
* But the decree of the ministry published afterwards in the official journal named twenty male students at the top and then Marie-Louise at the head of the Bousiers de licence.
* Paul Dubreil, whom Marie-Louise had met while they both studied at the École Normale Supérieure, had been awarded a Rockefeller scholarship in 1929 and at the time of their marriage was on a European tour which would let him study with the top mathematicians in Germany and Italy.
* At the start of the new academic year 1931-32 Paul Dubreil took up an appointment at the University of Lille and Marie-Louise continued to work on her thesis on fluids but began to take an interest in algebra.
* Dubreil-Jacotin's interests in algebra had now reached the point where she offered it as a subsidiary subject at her oral.
* Dubreil-Jacotin, therefore, accepted a position of research assistant at Rennes.
* Two years later Dubreil-Jacotin was appointed as an assistant lecturer at Rennes.
* Remember too that these were the years of the Second World War which began around the time that Dubreil-Jacotin became an assistant lecturer in Rennes.
* The train that Marie-Louise took each Tuesday was destroyed by a bloody bombing of the Rennes railway station.
* Marie-Louise accepted the risks calmly as part of her job.
* In her memory the Ile de France Yacht Club founded a "Challenge Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin" judged on two contests: a regatta and a bridge tournament.
* Two years later Dubreil-Jacotin was involved in a car accident which did not seem too serious at the time but she died of a heart attack five weeks later.

Born 7 July 1905, Paris, France. Died 19 October 1972, Paris, France.
