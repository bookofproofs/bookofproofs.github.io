**Anatoly Mykhailovych Samoilenko** was a Ukrainian mathematician who worked on linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Samoilenko-Vishik theory on oscillatory processes and linear equations with deviating arguments.
2. Found a general theory of nonselfadjoint linear equations with deviating arguments.
3. Researched the existence of oscillatory solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations.
4. Investigated the existence of solutions to the inverse problem of dynamics.
5. Developed a theory of stability and instability of solutions of differential equations.
6. Proved the existence and behavior of an continuous soliton representation in weakly dispersive media.
7. Provided insights into the dynamics of nonlinear systems with internal and external sources.
8. Identified a continuous spectrum of data processing equation with periodic solutions.
9. Established a unique solution theorem in the theory of linear differential equations with deviating arguments.
10. Constructed a homological theory of partial differential equations and generalized nonselfadjoint linear equations.

Born 2 January 1938, Potiivka, Radomyshl, Zhytomyr oblast, Ukraine. Died 4 December 2020, Kyiv, Ukraine.
