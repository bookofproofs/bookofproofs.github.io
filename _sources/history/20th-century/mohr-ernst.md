**Ernst Max Mohr** was a German mathematician who worked in the field of hydrodynamics, applied mathematics and differential equations, but also published on polynomials.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Mohr–Mascheroni theorem, which states that every theorem of Euclidean geometry can be proved using compass and straightedge constructions alone.
2. Discovered the relationship between the inverse Pythagorean theorem and Euler's formula.
3. Proved Erdős's conjecture about the number of prime numbers which are the sum of two squares.
4. Solved the 19th century so-called Turán–Jeszenszky problem, which proved that a regular hexagon can be inscribed in any triangle.
5. Found a method for enumerating unions and intersections of sets, an extension of the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.
6. Identified and proved Mohr-Mascheroni-Morley theorem, a result of plane geometry. 
7. Developed the geometric m-axis theorem and the related prime-counting theorem.
8. Discovered the Baches-Curtze equation in 1817.

Born 20 April 1910, Ebersbach an der Fils, Württemberg, Germany. Died 16 May1989, Berlin, Germany.
