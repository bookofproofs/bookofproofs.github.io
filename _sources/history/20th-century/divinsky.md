**Nathan Divinsky** was a Canadian algebraist who was also enthusiastic about chess.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Divinsky won the Manitoba Chess Championship in 1946 and was awarded an M.S. from Chicago in 1947 after submitting a thesis Burnside's problem.
* Albert, like Divinsky, had Russian parents, and was one of the leading experts on algebras.
* It is not surprising, therefore, that Divinsky would write a thesis on algebras: he submitted his thesis Power-Associativity and Crossed Extension Algebras to the University of Chicago and was awarded his Ph.D. in 1950.
* In 1959 Divinsky took over the magazine Canadian Chess Chat.
* During the 1950s and 1960s Divinsky published papers on ring theory.
* Divinsky was still playing chess at the highest level at this time and represented Canada in the 1966 Chess Olympiad in Havana.
* One friend, Fritz Bowers, says of Divinsky, "Tuzie's very reactionary and elitist.
* If they want to do that, let them do that but to finance it and to spend the limited energy you have on some idiot Divinsky to get into grade 7 instead of quitting at grade 6 instead of doing something for a kid who has enormous talent and can contribute something to the world ...
* After returning to Canada in 1973, Divinsky then spent a year in Oregon.
* In 1979, in partnership with three others, Divinsky began the reconstruction of the Arrow Transfer warehouse on Granville Island, Vancouver, as the Bridges Restaurant.
* In that same year Divinsky left the Vancouver School Board, which he had served on since 1974 having chairman from 1978 to 1980.
* Although Divinsky continued to publish the occasional mathematics paper during the 1970s and 1980s, he began to apply mathematical techniques to a study of the strength of various chess champions.
* Before this book was published, however, Divinsky had become a celebrity on British television.
* In the early 1980s, Divinsky visited the University of St Andrews, Scotland, and addressed our Pure Mathematics Seminar.
* Divinsky, however, seemed to have frequent contact with Fischer and described his mental state in detail.
