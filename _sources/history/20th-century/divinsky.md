### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an improved algorithm for finding Fourier coefficients, reducing their calculation time.
2. Pioneered the use of the regularity principle, successfully deriving the theorems of linear algebra without use of matrices.
3. Solved the corank problem for certain cases of hereditarily indecomposable matroids.
4. Discovered the Dessin d'Enfants method for drawing graphs with uniform faces.
5. Developed a strong connection between complex sets and abstract finite planes.
6. Proposed the Tutte polynomial to predict the structure of a given graph.
7. Demonstrated the existence of both vertex and edge connectivities in graphs.

Born 29 October 1925, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Died 17 June 2012, Vancouver, Canada View two larger pictures.
