**Errett Bishop** was an American mathematician who worked in analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He died in 1933 when his son Errett was five years old.
* Despite dying before he could personally influence Errett towards mathematics, in fact he did have a very substantial influence since when Errett was a young boy he began to study the mathematics the textbooks which had belonged to his father.
* The family remained in the same family home in Newton after Albert's death and his books remained to excite young Errett.
* It is clear that Errett was a child prodigy but it was remarkable that he had a sister, Mary, who was two years younger than he was an was also a mathematical prodigy.
* Errett did not find High School at all challenging and when he was sixteen, wanting to progress with his education in a way that was not happening at school, he applied and was accepted for a special scholarship program at the University of Chicago.
* Starting his university studies in 1944, Bishop graduated with a B.S. from Chicago in 1947 and continued to study for his Master's degree which was awarded in 1947.
* Bishop was joined in Chicago by his younger sister Mary who, as he had been, was accepted for the special scholarship program at the University of Chicago.
* Bishop had been taught by Paul Halmos when he was studying for his B.S. and it was Halmos who supervised his doctoral studies.
* However Bishop spent 1950-52 in the U.S. army.
* After completing his basic army training Bishop was sent to undertake mathematical research at the National Bureau of Standards.
* Returning to Chicago in 1952 Bishop submitted his doctoral thesis Spectral Theory for Operations on Banach Spaces in 1954.
* Having submitted his thesis, Bishop was appointed as an instructor in mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley.
* Bishop's work is so wide ranging that it is difficult to give an overview in a biography such as this.
* Let us look at the book Selected papers which was published in 1986 and reprints some of Bishop's most significant contributions.
* Here Bishop worked on uniform algebras (commutative Banach algebras with unit whose norms are the spectral norms) proving results such as antisymmetric decomposition of a uniform algebra, the Bishop-DeLeeuw theorem, and the proof of existence of Jensen measures.
* In 1965 Bishop wrote an excellent survey Uniform algebras examining the interaction between the theory of uniform algebras and that of several complex variables.
* An examples of a paper by Bishop on this topic is Spectral theory for operators on a Banach space (1957).
* He introduced the condition now called the Bishop condition which turned out to be very useful in the theory of decomposable operators.
* Examples of Bishop's papers in this area are Analyticity in certain Banach spaces (1962).
* Bishop become interested in foundational issues around 1964, about the time he was at the Miller Institute.
* Many other areas of mathematics were given the constructive treatment by Bishop.
* In the following year Bishop published Schizophrenia in contemporary mathematics which gave his principles of constructivism.

Born 24 July 1928, Newton, Kansas, USA. Died 14 April 1983, San Diego, California, USA.
