**Errett Bishop** was an American mathematician who worked in analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of what is now known as Bishop-style constructive analysis, which proved important for developing intuition and understanding of mathematical objects that was often missed in the then-traditional way of teaching math. 
2. Authored the well-regarded book, Foundations of Constructive Analysis, which introduced Bishop-style analysis to a wide audience of mathematicians. 
3. Authored several other influential works such as the monograph Set Theory: An Introduction to Large Cardinals.
4. Established the Set Theoretic Workshop at the University of California, Berkeley, which attracted many leading mathematicians and provided an important forum for the exploration of set theory.
5. Developed the notion of strongly inessential maps which led to the resolution of several long-standing questions in topology.

Born 24 July 1928, Newton, Kansas, USA. Died 14 April 1983, San Diego, California, USA.
