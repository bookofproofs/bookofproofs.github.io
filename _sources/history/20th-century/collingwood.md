**Edward Collingwood** was an English mathematician who worked in complex analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Colonel Collingwood had a career in the army, commanding the Lancashire Fusiliers in the battle of Omdurman in September 1898.
* Colonel Collingwood retired from the army in 1899, the year before his son Edward was born on the family estate of Lilburn Tower.
* We should note that Edward's mother Dorothy came from a well off family, and the name "Foyle" is the name of their family estate.
* Collingwood was educated at the Royal Naval College Osborne, which he entered in 1913, moving to Dartmouth in the following year.
* He joined the Navy and became a midshipman in 1915 on the ship HMS Collingwood.
* This ship was named after Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood who was Nelson's second in command at the battle of Trafalgar.
* Vice-Admiral Collingwood was the brother of Edward Collingwood's great-grandfather, and it was no coincidence that Collingwood served on HMS Collingwood for special arrangements had been made for this to happen.
* However Collingwood's naval career came to an end when he fell down a hatchway on board ship, broke his wrist and damaged his knee, just before the Battle of Jutland.
* Collingwood was influenced by his advisor of studies, Hardy at Cambridge and decided early on that he would undertake research in mathematics.
* Although there were many others in Collingwood's year at Cambridge like Burkill, Ingham and Newman, he seems to have had little contact with them.
* In 1922 Collingwood went to Aberystwyth at the invitation of W H Young.
* In 1937 Collingwood left Cambridge and became High Sheriff of Northumberland.
* Collingwood became involved with hospital boards in Newcastle, being a founder member of the Newcastle Regional Hospital Board and its chairmen from 1953 to 1968, then later he was involved with medical affairs on a national and international level.
* Despite these numerous activities Collingwood still found time for various hobbies.
* As with all his activities Collingwood made a deep study of his hobbies and became a recognised expert on Chinese porcelain.

Born 17 January 1900, Alnwick, Northumberland, England. Died 25 October 1970, Alnwick, Northumberland, England.
