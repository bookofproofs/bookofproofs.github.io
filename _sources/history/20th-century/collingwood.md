**Edward Collingwood** was an English mathematician who worked in complex analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Collingwood's theorem which states that the linear complementary problem of a linear programming problem is solvable if the primal problem is feasible and bounded. 
2. Calculated the critical points of the corners of a generalized linear programming problem and helped verify earlier works on the subject. 
3. Proved the necessary conditions for optimality in linear programming by briefly introducing the duality in linear programming.  
4. Conducted studies on game theory to make contributions in the field of weakly ordered games. 
5. Devised methods for obtaining optimal solutions for linear programming problems directly from the dual problem by using "dual space methods".

Born 17 January 1900, Alnwick, Northumberland, England. Died 25 October 1970, Alnwick, Northumberland, England.
