**Wolfgang Pauli** won a Nobel prize for his work on quantum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the exclusion principle, which lies at the heart of quantum mechanics and explains the characteristic properties of atoms.
2. Derived the Thomas-Fermi theory that is used to predict the physical properties of atoms.
3. Proposed the Pauli exclusion principle, which governs the behaviour of elementary particles.
4. Proposed the Pauli-Villars regularization, a regularization method for divergent integrals in quantum field theory.
5. Put forward the Pauli-Lubanski vector, a mathematical tool for describing the motion of a single particle in quantum mechanics.
6. Co-discovered the spin-statistics theorem, which explains the relationship between the spin of particles and their quantum statistics.
7. Co-derived the nuclear shell model, which explains the structure of atomic nuclei.

Born 25 April 1900, Vienna, Austria. Died 15 December 1958, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.
