**Jack Kiefer** was an American mathematical statistician who worked in the optimal design of experiments and other topics in mathematical statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After a break of three years he returned to MIT in the spring of 1946 but it was not clear at this stage in which area Kiefer wanted to make a career.
* The theatre was one of Kiefer's passions and he had the opportunity at MIT to become involved in writing, directing and producing plays.
* By the way, Jack was really torn between show biz and statistics.
* After graduating Kiefer attended a summer school at Berkeley where courses of lectures were given by Michel Lo√®ve and Abraham Wald.
* Kiefer moved to Cornell as an instructor in the Department of Mathematics and continued working for his doctorate with Wolfowitz.
* After Kiefer was awarded his doctorate in 1952 he was promoted at Cornell from an instructor to as assistant professor.
* Jack aspired at one time to become a proficient pianist.
* In July 1973 Kiefer was elected the first Horace White Professor at Cornell University, a position he held until 1979 when he retired and joined the faculty at the University of California at Berkeley.
* Kiefer's main research area was the optimal design of experiments, and about half his 100 publications dealt with that topic.
* A paper Sequential minimax search for a maximum which Kiefer published in the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society in 1953 was based on his master's thesis.
* Let us note a few other examples of Kiefer's work.
* In this paper Kiefer generalised the notions of a balanced incomplete block design and a Youden square, to the balanced block design and generalized Youden square.
* Another important paper Optimum designs in regression problems, which Kiefer wrote in collaboration with Wolfowitz, appeared in 1959.
* In 1980 Kiefer went to China as part of Berkeley's China Exchange Program.
* Kiefer received many honours.
* Jack was unbelievably humble, especially for a man of his stature.
* Jack was very critical.
* Kiefer's suffered for many years from an arthritic hip condition which by 1971 saw him severely disabled.
* Jack's friends at Cornell felt similarly.
* In 1987, six years after his death, Kiefer's Introduction to statistical inference was published.

Born 25, Jan 1924, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Died 10, Aug 1981, Berkeley, California, USA.
