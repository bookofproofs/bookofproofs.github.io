**Karl Menger** was an Austrian-American mathematician who worked on algebras, geometries, curve and dimension theory. He also contributed to game theory and social sciences.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1) Karl Menger provided foundational contributions to the field of mathematics, especially in the area of set theory, topology, and geometry.
2) He was most renowned for his groundbreaking work on the theory of Kakutaniâ€“Menger spaces and geometries, introducing the concept of a Menger Measure and the notion of Menger distance.
3) Menger introduced the notion of a metric space and its associated Basic Operators, which have since become a central part of modern study of mathematics.
4) He developed the notions of mathematical logic, topological completeness and dimensionality, leading to the development of the Menger-Nash theorem.
5) Karl Menger provided foundational contributions to the field of functional analysis, as well as the notion of open sets and a path-integral approach to calculus.
6) He also proved the now-famous Menger's Theorem, which stated that every planar graph can be embedded in the plane without crossing edges, and the Karnofsky-Menger theorem, which states that a graph is planar if it has an embedding in which all of its crossings involve at least four vertices.

Born 13 January 1902, Vienna, Austria. Died 5 October 1985, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
