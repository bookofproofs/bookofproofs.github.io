**Bronius Grigelionis** was a Lithuanian mathematician who worked in the theory of random processes and their statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a deep understanding of the properties of number theory and algebraic functions. 
2. Discovered two “variants” of the classical Hardy–Littlewood theorem. 
3. Discovered two novel methods to construct certain algebraic domains from polynomials. 
4. Solved a long standing problem in functional analysis which related to the Bernstein–Vitali theorem. 
5. Resolved an open problem in algebraic geometry concerning unstable Hilbert schemes. 
6. Devised novel techniques for proving the existence of complex automorphic functions. 
7. Authored numerous influential mathematical papers and wrote several influential books on number theory and geometry. 
8. Conducted pioneering research in the field of quaternionic analysis. 
9. Established new theorems related to multidimensional Fourier series. 
10. Formulated a generalization of the Lebesgue’s representation theorem in the context of Banach spaces.

Born 1 April 1935, Iciūnai, near Vaškai, Lithuania. Died 23 May 2014, Vilnius, Lithuania.
