**Goro Shimura** was a Japanese mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He solved the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture, forming the foundation for the modern theory of modular forms.
2. He also made major contributions to the theories of complex multiplication and class field theory.
3. He formulated the Shimura Correspondence, which relates certain modular forms to elliptic curves. 
4. As a researcher at Princeton University, he collaborated with other mathematicians to develop the theory of Siegel modular forms.
5. He published groundbreaking theories regarding the structure of Shimura varieties, among which the famous theorem of him and Masayoshi Nagura. 
6. He received the United States National Medal of Science in 1996.

Born 23 February 1930, Hamamatsu, Japan. Died 3 May2019, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
