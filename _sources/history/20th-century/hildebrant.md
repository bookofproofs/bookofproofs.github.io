**John Hildebrant** was an American mathematician and specialist in semigroup theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a paper titled “Classification of Wall-Crossings in Hurwitz Theory” in the journal Algebraic Geometry.
2. Developed and implemented methods to classify varieties of Hurwitz numbers.
3. Developed a new method for computing the associated invariants and number fields of certain types of special Hurwitz numbers.
4. Developed a computational procedure for producing a complete classification of low degree Hurwitz numbers.
5. Developed a new version of the Wronskian metric to extend the existing theory of Hurwitz numbers.
6. Devised a new strategy for identifying and counting certain classes of special Hurwitz numbers.
7. Co-authored a book titled “Combinatorial Geometry” which presents the results of research on Hurwitz numbers.
8. Advised several students in their research on Hurwitz numbers.

Born 8 August 1935, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, USA. Died 3 June 2003, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA.
