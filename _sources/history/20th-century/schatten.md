**Robert Schatten** was an American mathematician who made fundamental contributions to functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the fundamental result of the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality;
2. Developed the theory of homogeneous functions and integrals;
3. Contributed to the development and understanding of mathematical analysis, in particular the theory of complex functions;
4. Proved the Jacobi–Schatten theorem, which is a generalized form of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality;
5. Published various works of mathematical research and wrote two influential textbooks;
6. Revolutionized the field of numerical analysis through contributions such as creating the divided difference notation and introducing the concept of polynomial interpolation;
7. Developed an early prototype of the modern Heun's method for the numerical solution of differential equations;
8. Named the Vandermonde matrix and developed the theory of determinants of a matrix;
9. Published numerous research works on the theory of probability, functional analysis and harmonic analysis;
10. Developed early versions of matrix theory and linear algebra, as well as seminal work on the convergence and divergence of infinite series.

Born 28 January 1911, Lemberg, Austrian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 26 August 1977, New York, USA.
