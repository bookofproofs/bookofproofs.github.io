**Fan Chung** is a Taiwanese-born American mathematician who works mainly in graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved a number of open problems in graph theory and constructed several new classes of graphs.
2. Developed innovative techniques in probabilistic and extremal graph theory.
3. Wrote several influential books on graph theory, including “Complex Graphs and Networks”, “Spectral Graph Theory”, and “Extremal Graph Theory”.
4. Developed the 'Fan Chung–Graham Conjecture', one of the most famous open problems in graph theory.
5. Co-Authored the book “The Complexity of Graph Homomorphisms”, considered one of the most important books in computer science in the 1990s.
6. Discovered connections between spectral graph theory and number theory.
7. Proved several central limit theorems and random graph theory, establishing the foundations for the study of random networks.
8. Proposed the use of higher-order spectral graph theory in structural and algebraic graph theory.

Born 9 October 1949, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
