**Fan Chung** is a Taiwanese-born American mathematician who works mainly in graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Chung graduated with a B.S. in mathematics in 1970 and then went to the United States for her graduate studies.
* Chung was awarded an M.S. in 1972, then continued her studies for a Ph.D. with Wilf as her supervisor.
* Also in 1973 Chung attended the Capital Conference at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. There she presented a paper On triangular and cyclic Ramsey numbers with k colors which was published in the Proceedings of the Conference in the following year.
* In 1974 Chung graduated with a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania and applied for a job as a member of Technical Staff working for the Mathematical Foundations of Computing Department at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey.
* Also in 1975 Chung published her first joint paper with Ron Graham On multicolor Ramsey numbers for complete bipartite graphs which appeared in the Journal of Combinatorial Theory.
* Her second child was born in 1977 but Chung's marriage was not a successful one and it ended in divorce in 1982.
* She would marry Ron Graham in 1983 but she continued to publish under her original name of Fan Chung.
* In the autumn of 1989 Chung became a visiting professor at Princeton.
* This year was to have a huge influence on Chung who decided to return to the academic world but she did not formally leave Bellcore until 1994.
* In this clear and well-paced lecture, the noted graph theorist Fan Chung exploits this analogy to produce some interesting and useful results.
* We have already given some details of Chung's first few publications.
* In 1997 the American Mathematical Society published a major book Spectral graph theory by Chung.
* Chung studies this topic from the point of view of spectral geometry in this book drawing the analogy to the spectrum on Riemannian manifolds.
* Only one year later, in 1998, another important book appeared, this time jointly written by Chung and her husband Graham.
* It was based on an article Chung published on the same topic in the previous year in the Journal of Graph Theory.
* Chung and Graham were not only associated with Erd≈ës through his mathematics, but they also were close personal friends with their home providing for him the only place he had as a base.
* It is worth noting the tremendous contribution Chung has made, and continues to make, as a member of the editorial board of various journals.
* Finally we should note that Chung was honoured with the Allendoerfer Award by the Mathematical Association of America in 1990 and by membership of the American Academy of Arts and Science in 1998.

Born 9 October 1949, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
