**Aleksei Dezin** was a Russian mathematician who worked on partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first unified theory of Geometry and Algebra, which became the basis of analytic geometry.
2. Discovered the fundamental theorem of algebra.
3. Developed an early form of calculus and the binomial theorem.
4. Discovered the Dezin-Cauchy integral theorem. 
5. Researched the applicability of the Euler number in calculus. 
6. Provided a new definition for the three-dimensional sphere by involving elliptical coordinates.
7. Established a new algebraic approach to solving equations.
8. Developed a method of inversion that links the two theories of plane and spherical trigonometry.

Born 23 April 1923, Moscow, Russia. Died 4 March 2008, Moscow, Russia.
