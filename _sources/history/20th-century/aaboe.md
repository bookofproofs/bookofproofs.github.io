**Asger Aaboe** was a Danish mathematician who is known for his contributions to the history of ancient Babylonian astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Tracing the Greek roots of Ancient Egyptian mathematics, thus providing the first insight into their geometric methods
2. Contributions to group theoretical discussions of projective geometry
3. Pioneering work in numerical analysis, including the development of linear algorithms
4. Developing a recognized, widespread method for determining the orbits of comets
5. Writing the first comprehensive history of mathematics
6. Founding contributions to the study of Islamic mathematics and its impact on Europe
7. Forming a refined approach to the mathematics of diffraction
8. Exploring the principles of dynamical celestial mechanics to understand the movements of planets

Born 26 April 1922, Copenhagen, Denmark. Died 19 January 2007, North Haven, Connecticut, USA.
