**Jean-Pierre Serre** is a French mathematician who has made important contributions to algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and algebraic number theory. He was a member of Bourbaki.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1954 for his work on algebraic topology and differential geometry. 
2. In 1956, he was awarded the Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques for his proof of the Armendariz–Puiseux theorem in algebraic geometry.
3. He was also one of the founders of the Bourbaki group whose work revolutionized the field of algebraic geometry.
4. His contributions to the Langlands program have been monumental, specifically his contribution of an algebraic proof of the Weil conjectures.
5. His 1964 paper on group cohomology laid the foundation for the modern approach to the field and is considered a classic work in algebraic topology. 
6. In 2017, he was awarded the Abel Prize “for his fundamental work in algebraic geometry and his vision of the future development of the field”.

Born 15 September 1926, Bages, Pyrénées Orientales, France.
