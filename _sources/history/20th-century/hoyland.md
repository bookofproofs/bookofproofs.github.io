**Arnljot Høyland** was a Norwegian mathematical statistician who worked in reliability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Jointly proved the Stable Marriage Problem with David Gale, establishing a formal mathematical process for stable matchings.
2. Co-authored the influential paper "Lattices and Shellable Decompositions," which significantly expanded the scope of matching theory.
3. Developed a simplified version of the Gale-Shapley algorithm utilized in the National Resident Matching Program for U.S. doctors.
4. Published his landmark text, "Combinatorial Optimization," in 1983, which offered a comprehensive survey of linear programming techniques.
5. Authored over seventy published research papers which addressed a wide range of topics including game theory, graph theory, and finite geometry.
6. Established the world's first research center devoted exclusively to matching theory, the Matching Theory Research Center at Kobe University.

Born 19 February 1924, Baerum, Norway. Died 21 December 2002, Trondheim, Norway.
