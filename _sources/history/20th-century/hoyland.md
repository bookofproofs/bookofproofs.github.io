**Arnljot Høyland** was a Norwegian mathematical statistician who worked in reliability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His parents were Torleiv Høyland (1893-1989), a teacher, and Sigyn Tønnesdtr Husebø (1899-1994), a clerk.
* Arnljot was one of his parents' three children.
* Torleiv Høyland was the author of the book Laerernes Kirkenesferd Ⓣ(The teachers' journey to Kirkenes) (1946).
* Torleiv Høyland was prisoner no 1850 there.
* Arnljot Høyland is internationally renowned for his work in mathematical statistics.
* Høyland met Alf Prøysen, a famous Norwegian writer and musician, during the last years of the war.
* They cooperated among other things on shows, and it was in this context that Høyland composed the melody Prøysen later used in his "Julekveldsvise".
* Because if this Høyland was interviewed several times on Norwegian television in the 1990s.
* Høyland completed his high school studies and took his matriculation examination in 1943.
* At this time Høyland was a sixteen year old schoolboy.
* However, Høyland completed his high school studies and took his matriculation examination in 1943.
* At the end of the war, in autumn 1945, Høyland began to study at the University of Oslo.
* Høyland was given some tests and then told he could start work.
* Høyland needed the money, so he accepted.
* This led to his mathematics studies at university, which Høyland completed while holding his position in the Intelligence Service, having a high component of mathematical statistics.
* He had written the works in Esperanto which Høyland had to read.
* As to his work with the Intelligence Service, Høyland says that 1948 was an exciting year.
* Høyland retired from the Norwegian Defence in 1954, having attained the rank of a major.
* David Blackwell was head of statistics at that time and he advised Høyland to register as a Ph.D. student.
* Lehmann was using the lectures he was giving as the basis for his famous book Testing Statistical Hypotheses (1959) and Høyland received a "thanks" in the Preface to the book for having worked through all the problems.
* Back in Norway, Høyland had difficulties because he was arguing for non-parametric statistics.
* After working as a lecturer at the University of Oslo from 1959 to 1965, Høyland was hired by the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) in Trondheim as a senior lecturer in 1965 and later became a professor of mathematical statistics.
* Høyland was the first person who specialised in statistics that NTH hired.
* Høylands 2-volume textbook Sannsynlighetsregning og statistisk metodelaere Ⓣ(Probability and statistical methods), published in 1972-73, was compulsory reading for the students at NTH for over 20 years.
* When professor Høyland returned to NTNU (NTH at that time), he was very enthusiastic and wanted to start a course in reliability analysis at NTNU, using the book by Barlow and Proschan.
* Bent Natvig stayed only a short time and left NTNU during the summer of 1977 - so when the first ordinary course in reliability analysis was to be lectured, professor Høyland had to be the lecturer - with assistance from Marvin Rausand who took over Bent Natvig's position as an assistant professor.
* Høyland and Rausand were co-authors of an international textbook System Reliability Theory: Models and Statistics Methods (1994).
* Høyland was known for his cheerful spirit and his musicality.
* Arnljot Høyland was appointed Knight of First Class of the Order of St Olav in 1995.

Born 19 February 1924, Baerum, Norway. Died 21 December 2002, Trondheim, Norway.
