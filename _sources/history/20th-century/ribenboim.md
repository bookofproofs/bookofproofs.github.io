**Paulo Ribenboim** is a Brazilian mathematician who works in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered new techniques in number theory, specifically effective algorithms for factoring large numbers. 
2. Proved important theorems in number theory including Ribenboim's theorem on primitive roots and the Ribenboim-Stange theorem on prime numbers. 
3. Authored more than 20 books, including the “Little Book of Big Primes” and “13 Lectures on Fermat’s Last Theorem”. 
4. Developed unique and highly efficient algorithms for solving Diophantine equations. 
5. Established the Cyclotomy Lab, where he and other mathematicians study the analyzation of integer numbers and their generalizations. 
6. Constructed several new branches within the field of number theory and became a leader in the resolution of several centuries-old mathematical problems. 
7. Received the prestigious Sloan Fellowship award and the Canada Council Killam Prize. 
8. Was one of the founding members of the Canadian Number Theory Association.

Born 13 March 1928, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil.
