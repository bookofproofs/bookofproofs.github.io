**Nikolay Krasovsky** was a Russian mathematician who worked in control theory, dynamical systems and differential games.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Krasovskii-Lyapunov stability theory in non-autonomous systems. 
2. Published a theory of critical oscillations and stabilization in nonlinear autonomous systems. 
3. Pioneered the synthesis of the functional analysis and Lyapunov stability theory with the theory of nonsmooth vector fields.
4. Established the Krasovskii topological method for the investigation of nonlinear problems in mechanics.
5. Founded the Krasovskii-Lyapunov theory of parametric resonance. 
6. Contributed to the theory of nonlinear systems and bifurcation analysis.
7. Developed the longest range theoretical model of the motion of an inflated balloon. 
8. Developed the Krasovskii-Lyapunov method for linear-quadratic disturbance problems. 
9. Discovered the Krasovskii-Cerbus integral conditions for the solution of the problem of non-stationary nonlinear vibrating systems. 
10. Discovered the Krasovskii-Stoker integral conditions for nonlinear systems with externally applied forces.

Born 7 September 1924, Sverdlovsk, now Yekaterinburg, Russia. Died 4 April 2012, Yekaterinburg, Russia.
