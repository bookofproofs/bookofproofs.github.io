**Nikolay Krasovsky** was a Russian mathematician who worked in control theory, dynamical systems and differential games.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Around the time Nikolai Nikolaevich was born, Yekaterinburg was renamed Sverdlovsk and it had this name from 1924 to 1991.
* In 1932 Krasovskii entered Sverdlovsk School No 1 in Yekaterinburg.
* Krasovskii graduated from the School No 1 in 1941 and, because of the war, he worked as an electrician at the Ordzhonikidze Plant between 1941 and 1943.
* Although it specialised in applied sciences, there was a very strong Department of Higher Mathematics which, from 1946, was headed by the algebraist Sergei Nikolaevich Chernikov.
* This meant that Krasovskii, as well as taking many courses on applied mathematics and mechanics, was able to take courses on group theory, the theory of continuous groups, and linear inequalities given by Chernikov.
* After graduating, Krasovskii was appointed as an assistant to the Ural Polytechnical Institute in 1949.
* Barbashin influenced Krasovskii to work on the stability theory of motion and Krasovskii published his first papers Theorems on the stability of motions governed by a system of two equations and (with Evgenii Alekseevich Barbashin) The stability of motion as a whole in 1952.
* Krasovskii was awarded a Master's Degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.) in 1953 for his thesis On Stability of Motion under Large Initial Perturbations and in that year published six papers.
* In 1954 he published nine papers and from 1955 he worked towards his doctorate (equivalent to the habilitation) at the Institute of Mechanics of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow advised by Nikolai Gurevich Chetaev.
* In 1959, the year Krasovskii published the Russian version of this work, he was appointed to the Gorkii Ural State University in Yekaterinburg.
* In 1968 Krasovskii published the monograph Theory of control of motion: Linear systems (Russian).
* In 1970 Krasovskii was appointed as head of the Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Yekaterinburg.
* Krasovskii continued to publish monographs collecting together his own research and that of his co-workers.
* Nikolai was a highly cultured man, whose interests ranged from literature, arts, and theatre to events in medicine and sports.
* Krasovskii received many honours for his contributions.

Born 7 September 1924, Sverdlovsk, now Yekaterinburg, Russia. Died 4 April 2012, Yekaterinburg, Russia.
