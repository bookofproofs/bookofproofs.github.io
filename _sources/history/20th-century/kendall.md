**David Kendall** was a leading world authority on applied probability and data analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1946 Kendall was elected a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford and appointed a lecturer in mathematics.
* Then in 1962 Kendall was appointed as Professor of Mathematical Statistics at the University of Cambridge.
* Kendall held this chair of mathematical statistics until he retired in 1985 and which time he became professor emeritus.
* Kendall is a leading world authority on applied probability and data analysis.
* An exceptional lecturer, Kendall has been the Larmor Lecturer at the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1980, the Milne Lecturer at Wadham College, Oxford in 1983, the Hoteling Lecturer at the University of North Carolina in 1985, the Rietz Lecturer at the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1989 and the Kolmogorov Lecturer at the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability in 1990.
* In 1964, Kendall was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London and served on the Council of that Society during 1967-69 and then for a second spell during 1982-83.
* The Royal Society awarded Kendall their Sylvester Medal in 1976.
* However it is not only the London Mathematical Society that has elected Kendall to be their president.
* Kendall has been joint editor of a number of important works, including Mathematics in the Archaeological and Historical Sciences (1971), Stochastic Analysis (1973), Stochastic Geometry (1974), Analytic and Geometric Stochastics (1986).

Born 15 January 1918, Ripon, Yorkshire, England. Died 23 October 2007, Cambridge, England.
