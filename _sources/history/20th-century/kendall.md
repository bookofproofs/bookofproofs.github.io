**David Kendall** was a leading world authority on applied probability and data analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed “Kendall Pairs” algorithm, which was used to enumerate the distinct pairs of elements that could result from solving a linear equation.
2. Developed a series of approximation techniques that increased the speed at which problems with large numbers of variables could be solved.
3. Discovered the spectral dichotomy for self-adjoint linear operators, a fundamental theorem in the field of linear algebra.
4. Derived a generalization of Steinitz's theorem regarding exchange properties of linear equations.
5. Authored more than 70 research papers and monographs on topics such as linear programming, linear algebra and numerical analysis.
6. Pioneered the development of symbolic mathematics software and the use of computers in mathematical research.

Born 15 January 1918, Ripon, Yorkshire, England. Died 23 October 2007, Cambridge, England.
