**Eugene B Dynkin** was a Russian-born American mathematician who worked in the fields of probability and algebra, especially semisimple Lie groups and algebras, and Markov processes. Dynkin diagrams are named after him.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received a Stalin Prize in 1950 for work on differential geometry. 
2. Developed a generalization of Markov Processes known as super-Markov processes. 
3. Was awarded Moscow State University's Golden Medal for distinguished research in 1941. 
4. Developed Dynkin formulas which can be used to reconstruct the martingale property of jump-diffusions from its Laplace transform. 
5. First person to use tree or diagrammatic techniques to solve problems in algebra, probability theory and Lie theory. 
6. Introduced and developed the theory of random measures. 
7. His theorem on transience laid the groundwork for later advances in Markov chain theory. 
8. Published paper on the solution of integral equations of the first kind involving continuous variables. 
9. Was responsible for founding the theory of semimartingales. 
10. Was the first to bring the theories of algebra, probability & statistics together.

Born 11 May1924, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia). Died 14 November 2014, Ithaca, New York, USA.
