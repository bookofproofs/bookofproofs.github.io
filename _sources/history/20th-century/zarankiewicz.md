**Kazimierz Zarankiewicz** was a Polish mathematician who worked in topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a groundbreaking construction involving the Levi graph in 1935 which provided a new way of analyzing Ramsey theory and resolving the Zarankiewicz Problem.
2. Established the Zarankiewicz Crossing Number in 1947, an important concept in graph theory.
3. Developed a theorem of finite plane graphs in 1952 which has since been referred to as the Zarankiewicz–Bogdanov Theorem.
4. In 1964, he formulated a widely used graph theorem in discrete mathematics which has been referred to as a cornerstone of graph theory, the Zarankiewicz Problem.
5. Crafted a groundbreaking formula for counting the number of edges in transversal graphs in 1959. 
6. Showed that every planar graph with a given girth and a given degree of maximal vertices is infinitely constructible in 1957. 
7. Developed the Zarankiewicz's Packing Scheme for calculating the chromatic number of certain types of graphs.
8. Solved a conjecture proposed by fellow mathematician Stanisław Saks in 1945, the Zarankiewicz Problem, the first instance of a topological problem in extremal graph theory. 
9. Discovered a theorem of combinatorics in 1938 that went on to become known as the Zarankiewicz–Rado Theorem.
10. Established a theorem on the symmetric difference in graphs in 1934 which was later referred to as the Zarankiewicz–Tutte Theorem.

Born 2 May 1902, Częstochowa, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 5 September 1959, London, England.
