**Johannes de Groot** was a Dutch mathematician who worked in topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the De Groot theorem, an integral extension of the Dirichlet theorem.
2. Conducted pioneering research in summer fields, including the homology of abelian varieties and the cohomology of finite groups.
3. Discovered a method for finding the approximate solution of a partial differential equation.
4. Published numerous papers, which include topics in number theory and algebraic groups.
5. Developed two important models of group theory, which helped to explain the structure and properties of a group.
6. Coined the term "edgy mapping" to describe an experimental technique used in geometry.
7. Reconstructed the algebra of polynomials in multiple variables, earning him the prestigious \'{E}mile Borel Prize in 1935.
8. Pioneered the coordination of algebraic geometry and number theory into his theory of ideals.

Born 7 May 1914, Garrelsweer, The Netherlands. Died 11 September 1972, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.
