**Ovide Arino** was a French mathematician who worked in differential equations and Banach spaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm  that considered the computational complexity of various Diophantine equations.
2. Constructed a general method for developing elliptic curves that could be used in cryptographic applications.
3. Studied several topics in number theory including irreducible polynomials, Fermat's Last Theorem, and Mordell's Conjecture.
4. Developed a tool to determine the genus of an algebraic curve over an algebraic number field.
5. Devised a new method for computing elliptic curves over finite fields.
6. Used number theory to study random number generators and analyze the security of cryptographic protocols.

Born 24 April 1947, Toulouse, France. Died 29 September 2003, Bedlewo, Poland.
