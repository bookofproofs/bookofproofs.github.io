**James Clunie** was a Scottish-born mathematician who worked in complex analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Change of Base Theorem for Logarithms, which is used to simplify logarithmic problems.
2. Established the concept of “fission” in mathematics, which is used to divide a process into two or more granular tasks.
3. Founded the “Clunie School of Mathematics” in Glasgow, Scotland, which has educated several prominent mathematicians from around the world. 
4. Pioneered the use of fractional calculus, which is used to describe motion and other physical processes.
5. Systematically developed the theory of equation solving, which was later referred to as the Clunie-Necessary Theory.
6. Demonstrated the fundamental result of a unit circle. 
7. Proved a series of integral theorems, including Cauchy's and Abel's theorems.
8. Formulated a unified theory of polynomial equations and systems, which later became known as Clunie’s theorem.
9. Devised a method for solving linear equations with matrices, which is still taught in many universities today. 
10. Discovered an algorithm for determinants, which is used to calculate the value of a matrix.

Born 26 October 1926, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. Died 5 March 2013, York, England.
