**Luis Caffarelli** is an Argentine mathematician who has won several major prizes for his work in the field of partial differential equations and their applications.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of regularity for nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. 
2. Developed the theory of homogenization of partial differential equations. 
3. Pioneered new techniques for the study of free boundary problems. 
4. Developed multiple interior estimates, a method of proving existence of solutions to certain nonlinear equations. 
5. Developed the mathematical theory of homogenization for second order linear partial differential equations. 
6. Resolved the Gagliardo-Nirenberg problem of univalent functions and related problems. 
7. Jointly developed with Caffarelli-Silvestre the theory of fractional order equations. 
8. Developed the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities (1979) and its related extension. 
9. Developed the De Giorgi theory of ellipsoidal-type regularity for minimizers. 
10. Coined the term “Viscosity Solutions” for the study of nonlinear partial differential equations.

Born 8 December 1948, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
