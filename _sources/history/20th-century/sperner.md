**Emanuel Sperner** was a German mathematician who worked in the foundations of geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Identified the Sperner Lemma, a foundational result that is the basis for Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem.
2. Introduced the first formulation of a combinatorial problem that is now known as the Sperner's Theorem.
3. Developed a new proof of Joszef Borsuk's result on homotopy theory known as the Hexagon Theorem.
4. Determined the maximum number of points contained in a convex set in more than two dimensions.
5. Discovered the first extremal problem in Ramsey Theory that appeared in his doctoral thesis. 
6. Proved the Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem.
7. Demonstrated a tight connection between the theory of hypothesis testing and the Sperner lemma.

Born 9 December 1905, Waltdorf, Upper Silesia (now Poland). Died 31 January 1980, Laufen, Sulzburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
