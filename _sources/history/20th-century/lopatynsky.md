**Yaroslav Lopatinskii** was a Ukrainian mathematician known for his contributions to the theory of differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Lopatynsky worked at both the Azerbaidzhan University and the Baku Polytechnic Institute.
* Lopatynsky's first papers were on analysis: On uniform convergence (1929); Embedding of a Riemannian space in a Euclidean space (1934); (with L P Fridolina) The justification of mathematics, a critical situation (1934); and Limiting values of an analytic function on a set of singular points of measure greater than zero on a rectified curve (1935).
* In 1945 Lopatynsky moved to Lvov where he was appointed to the chair of differential equations at Lvov University.
* Lopatynsky's research continued to impress as he continued to prove major results in the theory of systems of linear differential equations of the elliptic type.
* Lopatynsky's contributions to the theory of differential equations are particularly important, with important contributions to the theory of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations.
* This is now known as the Lopatynsky Condition.
* In 1980 Lopatynsky published an important book Introduction to the Contemporary Theory of Partial Differential Equations.
* Yaroslav Borisovich has won the deep admiration and respect of his many students, as well as those closely associated with him professionally and socially.
* Lopatynsky received many honours for his achievements.
* The conference is named after an outstanding mathematician, talented pedagogue and organiser, Academician of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Yaroslav Borisovich Lopatinskii who was a founder of both the Department of Differential Equations in Donetsk National University and the Department of Partial Differential Equations in the Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.

Born 9 November 1906, Tbilisi, Georgia, Russia. Died 10 March 1981, Donetsk, USSR.
