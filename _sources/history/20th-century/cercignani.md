**Carlo Cercignani** was an Italian mathematician known for his work on the kinetic theory of gases.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote “Lectures on Hyperbolic Geometry” (1959) and “Boltzmann's Gift to Science” (1976), providing insights on non-Euclidean geometries.
2. Pioneered work on the Euler equations of gas dynamics (1962-1964), gaining a deep understanding of the mathematical models underlying the motion of a compressible viscous fluid.
3. Developed a method to solve the problem of Boltzmann's equation (1964-1966) which allowed for a better understanding of phenomenon at the molecular level.
4. Authored over 70 mathematical papers, dealing with the stability theory and numerical methods of the solutions of gas dynamics equations.
5. Systematized the mathematical theory for a broad range of transport equations necessary to describe the behavior of a fluid (1968).
6. Developed the theory of finite-difference methods for the Boltzmann equation (1971-1980).
7. Published “Mathematical Theory of Dilute Gases” (1972) which opened the use of mathematical models to understand the behavior of gases.

Born 17 June 1939, Teulada, Sardinia, Italy. Died 7 January 2010, Milan, Italy.
