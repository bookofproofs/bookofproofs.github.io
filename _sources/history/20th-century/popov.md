**Blagoj Popov** was a Macedonian mathematician who specialised in the application of mathematics to engineering and physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Popov Matrix Method in stochastic differential equations, a pioneering contribution to the theory of stochastic integrals. 
2. Established an algebraic approach to the theory of functionals by generalizing the methodology of Stone's theorem from Banach algebras. 
3. Published multiple research papers and monographs on a wide range of topics in mathematics throughout his career. 
4. Received numerous awards for his contributions to mathematics, including the Order of Merit from the Yugoslav Ministry of Education. 
5. Received the Pitagora Prize from the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics for his research in functional equations. 
6. Served as the President of the North Macedonia Mathematical Society, in addition to being a prominent member of the International Congress of Mathematicians.

Born 17 January 1923, Kochani, Serbia (now Northern Macedonia). Died 30 October 2014, Skopje, Macedonia.
