**Guglielmo Righini** was an Italian astronomer, specializing in the study of the sun. He also wrote on the history of science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a school of mathematics at the University of Bologna in 1714, where he taught up until his death in 1756.
2. Developed a notation for expressing real numbers developed a notation for expressing real numbers, which remains in use today.
3. Discovered a technique for finding the roots of equations, which is still used today.
4. Proposed a set of axioms that helped to form the basis of modern algebra.
5. Published influential works of applied mathematics, such as he L'ipotesi del defloramento in 1726.
6. Introduced the use of tables for the calculation of mathematical values.
7. Investigated the connections between mathematics and music, creating works such as the Treatise of Geometric Harmony in 1751.

Born 16 February 1908, Castelfranco Veneto, Italy. Died 29 May 1978, Florence, Italy.
