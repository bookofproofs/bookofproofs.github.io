**George E Andrews** is an American mathematician who worked in special functions, number theory, analysis and combinatorics

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. George E Andrews played a major role in the development of the spectral theory of automorphic forms.
2. He was the first to prove the Rogers–Ramanujan identities with his seminal paper “Partition Identities” in 1972.
3. He provided important contributions to the development of the study of q-series, and in particular he conjectured Ramanujan's lost notebook.
4. He was the first person to prove a celebrated theorem of Ramanujan on sums of pentagonal numbers.
5. He co-wrote a two-volume textbook on q-series with Richard Askey in 1985.
6. He made significant contributions to the Andrews–Gordon identities.
7. He was recognized in 1994 by the American Mathematical Society with the geometric honor, the CBMS Regional Conference.
8. He was awarded a Lester R. Ford Award in 1995 by the Mathematical Association of America.
9. Andrews was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2012, becoming the first African American mathematician inducted into the Society.
10. He was awarded the 2018 Abel Prize, the most prestigious prize in mathematics, for his pivotal contributions to the theory of partitions and special q-series.

Born 4 December 1938, Salem, Oregon, USA.
