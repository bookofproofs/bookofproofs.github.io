**Martin Eichler** was a German matnematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Eichler Integral, a new form of integral used to calculate differential forms in abstract mathematics.
2. Published a paper in 1962 on inhomogenous quadratic forms in algebraic number fields. 
3. Authored the book “Spinors and Quadratic Forms” in 1971, a landmark work in the field of mathematics.
4. Developed deep research around arithmetic geometries and modular forms. 
5. Conducted mathematical research on the application of the Shimura–Taniyama–Weil conjecture (now the Modularity Theorem) in number theory and algebraic geometry.
6. Established the Eichler–Shimura isomorphism, a branch-of- mathematics connecting the theory of modular forms and Dirichlet series with algebraic number theory and Diophantine equations.
7. Contributed insights into the theory of self-dual integral lattices. 
8. Pioneered the use of the theory of Fourier expansions in the study of Hilbert modular forms. 
9. Achieved breakthroughs in modular forms and in the representation theory of real and p-adic groups.
10. Was a recipient of the 1974 Wolf Prize in Mathematics.

Born 29 March 1912, Pinnow, Germany. Died 7 October 1992, Basel, Switzerland.
