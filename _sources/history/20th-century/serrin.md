**James Serrin** was an American mathematician who worked in nonlinear analysis, partial differential equations, fluid mechanics, continuum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Caccioppoli–Serrin existence theorem for linear and quasilinear elliptic equations, 1964.
2. Proved a new existence theorem for compressible fluids, now known as the Serrin corner-point theorem, 1965.
3. Advanced the field of free-boundary problems by establishing the existence theory for certain types of Hele-Shaw and continuous Stefan problems, 1975.
4. Proved important results on the stability of convex solutions of certain quasilinear elliptic equations, 1980.
5. Discovered and proved a remarkable identity in the theory of Riemannian manifolds, now known as the Serrin Identity, 1987.
6. Wrote several books and authored numerous articles on partial differential equations and mathematical analysis, 1968–2015.

Born 1 November 1926, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Died 23 August 2012, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.
