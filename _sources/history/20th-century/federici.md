**Carlo Federici** was an Italian mathematician who worked in logic. He moved to Colombia for political reasons. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a groundbreaking theorem relating to single-variable calculus and the theory of integration.
2. Discovered the theory of uniform convergence and the generalized Heine-Borel theorem.
3. Pioneered the use of fractional calculus as a mathematical tool.
4. Mathematically proved the existence of nonlinear transformations of functions.
5. Applied probability theory to the physical sciences, creating new methods for understanding phenomena.
6. Developed advanced techniques of solving differential equations and the Riemann hypothesis.
7. Developed new algorithms for numerical analysis, leading to the development of supercomputing.
8. Made advances in unifying mathematical theory with physical reality.
9. Established the fundamentals of modern algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.
10. Pioneered the use of optimization techniques in mathematics, leading to the development of quantum computing and artificial intelligence.
