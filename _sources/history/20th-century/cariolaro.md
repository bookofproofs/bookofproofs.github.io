**David Cariolaro** was an Italian mathematician who worked in graph theory. He died following an accident in China.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* David Cariolaro entered the Liceo Scientifico "Enrico Fermi" in Padua in 1983, graduating from the high school in 1988.
* Cariolaro spent four months in 1993-94 as an Exchange Student at Konstanz University in Germany.
* Carlo Bertoluzza and Cariolaro published the joint paper On the measure of a fuzzy set based on continuous t-co-norms in 1997.
* This paper was submitted for publication in October 1995 while Cariolaro was still in Pavia.
* Cariolaro was a Visiting Research Student at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Aalborg University in Denmark, in 1998-1999.
* Lars Dovling Andersen (born 1950) had been Head of Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University in 1996-1998 but by the time Cariolaro arrived there he was Vice Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Science.
* After the year in Aalborg, in 2000 Cariolaro also went to the University of Reading, England, where his thesis advisor was also Anthony J W Hilton.
* During his first two years at Reading, Cariolaro was a Teaching Assistant in the Department of Mathematics.
* His supervisor, Professor Anthony Hilton, reports that David was a diligent, hard-working student, who found it quite difficult to get to grips with his research topic, but eventually showed considerable insight and imagination.
* After leaving Reading, Cariolaro served as a postdoctoral fellow at several different institutions.
* In September 2009, Cariolaro was appointed as a Lecturer in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou, China.
* Cariolaro ran a web site which provided a discussion forum for those interested in graph theory.
* Tragedy struck on 20 September 2013 when Cariolaro was seriously injured in an accidental fall.
* David's condition is very critical and requires complex medical care whose cost, unfortunately not covered by any insurance, is so high that it has consumed our life savings in a few weeks.
* The purpose of this site is to present this dramatic story to as many people as possible, friends and acquaintances of David and Gianfranco, and to facilitate individual contributions giving everyone the possibility offering help and support.
* The struggle to get David Cariolaro back to Italy was reported on regularly in the newspaper Padova Oggi.
* Complicating Cariolaro's case is the fact that the Veneto Region has no legal requirement for pay for the flight.
* The President of the Veneto Region, Luca Zaia, wrote a letter to the Italian Prime Minister's Secretary urging intervention on humanitarian grounds to repatriate Cariolaro.
* This was quickly answered with an offer by the Government to send a Falcon with a fully equipped medical team to bring Cariolaro back to Italy.
* By 7 November the flight was ready to leave but Cariolaro's condition worsened and it was decided to wait until he showed sufficient improvement.
* Finally let us note Cariolaro's hobbies were music, chess, tennis, javelin throwing and cycling.

Born 12 July 1969, Padua, Italy. Died 10 January 2014, Padua, Italy.
