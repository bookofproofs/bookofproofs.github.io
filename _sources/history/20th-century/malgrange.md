**Bernard Malgrange** is a French mathematician who worked on differential equations and singularity theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of partial differential equations which is axiomatic and constructive.
2. Researched the zero-dimensional linear programming problems, eventually developing efficiency conditions for the problems.
3. Wrote the dissertation Sur quelques points de la theorie des equations aux derivees partielles which became a foundation of the solved equations in modern mathematics.
4. Established the link between algebraic geometry and partial differential equations.
5. Co-founded the study of essential boundary conditions of partial differential equations.
6. Successfully solved the topology of singularities which were instrumental in partial differential equations.

Born 6 July 1928, Paris, France.
