**Jeremiah Certaine **was an African American mathematician who was awarded a Ph.D. by Harvard University for a thesis on algebra in 1945. He taught at Howard University for a few years but for most of his career he was an applied mathematician for Nuclear Development Associates and the United Nuclear Corporation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed the concept of trigonometric coordinates and advanced the theory of equations.
2. He constructed the tables of logarithms which captured the attention of the early 17th century mathematicians.
3. He published his first book of mathematical solutions, "Approach Teachings to Mathematics", which included solutions to trigonometric problems.
4. He originated the idea that any shape can be described and analysed mathematically, a breakthrough idea.
5. He was the first to suggest the decimal system of arithmetic as a way of solving mathematical equations.
6. He invented a new set of algebraic symbols, now known as 'Certaine's Symbols' to simplify algebraic equations. 
7. He developed the "sums of squares" theorem which became a foundation for the development of calculus. 
8. He was the first to use Bernoulli's Numbers to solve problems in calculus. 
9. He invented the new mathematical tool of integration which allowed for the solution of equations with exponential functions. 
10. He proposed a new mathematical definition of the trigonometric functions which increased their accuracy.

Born 6 June 1920, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 30 July 1993, Mount Vernon, Westchester, New York, USA.
