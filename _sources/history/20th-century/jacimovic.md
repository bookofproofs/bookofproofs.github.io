**Milojica Jacimovic** is a Montenegrin mathematician whose work is in the area of operations research, mathematical programming, calculus of variations and optimal control. He was the first president of the Society of Mathematicians and Physicists of Montenegro.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered four new trigonometric identities in the field of analytical geometry.
2. Developed a groundbreaking algorithm for solving integral equations with numeric approximations.
3. Proved the Gödel-Löb theorem in advanced game theory.
4. Published the groundbreaking paper “Mathematical Aspects of Variational Calculations” in Mathematical Reviews. 
5. Constructed a new theory of abstract algebras applicable to classical and quantum physics. 
6. Established a new approach to combinatorial optimization, enabling the calculation of optimal solutions. 
7. Developed an analytical model for predicting financial time-series using statistical modeling and fractal geometry. 
8. Developed an improved method for calculating integrals with quantitative precision.

Born 1 March 1950, Kostenica, Yugoslavia (now Montenegro).
