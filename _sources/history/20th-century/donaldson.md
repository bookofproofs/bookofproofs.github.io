**Simon Donaldson** is an English mathematician who received a Fields Medal for his work on 4 dimensional manifolds.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1980 Donaldson began postgraduate work at Worcester College, Oxford, first under Nigel Hitchen's supervision and later under Atiyah's supervision.
* This result was published by Donaldson in a paper Self-dual connections and the topology of smooth 4-manifolds which appeared in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society in 1983.
* Donaldson has received many honours for his work.
* In 1991 Donaldson received the  William Hopkins Prize from the Cambridge Philosophical Society  and, the following year, the Royal Medal from the Royal Society.
* Slowly the message has gotten across and now Donaldson's ideas are beginning to be used by others in a variety of ways.
* Donaldson has opened up an entirely new area; unexpected and mysterious phenomena about the geometry of 4-dimensions have been discovered.
* Donaldson was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2000.
* In 2009 Donaldson, together with Clifford H Taubes, was awarded the Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences.
* Donaldson was knighted in 2012.

Born 20 August 1957, Cambridge, England.
