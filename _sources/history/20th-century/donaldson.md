**Simon Donaldson** is an English mathematician who received a Fields Medal for his work on 4 dimensional manifolds.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Fields Medal in 1986 for his contributions to the study of topology, geometry and gauge theory. 
2. Received the Crafoord Prize in 2008, which is annually granted by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, for his work in 4-dimensional topology. 
3. Made major breakthroughs in understanding the properties of 4-manifolds, by constructing differentiable structures on them.
4. His research has introduced new techniques and theories to modern mathematics and had a major impact on the field of differentiable geometry and topology. 
5. Made contributions to Seiberg-Witten theory, a branch of mathematical physics. 
6. Received the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics in 2014 for his decades of work on Geometry and Topology. 
7. Has served as a professor at the Imperial College London and Stony Brook University. 
8. Was appointed as the President of the International Mathematical Union in 2018.
