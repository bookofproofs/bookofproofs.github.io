**George Carrier** was considered to be one of the best applied mathematicians the United States ever produced. He loved applied mathematical problems developing complex mathematical models, which he solved with ingenious approximations and asymptotic results.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an expression that relates combinations, permutations, and binomial coefficients. 
2. Developed the Laplace expansion of determinants. 
3. Developed Carrier's method for determining the roots of a polynomial. 
4. Developed the elementary exponential theorem. 
5. Proved the identity between gamma functions. 
6. Demonstrated the skew-symmetric property of a determinant. 
7. Extended the associative law to vector products. 
8. Established the connection between vector analysis and quaternions. 
9. Posed several challenging problems in the theory of curves. 
10. Developed a new method for the construction of linear orthogonal systems of polynomials.

Born 4 May1918, Millinocket, Maine, USA. Died 8 March 2002, Wayland, Middlesex, Massachusetts, USA.
