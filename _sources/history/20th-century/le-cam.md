**Lucien Le Cam** was a French mathematician and statistician who moved to America and produced important resuls in asymptotic theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed influential methods of estimation theory
2. Co-authored the book “Decision Making Under Risk and Uncertainty” with Lars Peter Hansen and Paul Rutgers, which advanced the use of Bayesian Decision Theory
3. His contributions to maximum likelihood estimation earned him the 1973 Gauss Prize, the highest distinction in statistics
4. Developed the Likelihood Principle and provided a theory for the asymptotic structure of maximum likelihood estimators
5. Established the Le Cam inequality for comparison of two statistical models 
6. Established the likelihood ratio test for comparing hypotheses
7. Developed important approaches for refining asymptotic approximations
8. Made contributions to Neyman-Pearson generalizations
9. Developed statistical learning theory 
10. Developed techniques for automatically building high-level computer models from data

Born 18 November 1924, Croze, Creuse, France. Died 25 April 2000, Berkeley, California, USA.
