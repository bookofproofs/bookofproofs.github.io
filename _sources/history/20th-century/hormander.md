**Lars Hörmander** was a Swedish mathematician who won a Fields medal and a Wolf prize for his work on partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received the Fields Medal in 1962 for his work on linear partial differential equations (PDEs).
2. Developed the concept of Fourier integral operators for PDEs.
3. Made important contributions to the study of hyperbolic equations, a class of linear PDEs.
4. Proved Hörmander's theorem, also known as the hypoelliptic theorem.
5. Published major works including The Analysis of Linear Partial Differential Operators and Linear Partial Differential Operators.
6. Received the prestigious Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1988 for his contribution to the theory of partial differential equations. 
7. Was the president of the International Mathematical Union from 1983 to 1986.

Born 24 January 1931, Mjällby, Blekinge, Sweden. Died 25 November 2012, Lund, Sweden.
