**Israel Gohberg** was a Bessarabian-born mathematician who worked in operator theory and functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Gohberg then entered the College of Education in Frunze.
* Gohberg's teachers at the College of Education were so impressed with his abilities that persuaded him to move to a university.
* After graduating from University of Kishinyov, Gohberg went to the University of Leningrad to study for his doctorate which he received in 1954.
* Gohberg was appointed to the Academy of Sciences in Kishinyov where, in 1964, he became the Head of Functional Analysis.
* By 1969 Gohberg had made the decision to try to emigrate to Israel but only after great difficulty, and a long wait, did Gohberg and his family obtain the visa necessary for them to leave.
* After obtaining the visa in 1974, he emigrated to Israel.
* Once in Israel, he was appointed to a professorship at Tel Aviv University and he also was appointed to the Weizman Institute in Rehovot.
* In addition to Gohberg's outstanding work in analysis and in particular in operator theory and matrix methods, he founded the major international journal Integral equations and operator theory in the late 1980s.
* Gohberg has an amazing publication record with over 460 papers listed in Mathematical Reviews.
* Israel Gohberg had been described as one of the exceptional mathematicians of our time, comparable in his manner perhaps only to Paul Erd≈ës.
* Gohberg has received many awards for his outstanding work including the Alexander von Humboldt Prize in 1992 and an honorary degree from the Institute of Technology in Darmstadt in June 1997.

Born 23 August 1928, Tarutino, Romania (now Tarutyne, Ukraine). Died 12 October 2009, Kfar Saba, Israel.
