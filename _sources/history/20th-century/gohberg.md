**Israel Gohberg** was a Bessarabian-born mathematician who worked in operator theory and functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the theory of operator determinants, one of the main tools of modern functional analysis.
2. Developed the theory of linearization, which revolutionized the field of functional analysis and led to the development of new concepts in algebra and analysis.
3. Developed the theory of regularization, an early method for solving systems of equations.
4. Discovered the generalized eigenvalue problem, one of the central results in the development of functional analysis.
5. Clarified structural properties of various characteristic classes of linear operators, including the index of a Fredholm operator.
6. Ranked among the founders of modern operator theory and linear algebra, with other works including the development of the abstract form of structure theory of *-algebras.
7. Authored five important books on operator theory, linear algebra, and their applications.

Born 23 August 1928, Tarutino, Romania (now Tarutyne, Ukraine). Died 12 October 2009, Kfar Saba, Israel.
