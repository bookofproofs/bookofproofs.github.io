**Clifford Truesdell** was an American mathematician best known as a historian of science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of rational thermodynamics, which described the physical and mathematical relations between temperature, energy, and phase change.
2. Developed a thermodynamical characterization of simple fluids and phenomena related to them, thereby providing the mathematical basis of liquefaction theory.
3. Recognized the pragmatic relevance of geometric concepts and extended their application to mechanics and hydrodynamics.
4. Contributed to the postwar renewal of the tradition of mathematical research in continuum mechanics and rejuvenated the field of rational mechanics.
5. Developed the theory of simultaneous approximation and reflexivity, which helped to create a solid foundation for applied mechanics.
6. Introduced the concept of inequalities in the continuity of a function, which was of great importance for the theoretical foundation of physical findings.
7. Developed the mathematical models of the normal stress law and applied the theories to the stress and strain relationships of elastic bodies.
8. Established the foundational aspects of continuum thermodynamics and became recognized as the founder of modern thermomechanics. 
9. Founded the field of statistical thermodynamics, which deals with the study and optimization of macroscopic energy states.
10. Led the most comprehensive research into the equations of nonlinear elasticity, which is now a cornerstone of the mathematical theory of elasticity.

Born 18 February 1919, Los Angeles, California, USA. Died 14 January 2000, Baltimore, USA.
