**Charles Ehresmann** was a French mathematician who worked in differential topology and category theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Charles, however, was from that time on taught in French.
* In 1924 Ehresmann entered the École Normale Supérieure in Paris.
* After spending the years 1928-29 in Rabat, Ehresmann continued his education going to Göttingen to undertake research.

* Ehresmann followed the moves of the university then, in 1955, a chair of topology was specially created for him in the University of Paris.
* Ehresmann was one of the creators of differential topology.
* Beginning in 1941, Ehresmann made major contributions toward establishing the current view of fibre spaces, manifolds, foliations and jets.
* After 1957 Ehresmann became a leader in category theory and he worked in this area for 20 years.
* Between 1980 and 1983 Andrée Charles Ehresmann, his wife, edited his complete works.
* These appeared in seven volumes: Charles Ehresmann: Oeuvres complètes et commentées Ⓣ(Charles Ehresmann: Complete Works and commentaries) as supplements to the Journal Cahiers de Topologie et Géometrie Différentielle Categoriques which Charles Ehresmann created in 1957.
