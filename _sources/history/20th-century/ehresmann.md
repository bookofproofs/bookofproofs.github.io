**Charles Ehresmann** was a French mathematician who worked in differential topology and category theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1.He was a major developer of the theory of fiber bundles. 
2.He advanced the theory of categories and functors. 
3.He provided the first explicit description of the exponential map, which has many useful applications in geometry and dynamical systems.
4.He introduced the concept of a connection (resp. Ehresmann connection) on a fiber bundle and proved the fundamental theorem of Ehresmann, which gave rise to a deep geometric intuition for differential calculus and its applications.
5.He contributed to the development of a description of topological spaces and objects known as the Ehresmann-Scheerer theorem. 
6.He developed the category theory and the generalized inverse limit theory to algebraic topology and homology theory. 
7.He constructed a geometric interpretation of homological algebra
8.He was a major exponent of the homotopical approach to PDEs. 
9.He put forth a highly stylized system of axioms for geometry related to the category of smooth invertible functions.

Born 19 April 1905, Strasbourg, Alsace (now France). Died 22 September 1979, Amiens France.
