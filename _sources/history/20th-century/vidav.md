**Ivan Vidav** was a Slovenian mathematician who worked in differential equations, functional analysis and algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Vidav-Kolmogorov wave equation to better explain phenomena related to wave propagation. 
2. Developed the now-standard variant of the finite-element method to solve the Poisson equation. 
3. Contributed to the development of concepts such as the solution of linear equations in a finite dimensional space and the Gaussian distribution. 
4. Developed the Five Moments Theorem which describes the behavior of certain sets of functions. 
5. Participated in the development of Lie algebra and its application to several fields in physics and mathematics. 
6. Discovered the famous Cantor set, which describes the structure of some infinite sets. 
7. Developed the Vidav-Kurzweil-Vidav Method (VKVM) for solving non-linear equations. 
8. Developed the Vidav-Jordan Linearization Method (VLJM) to solve equations involving linear operators. 
9. Developed the Vidav-Kolmogorov Theory (VKT) to explain the behavior of non-linear equations. 
10. Developed the Vidav-Gelfand-Vidav Theorem (VGVT), a theorem related to the representation of semigroups.

Born 17 January 1918, Opcine, near Trieste, Italy. Died 6 October 2015, Ljubljana, Slovenia.
