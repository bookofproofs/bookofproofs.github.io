**Gordon Pask** was an English polymath who made contributions to a wide variety of areas including cybernetics and psychology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the ‘Conversation Theory’, an interdisciplinary approach to the study of interactive systems.
2. Co-founded the Cybernetics Society with W. Ross Ashby and C. H. Waddington in 1948.
3. Proposed the ‘Lattice Theory’ and ‘Interaction Transformation Model’ in the 1950s.
4. Pioneered self-organising systems and autonomous agents in the 1985 essay ‘Pask on Autopoiesis’.
5. Developed the ‘Collaboratory-in-Action’, a form of open-ended problem solving process.
6. Pioneered ‘Collaborative Optimisation’, a method to study complex systems.
7. Published several works on mathematical models of learning, including ‘An Approach to Cybernetics’.
