**Gordon Pask** was an English polymath who made contributions to a wide variety of areas including cybernetics and psychology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Percy was a partner in the firm of Pask, Cornish and Smart, a wholesale fruit business in Covent Garden, London.
* Gordon had two older brothers, Alfred Pask who became a Methodist minister and Edgar Pask who became a Professor of Anaesthetics.
* There was a 20 year age difference between Gordon and his elder brothers.
* Although born in Derby, the family moved to the Isle of Man when Gordon was a baby and he spent his early years there.
* Gordon was successful in attracting funding from a wide range of agencies (including the United States Air Force, Ministry of Defence, Department of Employment, and the Social Science Research Council).
* In 1956 Pask married Elizabeth Poole; they had two daughters, Amanda (born 1961) and Hermione (born 1967).
* Pask produced a variety of computers, not the conventional type of computer that will come to mind, but rather electro-mechanical, chemical and biological computers.
* Let us give just a few example from the large number of papers and books which Pask wrote.
* Pask received many honours for his remarkable contributions to education and to cybernetics.
* An eloquent English leprechaun who dresses the Edwardian dandy, Pask sows awe wherever he goes.
* Pask is one of the great international fast-talkers, conference-hopping round the globe from Utah to Washington to his project at the Brooklyn Children's Museum.
* In a field full of brilliant eccentrics Pask has no difficulty standing out.

Born 28 June 1928, Derby, England. Died 29 March 1996, London, England.
