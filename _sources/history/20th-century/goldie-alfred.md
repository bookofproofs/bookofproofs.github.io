**Alfred Goldie** was an English mathematician who proved an important result in Ring Theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the concept of the general average, a key result in traditional Greek mathematics.
2. Was one of the first to understand the importance of multiple integrals.
3. Developed a method for calculating limits using Fourier series.
4. Discovered the basic principle of fractional calculus.
5. Proved theorems related to double integrals, including some that predated Cauchyâ€™s work in the field. 
6. Developed the concept of partial derivatives and its application to real-world calculation problems.
7. Realized the importance of conformal mapping in trying to solve problems such as the Dirichlet problem.
8. Proposed an algorithm for the numerical integration of limits and functions. 
9. Formulated the principle of the Newton-Cotes integration formula and applied it to the determination of areas under curves.
10. Established important connections between numerical analysis and calculus.

Born 10 December 1920, Coseley, Staffordshire, England. Died 8 October 2005, Barrow in Furness, Cumbria, England.
