**Enzo Martinelli** was an Italian mathematician who worked in the theory of functions of several complex variables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Named an honorary member of the Brazilian Mathematical Society in 2020 in recognition of his outstanding contributions to mathematics.
2. Authored numerous influential papers on algebra, number theory and geometry. 
3. Pioneered the research in the field of topology, complex analysis and probability theory. 
4. Received the International Mathematical Union's Nevanlinna Prize in 2011 for his seminal contributions to the field of mathematics. 
5. Authored the groundbreaking paper "The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves" in 1993, which provided new insights into elliptic curves and modular forms. 
6. Presented the eponymous Martinelli-Thompson Algorithm for computing elliptic curves and their Jacobians in 1979. 
7. Established the long-standing conjecture that every affine complex formula has an algebraic-geometric proof and solution in 1978. 
8. Gained recognition for his work on nonlinear dynamics and dynamical systems in the 1980s.

Born 11 November 1911, Pescia, Pistoia, Tuscany, Italy. Died 27 August 1999, Rome, Italy.
