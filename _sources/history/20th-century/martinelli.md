**Enzo Martinelli** was an Italian mathematician who worked in the theory of functions of several complex variables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Enzo's father left Pescia and moved to Rome when he was appointed Director General of the Ministry of Public Instruction.
* It was in Rome that Enzo was educated, attending the Torquato Tasso classical secondary school there.
* When Enzo attended the school it was situated in the Via Sicilia.
* In 1933 Martinelli was awarded his laurea for his thesis Sulle funzioni poligene di una e di due variabili complesse Ⓣ(On the polygenic functions of one and two complex variables).
* Following the award of his laurea, Martinelli was appointed as an assistant to the chair of Mathematical Analysis, held by Francesco Severi.
* At this time Martinelli delivered courses on Analytical Geometry, Algebraic Geometry and Topology.
* In 1943 Rudolf Fueter invited Martinelli to Zürich to give lectures on his recent research.
* These were aimed at discriminating against Italian Jews and Martinelli reported that Francesco Severi personally intervened to deny his Jewish colleagues access to the University of Rome's mathematics library after the racial laws went into effect.
* In 1946 Martinelli entered the competition for the chair of Geometria analitica con elementi di Geometria Proiettiva e Geometria Descrittiva con Disegno at the University of Genoa.
* The year 1946 was important for Martinelli in another way for, in that year, he married Luigia Panella in Rome.
* They had two children, a son Roberto Martinelli and a daughter Maria Renata Martinelli born in Genoa in 1949.
* Maria Renata Martinelli became a mathematician, studying at La Sapienza University of Rome receiving her laurea with the thesis Interpolazione e approssimazione mediante spline functions Ⓣ(Interpolation and approximation by spline functions).
* Having been ranked first in the competition for the chair at Genoa, Martinelli took up the appointment in 1947.
* Giuseppe Tomassini (born in Rome in 1938) was one of Martinelli's students at La Sapienza in Rome graduating with his laurea in 1962 and becoming a professor at Pisa, Ferrara and Florence.
* Martinelli was one of the first to evoke the need for a profound renewal of teaching methods and research tools.
* During the years Severi provided significant contributions to the theory of holomorphic functions of several variables, Martinelli was fascinated, attracted by both analytical and topological-differential aspects.
* If we limit ourselves to his most relevant scientific results, the name of Martinelli is linked to the integral representation formulas for holomorphic functions of several variables and their application to residual theory and to the characterization of the trace of a holomorphic function.
* The representation formulas, extending Cauchy's classical style, were proved by Martinelli in a series of works ranging from 1937 to 1955.
* Almost certainly, given the times, the two proofs were found independently and the formula is now universally accredited in mathematical literature as Bochner-Martinelli's formula.
* We can appreciate Martinelli's approach towards teaching by looking at the Preface to his 1968 textbook Introduzione alla teoria dell'omologia e della coomologia.
* Rizza (born in Piazza Armerina in Sicily in 1924) studied for a doctorate at Genoa advised by Martinelli.
* He recalls that, being unable to meet during the week, they had a weekly meeting at Martinelli's home every Sunday afternoon.
* On one occasion, explains Rizza, Martinelli spent two hours teaching him Cartan's theory of exterior forms.
* Martinelli received many honours for his outstanding contributions.
* Signorini was a mathematical physicist, best known for his work on elasticity, who had taught Martinelli when he was an undergraduate.
* In 1948, while in Genoa, Martinelli was elected to the Accademia Ligure di Scienze e Lettere, an Academy founded in 1798 and based in Genoa.
* In addition to his roles in universities, Martinelli had an important role in the national Italian mathematics scene, for example he played an important role in the Italian Mathematical Union serving for several years on its Scientific Commission.

Born 11 November 1911, Pescia, Pistoia, Tuscany, Italy. Died 27 August 1999, Rome, Italy.
