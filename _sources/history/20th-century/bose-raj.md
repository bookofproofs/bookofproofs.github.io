**Raj Chandra Bose** was an Indian mathematician and statistician who worked in America. He best known for his work in design theory, finite geometry and the theory of error-correcting codes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Primitive Element Theorem, which states a field can be generated by a primitive element.
2. Found the Condition for Independence of Sets of Vectors over an Abelian Field which demonstrate that a set of vectors is linearly independent if and only if every minor of its components vanishes. 
3. Devised the Theory of Partial Geometries which involves mathematical objects like points, lines, planes and hyperplanes, and which has many implications in fields like cryptography. 
4. Invented Finite Geometry which helps in better understanding of inter-dimensional interactions.
5. Discovered a number of combinatorial results like the Hamming Weight Enumerator and Boseâ€“Chowla theorem.
6. Developed the Theory of Non-Singular Matrices, described properties of non-singular matrices, and issued results on their ranks, inverses, and permanent.

Born 19 June 1901, Hoshangabad, Madhya Pradesh, India. Died 31 October 1987, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.
