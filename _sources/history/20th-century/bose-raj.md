**Raj Chandra Bose** was an Indian mathematician and statistician who worked in America. He best known for his work in design theory, finite geometry and the theory of error-correcting codes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After completing his schooling at the Government High School in Rohtak, Bose entered the Hindu College in Delhi in April 1917.
* Raj Chandra Bose was lost in his books.
* Raj Chandra took his B.A. examination and passed it successfully.
* However Bose's teaching job prevented him attending most of the lectures for the MA courses up to April 1923 when his position at St Stephens High School came to an end.
* After the award of an MA in Pure Mathematics, First Class, in 1927, Bose remained in Calcutta (its official name today is Kolkata) working as a research associate from January 1928 to December 1929.
* From 1935 he had a full-time position at the Indian Statistical Institute as did Samarendra Nath Roy who had been appointed to a part-time post a few months after Bose.
* Mahalanobis was the first head of the Department of Statistics but, in 1945, he gave up this position and Bose became the Head.
* Despite publishing a host of outstanding papers, Bose had never taken a doctorate and, in order to become a professor, he now required to rectify that.
* Invitations came for Bose to spend time as a visiting professor in the United States.
* Bose's name is an integral part of the terms BCH codes, Bose-Mesner algebra, and the like, and he was one of "Euler's spoilers".
* First of we note that a BCH code is a Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem error correcting code, discovered in 1960.
* After taking up the position at Chapel Hill in 1949, Bose remained on the staff there until he retired in August 1971.
* After he retired in 1971, Bose was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Statistics at Colorado State University, Fort Collins.
* Many honours were bestowed on Bose both from his native country of India and from the United States.
* Following his death, the Indian Statistical Institute held its 'Conference on Combinatorial Mathematics and Applications' in memory of Bose in Calcutta in December 1988.
* In December 2002 the Indian Statistical Institute held the 'R C Bose Centennial Symposium on Discrete Mathematics and Applications' in Calcutta.
* One of his friends said of Bose "...
* Mrs Bose lives between them near Philadelphia.
* Finally let us record that Bose had several hobbies other than travelling which was noted in the quote above.

Born 19 June 1901, Hoshangabad, Madhya Pradesh, India. Died 31 October 1987, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.
