**Tim Pedley** is an English mathematician whose principal research interest is the application of fluid mechanics to biology and medicine.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the mathematical theory of turbulence, which revolutionized aeronautical engineering.
2. Developed advanced analytical tools for the study of turbulence and other nonlinear bulk flows.
3. Discovered and clarified the connection between physical and Fourier-space treatment of nonlinear dynamics.
4. Formulated the mathematical equations for the phenomenon of hydrodynamic turbulence.
5. Coined the term “eddy-current” in describing the interaction of convective and diffusive motions in turbulent flows.
6. Carried out pioneering work on the implications of turbulence for boundary layers in inviscid and adhesive fluids.
7. Published several monographs and journal papers on the principles of turbulence and structural analysis in fluid mechanics.
8. Developed a full mathematical theory of three-dimensional turbulent flows and other nonlinear phenomena.
9. Made significant contributions to the field of fluid mechanics by developing new models to explain existing flow phenomena.
10. Established a laboratory where turbulent flows in a wind tunnel could be studied in detail.

Born 23 March 1942, Leicester, England.
