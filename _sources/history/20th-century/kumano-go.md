**Hitoshi Kumano-Go** was a Japanese mathematician who specialised in partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Entering Osaka University after graduating from high school, Kumano-Go studied mathematics and graduated in 1958.
* As is frequently the case, the problem which Kumano-Go studied was to extend work which had been completed earlier by his supervisor.
* In 1962 Kumano-Go was appointed as an assistant at Osaka University.
* During these years Kumano-Go published a series of papers which studied the local and global uniqueness of the solutions of the Cauchy problem for partial differential equations.
* In two papers Kumano-Go also studied non-uniqueness of solutions of the Cauchy problem.
* Kumano-Go spent the two academic years 1967-69 visiting the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University.
* These were years of great benefit to Kumano-Go who was able to develop many ideas in conversations with Kurt Friedrichs, Peter Lax, Louis Nirenberg and others.
* In 1971 Kumano-Go was promoted to full professor.
* One other important monograph written by Kumano-Go should be mentioned.
* In addition to his work on pseudo-differential operators, Kumano-Go published a series of papers on the product of Fourier integral operators.
* Kumano-Go suffered ill health and was admitted to Osaka Hospital in May 1981.
* At the height of his mathematical contributions at the age of 46, Kumano-Go sadly died.

Born 4 October 1935, Arita, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. Died 24 August 1982, Osaka, Japan.
