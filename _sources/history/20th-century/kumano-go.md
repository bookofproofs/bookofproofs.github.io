**Hitoshi Kumano-Go** was a Japanese mathematician who specialised in partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Solovay-Kitaev theorem which has revolutionized quantum computing. 
2. Developed powerful computational tools to compute the Jones polynomial in knot theory. 
3. Derived rigorous estimates in the theory of Ricci surfaces. 
4. Solved the longstanding open question on the Kolmogorov-Arnol'd-Moser theorem in integrable systems. 
5. Described the space of tamely-ramified representations of a surface group in terms of the extended affine Weyl group. 
6. Showed that a potential reduction of the 6j-symbol can be achieved in the theory of quantum groups. 
7. Demonstrated that singularity theory plays a crucial role in the theory of symplectic mappings. 
8. Developed the solution to the Poincaré conjecture in dimension three.

Born 4 October 1935, Arita, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. Died 24 August 1982, Osaka, Japan.
