**Elias Stein** was a Belgian-born American mathematician who worked in the field of harmonic analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the first multidimensional singular integrals and developed the theory of singular integrals related to partial differential equations.
2. Devised analytic proofs of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg and Sobolev inequalities.
3. Demonstrated modular forms form a dense subset of L2[0,1).
4. Introduced harmonic analysis on real reductive groups and studied smoothness properties of extended solutions of partial differential equations.
5. Developed support theory based on Calderón’s theory of singular integrals.
 6. Developed a new approach for studying singular integrals that was based on integration by parts and oscillatory integrals.
7. Influenced many areas of mathematics, including harmonic analysis, operator theory, partial differential equations, and representation theory.

Born 13 January 1931, Antwerp, Belgium. Died 23 December 2018, Somerville, New Jersey, USA.
