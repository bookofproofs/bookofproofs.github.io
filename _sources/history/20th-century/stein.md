**Elias Stein** was a Belgian-born American mathematician who worked in the field of harmonic analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Elias was nine years old when the German armies invaded Belgium in May 1940.
* There they settled in New York and Elias attended Stuyvesant High School.
* After the award of his bachelor's degree in 1951, Stein remained at Chicago studying for his Master's degree.
* Stein held an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship during 1955-56 and was appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956.
* In 1958 Stein returned to the University of Chicago where he was appointed as an Assistant Professor.
* In 1961 Stein was promoted to Associate Professor at Chicago.
* Stein is the world's leading authority in harmonic analysis.
* Also in 1970 Stein published Singular integrals and differentiability properties of functions.
* In this book, Princeton professor Elias Stein, a leading mathematical innovator as well as a gifted expositor, produced what has been called the most influential mathematics text in the last thirty-five years.
* One reason for its success as a text is its almost legendary presentation: Stein takes arcane material, previously understood only by specialists, and makes it accessible even to beginning graduate students.
* Singular integrals were known to only a few specialists when Stein's book was first published.
* In 1984 Stein was awarded the American Mathematical Society's Leroy P Steele Prize for this book.
* This, however, was not the only Leroy P Steele Prize won by Stein for in 2002 he received the Leroy P Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement.
* Besides his contributions through his own research and excellent monographs, Stein has worked with and influenced many students, who have gone on to make profound contributions of their own.
* Many other major prizes have been awarded to Stein.
* Stein has made decisive contributions through his research, his expository efforts, and his training of graduate students.
* Stein's fusion of complex analysis, partial differential equations, analysis on nilpotent Lie groups, and Euclidean harmonic analysis has deeply influenced countless mathematicians.
* In 2001, Princeton University awarded Stein its President's Award for Distinguished Teaching.
* Let us return to looking at the outstanding books Stein has published.
* In 1971 Analytic continuation of group representations appeared based on a series of James Whittemore lectures that Stein had given at Yale University in November 1967.
* Also in 1971, in collaboration with Guido Weiss, Stein published Introduction to Fourier analysis on Euclidean spaces.
* Other books by Stein include: Boundary behavior of holomorphic functions of several complex variables (1992); (with P C Greiner) Estimates for the âˆ‚-Neumann problem (1977); (with Alexander Nagel) Lectures on pseudodifferential operators: regularity theorems and applications to nonelliptic problems (1979); (with G B Folland) Hardy spaces on homogeneous groups (1982); Harmonic analysis: real-variable methods, orthogonality, and oscillatory integrals (1993) based on the three Milliman Lectures he gave in 1991-92; and (with Rami Shakarchi) Fourier analysis: An introduction (2003).
* In addition to the prizes and awards we have mentioned above, Stein has been honoured with election to membership of the National Academy of Sciences (1974) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1982).
* Two of Stein's doctoral students, Charles Fefferman and Terence Tao, have won Fields medals.
* Before Stein tells you his solution, the problems involved look utterly hopeless.

Born 13 January 1931, Antwerp, Belgium. Died 23 December 2018, Somerville, New Jersey, USA.
