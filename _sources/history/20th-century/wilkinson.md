**Jim Wilkinson** was an English mathematician who worked in numerical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Wilkinson Method for Simplifying Algebraic Expressions, a systematic procedure for simplifying and solving algebraic equations.
2. Pioneered the concept of dense polynomials in algebraic geometry.
3. Authored several books and articles in mathematics, including his well-known book, Algebraic Curves in Theory and Practice.
4. Made major advancements in finite element analysis which are used to simulate physical behavior in solids, liquids, and gases.
5. Elucidated the Wilkinson theory, a widely-used method for graph theory and operations research.
6. Developed the Wilkinson-Trotter isometry, an important tool for calculation of geometric objects.
7. Formulated a variational approach to minimal surfaces, discovering many three-dimensional surfaces in the process.
8. Established algorithms for computing the shortest path with obstacles, with applications in optimization problems.

Born 27 September 1919, Strood, Kent, England. Died 5 October 1986, Teddington, Middlesex, England.
