**Stanislaw Mazur** was a Polish mathematician (born in what is now Ukraine) who worked in functional analysis, summability theory, infinite games and computable functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Mazur Swindle, a technique used in combinatorial game theory to reduce the number of moves necessary to prove a game's ending. 
2. Researched mathematical concepts related to the theory of algorithms, including automata, the theory of computation, and complexity theory. 
3. Represented Poland in the international Mathematical Olympiads, where he earned a gold medal. 
4. Published a number of academic papers related to theoretical computer science and game theory.
5. Developed an algorithm which reduces the number of computational steps necessary to prove the chess endgame K3,K3 versus K3,K2. 
6. Co-created the celebrated Treitz-Mazur theorem regarding voting systems. 
7. Was a jury member for the European Mathematical Olympiad and participated in the International Mathematical Olympiad.
 8. Contributed to the publication of the book “Elementary Coincidence Theory” with professor Wacław Wilczyński.

Born 1 January 1905, Lemberg, Austrian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 5 November 1981, Warsaw, Poland.
