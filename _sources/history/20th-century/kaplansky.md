**Irving Kaplansky** was a Canadian mathematician who made major contributions to ring theory, group theory and field theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Kaplansky Density Theorem, a fundamental result in the field of set theory.
2. Published more than 300 papers pertaining to mathematical subjects, including linear algebra, topology, analysis, and algebraic geometry.
3. Established a ring of polynomials to explain the structure of fields and the behavior of linear transformations.
4. Authored several important books on mathematics, such as "Linear Algebra and Geometry" and "A Mathematicianâ€™s Apology".
5. Invented the Kaplansky invariant, a tool used to classify finitely generated bimodules; it has been described as an "important generational milestone" in module theory.
6. Co-introduced the concept of zero-divisors in polynomial rings of several variables.
7. Authored an article in 1951 on the geometry of Banach spaces which has been featured in books such as "Function Analysis" and "Theory of Banach Spaces".
8. Contributed to the study of non-associative algebras, particularly the Wedderburn-Artin theorem.

Born 22 March 1917, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Died 25 June 2006, Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, California, USA.
