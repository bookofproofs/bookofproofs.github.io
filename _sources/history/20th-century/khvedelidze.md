**Boris Khvedelidze** was a Georgian mathematician who worked in the partial differential equations, integral equations, and mathematical physics. He was appointed as a Vice-President of the re-formed Georgian Mathematical Society in 1962.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Khvedelidze Interpolation Formula.
2. Demonstrated a new numerical procedure for solving singular integral equations with a kernel on an infinite interval.
3. Successfully solved a number of problems in the theory of functions of two real variables.
4. Constructed new solutions to the Cauchy problem for systems of first order linear partial differential equations.
5. Established a numerical method of recognition of characteristics of linear second order partial differential equations in several variables.
6. Derived a nonlinear equation that is related to the Riemann hypothesis.
7. Wrote a comprehensive monograph on systems theory.

Born 7 November 1915. Died 27 March 1993.
