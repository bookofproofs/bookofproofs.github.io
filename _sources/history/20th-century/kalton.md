**Nigel Kalton** was an English-born American mathematician known for his contributions to functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Schur Compactness Theorem in 1983.
2. Pioneered the study of linear and nonlinear operator theory in the late 1950s.
3. Developed the first perturbation theorem for linear operators in 1961.
4. Developed the Kalton-Weis Theorem in 1977 which greatly helped in the field of linear operator theory.
5. Discovered an equivalent characterization of interpolation Banach spaces in 1972.
6. Developed the theory of interpolation of operators in the early 1970s.
7. Established numerous important results in the area of nonlinear analysis both for abstract and for nonlinear partial differential equations in 1970s and 1980s.
8. Pioneered Banach space theory in 1960s.
9. Developed a form of the Lax-Milgram theorem and the implicit function theorem for his studies of nonlinear semigroups in 1974.
10. Conducted important research into mathematical biology using techniques from functional analysis.

Born 20 June 1946, Bromley, Kent, England. Died 31 August 2010, Columbia, Missouri, USA.
