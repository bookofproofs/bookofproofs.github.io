**Naum Il'ich Feldman** was a Russian mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Feldman was called up to serve in the Russian army in June and by October 1941 he was totally involved in the battle against the advancing German troops.
* The Russians began to counter-attack the German armies around Moscow and Feldman saw action for the first time in this bitter fighting.
* For his part in this siege Feldman was awarded a medal "For the Taking of KÃ¶nigsberg".
* At the end the war Feldman was with the Russian armies in East Prussia.
* Since so much of Feldman's later work was based on the work he undertook for this thesis we give a brief overview of its main results at this point.
* Feldman proved in his thesis Borel type results (called the measure of transcendence) for logarithms of algebraic numbers, obtaining estimates for the lower bound depending (as did Gelfond) on both the degree of PPP and the maximum modulus of its coefficients.
* After the award of his Ph.D., Feldman was sent to the Ufimskii Oil Institute where he was appointed as Head of the Department of Mathematics.
* In addition to his work on the measure of transcendence of numbers, Feldman also produced many results strengthening Liouville's theorem on the rational approximation of algebraic numbers.
* The power of Feldman's results in this area lie in the fact that he was able to give effective constants rather than just prove the existence of such constants.
* In 1982 Feldman published a 312 page text Hilbert's seventh problem.
* Naum Il'ich stood out by his great integrity, high principles, goodness and benevolence.

Born 26 November 1918, Melitopol, Zaporozhye oblast, Ukraine. Died 20 April 1994, Moscow, Russia.
