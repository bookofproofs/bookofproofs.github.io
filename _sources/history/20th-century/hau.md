**Lene Hau** is a Danish physicist and mathematician. She has led a team at Harvard University who have slowed light and in 2001 succeeded in stopping a beam of light. This has important applications to quantum computing.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an experimental method for the manipulation of Bose–Einstein condensates using laser light. 
2. Derived a mathematical model of this process to explain the transverse acceleration of condensates.
3. Discovered an entirely new type of wave motion called "quantum steering" in an experiment using liquid helium. 
4. Performed the experiments and created mathematical models to understand the basic properties of lasers and optics.
5. Established the Gaussian wave packet ansatz to map the time-dependent Schrodinger Equation to a single integro-differential equation.
6. Found a new type of dispersion relation which can explain complicated nonlinear dynamics even in high density regimes.
7. Explored the effects of phase noise on Bose–Einstein condensates, and developed an improved method to control these effects.
8. Demonstrated the reversibility of matter waves and the effect of Berry phase in a degenerate gas.
9. Developed the Schrodinger-Loss equation to describe the dynamics of ultracold bosonic gases in the presence of atom losses.
10. Contributed to the development of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its application to Bose–Einstein condensates.

Born 13 November 1959, Vejle, Denmark.
