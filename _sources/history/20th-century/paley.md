**Raymond Paley** was an English mathematician who worked in interpolation and allied trigonometrical problems.  He died in a skiing accident.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Raymond's father died in Nordrach Sanatorium, Clutton, Somerset on 11 September 1906 before his son (our mathematician) was born and his mother married Neville Edward Anning Gardner, a planter, on 28 June 1910.
* Raymond Paley was educated at Eton.
* Paley had already proved impressive results on Fourier series and had collaborated with Littlewood, his supervisor.
* Zygmund discovered Paley's extraordinary talent and the two worked jointly on existence proofs, brilliantly applying ideas from Borel's Calcul des probabilités dénombrables.
* Zygmund's book Trigonometric Series published in 1935 owes a debt to the joint work that he carried out with Paley.
* Norbert Wiener was proving important results in areas of interest to Paley so he applied for a Rockefeller International Research Fellowship to allow him to travel to the United States to collaborate with him at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
* For a young man of 26, Paley had collaborated with a remarkable group of mathematicians.
* Already with a reputation remarkable for one so young, Paley stood on the brink of becoming one of the very first rank of research mathematicians.
* Mr Paley was skiing alone at an altitude of 9,600 ft, but his death was witnessed by companions lower down the mountainside.
* Norbert Wiener gave the Colloquium Lectures of the American Mathematical Society in 1934 and spoke on Paley's work.
* Paley was to have been a Colloquium Lecturer himself.
* In a group notable for its brilliant technique, no one had developed this technique to a higher degree than Paley.

Born 7 January 1907, Bournemouth, England. Died 7 April 1933, Banff, Alberta, Canada.
