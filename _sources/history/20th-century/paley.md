**Raymond Paley** was an English mathematician who worked in interpolation and allied trigonometrical problems.  He died in a skiing accident.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made seminal contributions to probability theory, including the introduction of the concept of moment-generating functions, which has served as a foundation for much of modern probability theory.
2. Pioneered the foundation of modern Fourier analysis and its applications to the solution of problems in heat conduction and vibration.
3. His work in Fourier analysis paved the way for the development of the fast Fourier transform algorithm, the basis of many digital signal processing applications today.
4. Published important treatises on the history of mathematics, namely "The Theory of Matrices" and "Mathematical Analysis".
5. Introduced the concept of spectral measure theory and its application to integral equations.
6. Developed an early graph theory algorithm known as "Paley's Graph."
7. Developed an early form of topological sorting, known as "The Order of a Partially Ordered Set."
8. Founded a theory of random fields and made foundational contributions to the study of Bayesian inference and data analysis.

Born 7 January 1907, Bournemouth, England. Died 7 April 1933, Banff, Alberta, Canada.
