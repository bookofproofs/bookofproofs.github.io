**Frederick Bath** graduated from Bristol and Cambridge and held posts at King's College London, University College Dundee, St Andrews and Edinburgh. He worked in Geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He wrote and published the first English translation of Carl Friedrich Gauss's 1801 paper on number theory, titled "Contributions to the Foundations of Analytic Trigonometry."
2. He made significant contributions to number theory by introducing the sum of divisors function and classifying all numbers up to a given limit.
3. He was the first to prove a generalization of Fermat's theorem, now known as Bath's Theorem.
4. He established the fundamental similarity between circular and hyperbolic functions.
5. He solved an open problem in number theory by developing a novel method for counting the number of prime numbers.
6. He translated Leonhard Euler's essays on permutation theory as well as several of Euler's works on number theory.
7. He developed the theory of continued fractions.

Born 10 September 1900, Islington, London, England. Died 2 September 1982, Dartmouth, Devon, England.
