** C R Rao**  is an Indian-born mathematician and statistician who has worked most of his life in America. His statistical work has been applied in many fields.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Calyampudi Radhakrishna completed his first two years schooling in Gudur, his next two in Nuzvid, and then grades 6 and 7 in Nandigama, all towns in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
* The most significant result CR obtained during this period is now called the Cram√©r-Rao inequality and gives a bound for the variance of an unbiased estimate of a parameter.
* Least squares and alternatives (1995), and (with M B Rao) Matrix algebra and its applications to statistics and econometrics (1998).
* C R Rao has received so many honours that it would be quite impossible to list them all.
* The Journal of Quantitative Economics published a special issue in Rao's honour in 1991.
* One of the purposes of this special issue is to recognize Dr Rao's own contributions to econometrics and acknowledge his major role in the development of econometric research in India.
* C R Rao has served as president of five statistical societies: the Indian Econometric Society (1971-1976); the International Biometric Society (1973-1975); the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (1976-1977); the International Statistical Institute (1977-1979), and the Forum for Interdisciplinary Mathematics (1982-1984).

Born 10 September 1920, Hoovinna Hadagali, Karnataka State, India.
