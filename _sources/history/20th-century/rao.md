** C R Rao**  is an Indian-born mathematician and statistician who has worked most of his life in America. His statistical work has been applied in many fields.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the highly influential book Statistics and Truth (1977), which introduced a broad research agenda for inference that emphasized the building of models for data analysis.
2. Developed the field of multivariate analysis, introducing the first systematic theory of how to analyze more than two variates at a time.
3. Conducted pioneering work on linear models, particularly the Rao–Rubin generalization of the Gauss–Markov theorem and the Rao–Blackwellization of an estimator.
4. Developed the Brachman-Rao Inequality, a seminal result on the efficiency of estimators.
5. Constructed the Cramer–Rao lower bound, which underscores the importance of efficiency in statistical estimation.
6. Coined the term “distribution-free” (nonparametric) methods for statistical analysis. 
7. Expanded the theory of statistical estimation and testing, especially for large sample sizes.
8. Established the Rao-Cramér–Rao inequality that became the first quantitative measure of the precision of an estimator.
9. Founded the theory of orthogonal arrays, now widely applied in design of experiments.
10. Led the development of statistics as a separate field of mathematics, distinct from probability.

Born 10 September 1920, Hoovinna Hadagali, Karnataka State, India.
