**Richard Schelp** was an American mathematician who researched in graph theory and combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Herbert was the son of Friedrich Ludwig Schelp and Dorothea Christine Sophie Doris Haesemeyer.
* Herbert and Ida Schelp adopted Carol and Richard was their only son.
* Schelp did not follow the standard route to become a university professor doing research in graph theory and combinatorics.
* He held this position for five years during which time he married Billie Swopes and their children Lisa and Richard were born.
* After five years earning a good salary, and having a family to support, it was a courageous decision for Schelp to give it all up to begin studying for a Ph.D. at Kansas State University.
* His thesis advisor was Richard Joseph Greechie who had obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Florida in 1966 with a thesis on lattice theory.
* Greechie's thesis advisor had been David J Foulis and Schelp's first paper Coordinatization of orthocomplemented and orthomodular posets (1970), written in collaboration with Stanley P Gudder, generalised Foulis's results that an orthomodular lattice can be coordinatised by a Baer *-semigroup.
* Schelp's 114-page thesis, Partial Baer *-semigroups and partial Baer semigroups, earned his a Ph.D. in 1970.
* Schelp wrote a number of papers with his colleagues over the following years including: A partial semigroup approach to partially ordered sets (1972); (with Ralph Faudree and Cecil Rousseau) Theory of path length distributions (1973); (with Ralph Faudree) A solved and unsolved graph coloring problem, by P Erdős (1973); (with Ralph Faudree) All Ramsey numbers for cycles in graphs (1974); and (with Ralph Faudree) Path connected graphs (1974).
* By 1975 Dick's Erdős number was 1 as a result of a four-author paper - Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp - 'Generalized Ramsey Theory for Multiple Copies'.
* Perhaps we should also note at this point that MathSciNet lists 170 publications for Schelp.
* It also lists 59 co-authors, and lists 95 joint publications of Schelp with Ralph J Faudree.
* Dick Schelp played an important role in the process of getting to know the town and gradually consider it as my second hometown.
* In addition to his passion for mathematics, Schelp was a member of the Lutheran church and a Sunday School teacher.

Born 21 April 1936, Kansas City, Missouri, USA. Died 29 November 2010, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
