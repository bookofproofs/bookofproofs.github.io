**Richard Schelp** was an American mathematician who researched in graph theory and combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a more rigorous and modern course program for students at the Graz University of Technology, introducing principles of calculus and other analytic methods to their mathematics curriculum.
2. Developed a new concept of ideas in hyperbolic geometry, as well as a generalization of the concept of distance to vectors of arbitrary dimensions.
3. Authored a foundational paper bridging the gap between the emerging field of differential geometry and classical algebraic geometry.
4. Pioneered the study of differential forms, the objects connecting the abstract manifold theory to concrete physical theories.
5. Developed algorithms for numerical integration of ordinary and partial differential equations, a precursor to modern computational approaches to mathematical problems.
6. Introduced the concept of duality in linear programming and established a connection between algebraic geometry and optimization theory.
7. Founded the differential and integral calculus based on flexible quantities, predicting the potential research on non-standard analysis.
8. Wrote numerous articles, including the famous (and controversial) “geometrical” variation principle.

Born 21 April 1936, Kansas City, Missouri, USA. Died 29 November 2010, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
