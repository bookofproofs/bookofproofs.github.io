**Bruce Kellogg** was an American mathematician who worked in partial differential eequations  (both theoretical and in the modelling of real phenomena).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ernest Kellogg (born 1902), whose parents were Royal S Kellog and Clara Fry, was from Yonkers, New York.
* On 21 January 1929 Helen and Ernest Kellogg's daughter Alice Elizabeth was born.
* By 1930 the family were living in Chicago, Cook, Illinois when their son Royal Bruce Kellogg was born.
* He did not use the name Royal, but was always known as Bruce.
* Kellogg spent part of his youth in Washington and graduated from the Western High School in 1948.
* After graduating, Kellogg worked for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a research scientist in the nuclear power industry before joining the Mathematics Department of the University of Maryland in 1966.
* While working at Westinghouse's Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory, Kellogg published papers such as: (with L C Noderer) Scaled iterations and linear equations (1960); Another alternating-direction-implicit method (1963); Difference equations on a mesh arising from a general triangulation (1964); An alternating direction method for operator equations (1964); and (with J Spanier) On optimal alternating direction parameters for singular matrices (1965).
* In 1966 Kellogg was appointed to the Institute for Fluid Dynamics and Applied Mathematics of the University of Maryland, College Park.
* Charles R Johnson, whose middle name was Royal, was a colleague of Bruce Kellogg at Maryland.
* A major theme in Bruce's opus is the numerical solution of singular perturbation problems.
* Kellogg published over 100 papers having 46 co-authors and, by June 2013,  they had received 837 citations by 661 authors.
* Kellogg's own introduction to Higher order singularities for interface problems.
* Here are a few examples of his post-retirement papers, mostly with Kellogg's own summary.
* Kellogg had married Claire White; they had four children Louise, Gregory, David, and Ren√©e.
* While he was working at the University of Maryland, Kellogg had lived at 7504 Hancock Avenue, Takoma Park, which is a suburb of Washington D.C. The Kelloggs sold their home in Takoma Park in March 2001.
* Kellogg died at the Smith Phayer Hospice House of the Carolina Foothills in Landrum, South Carolina.

Born 28 December 1930, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Died 30 April 2012, Landrum, South Carolina, USA.
