**Bruce Kellogg** was an American mathematician who worked in partial differential eequations  (both theoretical and in the modelling of real phenomena).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored more than 130 papers in the field of mathematics, particularly in the areas of dynamical systems and differential equations.
2. Awarded the prestigious (and rarely given) Lester R. Ford Award in 1970 for his work on differential equations 
3. Developed innovative designs for teaching numerical analysis 
4. Proposed the method of piecewise-linear approximation for the numerical solutions of differential problems.
5. Developed a new approach for numerical approximations to partial differential equations.
6. Authored the influential textbook "Dynamic Systems and Differential Equations: Theory and Applications".
7. Served as the director of the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University in the early 1970s.
8. Established the Bruce Kellogg Endowment at the University of California in 1997.
9. He also served on the editorial boards of numerous journals and was a member of numerous committees and societies devoted to mathematics.

Born 28 December 1930, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Died 30 April 2012, Landrum, South Carolina, USA.
