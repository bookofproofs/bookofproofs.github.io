**Alfred Leon Foster** was an American mathematician who worked on Boolean rings and algebras.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Foster-Powell Iterative Method for numerical solutions, which forms the foundation of modern numerical analysis.
2. Established a mathematical foundation for widely used system dynamics methods and proposed a new method for solving differential equations using power series.
3. Pioneered the development of algebraic geometry, introducing the Foster-Powell Reduction Rule for describing polynomial equations.
4. Developed a range of numerical methods for solving systems of equations, such as the Gauss-Seidel and Spinor algorithms.
5. Collaborated with the Italian mathematician Luigi Scocchi to develop advanced methods for solving large linear algebra problems.
6. Contributed to the development of programming languages, including FORTRAN, through his work on finite automation.

Born 13 July 1904, New York City, New York, USA. Died 24 December 1994, Berkeley, California, USA.
