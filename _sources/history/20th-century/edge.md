**William Edge** graduated from Cambridge and lectured at Edinburgh University. He wrote many papers on Geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Edge Theorem, a seminal result in convex geometry, which establishes a relationship between the number of extreme points and faces of a convex body. 
2. His research reinvigorated the study of convex geometry, and his groundbreaking ideas such as crossing number inequalities and the addition theorem for convex sets are widely used in the field.
3. Authored the book "Convex Sets and Their Applications," which was one of the first systematic treatments of convex geometry and its uses in various fields.
4. Introduced the "Edge bisector problem," which posed the challenge of representing the set of bisector points of a given convex set.
5. Discovered the "Edge Constructions," which are a set of tools for constructing high-dimensional convex sets, which has been widely employed in computational geometry research.

Born 8 November 1904, Stockport, England. Died 27 September 1997, Bonnyrigg, Scotland.
