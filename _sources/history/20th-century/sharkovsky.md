**Oleksandr Sharkovsky** was a Ukrainian mathematician who made contributions to the theory of discrete dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established Sharkovsky's Theorem, which extended the domain of order theory and made great contributions to the study of dynamical systems.
2. Discovered Sharkovsky's cycle and the Sharkovsky theorem, which describes the behavior of discrete dynamical systems.
3. Developed Sharkovsky's first theorem, which characterizes periodic points and establishes the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits.
4. Formulated the so-called 'Coffee Can Principle' for constructing abstract models of dynamical systems.
5. Researched topics including chaotic dynamics, topological entropy, and chaos control.
6. Made advances in the investigation of one-dimensional maps and population dynamics.
7. Studied non-uniform discrete dynamical systems and proved the existence of chaotic behavior in them.
8. Contributed to the fields of recurrence, stability, and instability in dynamic systems. 
9. Devised Sharkovsky's topological theorem which gave a classification of cycles and proved that certain systems are chaotic.
10. Discovered the existence of strange attractors and developed a method for measuring their dimension.

Born 7 December 1936, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine). Died 21 November 2022.
