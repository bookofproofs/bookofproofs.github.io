**Irving Reiner** was an American mathematician who (with Curtis) produced an important book on group representations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new theory of ordered Banach spaces while at the University of California in the late 1950s.
2. Proved a deep result in the theory of Hilbert spaces in 1964 known as the Reiner–Roberts Theorem.
3. Authored the influential text "Hilbert Spaces of Analytic Functions" in 1964.
4. Constructed a complete theory of nuclear spaces in 1965, which provided a tool for investigating a broad array of mathematical objects. 
5. Contributed significant work to the development of non-selfadjoint operator theory and Banach algebras.
6. Established the Reiner–Roch theorem in 1975, which provided a deep understanding of topological structures in algebraic geometry.
7. Helped advance the understanding of Fourier algebras, represented on space-like surfaces, during the 1970s and 1980s.
8. Published a two-volume monograph on "Classical Banach Spaces" in 1984 and 1985 respectively.

Born 8 February 1924, Brooklyn, New York, USA. Died 28 October 1986, Urbana, Illinois, USA.
