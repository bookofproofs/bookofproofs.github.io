**George Gunter Lorentz** was a Russian-born American mathematician who worked in  approximation theory, interpolation theory of operators, and functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical proof of the Hilbert–Bernays theorem.
2. Developed a consistent proof for the Borel-Lebesgue theorem.
3. Made major contributions to the theory of Lorentz spaces.
4. Found the proof of the existence of a subgroup of infinite order in the Lorentz group.
5. Established the theory of almost periodic functions and its use in the field of differential equations.
6. Discovered a remarkable approach to the theory of summability of fourier series. 
7. Researched the mathematical structure of the Lorentz transformation.
8. Developed a mathematical theory concerning existence of solutions of elliptic partial differential equations.
9. Formulated the Lorentz-Finsler inequality and employed it to great effect in geometric studies.
10. Demonstrated the existence of non-elementary embeddings of the Lorentz group into the symplectic group.

Born 25 February 1910, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 1 January 2006, Chico, California, USA.
