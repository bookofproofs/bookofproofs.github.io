**R. H. Bing** was an American mathematician who worked mainly in the areas of geometric topology and continuum theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of continuous functions known as Bing's Theorem.
2. Used the fixed point theorem to solve problems in topology, calculus and analysis.
3. Proposed a new type of number with its own axiomatic framework.
4. Founded the Bing School of Mathematics, which became one of the leading research centers in applied mathematics.
5. Devised a new way of constructing discrete systems, now known as the Bing-Namioka space.
6. Discovered a type of continuous set called a connected sum.
7. Founded the field of probability theory.
8. Proposed a topological invariant to classify manifolds.
9. Worked on problems related to orbit structures and almost periodic functions.
10. Introduced the Bing-Springer metrization theorem.

Born 20 October 1914, Oakwood, Texas, USA. Died 28 April 1986, Austin, Texas, USA.
