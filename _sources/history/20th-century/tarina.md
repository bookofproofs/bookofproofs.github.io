**Marian Țarină** was a Romanian mathematician who worked in geometry and was also interested in the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was therefore part of Romania long before Țarină was born and the city of Turda was where he grew up.
* The two universities combined to become the Babeș-Bolyai University in 1959 so, after serving as an assistant in the Babeș University, Țarină became a lecturer in the Babeș-Bolyai University in 1960.
* Țarină used methods developed by his thesis advisor Vrănceanu to attack the case of subprojective spaces of order n−3n - 3n−3 in his 1964 paper.
* The entire didactical activity of Professor Marian Țarină was at the University of Cluj.
* Țarină taught many courses at Cluj on a variety of different topics such as: Differential Geometry, Fundamental Algebraic Topology, Symmetric Spaces, Lie Groups, Groups, and the History of Mathematics.
* Throughout his career, Țarină published more than 50 research papers and presented almost 200 scientific communications.
* Comment: In this note, Țarină discusses a generalisation of the projective and the conformal equivalence of connections on a manifold.
* Comment: In this note, Țarină discusses a generalisation of the projective and the conformal equivalence of connections on a manifold.
* Comment: In this paper, Țarină gives a few ways of defining invariant connections in principal fibre bundles and establishes some properties about the order of invariant connections.
* Comment: Țarină writes, "Many geometric objects in the theory of Finsler spaces present an obvious analogy with the case of linear connections.
* Țarină unexpected died in May 1992 at Oradea in his sixtieth year.
* My contacts with Marian Țarină showed me the special human qualities of that excellent mathematician: warmth, modesty, and humour.
* My memories of Professor Marian Țarină will remain alive throughout my life.
* A Symposium in Geometry was organized on the occasion of the 190th  anniversary of Janos Bolyai and of the 60th  anniversary of Marian Țarină at Babeș-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca in 1993.
* The regional Romanian school mathematics and computer science competition is now named the 'Marian Țarină competition'.

Born 15 August 1932, Turda, Romania. Died 31 May 1992, Oradea, Romania.
