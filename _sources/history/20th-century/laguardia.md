**Rafael Laguardia** was a Uraguayan mathematician best known for founding the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics in Montevideo.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed foundational theories, such as the "Principle of Variational Analysis", which he applied to the study of dynamics, mechanics and multiple integrals. 
2. Contributed to the development of calculus, and published four volumes of his Course of Calculus. 
3. Demonstrated a relationship between the Dirichlet-Jordan integral and the theories of Edouard Lucas and Charles Hermite. 
4. Approximated the integrals of a function by expanding them in a series of higher orders and simplifying the calculations.
5. Developed the concept of Hyperspace and utilized it to gain a better understanding of the concept of continuity.
6. Made pioneering advances in the theory of analytic functions and showed how it could be applied to the study of linear partial differential equations.
7. Successfully solved the complex problem of solving a partial differential equation with a non-homogeneous boundary condition.
8. Developed the concept of multi-dimensional integration, which he applied to the study of probability theory.

Born 10 January 1906, Montevideo, Uruguay. Died 31 August 1980, Montevideo, Uruguay.
