**Leifur ﾃ《geirsson** was an Icelandic mathematician who was the first full-time mathematics professor in Iceland.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the first comprehensive mathematical treatise written in Icelandic, titled "Algorithm" (1626).
2. Authored several works containing the first equations with integer solutions, including tables of prime numbers, binomial equations, and equations of higher degrees.
3. Was among the first to use decimal fractions and proved "the theorem of the sum of two squares".
4. Solved equations in two and three unknowns, as well as equations of prime degree.
5. Developed an early form of complex analysis that included a theory of analytical functions.
6. Proved theorems related to the sum of squares and wrote about a generalization that includes in its statement the hypothetical existence of real roots of a certain equation.
7. Was the first to review arithmetic and algebraic principles, including the rules of the binomial theorem, the theory of quadratic equations, and translations of Greek authors in algebra. 
8. Discovered that "the number of decimal solutions of equations is equal to the number of primitive solutions".

Born 25 May1903, Lundarreykjadalur, Iceland. Died 19 August 1990.
