**Abraham Wald** was a mathematician born in what is now Romania who worked on decision theory, geometry and econometrics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the ‘Sequential Probability Ratio Test’, which is a statistical technique used for analyzing samples in large experiments;
2. Developed a statistical theory that is used in selecting random samples from a population in order to make universal inferences;
3. Applied probability theory to identify the optimal design for aircraft structures, minimizing the impact of enemy fire while maximizing the aircraft's performance;
4. Developed the ‘systems design approach’ to optimally balance resource consumption and damage protection, when faced with incomplete and uncertain information that is common after conflict.
5. Developed ‘Ruggedness Theory’, which provides a mathematical approach to the design of dependable products with improved reliability;
6. Contributed to Bayesian Decision Theory and developed the ‘Wald-Wolfowitz Run Test’ for detecting randomness in a sequence of numbers; 
7. Formulated the ‘population attributable fraction’, which is used in epidemiology to evaluate how much of a given health outcome can be attributed to the presence of a risk factor;
8. Used game theory and mathematical models to develop strategies for predicting the behavior of aerial bombing raids.

Born 31 October 1902, Kolozsvár, Hungary (now Cluj, Romania). Died 13 December 1950, Travancore, India.
