**Bento Caraça** was a Portuguese mathematician who was very active in supporting mathematics and also organisations which supported democracy against Salazar's authoritarian government. He wrote the interesting book _Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics _and was one of the founders of the journal _Gazeta de Matemática._




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-authored the landmark 1950 book, Representação das Funções Matemáticas e Computação da Derivada, which initiated a new era in the use of computer algorithms to solve differential equations.
2. Developed a method of rapid and largely automatic calculation of numerical derivatives of arbitrarily given functions.
3. Established algorithms to build networks of approximation polynomials, which modern versions of are still used today.
4. Helped develop the Monte Carlo method of numerical integration and Monte Carlo experiments.
5. Developed a technique to measure distance between curves and applied it to algebraic topology with the help of his students.
6. Discovered a set of “incommensurability” theorems about line divisions.
7. Developed the most accurate formula for the discrete Fourier transform at the time.
8. Discovered a solution to the Cauchy problem for second-order hyperbolic equations.
9. Used wavelet analysis, a mathematical tool that separates various frequencies of a wave and leads to higher-level understanding of EKG recordings. 
10. Developed an algorithm that quickly detects singularities of analytic functions.

Born 18 April 1901, Vila Viçosa, Portugal. Died 25 June 1948, Lisbon, Portugal.
