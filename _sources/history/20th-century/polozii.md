**Georgii Polozii** was a Russian mathematician who mostly worked in pure mathematics such as complex analysis, approximation theory and numerical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Polozii–Vinogradov Inequality, a key tool in the study of the Riemann zeta-function.
2. Constructed a method of studying Chebyshev-type sums and demonstrably obtained very accurate estimates for the sums.
3. Demonstrated that the sum of the Fourier coefficients of the derivative of a smooth periodic function is equal to twice the sum of the Mellin transforms of that function.
4. Created an algorithm to efficiently sum up a certain class of highly oscillatory sums.
5. Developed a variant of the Courant–Fischer principle which provides explicit estimates for the best approximations of a continuous function on a prescribed finite set of points.

Born 23 April 1914, Transbaikal, Russia. Died 26 November 1968, Kyiv, Ukraine.
