**John Semple** was a Irish mathematician whose most important work was in Algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
John Semple is an American mathematician who is best known for his work in algebraic geometry, in particular the theory of schemes. He has also made fundamental contributions to the theory of enumerative geometry, higher-dimensional algebra, intersection theory, and other mathematical topics.

1. Developed the theory of schemes, a type of mathematical structure in algebraic geometry. 
2. Established a major result in the theory of enumerative geometry. 
3. Advanced higher-dimensional algebraic geometry through his work on intersection theory. 
4. Discovered and solved the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence. 
5. Wrote two classic books: Geometry of Algebraic Curves and Introduction to Algebraic Geometry. 
6. Contributed to the development of the theory of motives. 
7. Researched algebraic surfaces and the application of differential forms to algebraic geometry.
8. Developed the language of algebraic geometry and championed its usage.

Born 10 June 1904, Belfast, Ireland. Died 23 October 1985, London, England.
