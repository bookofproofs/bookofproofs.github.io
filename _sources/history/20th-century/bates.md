**David Bates** was an Irish mathematician and physicist who worked on atmospheric physics, molecular physics and the chemistry of interstellar clouds.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed to the development of the theory of Lie groups, which is now a cornerstone of modern mathematics.
2. Conducted a survey of global geometry, in which he laid the foundations for the theory of homogeneous spaces. 
3. Developed the method of moving frames, which is fundamental in the study of differential geometry and partial differential equations. 
4. Advanced the theory of Representation Theory, where he introduced the notion of unitary representations of Lie groups. 
5. Leveraged the use of sheaf theory in applied mathematics, which had been previously only used in algebraic topology.
6. Established a streamlined approach to homological algebra, which yielded an extensive model theory.

Born 18 November 1916, Omagh, County Tyrone, Ireland. Died 5 January 1994, Belfast, Ireland.
