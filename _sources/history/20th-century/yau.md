**Shing-Tung Yau** is a Chinese mathematician who won a Fields Medal for his work on differential geometry and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father was an economist and philosopher working in southern China when Yau was born.
* However, by late 1949 the Communists were in control of almost all of China and Yau's family fled to Hong Kong where his father obtained a position teaching at a College.
* (The College later became a part of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.) Times were difficult for the family, however, and Yau's mother knitted goods to sell in order to supplement their low income.
* Life was tough for Yau living in a village outside Hong Kong city in a house which had no electricity or running water and at this stage of his life he often played truant from school preferring his role as leader of a street gang.
* Yau's father was a major influence on him, encouraging his interest in philosophy and mathematics.
* Sadly, when he was fourteen years old, his father died but by this time Yau was enjoying his school education.
* By good fortune, one of his lecturers at the College had studied at the University of California, and, seeing Yau's enormous potential, suggested that he go there to study for a doctorate.
* Yau studied for his doctorate at the University of California at Berkeley under Chern's supervision.
* He received his Ph.D. in 1971 and, during session 1971-72, Yau was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
* Yau was appointed assistant professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1972.
* Yau was awarded a Fields Medal in 1982 for his contributions to partial differential equations, to the Calabi conjecture in algebraic geometry, to the positive mass conjecture of general relativity theory, and to real and complex Monge-Amp√®re equations.
* Nirenberg described Yau's work at the International Congress in Warsaw in 1983.
* Nirenberg describes briefly the areas of Yau's work.
* Yau's solution is classical in spirit, via a priori estimates.
* Yau solved the Calabi conjecture in 1976.
* Another conjecture solved by Yau was the positive mass conjecture, which comes from Riemannian geometry.
* Yau, in joint work, constructed minimal surfaces, studied their stability and made a deep analysis of how they behave in space-time.
* Yau, working with W H Meeks solved this problem in 1980.
* In joint work of Yau with Karen Uhlenbeck On the existence of Hermitian Yang-Mills connections in stable bundles (1986), they solved higher dimensional versions of the Hitchin-Kobayashi conjecture.
* Yau was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1993.
* Yau's team is one of these and he has been criticised by some for comments which people felt did not give Perelman full credit.
* However Yau has clearly stated that it had only been his intention to say that his team made Perelman's proof understandable to a much wider range of mathematicians.

Born 4 April 1949, Kwuntung (now Guangdong), China.
