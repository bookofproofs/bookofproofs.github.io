**David Mumford** is an English-born American mathematician who won a Fields Medal for his work on algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Mumford's father worked for the United Nations from its foundations in 1945 and this was his job while Mumford was growing up.
* Mumford's mother was American and the family lived on Long Island Sound in the United States, a semi-enclosed arm of the North Atlantic Ocean with the New York- Connecticut shore on the north and Long Island to the south.
* After attending Exeter School, Mumford entered Harvard University.
* It was at Harvard that Mumford first became interested in algebraic varieties.
* After graduating from Harvard, Mumford was appointed to the staff there.
* Mumford's greatest honour was being awarded a Fields Medal at the International Congress in Vancouver in 1974.
* Mumford has carried forward, after Zariski, the project of making algebraic and rigorous the work of the Italian school on algebraic surfaces.
* In the 1980s however, the direction of Mumford's work changed dramatically.
* Mumford has received many honours in addition to the Fields Medal.
* Let us mention the book Indra's Pearls: The Vision of Felix Klein  which he published with Caroline Series and David Wright in 2002.
