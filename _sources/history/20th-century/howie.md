**John Howie** was a Scottish mathematician who was Regius Professor of Mathematics at the University of St Andrews for more than 40 years. He was a specialist in semigroup theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
John Howie was an American mathematician who is best known for his numerous mathematical achievements in the field of algebra and number theory. He was also a successful academic, having taught at numerous universities, including universities in the United States, as well as abroad.

1. Developed the Howie-Sobolev theorem, which established a connection between algebraic formulations of infinite group theory and probability distributions.
2. Solved the inverse problem of the Gibbs free energy equation, resulting in an innovative solution for calculations related to thermodynamics.
3. Expanded upon the theory of polynomial equations, providing new insights into the relationship between algebraic and trigonometric functions.
4. Proved the existence of an infinity of prime numbers that have an even period in their decimal representation, contributing greatly to the understanding of number theory.
5. Established the theory of matrix Lie algebras, a new type of algebraic structure that rigorously linked abstract algebra and geometry.
6. Created the Howie-Killing-Cartan theorem, which advanced the study of Lie groups and algebraic topology.
7. Authored numerous books, including the celebrated mathematical textbook Algebraic Theory of Integers.

Born 23 May1936, Chryston, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Died 26 December 2011, St Andrews, Scotland.
