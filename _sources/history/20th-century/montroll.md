**Elliott Montroll** was an American scientist and mathematician who worked in a variety of applied mathematical and statistical areas.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Adolph was an artist who dealt in furs and together with his wife Esther provided a loving home in which Elliott grew up.
* They taught Elliott to read and write before he entered school for the first time at the age of five.
* It was clear that given his passion for chemistry that was the subject Montroll would study at university.
* Montroll was now in the unusual position of being able to work in mathematics, physics or chemistry departments.
* During 1942-43 Montroll was an instructor in physics at Princeton University and in 1943 he married Shirley Abrams; they had ten children, five boys and five girls.
* In 1943 Montroll was appointed as Head of the Mathematics Research Group at the Kellex Corporation in New York.
* During his time at Maryland, Montroll published Topics in statistical mechanics of interacting particles  which was 86 pages of mimeographed notes of a lecture series, written jointly with G F Newell.
* At the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability 1954-1955, Montroll gave a paper Theory of the vibration of simple cubic lattices with nearest neighbor interactions  in which described vibrations of a cubic lattice with 1, 2, 3, and nnn dimensions where nnn is large.
* Montroll was not someone who was happy to remain in one place for a long time and by 1960, having been at the University of Maryland for nine years, he felt it was time to move on.
* Montroll's work led to him receiving many honours and prizes.

Born 4 May 1916, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 3 December 1983, Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA.
