**Elliott Montroll** was an American scientist and mathematician who worked in a variety of applied mathematical and statistical areas.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the 'tree' structure used to classify and study combinatorial problems.
2. Pioneered the concept of winding numbers and used it to prove the Riemann-Roch theorem.
3. Published numerous research papers on the topics of generating functions, large deviations, and probability theory.
4. Co-authored the influential book ‘Studies in Combinatorial Theory’ with William Tutte. 
5. Developed the ‘excess’ formula, which is used to calculate the number of spanning trees in a graph.
6. Proved the Dvoretzky-Erdoes inequality in discrete probability.

Born 4 May 1916, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 3 December 1983, Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA.
