**Norman Alling** is an American mathematician who worked in a wide range of mathematics, from the theory of ordered groups to Riemann surfaces, including surreal numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a geometrical representation of the solar system that correctively predicted the actual movements of the planets. 
2. Conjectured the true shape of the earth was a flattened ball
3. Demonstrated that the diurnal and annual motions of the planets, as then observed, could be more easily explained by a geocentric rather than a heliocentric model.
4. Proposed that a mechanism within the planets themselves was responsible for their motions, rather than requiring celestial motors. 
5. Proved the theorem of intervals of uniformity.
6. Demonstrated that the movement of the light in the heavens must conform to the same laws of geometry that determined the movement of objects in terrestrial motion.
7. Discovered a theorem that the time of the revolution of the moon around the earth could be calculated by its distance from the sun.
8. Derived a cosmological theorem which later helped astronomers to solve the three-body problem.

Born 8 February 1930, Rochester, New York, USA.
