**Norman Alling** is an American mathematician who worked in a wide range of mathematics, from the theory of ordered groups to Riemann surfaces, including surreal numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However it ended its relationship with Columbia in 1944 so by the time Alling entered it was a private, coeducational institution of higher learning.
* After the award of his Bachelor's Degree, Alling entered Columbia University in New York and was awarded his Master's Degree in 1954.
* Alling did not remain at Columbia University to finish off writing his thesis, however, but rather took up an appointment as an assistant professor at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, in 1957 after he stopped lecturing at Columbia.
* It was around this time that Ribenboim and Alling first met.
* Alling lectured at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1962 to 1964 when he was awarded a National Sciences Foundation Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship which enabled him to spend 1964-65 undertaking research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
* Perhaps the breadth of Alling's interests can be deduced from the titles of his books.
* Manfred Knebusch described Alling's approach to his topic in  Real elliptic curves.
* Just as important, our prolonged contact with the same professor - Norman Alling in my year  - gave us a deeper appreciation of the mindset of a professional mathematician.
* After he retired, Alling continued to undertake research.
* Finally we note Alling's love for skiing on the slopes in Colorado.

Born 8 February 1930, Rochester, New York, USA.
