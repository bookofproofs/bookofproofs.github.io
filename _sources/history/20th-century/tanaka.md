**Hideo Tanaka** wasa Japanese mathematician known for his work on fuzzy sets.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* During his graduate studies, Tanaka was advised by Kiyoji Asai (1923-2012).
* His research topic was 'Sensitivity analysis in control theory' but it is not for his work in that area that we have included Tanaka in this mathematics archive, rather it is for his work on Fuzzy Operations Research.
* After graduating, Tanaka was appointed to the Department of Industrial Engineering at Osaka Prefecture University as a research associate in July 1969 and he worked there until he retired in March 2000.
* Kiyoji Asai had become interested in fuzzy sets while Tanaka was studying with him.
* He moved from Osaka City University to take up a full professorship at Osaka Prefecture University in 1969 and at that time Tanaka was appointed as a research associate.
* While having a permanent position at Osaka Prefecture University, Tanaka held a number of other visiting positions during these years.
* Zimmermann, who worked in the Department for Operations Research, was pursuing research in fuzzy set theory and its applications and his interests were close to those of Tanaka.
* During 1981-82, Tanaka was in the United States at Kansas State University.
* As an indication of the topics on which Tanaka undertook research, we quote the titles of some of his papers.
* Tanaka published a number of books in Japanese including: Fuzzy modelling and its applications (1990); Fuzzy OR (1993); Data analysis software (1995); and Reasoning and knowledge acquisition from the data (2004).
* A month after Tanaka retired in March 2000, he was appointed as a Professor in the Graduate School of Management and Information Science at Toyohashi-Sozo College.
* For his contributions to fuzzy theory, Tanaka received many awards.
* Prof Tanaka's students have happy memories of these experiences.
* Prof Tanaka invited his students to his home on many occasions.
* Mrs Fuku Tanaka was always very hospitable and provided a variety of succulent dishes.
* She acquired these recipes during the Tanakas' two visits to the US and during their one-time stay in Germany.
* Professor Tanaka generally preferred philosophical discussions with sociological implications.
* Professor Tanaka was an exceptionally good and benevolent person who developed a personal friendship with many of his colleagues, in Japan and abroad.
* Tanaka suffered from interstitial pneumonia and he struggled for several years with the disease before it finally led to his death at the age of 74.

Born 28 September 1938, Osaka, Japan. Died 16 May 2012, Osaka, Japan.
