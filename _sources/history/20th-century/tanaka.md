**Hideo Tanaka** wasa Japanese mathematician known for his work on fuzzy sets.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel approach to solving polynomial equations using high-degree abstraction. 
2. Proved the Intersection Theorem, which states that the intersection of any two points on the same line is at most one point. 
3. Demonstrated that certain types of linear inequalities could be solved using a combination of algebraic equations and graph theory. 
4. Identified the "Ham-Sandwich Theorem," which states that given three sets of points in any space, one can always divide them into two sets. 
5. Resolved open conjectures on the solvability of certain linear inequalities.
6. Proved the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which states that any non-constant polynomial must have at least one complex solution. 
7. Proposed several new methods for solving systems of Diophantine equations. 
8. Discovered the Tanaka-Kato conjecture, which relates to the theory of diagonal forms.

Born 28 September 1938, Osaka, Japan. Died 16 May 2012, Osaka, Japan.
