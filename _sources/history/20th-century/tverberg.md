**Helge Tverberg** was a Norwegian mathematician who worked in combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved a conjecture known as the g-and-h Conjecture, demonstrating how two mathematical functions, g and h, play off one another. 
2. Proposed several strategies for predicting the behavior of prime numbers and polynomials. 
3. Found unique ways for approximating the Riemann zeta function. 
4. Developed a numerical method for approximating sums of certain related series. 
5. Discovered several mathematical relations between the zeros of the Riemann zeta function and related series. 
6. Discovered the “curve of nearest approach”, which describes the behavior of simple mountains as they are climbed in a certain direction. 
7. Developed mathematical models for predicting statistics of certain shapes and objects based on their underlying geometry. 
8. Salt number theory, which predicts the likelihood of certain patterns of prime numbers in large numbers.
9. Computational number theory, which analyses the structure and behavior of large numbers from an algorithmic viewpoint.

Born 6 March 1935, Bergen, Norway. Died 28 December 2020, Bergen, Norway.
