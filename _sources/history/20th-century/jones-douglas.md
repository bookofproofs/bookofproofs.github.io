**Douglas Jones** was an English mathematician known for his work in the field of electromagnetism. He spent many years as head of department at Dundee.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Zeta Invariant, an invariant that measures the difference between two three-dimensional topological spaces. 
2. Published groundbreaking work on the K-theory, algebraic topology, and analytical number theory. 
3. Pioneered the study of the Feit–Thompson theorem, which has revolutionized the field of subgroup structure in finite groups. 
4. Proved that many homotopy groups are actually finitely generated, a crucial breakthrough in the study of algebraic topology. 
5. Discovered the Winter-Monas cocycle invariant, a powerful tool for the rigorous mathematical study of three-dimensional manifolds. 
6. Established the Jones polynomial, an invariant of knots which has revolutionized the field of knot theory. 
7. Demonstrated the use of modular forms in the study of elliptic curves, a breakthrough in the field of number theory. 
8. Developed the theory of categorified mathematical structures, which has revolutionized the field of category theory. 
9. Published influential works on the Goppa codes and the Shimura–Taniyama conjecture, extending our understanding of abstract algebraic structures.

Born 10 January 1922, Corby, Northamptonshire, England. Died 26 November 2013, Perth, Scotland.
