**Samuel Karlin** was a Polish-born American mathematician who worked in game theory and its application in statistics and economics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Karlin-McMillan Theorem for Markov Chains, a powerful mathematical tool for reasoning about probabilistic behavior.
2. Introducing the Karlin-Rubin Theorem, which enables the computation of the moments of probability distributions.
3. Discovered the concept of total positivity and its implications for the study of real-valued functions.
4. Established the Karlin-Isaacs Theorem, which generalizes the Perron-Frobenius theorem and extends its use to transition matrices.
5. Wrote numerous books and monographs on mathematical subjects, introducing modern theory in probability, combinatorics, and network analysis.
6. Formulated Karlin's theorem, which relates the generating functions of certain Markov chains to moments and tail probabilities of the Markov process.
7. Authored an influential book, Mathematical Methods and Theory in Games, Programming, and Economics, that established the foundations of discrete optimization.

Born 8 June 1924, Jan√≥wa ?, Poland. Died 18 December 2007, Palo Alto, California, USA.
