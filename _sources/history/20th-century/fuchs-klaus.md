**Klaus Fuchs** was a German theoretical physicist best known as an atomic spy who supplied information to the Soviet Union. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed to the development of the first atom bomb, the Manhattan Project.
2. Played a key role in unraveling the secrets of the atom and its structure.
3. Proposed the Fuchsian Functions, a mathematical approach to solving certain form of nonlinear differential equations.
4. Made significant contributions to the current understanding of atomic structure.
5. Developed the Fuchs–Lieber equation, an analytic equation for describing the production of slow neutrons in an atomic nucleus.
6. Awarded the Max Planck Medal for his contributions in the field of physics.
7. Developed the Fuchsian Group, which enabled him to prove the impossibility of certain criteria for a certain set of equations.
8. Developed the Fuchsian equation, a series of equations to describe the scattering of particles in interaction with a nucleus.
9. Developed improved methods for solving mathematical problems involving linear partial differential equations.
10. Published his work on the Fuchsian equation in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society.

Born 29 December 1911, Rüsselsheim, Germany. Died 28 January 1988, Dresden, East Germany.
