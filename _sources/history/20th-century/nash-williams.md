**Crispin  Nash-Williams** was a Welsh mathematician who worked in discrete mathematics, especially graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Nash–Williams' theorem, which is a fundamental result in graph theory that provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to have a decomposition into edge-disjoint spanning trees.
2. Proved the theorem of Tutte & Nash-Williams which gives a simple characterization of the Tutte polynomial of a graph.
3. Developed Nash–Williams' algorithm for finding an optimal solution to the travelling salesman problem, which is an algorithm for finding the shortest possible tour in a graph visiting all its vertices once.
4. Co-authored the book The Existence of Paths of Maximal Length in a Graph (1959).
5. Published work including Steiner decompositions and Hamiltonian decompositions, covering the theory of directed and undirected graphs.
6. Conducted research on the properties of Ear decompositions of graphs, contributing to the understanding of the relationship between graph theory and matroid theory.
7. Was awarded the Senior Whitehead Prize by the London Mathematical Society in 1989.

Born 19 December 1932, Cardiff, Wales. Died 20 January 2001, Ascot, England.
