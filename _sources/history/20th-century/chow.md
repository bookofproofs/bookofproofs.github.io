**Chow Wei-Liang** was a Chinese mathematician  known for his work in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Chow trace identity, a fundamental tool used in algebraic and arithmetic geometry
2. Solved the Problem of Realizability for Algebraic Cycles and Rational Equivalence
3. Showed that the Riemann-Roch Theorem is a direct consequence of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem
4. Constructed the theory of $\lambda$-rings as a foundational part of Grothendieck's theory of motives
5. Contributed to Milnor's development of the $\mu$-invariant in K-theory
6. Helped establish the Greenberg-Hopkins Howsonâ€™s theorem on the Galois modules structure of the K-groups of a number field
7. Put forth an algebraization of singularity theory, known as the Chow-Lefschetz theorem
8. Pioneered parts of complex algebraic geometry, such as Mayer-Vietoris sequences and a criteria for a projective algebraic set to be smooth

Born 1 October 1911, Shanghai, China. Died 10 August 1995, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
