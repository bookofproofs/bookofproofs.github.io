**Lennart Carleson** is a Swedish mathematician who solved one of the most important problems in the theory of Fourier series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Carleson's research thesis was supervised by Arne Beurling and he was awarded his doctorate in 1950 for On a Class of Meromorphic Functions and Its Exceptional Sets.
* Carleson spent session 1950-51 in the United States, undertaking post-doctoral work at Harvard University.
* Carleson returned to Sweden, taking up his lectureship at Uppsala University at the beginning of session 1951-52.
* Among many important roles which Carleson has occupied, we should mention three in particular.
* Carleson's mathematical contributions have been far too many, and much too deep, to be described in any detail in a biography of this type.
* During his career as a mathematician Carleson has been influential in several major areas of analysis and dynamical systems over nearly half a century of mathematical activity.
* Carleson's mathematics is characterized by a deep geometric insight combined with an amazing control of the branching complexities of the proofs.
* A major problem solved by Carleson in 1962 was the famous 'corona problem' in the paper Interpolations by bounded analytic functions and the corona problem.
* As so often in his work, not only did he solve the problem but in doing so he introduced what are today called 'Carleson measures' which went on to become a fundamental tool in complex analysis and harmonic analysis.
* In 1967 HÃ¶rmander introduced some ideas to simplify Carleson's proof and Carleson lectured on The corona theorem to the Fifteenth Scandinavian Congress in Oslo in 1968.
* In 1966 Carleson solved one of the outstanding problems of mathematics in his paper On convergence and growth of partial sums of Fourier series.
* Kolmogorov proved results in 1928 which seemed to suggest that Luzin's conjecture must be false but Carleson amazed the world of mathematics when he proved Luzin's long-standing conjecture in 1966.
* Carleson lectured on his spectacular result at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Moscow in 1966 when he gave the address Convergence and summability of Fourier series.
* Carleson received the Wolf Prize 1992 together with John G Thompson.
* Carleson's work has forever altered our view of analysis.
* Besides his papers Carleson has published an influential book on potential theory 'Selected problems in the theory of exceptional sets' and helped make accessible the unpublished work of Arne Beurling (i.e., as co-editor with P Malliavin, J Neuberger, and J Wermer of 'The collected works of Arne Beurling' 2 Vols 1989) ...
* But Carleson's influence extends far beyond his publications.
* Carleson has received a host of honours for his truly outstanding contributions.

Born 18 March 1928, Stockholm, Sweden.
