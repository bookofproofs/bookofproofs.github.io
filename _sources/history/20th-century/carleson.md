**Lennart Carleson** is a Swedish mathematician who solved one of the most important problems in the theory of Fourier series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1993 for his work on complex dynamics and singular integrals.
2. Received the King Faisal International Prize for Science in 1989 for his work in the field of Fourier analysis.
3. Elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1978.
4. Received the King Gustav Adolf Prize in 1975 for his research in the theory of Fourier series.
5. Proved his famous theorem (the Carleson-Hunt theorem) in 1968, which led to a revolution in Fourier analysis.
