**Branko Grünbaum** was a Jewish Croatian mathematician who survived the Nazi invasion, later escaped to Israel where he obtained his doctorate, and had most of his career in the United States. He was a prolific author writing over 250 papers and four very influential books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Grünbaum-Hadwiger theorem for classifying regular polytopes.
2. Wrote "Convex Polytopes," the influential tome co-authored with Victor Klee which has become a standard reference in the field of convex polytopes.
3. Published work on multiple topics such as: spherical and hyperbolic geometry, Ramsey theory, topological graph theory, coloring of graphs and lattices, crystallographic groups and quasicrystals.
4. Collabroated on papers with renowned mathematicians such as Paul Erdős, Hugo Hadwiger, Richard Rado, and Kazimierz Kuratowski.
5. Awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement in Mathematics by the American Mathematical Society in 1997 in recognition of his contributions to mathematics.
6. Named a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012.
7. Received an honorary doctorate from the University of Washington in 1991.

Born 2 October 1929, Osijek, Yugoslavia (now Croatia). Died 14 September 2018, Seattle, USA.
