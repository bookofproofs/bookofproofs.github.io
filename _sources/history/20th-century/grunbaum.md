**Branko Grünbaum** was a Jewish Croatian mathematician who survived the Nazi invasion, later escaped to Israel where he obtained his doctorate, and had most of his career in the United States. He was a prolific author writing over 250 papers and four very influential books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Vlado, the son of Jakob and Flora Grünbaum, was Jewish; he had one older sister Slava and one younger sister Sida.
* Vlado and Margareta were married and their son Branko, the subject of this biography, was born while his father managed the sawmill.
* One of the workers at the sawmill was a German and he played with young Branko and taught him German.
* Emma, Branko's maternal grandmother, received some compensation and bought a house near Osijek where she earned money tutoring French and German to high school students.
* Branko played while his grandmother taught and he learnt more German and some French.
* Branko Grünbaum's family were immediately in danger.
* The Grünbaum family somehow survived the war.
* Branko, who had wanted to leave the country for several years, became even more determined to do so but this was not possible.
* Very few Jews were left in Osijek by the end of the war in 1945 and Branko frequently met up with seven other Jewish High School students.
* In 1948 Grünbaum, unhappy with the Communist government, wanted to leave Yugoslavia and he also wanted to marry Zdenka.
* Grünbaum, however, felt it might be a trick to identify 'trouble makers', so did not register.
* The Jews who had registered for the ship to Israel left and Grünbaum realised it was not a trick.
* Branko's father, Vlado, was given a grant to open a car repair shop.
* Branko worked for a textile machinery firm and Zdenka was able to continue her schooling.
* Both Branko and Zdenka tried to learn Hebrew and, in October 1950, at age 21, Branko Grünbaum was able to begin his studies of mathematics at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
* Grünbaum was awarded an M.Sc. in 1954.
* Zdenka was told to report for military service so, to avoid her doing that, Branko and Zdenka were married on 30 June 1954.
* Grünbaum was by this time undertaking research for his Ph.D. advised by Aryeh Dvoretzky.
* He was able to work on setting up an Operation Research unit where he could use his mathematical skills and was allowed to spend "one day a week in Jerusalem, officially, to consult with Professor Dvoretzky but practically it was to discuss his PhD research." Branko and Zdenka's first child, Ram Grünbaum, was born in Kfar Saba, Israel, on 27 June 1956.
* In 1957 Branko Grünbaum submitted his thesis, On Some Properties of Minkowski Spaces (Hebrew) and was awarded a Ph.D. He continued his army service until 1958 and by this time, despite three years of military service, he had eleven papers in print.
* A scholarship allowed Grünbaum to spend from September 1958 to June 1960 at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, USA.
* Branko and Zdenka, with their son Ram, sailed on the T.S.S. Olympia arriving in New York on 5 September 1958 having left Lisbon exactly one month earlier.
* After two years at Princeton, they spent one year in Seattle at the University of Washington where their second son Daniel Grünbaum was born on 2 November 1960.
* While in Seattle, Grünbaum accepted a position at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
* Branko and Zdenka's Orthodox Jewish marriage had been annulled because Branko's mother was not Jewish.
* In the City of Seattle, on 5 September 1961, Branko Grünbaum and Zdenka Bienenstock were married by a Justice of the Peace at 9:30 a.m. just before they left the United States for Jerusalem.
* Grünbaum now felt slightly uneasy in Israel since, despite having a Jewish father, he had been declared a non-Jew since his mother was not Jewish.
* Grünbaum had two possible places in North America which were particularly attractive because of his interest in geometry, the University of Toronto where Donald Coxeter was a professor, and the University of Washington in Seattle where he could work with Victor Klee.
* Grünbaum's son Daniel had been born in Seattle, so had American citizenship.
* Branko, Zdenka and Ram were "lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence on February 1, 1968." Ram petitioned to become a naturalised citizen on 1 October 1971 and had his name changed to Rami.
* Branko and Zdenka petitioned to become naturalised citizens on 6 June 1973.
* Unfortunately, Branko caught them using the bad one again a few years later, but a follow up letter from him on the question seems to have permanently resolved the issue.
* We mentioned above some of the honours that were awarded to Grünbaum.
* Gordon Williams undertook research for a Ph.D. advised by Grünbaum.
* Zdenka Grünbaum died in her sleep on 28 December 2015.
* Branko Grünbaum survived her by three years, dying in 2018 a few weeks before his 89th birthday.

Born 2 October 1929, Osijek, Yugoslavia (now Croatia). Died 14 September 2018, Seattle, USA.
