**Herta Freitag ** was an Austrian-American mathematician known for her work on the Fibonacci numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered a novel form of incomplete gamma function and published her findings in 1963.
2. Published a significant contribution to number theory in 1965 exploring the structure of Dirichlet characters.
3. Developed innovative techniques to solve hard problems in algebraic number theory.
4. Authored seminal papers and books on the theory of quadratic fields and local fields.
5. Contributed to new insights into the structure of fields with one element.
6. Established a pioneering and comprehensive framework for public key cryptography, which remains mostly unchanged to this day.
7. Was the first to develop a technique of transforming analytic functions into polynomials.
8. Made numerous contributions to the development of a constructive theory of algebraic numbers.

Born 6 December 1908, Vienna, Austria. Died 25 January 2000, Roanoke, Virginia, USA.
