**Moshe Carmeli** was an Iraqi-born Israeli mathematician who worked in various areas of mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a “self-dual” version of quantum field theory whose methods are still being studied. 
2. Developed the first version of Higher Spin Theory, an abstract and highly influential theory of higher-order symmetries. 
3. Pioneered the direct use of Clifford algebra, now an advanced tool used in many mathematical disciplines. 
4. Discovered the Fueter-Carmeli decomposition, a fundamental tool in the study of analytic functions. 
5. Demonstrated a link between the mathematics of classical fields and the modern theory of Clifford algebra. 
6. Developed the Carmeli-Cowen-Fels method for analyzing the properties of linear differential equations. 
7. Authored several influential papers on nonlinear evolution equations and their use in various physical applications. 
8. Developed an original method for calculating optimal solutions in system theory and control. 
9. Formulated a new approach to solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations, now used in economics and operations research. 
10. Devised a breakthrough formula for the computation of average response times in distributed systems.

Born 15 June 1933, Baghdad, Iraq. Died 27 September 2007, Beer Sheva, Israel.
