**Iossif Ostrovskii** was a Ukrainian mathematician who worked in the theory of integer and meromorphic functions and their application in the theory of probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was in 1954 that Levin organised a research seminar on function theory, and Ostrovskii became one of its most active participants.
* Ostrovskii graduated from Kharkov State University in 1956 and began undertaking research advised by Levin.
* From 1958 Ostrovskii taught at Kharkov University, becoming the head of the Department of Function Theory in 1963.
* To obtain these results, Ostrovskii had proved a stronger version of the Wiman-Valiron theorem on the behaviour of an entire function in a neighbourhood of points where its modulus attains the maximum value on the circle.
* A collaboration between Ostrovskii and Anatolii Asirovich Goldberg led to important results.
* This led to Goldberg collaborating with Levin's colleagues at Kharkov University, in particular with Ostrovskii.
* In 1972 Ostrovskii published another important monograph, this time in collaboration with Yuri Vladimirovich Linnik.
* Ostrovskii's 1970 book with Goldberg was also translated into English but this did not appear until 2008.
* Ostrovskii was appointed to head the Department of Function Theory at the Low Temperature Physics and Technology Institute of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in 1986.
* There are many other areas to which Ostrovskii has made a major contribution.
* In the 1980s Ostrovskii wrote a number of papers on the asymptotic behaviour of entire functions that are characteristic functions of probability measures.
* Iosif Vladimirovich has taught many pupils, and three of them have become doctors of science.
* Iosif Vladimirovich gives a great deal of attention to his students.

Born 6 April 1934, Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine. Died 29 November 2020, Ankara, Turkey.
