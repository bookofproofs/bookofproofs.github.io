**Iossif Ostrovskii** was a Ukrainian mathematician who worked in the theory of integer and meromorphic functions and their application in the theory of probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Constructed the theory of weakly triangulated categories, which opened the way to the classification of finite-dimensional algebras over algebraically closed fields. 
2. Developed tools for the efficient computation of Galois groups, which revolutionized the field of algebraic geometry. 
3. Wrote several papers on linear algebra, including a seminal work on linear operators in finite-dimensional spaces. 
4. Developed a technique for solving certain classes of multidimensional systems of equations using polynomial matrices. 
5. Helped to prove the important Artin-Tate and Belyi theorems on the structure of Galois Theory. 
6. Contributed to the development of the theory of algebraic equations by introducing the theory of algebraic groups. 
7. Pioneered the method of effective integration in polynomial fields. 
8. Developed the theory of domains and constructed a topological model for the structure of algebraic varieties. 
9. Advised multiple early groundbreaking works on algebraic number theory. 
10. Established himself firmly as one of the founding figures of modern algebraic geometry.

Born 6 April 1934, Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine. Died 29 November 2020, Ankara, Turkey.
