**Pavel Krejčí** is a Czech mathematician who is known for his work on the applications of differential equations to hysteresis problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After the award of his Master's degree, Krejčí became a computer programmer at the Poldi Steel Company, Kladno, Czechoslovakia.
* Krejčí continued to work at the Institute of Mathematics in Prague until December 1996 but during these years spent part of his time visiting other institutions.
* In February 2015, MathSciNet lists 120 publications by Krejčí.
* Krejčí has received prestigious awards such as the Research Award of the Minister of Education of the Czech Republic (2001), the John von Neumann Guest professorship at Munich (2010), and the Bernard Bolzano Honorary Medal for Merit in Mathematical Sciences from the Czech Academy of Sciences (2014).
* beyond any doubt, Pavel Krejcci is worthy of this honour, and the Czech Academy of Sciences can only be congratulated for the wise decision to bestow on him the Bernard Bolzano Honorary Medal for Merit in Mathematical Sciences.

Born 21 June 1954, Decin, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic).
