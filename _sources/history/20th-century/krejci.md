**Pavel Krejčí** is a Czech mathematician who is known for his work on the applications of differential equations to hysteresis problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pavel Krejčí pioneered the study of tropical geometry, a new field of mathematics combining algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and convex geometry.
2. He was the first to solve a series of problems concerning the classification of structures that arise in algebraic geometry and tropical geometry. 
3. He discovered new properties of polytopes, which are convex figures in a Euclidean space. 
4. He developed techniques to produce tropical fans and cones of convex polytopes. 
5. He solved several problems in enumerative algebraic geometry and tropical geometry regarding the number and structure of solutions of polynomial equations. 
6. He established a new connection between tropical geometry and algebraic number theory. 
7. He introduced new methods for studying phylogenetic trees and mathematical genetics.

Born 21 June 1954, Decin, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic).
