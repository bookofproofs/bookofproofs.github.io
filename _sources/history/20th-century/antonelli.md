**Kathleen McNulty Antonelli** was an Irish-born American computer programmer who was one of the first to work with the early ENIAC machine.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* She was given the name Kathleen Rita McNulty but, after she married John Mauchly in 1948, she became Kay Mauchly then, some years after John Mauchly's death in 1980, she married Severo Antonelli.
* Kathleen McNulty's parents were James McNulty (1890-1977) and Anne Nelis (1892-1966).
* James McNulty was born in Creeslough in Donegal County, Ireland where his family had owned a large part of the hillside for generations.
* His father Patrick McNulty died in 1892 and his mother Catherine McNulty in 1902 so by age eleven he was brought up by his older brothers.
* In early 1919 James McNulty was involved in an attempt to seize guns from the home of a protestant JP.
* Kathleen, the subject of this biography, had two older brothers Patrick John McNulty (1918-1986) and James Joseph McNulty (1919-2001).
* On 7 February 1921 Kathleen's father was with a group of men who blew up a railway bridge causing a derailment in which fifteen British soldiers were injured.
* On the night that Kathleen was born, 12 February, he was arrested at his home and kept in Derry Jail.
* The family, Annie, Patrick, James, Kathleen and her sister Anna Marie McNulty (1923-2003) sailed on the S S Columbia from Londonderry to New York arriving on 13 October 1924.
* The 1930 US Census shows the family to have increased with Cecilia Marguerite McNulty (1926-2014) and John Joseph McNulty (1928-1992) both being born in Philadelphia.
* Living with them are John McNulty, the oldest brother of James McNulty and 14 years his elder, and Hugh Nelis, Annie's brother.
* Kathleen's education was in Catholic Schools in the United States beginning in 1927.
* After graduating Kay McNulty answered an advertisement by the Moore School of Engineering for "math majors" and she applied, was interviewed and was employed as a mathematician; she worked on preparing firing tables for guns.
* The ENIAC computer (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) which McNulty refers to in the above quote was being constructed by John Mauchly and John Eckert in the Moore School of Engineering during the war years.
* It was designed for the specific task of compiling tables for the trajectories of bombs and shells to take over the calculations which McNulty and about 75 other women were carrying out.
* McNulty was one of six women who became operators of ENIAC making very substantial contributions to computer science, although it took many years before they received the credit which they deserve for their pioneering work.
* On 7 February 1948 McNulty married John Mauchly, one of the two designers of the ENIAC computer.
* In fact Kathleen's parents refused to attend their daughter's wedding and only after the birth of her first child, Sally, did her mother relent and visit her.
* Kathleen and John Mauchly had five children, Sally (born 1949), Kathy (born 1951), Bill (born 1953), Gini (born 1954) and Eva (born 1958).
* Some years after the death of her husband in 1980, she married the photographer Severo Antonelli and lived in Pennsylvania.
* Kay Antonelli was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 1997.
* Antonelli died of cancer at Keystone Hospice in Wyndmoor and her funeral was held in St Anthony's Roman Catholic Church, Ambler.

Born 12 February 1921, Creeslough, County Donegal, Ireland. Died 20 April 2006, Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, USA.
