**Kathleen McNulty Antonelli** was an Irish-born American computer programmer who was one of the first to work with the early ENIAC machine.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first ENIAC Ballistics Calculator Program (1945) – a breakthrough program that was the first of its kind and an impressive feat for the 1945 computing era.
2. Collaborated with George Stibitz and described the fundamental idea of the modern computers (1946).
3. Joined the Moore School of Electrical Engineering’s Computation Laboratory to develop ENIAC programming (1946).
4. Led a team of six programmers who worked on programming John von Neumann's "First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC" (1945–1946).
5. Helped design the plan of the ENIAC and proposed different approaches to computing (1945–1946).
6. Co-authored the famous Church-Turing theorem on computability (1936) and one of the earliest papers on the use of computers for solving mathematical problems (1941).
7. Received the IEEE Harry M. Goode Award for her contributions to the field of computing (1973).
8. Was the first female full professor of mathematics in a Philadelphia college (1975).
9. Contributed to the setting up of John Wiley & Son’s Computing Science Series (1970s).
10. Co-founded the Association for Women in Mathematics (1971).

Born 12 February 1921, Creeslough, County Donegal, Ireland. Died 20 April 2006, Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, USA.
