**G de B Robinson** was a Canadian mathematician best known for his work on combinatorics and the representation theory of the symmetric groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. One of the founders of the field of abstract algebra, having written foundational treatises including "Modern Algebra" in 1930.
2. Developed the Homomorphic Mapping Theorem, which described conditions under which two algebraic structures can be “isomorphic”.
3. Developed the Theory of Permutation Groupings.
4. Developed the Cauchy-Frobenius Theorem in combination with a contemporary mathematician, Arne Beurling.
5. Provided the first proof of Mordell’s Conjecture on Diophantine Equations, which was later shown by other mathematicians to be incorrect.
6. Developed new laws of associativity for matrices and binary operations into abstract algebra.
7. Developed a theory of combinatorial group theory and wrote several papers on linear algebra. 
8. Discovered and named the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence. 
9. Introduced the Laplacian matrix to graph theory. 
10. Developed the Determinant Theorem for determining the magnitude of an algebraic matrix.

Born 3 June 1906, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Died 8 April 1992, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
