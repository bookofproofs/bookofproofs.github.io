**Michael Artin** is an American mathematician known for his contributions to algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* She attended the gymnasium in Hamburg and then Hamburg University where she took classes taught by Emil Artin.
* Emil Artin, born in Vienna, was descended from an Armenian carpet merchant who moved to Vienna in the 19th  century.
* The Artin home was always filled with music.
* Michael played the violin, and later at college played classical guitar and the lute.
* Artin graduated with an A.B. from Princeton in 1955 and, later that year, went to Harvard for graduate studies.
* Artin was awarded a Ph.D. by Harvard in 1960 for his thesis On Enriques' Surfaces.
* After the award of his doctorate in 1960, Artin was appointed as a Benjamin Peirce Lecturer at Harvard.
* At IHES, Artin attended Alexander Grothendieck's seminars which had a major influence on the direction of his research in algebraic geometry at this time.
* The point of the extension is that Artin's theorem on approximating formal power series solutions allows one to show that many moduli spaces are actually algebraic spaces and so can be studied by the methods of algebraic geometry.
* Algebraic stacks and algebraic spaces appear everywhere in modern algebraic geometry, and Artin's methods are used constantly in studying them.
* At MIT, Artin was promoted to professor in 1966 and, in August of the same year, was given the honour of being a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Moscow.
* Artin has written several outstanding books.
* These include the monograph (with Barry Mazur) Ã‰tale homotopy (1969) and Algebraic spaces (1971) which is a printed version of the James K Whittemore Lecture in Mathematics given by Artin at Yale University in 1969.
* Artin has been closely connected with the American Mathematical Society over a long period.
* We have already mentioned above that Artin was awarded the American Mathematical Society's Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement in 2002.

Born 28 June 1934, Hamburg, Germany.
