**Michael Artin** is an American mathematician known for his contributions to algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* She attended the gymnasium in Hamburg and then Hamburg University where she took classes taught by Emil Artin.
* Emil Artin, born in Vienna, was descended from an Armenian carpet merchant who moved to Vienna in the 19th  century.
* Michael was their second child.
* Because Natascha's father, the agronomist Naum Jasny, was Jewish, Emil Artin was in difficulties with the Nazi anti-Semitic legislation brought in in 1933.
* When Michael was three years old, in 1937, Emil lost his position at the University of Hamburg and decided to emigrate to the United States for the sake of his wife and children.
* Michael's young brother Thomas was born in the United States in November 1938.
* The Artin home was always filled with music.
* Michael played the violin, and later at college played classical guitar and the lute.
* Michael's father used to read to him in German when he was a child and then later they had a rule that only German was spoken at the dinner table.
* In April 1946 Emil Artin was appointed as a professor at Princeton and he was joined in Princeton by the rest of his family in the autumn of 1946.
* Michael was an undergraduate at Princeton where, because his father was on the faculty, he received free education.
* Artin graduated with an A.B. from Princeton in 1955 and, later that year, went to Harvard for graduate studies.
* Artin was awarded a Ph.D. by Harvard in 1960 for his thesis On Enriques' Surfaces.
* After the award of his doctorate in 1960, Artin was appointed as a Benjamin Peirce Lecturer at Harvard.
* At IHES, Artin attended Alexander Grothendieck's seminars which had a major influence on the direction of his research in algebraic geometry at this time.
* The point of the extension is that Artin's theorem on approximating formal power series solutions allows one to show that many moduli spaces are actually algebraic spaces and so can be studied by the methods of algebraic geometry.
* Algebraic stacks and algebraic spaces appear everywhere in modern algebraic geometry, and Artin's methods are used constantly in studying them.
* At MIT, Artin was promoted to professor in 1966 and, in August of the same year, was given the honour of being a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Moscow.
* Artin has written several outstanding books.
* These include the monograph (with Barry Mazur) Ã‰tale homotopy (1969) and Algebraic spaces (1971) which is a printed version of the James K Whittemore Lecture in Mathematics given by Artin at Yale University in 1969.
* Artin has been closely connected with the American Mathematical Society over a long period.
* We have already mentioned above that Artin was awarded the American Mathematical Society's Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement in 2002.
* Michael Artin is married to Jean.
* They have a daughter Wendy S Artin, a talented painter who lives and paints in Rome in Italy and a second daughter Caroline who works as an editor.

Born 28 June 1934, Hamburg, Germany.
