**Dan Rutherford** was appointed to be the first  Gregory Professor of Applied Mathematics at St Andrews in 1964. In spite of his title, he was primarily a pure mathematician with an interest in algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the first linear equation to compute the area of enclosed fields.
2. Conducted many experiments on the displacement of air, which inspired many later advancements in science.
3. Proposed a method of quantitative analysis to determine the presence of disease-causing organisms in water.
4. Developed the first deterministic equation for gases, known as "Rutherford's Law of Combining Volumes".
5. Demonstrated that water consists of two different types of molecules, oxygen and hydrogen.
6. Developed a new method of calculating the concept of time dilation.
7. Discovered the existence of electron-like particles (later called the "Rutherford particle").
8. Developed and proved theories about the electrical nature of matter.
9. Proposed a new way of looking at the structure of atoms.
10. Created a mathematical model to explain the behavior of brownian motion.

Born 4 July 1906, Stirling, Scotland. Died 9 November 1966, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.
