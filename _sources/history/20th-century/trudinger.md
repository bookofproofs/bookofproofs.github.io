**Neil Trudinger** is an Australian mathematician who worked in the theory of partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In another 1967 paper On Harnack type inequalities and their application to quasilinear elliptic equations  Trudinger examines weak solutions, subsolutions and supersolutions of certain quasilinear second order differential equations.
* After the award of his doctorate from Stanford University, Trudinger became a Courant Instructor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University during the academic year 1966-67.
* In 1977 Trudinger published an important book in collaboration with David Gilbarg.
* In following the editions of the famous text by Gilbarg and Trudinger we have become side-tracked from presenting details of Trudinger's career.
* Trudinger was elected a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 1978 and was awarded their Hannan Medal in 1996.
* In the nonlinear analysis section, the prize goes to N S Trudinger of the Australian National University for the paper "Isoperimetric inequalities for quermassintegrals".
* Today Trudinger coordinates the Applied and Nonlinear Analysis programme at the Australian National University.

Born 20 June 1942, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia.
