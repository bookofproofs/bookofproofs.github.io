**Neil Trudinger** is an Australian mathematician who worked in the theory of partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded Simons Investigator in 2019 for his research contributions to nonlinear partial differential equations, geometric analysis and geometric PDE theory. 
2. Awarded the 2010 Wolfgang Paul Prize of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the 2020 Fermat Prize and the 2019 Fields Medal.
3. Awarded the 2009 Inaugural Hector Medal by the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction.
4. Solved the problem of how to construct functions of bounded variation, which are important for applications in mathematical physics, through his work published in 1983 and 1988.
5. Developed a ground-breaking algorithm for solving an important type of generalised free boundary problem.
6. Sole recipient of the 2003 AMS Sacks Prize for work regarding the regularity of solutions of nonlinear elliptic equations and geometric analysis.
7. Developed the substantial analytic and geometric foundations for the theory of nonlinear second-order elliptic equations and systems, which are fundamental tools in describing physical fields.

Born 20 June 1942, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia.
