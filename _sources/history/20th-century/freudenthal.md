**Hans Freudenthal** was a German-born Dutch mathematician who made important contributions to algebraic topology. He also published works on history and mathematical education.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Freudenthal Susceptibility Theorem which is used in electronics, to predict resonance frequency in circuits. 
2. Developed the Freudenthal Spectroscopic Theorem which provides insight into the electronic structure of molecules.
3. Proposed the subsagitta theorem to calculate the perimeter of small similar figures.
4. Led the team that created the book Geometry and the imagination, which is a pioneering textbook on geometry.
5. Explored the use of gauge theory in the context of the Einstein field equations.
6. Conducted research on group theory, Lie algebras, nonassociative algebras and algebraic geometry.
7. Developed the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem which provided an exact model of gravitational forces in elementary particles.
8. Received the Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1988.

Born 17 September 1905, Luckenwalde, Germany. Died 13 October 1990, Utrecht, The Netherlands.
