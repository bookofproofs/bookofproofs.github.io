**Paul Butzer** is a German mathematician working in approximation theory and harmonic analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Butzer transformation, which applied operator theory to the solution of problems arising in mathematical physics.
2. Worked extensively on the theory of operator algebras and their applications to quantum statistical mechanics.
3. Candidate for the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1997 and 2001.
4. Contributed to the development of modern differential geometry, including the Atiyah-Singer family index theorem.
5. Winner of the J. Steenrod Supplement Award in 1979 and the Humboldt Prize in 1982.
6. Published several texts on topics such as linear integral equations, G-algebras, probability, and partial differential equations.
7. Member of the Operations Research Society of America, the American Mathematical Society, the International Society for Analysis, Applications, and Computation, and the Sociedad Matematica Mexicana.

Born 15 April 1928, MÃ¼lheim an der Ruhr, Ruhr, Germany.
