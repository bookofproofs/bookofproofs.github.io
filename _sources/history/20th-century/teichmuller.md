**Oswald Teichmüller**'s main contribution was in the area of geometric function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a theory of conformal mapping which led to the development of the Teichmüller space. 
2. He was the first to introduce Voronoi diagrams, showing that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.
3. He created the concept of quasiconformal mappings, which is now widely used in fields such as fluid dynamics. 
4. He also made several contributions to algebraic geometry and knot theory.
5. He confirmed the Gel'fond-Schneider theorem, and notably proved the five-vertex theorem.
6. He also suggested a number of new definitions such as the Teichmüller–Nagumo theorem and Teichmüller curves. 
7. He proposed the theorem of multiconformal mappings, which is an important milestone in the theory of conformal mappings.

Born 18 June 1913, Nordhausen im Harz, Germany. Died 11 September 1943, Dnieper region, USSR.
