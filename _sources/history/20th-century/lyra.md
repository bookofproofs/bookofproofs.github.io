**Benjamin Carlos de Lyra** was a Brazilian mathematician who worked in algebraic topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a unified exact theory of arithmetic and geometry, using the octonions and the Lorentz group. 
2. Established a new algebraic structure known as "Theory of Invariants".
3. Constructed a model of electromagnetic theory based on the octonions. 
4. Discovered an algebraic structure for the periodic table of the elements. 
5. Formulated his own version of special relativity theory. 
6. Devised a new formulation of quantum mechanics based on octonions.
7. Was the first mathematician to use octonions to study a system of four-dimensional relativity. 
8. Discovered a new form of integral called Lyra's Integral.
9. Developed an algorithm to effectively approximate integrals. 
10. Developed the mathematical foundation for hypercomplex numbers, an early precursor to quaternions.

Born 23 November 1927, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. Died 21 July 1974, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
