**Michio Suzuki** was a Japanese mathematician who studied group theory and discovered the groups named after him.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a method of simultaneous linear equations, where two or more equations can be solved at the same time. 
2. He proposed an algebraic procedure for calculating factorials. 
3. He proved that a summation of the reciprocal of perfect powers above 2 is finite. 
4. He discovered a method for approximating the volume of a hypersphere using a series of integrals. 
5. He proved the existence of a multiplication table for any abelian group. 
6. He extended the Bernoulli-Cauchy Theorem from the field of algebra to the field of trigonometry. 
7. He developed several solutions to the Dirichlet problem in conformal mapping. 
8. He contributed to the development of the theory of elementary divisors. 
9. He introduced an algebraic equation that is known as the Suzuki equation. 
10. He developed an integral formula for certain Hurwitz zeta functions.

Born 2 October 1926, Chiba, Japan. Died 31 May 1998, Mitaka, Japan.
