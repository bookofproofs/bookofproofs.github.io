**Michio Suzuki** was a Japanese mathematician who studied group theory and discovered the groups named after him.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Michio Suzuki studied at the Third High School of Japan in Kyoto, entering the school in April 1942.
* There were a number of pupils at the Third High School who went on to make major contributions to mathematics, for example Noboro Ito and Hidehiko Yamabe were a class above Suzuki, being slightly older than him.
* Quite often classes could not be held regularly and Suzuki had to go to work in the fields and factories with his classmates.
* The war was reaching its climax in April 1945 when Suzuki entered the University of Tokyo to study mathematics.
* Tokyo was often bombed and on those occasions Suzuki and his fellow students had to escape into the countryside.
* After his undergraduate studies, Suzuki began research in the University of Tokyo's graduate School in April 1948.
* In April 1951, while still working on his dissertation, Suzuki was appointed as a lecturer at Tokyo University of Education.
* Brauer's influence on Suzuki was highly significant and led him towards the most important areas.
* In September 1952 Suzuki was awarded a post-doctoral fellowship to undertake research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and in November he married Naoko Akizuki, the daughter of a professor at Kyoto University; they had a daughter, Kazuko Suzuki.
* After spending academic year 1956-57 at Harvard University, Suzuki returned to the University of Illinois where he was promoted to associate professor in 1958 and full professor in 1959.
* Let us explain a little about the area in which Suzuki was working.
* In 1957 Suzuki made a major breakthrough.
* For those who know some group theory, we note that Suzuki proved that a finite group of odd order cannot be simple if the centraliser of every non-identity element is abelian.
* Suzuki's discovery of a new class of finite simple groups in 1960 shook mathematics.
* In 1967 Suzuki discovered another new finite simple group.
* Let us return to our sketch of Suzuki's career.
* Although Professor Suzuki was affiliated with the University of Illinois from 1952 until his death, he had a profound influence on the development of group theory (and subsequently of algebraic combinatorics) in Japan.
* We believe it is fair to say that much of the respect given to group theory in Japan as a whole derives from that given to Professor Michio Suzuki as one of the top mathematicians in the world (of course, many other Japanese group theorists deserve credit: nonetheless, the influence of Professor Suzuki was extraordinary).
* Michio Suzuki received many honours for his contributions to group theory.
* In 1974 Suzuki was awarded the Academy Prize from theJapan Academy.

Born 2 October 1926, Chiba, Japan. Died 31 May 1998, Mitaka, Japan.
