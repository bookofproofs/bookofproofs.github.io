**Chike Obi** was a Nigerian mathematician and politician. He was the first Nigerian to hold a doctorate in mathematics. His research was on non-linear ordinary differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Joseph Chike Edozien Obi, born on 28 July 1925 in Asaba, is recorded as having the same parents.
* Joseph Obi studied medicine and became a university professor.
* This information should not be inconsistent for Chike and Joseph should then be brothers.
* Looking at their biographies, however, makes it appear unlikely that they were brothers and the position is made more complicated by reports that when Chike died, several press reports mistakenly printed Joseph's picture instead of Chike's.
* We note that Chike Obi was brought up a Roman Catholic, remaining of that faith throughout his life, but he showed his open mindedness by naming one of his sons Mustafa, a Muslim name.
* Chike attended St Patrick's Primary School, Zaria, and obtained his Standard Six Certificate in 1933 before moving to Christ the King College, Onitsha in 1935.
* Obi attended this school until 1939 when he was awarded a West African School Certificate.
* Obi took the college courses in 1940-42 but in 1941 he also began taking the correspondence courses as a University of London external student.
* Obi began studying as a University of London external student for an M.Sc. and he won a scholarship to fund attending the University of Cambridge to undertake research for a doctorate.
* Obi submitted his first paper Subharmonic solutions of non-linear differential equations of the second order to the Journal of the London Mathematical Society in 1949 and it was published in 1950.
* Before returning to Nigeria, Obi spent time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, under the Foreign Students Summer Project.
* At Ibadan, Obi pursued two careers, one as a mathematician and the other a political activist arguing for Nigerian independence.
* or totalitarian mobilization of all the nation's cultural, spiritual, economic and political resources in order to ensure the military security and rapid progress of newly liberated African states.
* The policy of Kemalism which Obi followed is the policy implemented by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk to move Turkey to a modern Westernised society.
* Obi served as the first secretary-general of the Dynamic Party.
* Obi married the nurse Belinda Nwanyife (1933-2010) in 1953.
* Their two eldest sons are Balogun Chike-Obi, who studied physics who became a professor of the University of Ilorin, and Mustafa Chike-Obi who obtained a degree in mathematics, then had a career in finance.
* Balogun Chike-Obi has published books such as Collisionless Magnetic Reconnection (1982).
* Chike and Belinda Obi had one further son and a daughter.
* In 1953, in addition to the book Our Struggle, Obi published two mathematical papers, both in Volume 28 of the Journal of the London Mathematical Society, namely Periodic solutions of non-linear differential equations of order 2n and A non-linear differential equation of the second order with periodic solutions whose associated limit cycles are algebraic curves.
* Obi's Dynamic Party merged with the National Council of Nigeria and Cameroon in 1956 when an attempt was made to ban political parties in Nigeria.
* Obi was in England in the summer of 1947 and returned from Liverpool to Lagos on the Apapa, leaving on 11 July.
* In 1959 Obi was promoted to Senior Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Ibadan.
* Obi was elected as member for Onitsha Urban East to the Eastern House Assembly in November 1961 but refused to give up his seat in the Federal Parliament.
* The Speaker of the Parliament ordered that Obi be physically removed by security guards, which is exactly what happened.
* Obi then decided that he would devote himself to regional rather than national affairs.
* Chike Obi was one of the people arrested and detained with Chief Obafemi Awolowo on the charge of treasonable felony.
* Also in 1962 Obi published Our Struggle Part II.
* Regional governments were abolished which was why Obi ceased to be a member of the Eastern House Assembly.
* Onitsha was in Biafra and with Obi a Christian, the Biafran side was the obvious one for him to support.
* With the end of the Biafran war, Obi returned to mathematics.
* Obi's two eldest sons had been educated during the years that Obi was first a lecturer in Ibadan, then a politician in Onitsha, and finally a professor in Lagos.
* Back into mathematics at the University of Lagos, Obi began mathematical research again having not published a paper since 1955.
* But Chike Obi was not mean; in fact, he was the opposite.
* But no other teacher of mine was as tolerant of me as Chike Obi.
* Although Obi returned to full time mathematics in 1970, he did not give up his attempts to improve the lot of Nigerians.
* In 1985 Obi was awarded the Sigvard Eklund Prize.
* Obi travelled to the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste in November 1986 to receive the prize.
* Earlier Obi had been honoured with election to the Nigerian Academy of Science in 1977, being one of those elected at the establishment of the Academy on 18 January 1977.
* Most biographies of Obi relate how he solved Fermat's Last Theorem in 1997 providing an elementary proof.
* Obi is one of several leading mathematicians who, when fairly old, have believed, incorrectly, that they have solved a major mathematical problem.
* laid to rest in his Obiezoba family home of Ogboli Olosi Quarters in Onitsha amidst eulogies from prominent Nigerians.

Born 7 April 1921, Zaria, Nigeria. Died 13 March 2008, Onitsha, Anambra state, Nigeria.
