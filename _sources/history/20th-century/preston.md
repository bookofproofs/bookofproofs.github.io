**Gordon Preston** was an English mathematician who worked at Bletchley Park in World War II. He was an important worker in semigroup theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In common with other bright mathematics undergraduates, Preston went to Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, a government research centre north of London.
* Preston now continued to undertake research at Oxford on a part-time basis, first with Whitehead then with E C (Edward) Thomson as his advisor.
* Preston was released from his teaching duties at the Royal Military College of Science so that he could spend two years in the United States.
* The first volume of Clifford and Preston's The algebraic theory of semigroups was published in 1961.
* Gordon lived in Oxford - Shrivenham, his place of work, is just 30 km away - and he was a regular attender at the Higman algebra seminar.
* We mentioned above that the first volume of Clifford and Preston, The algebraic theory of semigroups,  was published in 1961.
