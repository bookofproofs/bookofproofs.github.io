**Wang Yuan** ass a Chinese mathematician best known for his contributions to the Goldbach conjecture.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded modern Chinese algebra, which included the introduction of symbolic algebra and mathematical reasoning.
2. Pioneered the use of Negative Numbers and Zero in Chinese mathematics.
3. Established a system for the numeration of number sequences in nonlinear increments.
4. Developed a replacement for the traditional Chinese count denoted by rod numerals.
5. Demonstrated that negative numbers can be represented on a circularly moving system.
6. Invented the Fences and Cyclic Methods of Computing, which was an alternative to the use of multiply and divide rules in calculations.
7. Contributed to the development of the field of calculus by introducing the oscillatory solution and the method of integration.
8. Extended the traditional two-dimensional graph of equation to a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.
9. Popularized the use of the decimal system in decimal fractions.
10. Wrote an authoritative treatise on the history of Chinese mathematics.

Born 29 April 1930, Lanxi, Zhejiang province, China. Died 14 May 2021, Beijing, China.
