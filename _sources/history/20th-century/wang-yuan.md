**Wang Yuan** ass a Chinese mathematician best known for his contributions to the Goldbach conjecture.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Wang Yuan fell in love with analytic number theory and gave a series of lectures to the graduate seminar based on Ingham's book The distribution of prime numbers.
* Wang Yuan graduated in 1952 and was assigned a position by the government in the Institute of Mathematics at the Academia Sinica in Nanking.
* Chern had acted as director there from 1946 to 1949 but had returned to the United States three years before Wang Yuan started to work there.
* Wang Yuan was assigned to the number theory section where he worked under Professor Hua Loo Keng, the director of the Institute.
* Most of Wang Yuan's research has been in the area of number theory.
* In 1957 Wang Yuan published four papers: On sieve methods and some of their applications; On some properties of integral valued polynomials; On the representation of large even number as a sum of two almost-primes; and On sieve methods and some of the related problems.
* Wang Yuan continued to improve his results on the Goldbach conjecture.
* Wang Yuan was harassed and put through critical interrogation.
