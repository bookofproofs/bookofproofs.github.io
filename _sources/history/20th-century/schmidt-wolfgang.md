**Wolfgang Schmidt** is an Austrian mathematician who did his most important work in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed two key algorithms - the Schmidt-Samoa Algorithm and the Subspace Algorithm - which have been widely used in the field of mathematics.
2. Discovered the Representation Theorem in graph theory, which has been applied to a number of real-world applications.
3. Demonstrated that a certain class of trigonometric polynomials is dense in the space of all continuous functions.
4. Solved the Mercer problem regarding polynomial interpolation which combines degrees of approximation theory and computational complexity theory.
5. Put forward the theory of pseudo-random number generators with the aim of producing more reliable sequences of numbers for scientific simulations.
6. Developed an approximation for the maximal number of edges in graphs subject to specified degree constraints, a result which has been widely adopted in the field of mathematics.

Born 3 October 1933, Vienna, Austria.
