**Shizuo Kakutani** was a Japanese-born American mathematician who worked in probability theory, ergodic theory and complex analysis, and is best known for his fixed-point theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He formulated the Kakutani Fixed Point Theorem in 1941, providing a foundation for the study of convex sets and affine geometry.
2. He introduced the calculus of finite variation, which became a major part of the field of convex optimization.
3. He was awarded the George Pólya Prize for his research in numerical analysis, optimization and game theory.
4. He received the John von Neumann Theory Prize, recognizing his work in convex sets, fixed point theory and measure theory.
5. He solved the problem of determination of continuous functions that maximize or minimize a given integral. 
6. He advanced the study of Fourier series, partial differential equations and potential theory, contributing to the development of mathematical analysis.
7. He advanced the use of computers to solve optimization problems, contributing to the evolution of both mathematical analysis and computer science.
8. He published twenty-five papers in mathematical journals between 1930 and 1941.
9. He was a Guggenheim fellow in 1937. 
10. He established the first Institute of Mathematics at the University of Tokyo.

Born 28 August 1911, Osaka, Japan. Died 17 August 2004, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.
