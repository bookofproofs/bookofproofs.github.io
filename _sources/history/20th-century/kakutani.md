**Shizuo Kakutani** was a Japanese-born American mathematician who worked in probability theory, ergodic theory and complex analysis, and is best known for his fixed-point theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Seiichi studied physics at Kyoto University and it was through him that Shizuo was first introduced to mathematics.
* Shizuo was fascinated and was enthusiastic to learn more mathematics.
* The first problem was that Kakujiro Kakutani had made the decision that one of his two sons would follow him into law and take over his practice in due course.
* After completing his middle school, Shizuo entered Konan High School in Kobe to prepare for his university studies.
* However, Shizuo was now not qualified to enter a mathematics course at either the University of Tokyo or Kyoto University since these had absolute rules regarding entry qualifications.
* There was one possible route for Shizuo which was to enter Tohoku University in Sendai.
* Kakutani applied but there were only fifteen places, and seventeen applicants.
* Of the seventeen, exactly fifteen had the science qualification from high school so it looked like an easy task to decide to admit those and to turn down Kakutani.
* However, after due consideration it was decided to admit all seventeen applicants and Kakutani had scrape through.
* At Tohoku University Kakutani was introduced to the theory of analytic functions.
* Indeed on the strength of this work Weyl invited Kakutani in 1940 to spend two years at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
* Kakutani not only took great interest in the work of Weyl's group at Princeton but also the group of mathematicians working with von Neumann on measure theory and ergodic theory.
* Kakutani also made many visits during which he met mathematicians such as Garrett Birkhoff, G D Birkhoff, Stone, Wiener, and Hille.
* In December 1941 with Kakutani still studying at Princeton, war broke out between the United States and Japan with the entry of the U.S.A. into the Second World War.
* Of course this put Kakutani in a difficult position for he was now a guest in a country at war with his own.
* What, you may wonder, did Kakutani do.
* On his return to Japan Kakutani accepted the appointment as assistant professor at Osaka University.
* Kakutani, however, managed to continue to produce a stream of papers containing highly original ideas.
* In 1948 Kakutani was again invited to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
* Kakutani contributed to several areas of mathematics.
* Kakutani was to remain at Yale until he retired in 1982.

Born 28 August 1911, Osaka, Japan. Died 17 August 2004, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.
