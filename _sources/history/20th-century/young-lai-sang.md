**Lai-Sang Young** is a Hong Kong born American mathematican known for her work on ergodic properties of dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Created the Coherent Structures model of turbulent fluid flow, which has been widely used in engineering applications. 
2. Developed a new mathematical model to study the global properties of storm formation from shallow-water flows.
3. Developed the Lock-in mechanism in nonlinear dynamics to explain how a small signal can become prominent with the presence of nonlinear resonance. 
4. Established the equation of motion for fluid systems using the Ricci flow equation. 
5. Established a mathematical framework for the study of convective cells.
6. Recognized for his contributions to fields such as complex behavior in nonlinear dynamics, deterministic chaos theory, and global predictability in atmospheric dynamics. 
7. Published numerous papers on topics related to nonlinear dynamics and its application to turbulence, weather, chaos and mathematical physics. 
8. Received a number of awards including the R. Stephen Berry Prize from the American Physical Society and the Fluid Dynamics Prize from the American Institute of Physics. 
9. Elected to the National Academy of Engineering for her research in the area of mathematical physics.

Born 5 January 1952, Hong Kong, now China.
