**Lucien Alexandre Charles René de Possel** was a French mathematician and computer scientist who worked on optical character recognition. He was one of the founders of the Bourbakists.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed mathematical equations to solve problems in the field of Applied Mathematics, specifically the theory of curves and surfaces.
2. Pioneered the theory of algebraic curves, which formed the basis for many of the methods used to solve problems in Differential Geometry.
3. Published seminal works on the calculus of variations from a geometric point of view.
4. Found important applications of the Langrange Multiplier theorem for solving equations with multiple constraints.
5. Discovered solutions for an important set of partial differential equations known as Descartes equations.
6. Made fundamental contributions to the theory of differential equations and the development of their solutions.
7. Established key results in the theory of analytic functions and their application to differential equations.
8. Pioneered research on the algebraic number theory.
9. Proposed important methods of interpolation and approximation of functions.
10. Developed methods of graph theory and its application to the study of language structures.

Born 7 February 1905, Marseilles, France. Died 26 February 1974, Paris, France.
