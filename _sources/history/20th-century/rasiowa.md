**Helena Rasiowa** was an Austrian-born Polish mathematician who worked in algebraic logic and the mathematical foundations of computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1918 Poland regained its status as an independent nation and Rasiowa's parents moved to Warsaw.
* Rasiowa entered the University of Warsaw in 1938 but, after the German invasion of Poland in 1939, the university closed.
* Rasiowa and her parents moved to Lwów (now Lviv in Ukrains) but the Poles were trapped between the Soviets and the Germans and Lwów came under Soviet control.
* In this dangerous situation Rasiowa learnt mathematics, knowing that the penalties for being discovered were extreme.
* Yet in this environment Rasiowa studied for her Master's Degree under Łukasiewicz's supervision.
* Rasiowa's thesis burned together with the whole house.
* After the war Rasiowa taught in a secondary school while her supervisor Łukasiewicz left Poland after the terrible suffering he had gone through.
* Mostowski however remembered Rasiowa's impressive work and persuaded her to return to the University of Warsaw to complete a second Master's Thesis under his supervision.
* Rasiowa was promoted steadily, reaching the rank of Professor in 1957 and Full Professor in 1967.
* Of course Rasiowa's work on algebraic logic was in precisely the right area to make her a natural contributor to theoretical computer science.
* In fact in 1984 Rasiowa introduced an important concept of inference where the basic information was incomplete.
* Rasiowa wrote over 100 papers, books and monographs.
* Rasiowa remained active right up to her death, having completed eight chapters of a new monograph Algebraic analysis of non-classical first order logics before entering hospital with her final illness.

Born 20 June 1917, Vienna, Austria. Died 9 August 1994, Warsaw, Poland.
