**Helena Rasiowa** was an Austrian-born Polish mathematician who worked in algebraic logic and the mathematical foundations of computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a strong theoretical basis for the extension of classical propositional logic to first-order predicate logic.
2. Developed techniques for proving completeness and incompleteness of logics and their axiomatization.
3. Developed the theory of logics with infinitely many formulas and identity, which had held a deep influence in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Mathematical Logic.
4. Co-authored the two-volume book “Mathematical Logic” regarded as one of the most comprehensive works in the field of mathematical logic.
5. Pioneered the implementation of mathematical systems in computers.
6. Developed algebraic or procedural methods for solving ‘word equations’, allowing one to solve various decision problems.
7. Developed a method for constructing the most general model of a finite set of sentences.
8. Pioneered the study of universal algebraic doctrines which became the foundation of universal algebra.
 9. First to proved any significant metamathematical theorem about any non-classical logic.
10. Received the IEEE Harry H. Goode Memorial Award in 1978 for her contributions in the field of mathematical logic and foundations of Computer Science.

Born 20 June 1917, Vienna, Austria. Died 9 August 1994, Warsaw, Poland.
