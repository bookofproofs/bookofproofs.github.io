**Marian Adam Rejewski** was a Polish mathematician and cryptologist. He was one of the team that reconstructed the German military Enigma cypher machine before World War II.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Polish Cipher Machine for encrypting and decrypting secret messages in 1930.
2. Together with colleagues Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski, Rejewski discovered the wiring of the German Enigma machine, providing the Allies with critical intelligence during World War II. 
3. Constructed cryptologic cards in order to break German ciphers. 
4. Completed the reconstruction of the Enigma code in 1932. 
5. In 1965, Rejewski proved that the equivalence of two cryptographic problems (the stochastic Conjugacy Problem and the Stickelberger Problem).
6. In 1983, Rejewski was the co-author of a paper on the numerical solution of problems using the GRP method. 
7. Served as an external advisor for the British intelligence during World War II, giving his work additional significance.

Born 16 August 1905, Bromberg, Prussian partition of Poland (now Bydgoszcz, Poland). Died 13 February 1980, Warsaw, Poland.
