**George Mackey** was an American mathematician who worked on the representation theory of groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the use of representation theory in quantum mechanics, which forms the basis of much of modern mathematical physics.
2. Spurred his work on operator algebras and unitary representation theory, which became foundational work for numerous applications in mathematics and physics.
3. Developed a deep understanding of group representations, which became essential to understanding problems in quantum mechanics and other aspects of mathematical physics.
4. Developed a new and compelling approach to information theory based on group representation theory.
5. Systematically extended Lie theory to the point where it could be useful to particle physicists and others involved in studying the symmetries of physical systems.
6. Established a formal approach in representation theory for the analysis of Yang-Mills fields.
7. Introduced new methods and theorems in analytic number theory drawing on his work in representation theory and algebra. 
8. Developed groundbreaking studies in spectral theory, with a particular emphasis on spectral multipliers, spectral measures, and the Fourier and wavelet transforms.

Born 1 February 1916, St Louis, Missouri, USA. Died 15 March 2006, Belmont, Massachusetts, USA.
