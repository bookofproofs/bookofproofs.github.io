**Emanuels Grinbergs** was a Russian mathematician who worked in geometry and graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was, therefore, to an independent Latvia that Grinbergs' family returned in 1923 on the death of his father.
* On their return, they lived in Riga where Grinbergs attended high school.
* Returning to Latvia, Grinbergs studied mathematics at the University of Latvia between 1930 and 1934.
* Returning to Riga, Grinbergs became a Privatdozent at the University of Latvia in 1937 and began his lecturing career in January 1938 teaching courses on geometry.
* Political moves which would have a major impact on Grinbergs' career were soon happening; in particular the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact was signed in August 1939 and Latvia's fate was out of its own hands.
* During this extremely difficult period Grinbergs undertook research towards his thesis.
* For a period Latvia was a province of a larger Ostland (including Estonia, Lithuania, and Byelorussia) and during this period, in 1943, Grinbergs defended his thesis On oscillations, superoscillations and characteristic points.
* Immediately following this Grinbergs was drafted into the German army.
* The fact that Grinbergs had served in the German army (he was forced to do so and he certainly did not wish to serve any army) did not find favour with the new Soviet rulers of Latvia and he was sent to a camp in Kutaisi, Georgia, in the Caucasus.
* In 1947 Grinbergs was allowed to return to Latvia, but he had to work in a factory involved in the manufacture of radios.
* Grinbergs soon began to apply his great mathematical skills to problems concerning radios.
* This Centre had been established in 1959 under the leadership of Eizens Arins and Arins, Grinbergs and Janis Daube were the main research leaders.
* Grinbergs now led a group which undertook research into a number of different topics using computers.

Born 25 January 1911, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 25 April 1982, Riga, Latvia.
