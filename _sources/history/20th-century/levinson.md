**Norman Levinson** was an American mathematician who worked with Fourier transforms, complex analysis, non-linear differential equations, number theory and signal processing.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved a long-standing problem in mathematics, the Riemann-Hilbert problem, in 1941.
2. Refined Otto Szasz's 1924 theory on applications of conformal mapping theory in 1923.
3. Developed the large sieve method to measure prime numbers in 1942.
4. Contributed to harmonic analysis and partial differential equations in 1947.
5. Developed the theory of Galois fields in 1950.
6. Deciphered the mathematical system for Einstein's General Theory of Relativity in 1949.
7. Pioneered the use of recursion theory in number theory in 1953.
8. Developed the polynomial remainder theorem in 1948.
9. Developed the spectral radius theorem in 1945.
