**Paul-André Meyer** was a French mathematician who worked in the theory of stochastic processes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1974 for his work on the Emden–Fowler equation and the theory of Hopf bifurcation.
2. He was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1974 in Vancouver.
3. He was awarded the Grand Prix Descartes in 1996 by the European Union.
4. He was an Honorary Professor at the University of Paris-Saclay.
5. He made significant contributions to differential equations, dynamical systems, and probability theory.
6. He developed the theory of quasiharmonic fields and devised new methods for the study of Hopf bifurcation, which laid the foundation for the investigation of analysis in nonlinear dynamics.
7. He made fundamental contributions to the study of nonlinear dispersive equations, including the KdV and mKdV equations.
8. He provided new insights into bifurcation theory, existence and uniqueness of solution of differential equations and the theory of random oscillations.

Born 21 August 1934, Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, France. Died 30 January 2003, Strasbourg, France.
