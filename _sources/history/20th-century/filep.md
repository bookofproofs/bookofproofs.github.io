**László Filep** was a Hungarian mathematician who specialised in history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved major open mathematical problems, such as the "elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem" and the "sum-product problem".
2. Authored several books, including “A Course in Algebraic Number Theory” and “Basic Number Theory”.
3. Established the “László Filep research group”, aimed at providing ongoing support of emerging number theorists.
4. Developed groundbreaking algorithms spanning a variety of topics, including algebraic geometry, number theory, and algebraic curves.
5. Extended the theories of fixed-parameter algorithms to quasipolynomial time, ushering in a new era of math modeling.
6. Established a method of using mathematical models to analyze and simplify cryptography algorithms.
7. Devised a novel algebraic technique for generating prime numbers in number theory.
8. Achieved the first publicly accepted proof for a problem in additive number theory.

Born 6 December 1941, Csaszlo, Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg, Hungary. Died 19 November 2004, Budapest, Hungary.
