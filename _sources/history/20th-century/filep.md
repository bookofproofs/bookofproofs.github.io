**László Filep** was a Hungarian mathematician who specialised in history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The elementary school in Csaszlo had a single room in which all pupils in different years were educated, and Filep studied at this school until he reached the age to attend secondary school.
* Filep graduated from Mátészalka Secondary School and entered the Kossuth Lajos Tudományegyetem, or the Lajos Kossuth University in Debrecen as it is called in English.
* Filep graduated from the Kossuth University in 1964, qualifying as a secondary teacher of mathematics and physics.
* In 1973 Filep was appointed as a lecturer at the College of Nyíregyháza.
* But this was not Filep's first publication, for he had published a number of articles in the prestigious Hungarian popular scientific magazine, Termeszet Vilaga (The World of Nature).
* Let us look in slightly more detail at three of Filep's articles on the history of mathematics by quoting his own summary to these papers.
* We must not give the impression that Filep's only research interest was in the history of mathematics for he also published a long series of papers on fuzzy groups, some written with his collaborator Gyula Iulius Maurer, beginning in 1987.
* Changes in the Hungarian system of doctorates in the early 1990s meant that Filep felt the dr.
* Filep brought Davis from Vienna to Miskolc so that he could attend both conferences.
* Shortly after the Miskolc conference, Filep collapsed and died during a lecture that he was giving at the Sapientia College of Theology of Religious Orders in Budapest.

Born 6 December 1941, Csaszlo, Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg, Hungary. Died 19 November 2004, Budapest, Hungary.
