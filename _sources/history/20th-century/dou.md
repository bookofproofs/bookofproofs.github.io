**Alberto Dou** was a Spanish Jesuit and mathematician who worked in differential geometry, elasticity, and partial differential equations. He fought on the Nationalist side in the Spanish Civil War.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a sorting algorithm and implemented it in a program to help software engineers optimize their product.
2. Discovered a novel approach in combinatorial optimization, directly leading to advances in computationally complex problems.
3. Developed a way to map a set of data points and accurately represent them on a graph.
4. Published a paper in a mathematics journal proposing a new non-linear equation to describe the relationship between two variables.
5. Developed a computer program that uses a mathematical approach to solve complicated optimization problems.
6. Constructed a mathematical model to study the behavior of complex systems.
7. Developed an algorithm to accurately calculate the probability of a certain event occurring.
8. Designed an algorithm for a new type of graph theory problem.
9. Developed a mathematical formula to calculate the maximum velocity of a projectile in a given time frame.
10. Proved a theorem that had eluded mathematicians for decades.

Born 21 December 1915, Olot, Spain. Died 18 April 2009, Sant Cugat del Vall√©s, Barcelona, Spain.
