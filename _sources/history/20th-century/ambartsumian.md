**Viktor Ambartsumian** was an Armenian astrophysicist who was born in what is now Georgia. He was one of the founders of theoretical astrophysics and worked in the field of the physics of stars and nebulae.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of star formation in the universe, which revolutionized the field of astrophysics.
2. Coined the term "stellar association" which describes large groups of stars that form together in a system.
3. Showed that stars have a finite life cycle, demonstrating that their luminosity is dependent on their age and composition.
4. Demonstrated new methods for cataloging stars and measuring the distances between stars and galaxies.
5. Proposed the idea of a stellar population, which is different from an individual star or a group of stars.
6. Established the concept of interstellar matter and demonstrated that it has an influence on star formation.
7. Formulated an equation for the velocity of stars in a galaxy, now known as the "Tully-Fisher" law.
8. Led to the discovery of stellar explosions, or supernovae, as a source of energy necessary for the formation of new stars.
9. Developed mathematical models to help explain various aspects of stellar dynamics, stellar spectra, and interstellar gas.
10.Created a new type of astrophysics, which we now refer to as stellar dynamics.

Born 18 September 1908, Tiflis, Russian Empire, now Tbilisi, Georgia. Died 12 August 1996, Byurakan, Armenia.
