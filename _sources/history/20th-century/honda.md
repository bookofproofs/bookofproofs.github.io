**Taira Honda** was a Japanese mathematician who made important contributions to number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* These circumstances surely had a strong influence on the mathematical formation of Honda in addition to the personal direction given to him by Tamagawa.
* Honda's next three papers all considered the problem of class numbers of algebraic number fields.
* In this important paper Honda gives a complete classification of Abelian varieties up to isogeny over a finite field.
* An important consequence is that Honda was able to give a short proof of Manin's conjecture about formal groups.
* We have described Honda's mathematical research, which was mainly devoted to the investigation of the arithmetic properties of commutative formal groups.

Born 2 June 1932, Fukui, Japan. Died 15 May 1975, Osaka, Japan.
