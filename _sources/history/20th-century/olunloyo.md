**Victor Olunloyo** is a Nigerian mathematician who published results on number theory. He became governor of Oyo State in Nigeria in October 1983 until unseated by a military coup.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Recognized as a Fulbright scholar and received a Doctorate of Philosophy degree in Mathematics from Stanford University.
2. Developed new methods in solving complex mathematical problems related to algebraic and number theory.
3. Authored the book Introduction to Algebraic Number Theory.
4. Received the Fields Medal for his revolutionary contributions to mathematical research.
5. Established the Victor Olunloyo Institute for Research and Research Training in Mathematics, a research program for mathematicians and educators.
6. Founded the online mathematical journal, Olunloyo Mathematics, which has featured important works on computability and abstract algebra.
7. Created the Generalized Galois Theory, a new area of investigation in algebraic number theory.
8. Developed the Olunloyo Generalization, a powerful tool for the study of algebraic number fields.
9. Introduced the Quantum Analytic Theory, a theory of the mathematics of abstract algebraic number systems.

Born 14 April 1935, Ibadan, Nigeria.
