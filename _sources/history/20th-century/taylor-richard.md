**Richard Taylor** is a British mathematician who works in America in the field of number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* John Taylor is a mathematical physicist, now Emeritus Professor of Mathematical Physics at the University of Cambridge.
* After completing his school studies at Magdalen College School, Taylor returned to Cambridge where he matriculated at Clare College in 1980.
* Taylor graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1984 and, after some doubts as to whether he was good enough to undertake research in an area as demanding as number theory, he decided that he would undertake graduate studies at Princeton in the United States.
* Taylor spent four years at Princeton 1984-88, during which time he undertook research for a Ph.D. advised by Wiles.
* Taylor was awarded his Ph.D. in 1988 for his thesis On congruences between modular forms.
* After graduating from Princeton, Taylor became a fellow of Clare College, Cambridge and a Royal Society European Exchange Fellowship funded a postdoctoral year 1988-89 at the Institut des Hautes Ã‰tudes Scientifiques outside Paris.
* Taylor, still a fellow of Clare College, was appointed Assistant Lecturer (1989-92), Lecturer (1992-94), then Reader (1994-95) at Cambridge University during the six years 1989-95.
* Taylor moved to Oxford in 1995 when he was appointed Savilian Professor of Geometry.
* Dr Taylor will be a fellow of New College.
* As he explains in the above quote, after only one year at Oxford, Taylor moved to the United States when he was appointed as a Professor at Harvard University.
* In 2002 Taylor was appointed as Herchel Smith Professor of Mathematics at Harvard.
* Taylor joined the Mathematics Department in the School of Humanities and Sciences of Stanford University in July 2018 when he was appointed as the new Barbara Kimball Browning Professor.
* To understand the outstanding contributions which Taylor has continued to make we first list prizes and awards he has won and then give the citation for some of these.
* Let us now give some information about some of these prizes and the citation for Taylor.
* The Ostrowski Prize: Citation for Richard Taylor.
* Taylor has been a major contributor to some of the most spectacular developments in number theory over the last ten years.
* Taylor's extraordinary creativity and impressive technical command of both algebraic geometry and automorphic representation theory allowed him to make deep and profound discoveries in this area.
* In a series of papers, jointly with Diamond, Conrad and Breuil, Taylor recently completed the proof of that conjecture: every rational elliptic curve is covered by a modular curve.
* A third and related series of papers, partly in collaboration with N Shepherd-Barron and K Buzzard, concerns a programme laid out by Taylor to prove the Artin Conjecture on the holomorphicity of LLL-functions of certain two-dimensional representations of the Galois group of the rational numbers.
* The Cole Prize in Number Theory: Citation for Richard Taylor.
* The Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Number Theory is awarded to Richard Taylor of Harvard University for several outstanding advances in algebraic number theory.
* The Breakthrough Prize: Citation for Richard Taylor.
* The Breakthrough Prize is awarded to Richard Taylor, Institute for Advanced Study, for numerous breakthrough results in the theory of automorphic forms, including the Taniyama-Weil conjecture, the local Langlands conjecture for general linear groups, and the Sato-Tate conjecture.
* In October-November 2013 Taylor delivered three lectures in the University of California Los Angeles Distinguished Lecture Series.

Born 19 May 1962, Cambridge, England.
