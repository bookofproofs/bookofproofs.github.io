**Pao-Lu Hsu** was a Chinese mathematician who worked in probability theory and statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Hsu's school education was in Peking and he did not choose mathematics as a career at this stage but rather it was chemistry which he decided to study at university.
* Hsu passed examinations in 1936 at Peking University and obtained a scholarship to enable him to continue his graduate studies in Britain.
* Certainly University College, London was an excellent place for Hsu to study as his mathematical interests were in probability and statistics.
* Hsu's first two papers were published in the Statistical Research Memoirs which were edited by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson.
* One concerned what is now known as the Behrens-Fisher problem, while the second Hsu examined the problem of optimal estimators of the variance in the Gauss-Markov model.
* In 1938 Hsu, while still undertaking research for his doctorate, too up a position as lecturer in Egon Pearson's Department.
* Hsu chose to leave Britain to return to his homeland of China where he was appointed as Professor at Peking University.
* It was a period of great difficulty and hardship for Hsu.
* It is a great tribute to Hsu's determination to devote himself to statistics that he managed to continue his research during these difficult war years.
* Many of his publications on multivariate analysis from this period show that he had been strongly influenced by R A Fisher while at University College.
* Attempts were made to get Hsu to the United States.
* During the next two years he taught at the University of California, Columbia University, and the University of North Carolina where he was offered an associate professorship.
* After spending 1946-47 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in 1947 Hsu returned to his professorship at Peking University.
* Hsu had poor health from 1950.
* Hsu died in his home on the campus of Peking University in 1970.

Born 1 September 1910, Beijing, China. Died 18 December 1970, Beijing, China.
