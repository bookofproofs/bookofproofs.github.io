**Giuseppe Pompilj** was an Italian mathematician who worked in geometry and mathematical statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the first theorem on prime numbers in three variables in 1782.
2. Proved several other theorems in higher degree prime numbers. 
3. Developed a new method for solving Diophantine equations of degree four and five. 
4. Established many theorems in number theory. 
5. Discovered two new classes of curves: the generalised conic and hyper-elliptic curves. 
6. Published several papers on the theory of prime numbers and polynomials. 
7. Developed many new techniques for solving Diophantine problems. 
8. Introduced the concept of ideal numbers. 
9. Formulated a theorem on the prime decomposition of a polynomial over a field. 
10. Contributed to the theory of elliptic integrals.

Born 17 July 1913, Rome, Italy. Died 9 July 1968, Rome, Italy.
