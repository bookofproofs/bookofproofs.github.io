**Mark G Krein** was a Soviet mathematician who worked in functional analysis, operator theory, classical analysis and representation theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed results concerning embedding theory of separable Banach spaces, now known as the Krein–Milman theorem. 
2. Made advances in the theory of completely continuous linear operators, in particular the well-known Krein–Rutman theorem.
3. Demonstrated that a functional equation that had been considered for arbitrary points in the complex plane could be reduced to one for real numbers.
4. Proved a generalization of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem known as the Krein–Stone theorem.
5. Contributed to the theory of integral equations, Markov and Schmidt matrices, and the theory of finite Toeplitz matrices.
6. Discovered spaces of entire functions that are invariant under a shift.

Born 3 April 1907, Kiev, Russian Empire (now Kyiv, Ukraine). Died 17 October 1989, Odessa, Ukranian SSR.
