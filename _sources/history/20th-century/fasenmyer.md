**Mary Celine Fasenmyer** was an American mathematician known for her work on hypergeometric functions and linear algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* George Fasenmyer owned an oil lease in Crown, Pennsylvania and he ran his own business from there.
* Mary's mother Cecilia died when she was only one year old.
* Mary was sent to school in Titusville, a town in Crawford county north-western Pennsylvania about 30 miles from Crown.
* As an aside we note that the world's first successful oil well was drilled beside Titusville in about 1860 and this marked the start of a Pennsylvania oil boom of which, of course, Mary's father was a part.
* At St Joseph's Academy Mary showed her mathematical talents but after she graduated in 1923 there was no university education for her.
* In 1933 Fasenmyer was awarded an A.B. by Mercyhurst College and in the same year she took her vows and joined the Sisters of Mercy becoming Sister Celine.
* There is a charming story told by Wilf of how he contacted Sister Mary in 1994.

Born 4 October 1906, Crown, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 27 December 1996, Erie, Pennsylvania, USA.
