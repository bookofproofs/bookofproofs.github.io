**Różycki** was a Polish mathematician who, along with his colleagues Marian Adam Rejewski and Henryk Michał Zygalski, did amazingly valuable work decoding messages sent by the German Enigma machines. Although impossible to quantify, many lives must have been saved since, it is claimed, their work contributed to the shortening of World War II by between three to five years.

Born 24 July 1909 Olszana, Russian Empire (now Vilshana, Ukraine). Died 9 January 1942 Mediterranean Sea, near the Balearic Islands.
