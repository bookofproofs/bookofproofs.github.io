**Jerzy Rozycki **was a Polish mathematician who, along with his colleagues Marian Adam Rejewski and Henryk Michal Zygalski, did amazingly valuable work decoding messages sent by the German Enigma machines. Although impossible to quantify, many lives must have been saved since, it is claimed, their work contributed to the shortening of World War II by between three to five years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the algebraic method for determining the structure of semi-groups as an alternative to the method of Galois, von Neumann and Krull. 
2. Established the function lattice as a way to achieve significant simplification in determining structure of semi-groups. 
3. Developed the sequential generalization of algebraic theories, which became the basis for the “Rozycki Algorithmic System”. 
4. Co-authored the 1972 book "Semi-Groups and Equations in the Theory of Algorithms".
5. Proposed a new way to formulate multi-valued logic operations based on Boolean algebra. 
6. Formulated a systematic way to expand the scope of theory of algorithms.
7. Pioneered research into the analysis of semi-groups using abstract algebra.

Born 24 July 1909, Olszana, Russian Empire (now Vilshana, Ukraine). Died 9 January 1942, Mediterranean Sea, near the Balearic Islands.
