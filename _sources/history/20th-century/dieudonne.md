**Jean Dieudonné** was a French mathematician who worked in a wide variety of mathematical areas including general topology, topological vector spaces, algebraic geometry, invariant theory and the classical groups. He was a founder member of Bourbaki and also wrote on the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the use of abstract algebra in studying the structure of algebraic groups and Lie groups. 
2. Developed the theory of rings, fields, and algebras. 
3. Developed the theory of direct sums of structures and studied the structure of their automorphisms. 
4. Advanced the structure theory of semi-simple algebras and Lie algebras. 
5. Worked on the classification and representation theory of semi-simple algebras. 
6. Established the concept of "smoothness”, which is now firmly associated with homological algebra and differential topology. 
7. Advanced the notion of abstract homology, which led to the formalism of natural homology and cohomology. 
8. Developed the theory of infinite dimensional manifolds, which is immensely important for differential topology.
9. Developed the algebraic notion of singular spaces.
10. Pioneered and advanced the theory of sheaf and cohomology theory. 
11. Applied the theory of sheaves to algebra and topology. 
12. Explored the concept of reflexivity, which has significant implications in mathematics and physics.
13. Was an early advocate of category theory.
14. Advanced the theory of spectral sequences.
15. Developed the notion of ​​adjoint functors with its application to the theory of adjoint quasifunctors. 
16. Was essential in the advancement of functional analysis. 
17. Developed the theory of Hopf algebras.
18. Contributed to the development of algebraic geometry.

Born 1 July 1906, Lille, France. Died 29 November 1992, Paris, France.
