**Jean Delsarte** was a French mathematician known for his work in mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Jean Delsarte developed the theory of bilinear forms. 
2. He contributed to numerically inverting matrices, allowing users to solve linear equations more quickly.
3. He published a foundational book entitled Théorie Générale des Equations Bilinéaires, which focused on the application of linear algebra to study conic sections.
4. He introduced two-dimensional vector operations, modernizing the field of analytical geometry.
5. He is credited with the theory of one-to-one mappings, which is fundamental to modern mathematics.
6. He developed a process to analyze linear systems of equations, allowing them to be deconstructed and studied more easily.
7. He explored the concept of invariants and developed theories on linear groups. 
8. He created the Delsarte identity, a formula for solving systems of equations.

Born 19 October 1903, Fourmies (Nord), France. Died 28 November 1968, Nancy, France.
