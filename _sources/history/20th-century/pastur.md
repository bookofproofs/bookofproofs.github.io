**Leonid Pastur** is a Ukrainian mathematical physicist and theoretical physicist.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received the USSR State Prize in 1981 for his outstanding contributions to the theory of random matrices. 
2. Developed the approximation of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution for large random matrices. 
3. Demonstrated universal behavior in the energy level spacing of electrons in disordered media. 
4. Proposed Pastor-LÃ©vy central limit theorem which allows the summation of a large number of independent random variables. 
5. Established connections between the theory of random matrices and the study of spectral properties of various operators. 
6. Authored numerous influential books and articles on random matrix theory. 
7. Developed a fundamental inequality related to models of random matrices in the context of coverings of spaces. 
8. Demonstrated that almost all large symmetric matrices share universal behavior.

Born 21 August 1937, Vinnytsya, Ukraine.
