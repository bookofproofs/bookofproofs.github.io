**Dan Quillen** was an American mathematician who won a Fields medal for his work in algebraic topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of higher category theory, using homotopical algebra as a framework.
2. Developed the Quillen-Suslin theorem, which allowed for substantial progress in algebraic K-theory.
3. Developed influential theories of algebraic K-theory, proving the Levi-Strauss theorem, the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, and numerous analytic K-theoretic results.
4. Resolved the long-standing Baer-Kamp problem in group cohomology in his seminal work on the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence.
5. His work on Grothendieck duality had a broad impact in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.
6. Founded the field of derived algebraic geometry that has driven significant advances in modern algebraic geometry.
7. Solved the long-standing Miller-Palmer conjecture, providing far-reaching implications in the theory of automorphic representations.

Born 27 June 1940, Orange, New Jersey, USA. Died 30 April 2011, Gainsville, Florida, USA.
