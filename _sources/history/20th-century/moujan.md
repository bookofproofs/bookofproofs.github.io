**Magdalena Mouján** was an Argentine mathematician who became famed as a writer of science fiction. She taught mathematics and statistics at various Argentine universities: Universidad Católica de la Plata, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Universidad Nacional del Comahue, and Universidad Nacional de Luján.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Magdalena was given the nicknamed "beltxa" at home.
* At the National University of La Plata, Mouján was fortunate to be taught by Manuel Sadosky and Luís Antoni Santaló.
* Mouján was also friendly with her talented fellow student Rebeca Cherep (better known as Rebeca Guber after her marriage to José Guber who was an engineering student at the National University of La Plata while Mouján was studying there).
* After her first degree Mouján continued to undertake research in mathematical physics for a Ph.D. and she was awarded the degree in 1950.
* Like Mouján, Durañona y Vedia published in Mundo Atómico Ⓣ(Atomic world).
* He made a proposal to the Board of Scientific Research and Experimentation of the Armed Forces to set up an "Operations Research Group", which he would lead himself, and he proposed that it be composed of three other members: Magdalena Mouján Otaño, Horacio C Reggini, a structural engineer, and Isidoro Marín, a civil engineer.
* Also in 1957 Durañona y Vedia and Mouján Otaño had produced a publication for the National Atomic Energy Commission entitled "Operations Research".
* Mouján was involved in the establishment of the Faculty of Physical, Mathematical and Engineering Sciences in the Catholic University of Argentina and, at the end of 1959, was appointed as a full professor in the Faculty.
* In 1961 Mouján became a member of the Argentine Atomic Energy Commission.
* Mouján knew most of the members of the team running Clementina which was headed by Manuel Sadosky.
* Mouján was brought on to the team to strengthen it but before starting work on this project, she had to take courses on the theories of radiochemistry, electronics and reactors.
* Mouján did not support General Onganía and had to resign her university position.
* It was held between 26 and 28 July 1968 and Mouján was joint winner of the story contest with Los Huáqueros Ⓣ(The grave robbers).
* One can see by looking at the references that we give for this biography of Mouján that she is better known as a writer of science fiction than she is as a mathematician.
* Subsequently, Nueva Dimensión published two other stories by Mouján: Bicho'e parra en orbit Ⓣ(Bicho'e parra in orbit) (Nueva Dimensión Ⓣ(New dimension) 18) and El lagarto rojo Ⓣ(The red lizard) (Nueva Dimensión Ⓣ(New dimension) 101).
* Let us return to Mouján's mathematical career.
* Mouján died at the age of 79 in a hospital in Mar del Plata.

Born 26 March 1926, Pehuajó, Argentina. Died 16 July 2005, Mar del Plata, Argentina.
