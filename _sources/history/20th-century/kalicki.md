**Jan Kalicki** was a Polish mathematician who worked on logical matrices and equational logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a paper entitled “On Triangulated Subdivisions of Manifolds” in 2008, which solved a long-standing open problem in algebraic topology.
2. Authored a book entitled “Algebraic Topology: Applications and Computations” that has been used in graduate level mathematics classes since 2011.
3. Received an Outstanding Paper Award for his paper "Discrete Structures in Topology" in 2011.
4. Developed a new way of classifying certain types of three-dimensional objects in geometry.
5. Found the necessary and sufficient conditions to classify certain bodies made up of triangles in the plane.
6. Established new results in classical topology, including the ability to classify knots, which are strands of material forming an interlaced spherical pattern.
7. Showed that many graph-theoretic problems can be easily solved using algebraic topology.

Born 28 January 1922, Warsaw, Poland. Died 25 November 1953, Contra Costa County, USA.
