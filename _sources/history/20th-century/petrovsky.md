**Ivan Petrovsky** was a Russian mathematician who worked in the field of partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Created the Petrovsky Recurrence, a solution to the partial differential equations of mathematical physics.
2. Co-developed the so-called 'Petrovsky method' for solving multi-dimensional problems.
3. Discovered the Petrovsky condition for the stability of solutions in equilibrium.
4. Published numerous papers on the properties of determinants and linear algebra equations.
5. Devised a method for solving the boundary value problem in partial differential equations.
6. Established the Fundamentals of Partial Differential Equations, a classic text in the field.
7. Developed the Hamilton-Jacobi method for solving variational problems.
8. Contributed to the body of knowledge on hyperbolic equations.
9. Pioneered the use of Green's functions in solving partial differential equations.
10. Significantly contributed to the theory of linear and nonlinear equations.

Born 18 January 1901, Sevsk, Orlov guberniya, Russia. Died 15 January 1973, Moscow, USSR.
