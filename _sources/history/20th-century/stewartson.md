**Keith Stewartson** was an English mathematician who worked in the theory of fluid flow.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of shallow-water turbulence in 1957.
2. Developed methods to study the unsteady and fully non-linear behaviour of waves with breaking.
3. Developed mathematical methods for the study of radar propagation in the coastal zone in 1962.
4. Received the Symons Memorial Gold Medal from the Royal Meteorological Society in 1960 for his contributions to the theory of hydrodynamic stability.
5. Received the Ferranti Prize from the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1965 for his paper on the stability of laminar flow of two incompressible fluids.
6. Published book "Theory of hydraulic jumps" in 1971.
7. Developed a mathematical model for the prediction of turbulent wakes in rivers in 1972.
8. Received the Rossby Prize from the American Meteorological Society in 1975 for his research on a broad range of topics related to nonlinear dynamical meteorology.

Born 20 September 1925, Barnsley, Yorkshire, England. Died 7 May 1983, London, England.
