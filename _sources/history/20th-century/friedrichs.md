**Kurt Friedrichs** was a German American mathematician who worked on many aspects of partial differential equations. He was the co-founder of the Courant Institute.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His parents were Karl Friedrichs, who was a lawyer and expert on Civil Service law, and Elisabeth Entel from Silesia.
* an exceptionally lovely woman whom the boy Friedrichs adored ...
* This friendship would play a role in Kurt's future.
* Friedrichs followed this custom and spent a term in Greifswald, a year in Freiburg, and a term in the Austrian university of Graz.
* Friedrichs lived in a former prisoner-of-war camp and, like the other students, found that conditions due to the high inflation were so bad that students scarcely had enough to eat.
* Yet the quality of the lecturers was remarkable, and Friedrichs was amazed at the broad mathematical knowledge of Carl Ludwig Siegel and Emil Artin.
* Friedrichs went to Aachen in 1929 to take up a position as assistant to Theodore von Kármán.
* It was Courant who had set this up and leaving Göttingen was difficult for Friedrichs.
* In 1929 Friedrichs returned to Göttingen and presented his habilitation thesis there.
* Friedrichs became professor at the Technische Hochschule in Braunschweig in 1931.
* Just days after this Friedrichs met Nellie Bruell, a young Jewish girl, as a ball in Braunschweig.
* It became increasingly clear that, although Friedrichs was not directly affected by the Nazis laws against Jews, many of his friends and colleagues were directly affected in a very serious way.
* Nellie, who was now Friedrichs' girlfriend, was also dismissed from her position as an assistant at the Technische Hochschule.
* Friedrichs visited Courant in New York in the summer of 1935, officially to work with him on the second volume of Courant-Hilbert, but in fact mainly to see if it might be possible for him to emigrate.
* By the time Friedrichs had returned to Braunschweig, the Nazis had passed laws forbidding marriage between Aryans and non-Aryans.
* She also left Germany and went to Lyon to await instructions from Friedrichs.
* Friedrichs arrived in New York on 4 March 1937.
* Courant worked hard to find a post for Friedrichs for he certainly did not have the personality to push himself forward.
* Friedrichs published On certain inequalities and characteristic value problems for analytic functions and for functions of two variables  in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society in 1937.
* In 1948 Courant and Friedrichs published the classic work Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves.
* If Courant did it, then it went to Friedrichs.
* And Friedrichs would look at it and grumble that it wasn't sufficiently exact.
* Then Friedrichs would take it back and say it wasn't precise enough.
* When it came back to Friedrichs, he would put in again some of what he had had before, but not so much.
* During the 1950s Friedrichs wrote five articles on Mathematical aspects of the quantum theory of fields  which eventually became part of his book with the same title.
* Friedrichs received many honours.

Born 28 September 1901, Kiel, Germany. Died 31 December 1982, New Rochelle, New York, USA.
