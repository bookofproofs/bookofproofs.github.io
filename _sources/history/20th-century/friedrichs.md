**Kurt Friedrichs** was a German American mathematician who worked on many aspects of partial differential equations. He was the co-founder of the Courant Institute.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He became a professor of mathematics at University of Hamburg in 1921.
2. He introduced the concept of partial differential equations.
3. His famous work, Ein stabiles Mehrstellensystem, argued for the stable numerical solution of linear elliptic differential equations.
4. He was one of the founders of the field of functional analysis.
5. He worked on the theory of functions of a real variable, the theory of orthogonal functions, integral equations, and differential equations.
6. He wrote several books on mathematical methods and is known for his papers written on the theory of elliptic functions and singular integrals.
7. He established an influential and lasting school of mathematics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen and was an outstanding teacher.
8. He formulated the Friedrichs system of linear equations and the Friedrichs integral equation.
9. He won the prestigious Acadermie de Paris award for his work on partial differential equations.
10. He was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1920, 1924 and 1928.

Born 28 September 1901, Kiel, Germany. Died 31 December 1982, New Rochelle, New York, USA.
