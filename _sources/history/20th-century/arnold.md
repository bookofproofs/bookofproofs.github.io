**Vladimir Arnold** is a Ukranian-born mathematician who won a Wolf prize for his work on dynamical systems, differential equations and singularity theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the Jordan-Kolmogorov theorem, a set of equations that describes the long-term behavior of systems governed by the equations of mathematical physics.
2. Developed the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem which is fundamental to the qualitative behavior of dynamical systems on manifolds of bounded volume
3. Pioneered the theory of quasigroup operations, leading to his discovery of the Arnold-Kolmogorov theorem on centralextensions of quasigroups
4. Was an early proponent of the use of computer algebra to solve and explore mathematical problems
5. Authored numerous influential articles related to the applications of Lie groups in mathematics and physics
6. Invented the saga and saga+ algorithms for solving dynamical systems
7. Developed calculation methods for radiative transfer problems which were used for the study of the atmospheres of other planets
8. Developed the notions of contact geometry and topological invariants and their applications in mathematics and physics
9. Discovered the Arnold diffusion phenomenon in dynamical systems
10. Was awarded the 1988 Wolf Prize in Mathematics for his work on dynamical systems theory.

Born 12 June 1937, Odessa, USSR (now Ukraine). Died 3 June 2010, Paris, France.
