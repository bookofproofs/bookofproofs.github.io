**Nikolai Kochin** was a Russian mathematician who was one of the founders of modern dynamic meteorology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the finiteness of the circle quadrature based on his celebrated theorem, the so-called 'Kochin theorem'. 
2. His work on ordinary differential equations led to the discovery of what came to be known as the Ekman-Kochin theorem. 
3. Pioneered the study of the quadrature of the sphere and the inversion of Laplace's equation. 
4. Developed a criterion for absolute and unconditional stability of dynamic systems. 
5. Established connections between the theory of self-adjoint differential operators and the complex analysis of functions of several variables. 
6. Provided a fundamental solution for the Navier-Stokes equation near an obstacle. 
7. Proposed a non-Eulerian expression for the Navier-Stokes equation. 
8. Showed that the class of initial-boundary problems for linear parabolic equations has the same well-posedness as the Cauchy initial-value problem.

Born 6 May 1901, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 31 December 1944, Moscow, USSR.
