### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1979 the Centre de recherche de mathématiques de la décision of the Université Paris IX-Dauphine published Guidy-Wandja's work  Investissement et épargne: un modèle quadratique d'allocation Ⓣ(Investment and savings: a quadratic allocation model).
* In 1981, after being advised by Jean-Pierre Aubin, Guidy-Wandja was awarded a 'Doctorat d'état en sciences mathématiques' by the Université Nationale de Cote d'Ivoire, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, for her thesis Modèles de décision entre investissement en biens durables et épargne en biens fiduciaires et Modèle de partage équitable ou théorie du chômage Ⓣ(Decision models between investment in durable goods and savings in fiduciary property and fair share model or unemployment theory).
* Primarily on the initiative of Guidy-Wandja, the International Committee on Mathematics in Developing Countries was set up and held its constitutive meeting in Warsaw when the International Congress of Mathematicians was taking place there in August 1983.
* At this meeting Guidy-Wandja was elected as President of the International Committee on Mathematics in Developing Countries.
* The Chairman of the Committee on Development and Exchange wrote to Guidy-Wandja making clear that the Committee on Development and Exchange was the only body within the International Mathematical Union with a remit for developing countries.
* He asked why Guidy-Wandja felt it necessary to set up a new organisation.
* In 1992 Guidy-Wandja was awarded a Doctorat d'État en Science Économie for her thesis La dynamique d'intégration commerciale des pays de l'Afrique subsaharienne: cas de la Zone Franc Ⓣ(The trade integration dynamics of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa: the case of the Francophone Zone).
* The letters CFA have been given different meanings over time, from 'French Colonies of Africa', to 'French Community of Africa', but by the time Guidy-Wandja wrote this article it stood for 'African Financial Community'.
