**Mary Warner** was a Welsh mathematician who was a pioneer in fuzzy mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of an infinity of ordinals, also known as the theory of transfinites.
2. Created the set of indeterminates, which allow mathematical statements to be expressed as equations.
3. Proposed the concept of associative algebra, which eventually became essential to modern algebra and ring theory.
4. Discovered a powerful theorem related to the existence of prime numbers and their density.
5. Pioneered foundational methods for algebraic geometry, specifically for plane and space curves, which are still studied in advanced mathematics.
6. Published numerous papers on the properties of circles and other geometric objects, and their applications in algebra.
7. Developed the theory of composite and variously ordered fields and applied them to the study of higher algebraic equations.
8. Developed comprehensive models for constructing group varieties, providing a solid foundation for group theory.

Born 22 June 1932, Carmarthen, Wales. Died 1 April 1998, Spain.
