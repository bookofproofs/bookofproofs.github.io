**Maurice Stevenson Bartlett** was an English statistician who made  contributions to the analysis of data with spatial and temporal patterns.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* William Bartlett was a clerk when Maurice was born; he was the youngest of his parents' three children, having two older siblings Connie and Gerald.
* Maurice did not shine at elementary school, and he was considered quite slow on the uptake.
* the headmaster of Latymer summoned them to his office to impress upon them the desirability that the young Bartlett should continue his education.
* Wishart had both a flair for mathematical statistics and a flair for very practical applications of experimental design and his course had a major influence on Bartlett.
* Although offered a position in the Inland Revenue, Bartlett took the opportunity to stay at Cambridge for another year presented to him when his scholarship was extended.
* This was a highly successful year for Bartlett, and he was awarded the Rayleigh Prize.
* Bartlett was offered the post and happily accepted, taking up the position in October 1933.
* Bartlett felt that he wanted to become involved in statistics in a more practical way and, after only one year at University College, the opportunity arose when he was offered the position of statistician at ICI's Agricultural Research Station at Jealott's Hill.
* Bartlett was appointed and took up the lectureship in October 1938.
* Bartlett was assigned to war work relating to the development of rocketry.
* In 1947 Bartlett was offered the Chair of Mathematical Statistics at the University of Manchester; he happily accepted.
* Sheila died in 1998, leaving a grieving but stoic Maurice in their home at Exmouth.
* Egon Pearson retired from his chair at University College, London, in 1960 and the university approached Bartlett and offered him the chair.
* We have already mentioned Bartlett's most famous book An Introduction to Stochastic Processes with Special Reference to Methods and Application (1955).
* We note that throughout Bartlett's career, there was an interplay between practical and mathematical statistics.
* Of course Bartlett's remarkable achievements led to him being honoured by many different bodies.

Born 18 June 1910, Chiswick, London, England. Died 8 January 2002, Exmouth, Devon, England.
