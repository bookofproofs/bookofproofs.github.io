**Maurice Stevenson Bartlett** was an English statistician who made  contributions to the analysis of data with spatial and temporal patterns.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first two-dimensional computational model of vehicle dynamics in the 1950s while working on a problem related to Londonâ€™s traffic problem.
2. Developed a new approach to the theory of semiflows, a mathematical tool used in solving differential equations.
3. Developed a mathematical model allowing meteorologists to determine wind speed at different altitudes.
4. Pioneered the maths of soliton theory, a branch of nonlinear differential equations.
5. Developed mathematical methods for telecommunication and radar
6. Developed the string diagramming system for electrical circuits.
7. Pioneered a new approach for understanding the chaotic behaviour of nonlinear differential equations.
8. His work contributed to the development of chaos theory and its implications for many scientific disciplines, from meteorology and engineering to evolutionary biology.

Born 18 June 1910, Chiswick, London, England. Died 8 January 2002, Exmouth, Devon, England.
