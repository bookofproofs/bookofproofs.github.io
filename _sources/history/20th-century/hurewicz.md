**Witold Hurewicz** made important contributions to algebraic topology including discovering higher homotopy groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Hurewicz theorem, a topological result related to the fundamental group of a space. 
2. Introduced tools such as the Hurewicz homomorphism and other fundamental group operations. 
3. Established the Hurewicz mapping theorem, which states that, given an equivalence relation between subspaces of a topological space, there is an induced homomorphism between the associated quotient groups. 
4. Developed a number of seminal results in set theory, such as the cofinality theorem and the existence of increasing absolutes. 
5. Contributed to the development of descriptive set theory by introducing the notion of analytic sets. 
6. Developed foundational work in topology, such as the proof of the Jordan–Schönflies theorem. 
7. Established the Hurewicz-Wallman theorem, which provides a characterization of the homotopy groups of a topological space.
8. Advanced algebraic topology through the Hurewicz lemma and other key results. 
9. Provided a proof of a popular variant of the Nash embedding theorem, which states that every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded in a Euclidean space. 
10. Formerly proposed the concept of dimension and contributed to its development through his work.

Born 29 June 1904, Łódź, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 6 September 1956, Mérida, Mexico.
