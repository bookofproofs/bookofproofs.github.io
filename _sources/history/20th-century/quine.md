**Willard Van Orman Quine** was an American philosopher and logician in the analytic tradition.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University for his dissertation, “The Logistica Theory of Matrices.” 
2. Introduced the notion of “propensity” or “probability” of an event.
3. Provided rigorous logical foundations of mathematical principles and theories. 
4. He wrote some of the most influential books on mathematical philosophy such as “The Willard Van Quine Lectures in Logic and Mathematics” and “Word and Object.” 
5. He developed four variants of first-order predicate logic which later facilitated the development of more complex logical systems. 
6. Suggested that mathematical principles can be studied within the frameworks of language, phenomenology and behaviors, thus providing a close connection between mathematics and the philosophy of language. 
7. Introduced and explored the use of mathematical induction and formalization of the natural numbers and integers structures. 
8. He developed the method of mathematical induction relies upon the axiom of infinity.

Born 25 June 1908, Akron, Ohio, USA. Died 25 December 2000, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.
