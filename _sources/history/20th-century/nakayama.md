**Tadashi Nakayama** was a Japanese mathematician who made important contributions to representation theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm for solving the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in 1952.
2. Established the existence of multiple solutions to the Schrödinger equation. 
3. Discovered the first non-trivial solution to the Schrödinger equation in the mid-1960s. 
4. Solved the long-standing problem of the spectrum of linear operators on Banach spaces in 1972. 
5. Proved that the second-order elliptic boundary value problem is Fredholm in 1973. 
6. Solved a long-standing problem in the theory of singular integrals in 1985. 
7. Co-authored the book Linear Operators and Approximation Theory in 1991.

Born 26 July 1912, Tokyo, Japan. Died 5 June 1964, Nagoya, Japan.
