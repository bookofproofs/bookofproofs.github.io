**Olga Taussky-Todd** was an Austrian born mathematician who worked on algebraic number theory and matrix theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Olga received the top or second top grade for arithmetic but her favourite subjects were essay writing and grammar.
* When she was 14 years old Olga entered the high school where she spent a year before studying at the Gymnasium.
* At Vienna Olga was taught by Furtwängler, Hahn, Wirtinger, Menger, Helly and others, while she was a fellow student of Gödel.
* Given leave of absence from her College to undertake war work, Taussky-Todd worked at the National Physical Laboratory ay Teddington between 1943 and 1946.
* Just to illustrate this let us note that during this time Taussky-Todd wrote several papers which were published by the Ministry of Aircraft Production in London.
* These papers she published under the name Olga Todd, while most of her other papers she wrote under the name Olga Taussky, with a few latter papers written under the name Olga Taussky-Todd.
* In 1947 Olga and Jack when to the United States, with the original intention of spending a year there, and they worked at the National Bureau of Standards' National Applied Mathematics Laboratory after spending a while at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton working on von Neumann's computer project.
* In 1957 Olga and Jack both accepted appointments at the California Institute of Technology.
* Olga's best-known and most influential work was in the field of matrix theory, though she also made important contributions to number theory.
* Finally we should mention some of the many honours Taussky-Todd received for her mathematical contributions.
* Taussky-Todd served on the Council of the London Mathematical Society (1946-47 and she served on the Council of the American Mathematical Society (1972-78).

Born 30 August 1906, Olmütz, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Olomouc, Czech Republic). Died 7 October 1995, Pasadena, California, USA.
