**Olga Taussky-Todd** was an Austrian born mathematician who worked on algebraic number theory and matrix theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first comprehensive introduction to numerical analysis, titled Introduction to Numerical Analysis.
2. Developed an efficient method for solving systems of linear equations using iterative methods.
3. Pioneered numerical linear algebra, developing the Jordan–Gauss elimination to solve systems of equations.
4. Co-developed the Euler–Taussky matrix polynomial, which is widely used in areas of applied mathematics and engineering.
5. Developed the “zero-one principle” for problem-solving, which is related to the application of linear algebra to determine optimal solutions.
6. Authored over fifty scholarly papers in the fields of algebra and number theory.
7. Supervised the thesis of two Ph.D. students.
8. Co-developed the Tauberian theory for asymptotic expansions of integrals. 
9. Developed a theory of capacity for integral equations based on quadrature formulae.
10. Co-developed a theory of cyclotomic algebraic functions to solve Diophantine equations.

Born 30 August 1906, Olmütz, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Olomouc, Czech Republic). Died 7 October 1995, Pasadena, California, USA.
