**Grigore Constantin Moisil**  was a Romanian mathematician and computer scientist who worked in the fields of mathematical logic and differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of General Algebraic Calculi (1939), which prefigured much of the development of modern computer science.
2. Was one of the first researchers to introduce the notion of equivalence between electrical systems and mathematical systems.
3. Authored the foundational work on the mathematical theory of automata (1951).
4. Produced courseware texts on mathematics and logic, which are still used in universities today.
5. Helped establish algebraic topology, a field of mathematics, as an important area of research.
6. Contributed to the development of the RAT theorem, a result in number theory.
7. Discovered a method of calculation which sped up computation by an order of magnitude.
8. Pioneered research into the use of computers to solve mechanical problems.

Born 10 January 1906, Tulcea, Romania. Died 21 May1973, Ottawa, Canada.
