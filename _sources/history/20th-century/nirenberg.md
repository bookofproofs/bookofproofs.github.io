**Louis Nirenberg** was a Canadian mathematician whohas made important contributions to linear and nonlinear partial differential equations and their application to complex analysis and geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Louis went to a Hebrew school but he did not want to learn Hebrew.
* Louis attended Baron Byng High School in Montreal where he had excellent teachers.
* After he graduated Nirenberg thought that he would carry on to graduate studies in theoretical physics.
* The advice came back that Nirenberg should first do a Master's Degree in mathematics at New York University, and then go on to study physics.
* Nirenberg went for an interview with Courant and Friedrichs in New York and they offered him an assistantship.
* After the award of a Master's Degree by New York University in 1947, Nirenberg remained there working for his doctorate.
* After completing his doctorate in 1949, Nirenberg was appointed as a Research Assistant at New York University, becoming one of the early members of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Mechanics (it was renamed the Courant Institute in 1964).
* A minor such gem is the useful set of Garliardo-Nirenberg inequalities.
* Nirenberg has been the centre of many major developments.
* Inequalities, mentioned near the beginning of this quote, have a special part in Nirenberg's life.
* The many publications by Nirenberg (MathSciNet lists 185) include only one book.
* We should note Nirenberg's special love of nonlinear problems and give two quotes from him on this topic.
* Nirenberg has been awarded many prizes and given many honours in a distinguished career.
* Nirenberg has served the American Mathematical Society in several roles.
* The Crafoord Prize was awarded to Nirenberg at a ceremony at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on Wednesday, 29 September 1982.
* Nirenberg has treated a great number of problems of this nature.
* Nirenberg's work ranges over a variety of problems and has been of basic importance for the development of the field.
* Caffarelli mentions Nirenberg's areas of interest in partial differential equations: Regularity and solvability of elliptic equations of order 2n; the Minkowski problem and fully nonlinear equations; the theory of higher regularity for free boundary problems; and symmetry properties of solutions to invariant equations.
* Joseph Kohn describes Nirenberg's contributions to complex analysis.
* Nirenberg's career has been an inspiration; his numerous students, collaborators, and colleagues have learned a great deal from him.
* Aside from mathematics, Nirenberg has taught all of us the enjoyment of travel, movies, and gastronomy.
* An appreciation of Nirenberg also must include his ever-present sense of humour.
* Nirenberg has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Accademia dei Lincei, the French Acad√©mie des Sciences, the Accademia Mediterranea della Scienze, the Istituto Lombardo, the Accademia Scienze e Lettere, and the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.
* Finally we mention that a conference dedicated to Louis Nirenberg was held in Trento, Italy in September 1990 to mark his 65th  birthday.
* A conference was held in Venice in June 1996 and another was held in Florence in July 1996, both to honour Nirenberg's 70th  birthday.
* A conference was held in Hsinchu in September 2000 to honour Nirenberg's 75th  birthday, and another conference was held at the Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Toledo in June 2006 in honour of Nirenberg's 80th  birthday.

Born 28 February 1925, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Died 26 January 2020, Manhattan, New York, USA.
