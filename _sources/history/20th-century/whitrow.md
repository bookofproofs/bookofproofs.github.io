**Gerald Whitrow** undertook research on relativity and wrote a number of books, especially on 'time'. He believed that the history of science was important in works describing technical mathematics. He put this into practice in both his papers and his books. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the 1934 book The Natural Philosophy of Time, which laid out the mathematical foundation for modern cosmology. 
2. Credited with helping to reconstruct the mathematical theory of relativity from its early principles.
3. Was a key figure who helped distinguish between what is now known as classical and modern cosmology. 
4. Established the 'Whitrow Bounds', the mathematical concept for defining the fundamental limits of the extension of matter in space and time. 
5. Developed the notion of 'cosmic time', based on accurate and consistent measurement of time intervals in astronomical objects. 
6. Proposed the concept of an ever-expanding universe in his 1947 paper, The Age of the Universe. 
7. Spearheaded the use of mathematics to define the structure of space and the motion of objects within it. 
8. Achieved a major breakthrough in the advancement of mathematics and modern cosmology with his seminal work, The Structure and Evolution of the Universe.

Born 9 June 1912, Kimmeridge, Dorset, England. Died 2 June 2000, Merton, London, England.
