**Raymond Smullyan** was an American mathematician, magician, concert pianist, logician and philosopher, best known for his popular puzzle books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published over forty books on logic, set theory, and recreational mathematics. 
2. Developed an axiomatic theory of ordinal notations. 
3. Developed the logic of combinatory logic, an important topic in mathematical logic.
4. Established the basic properties of ordinal arithmetic. 
5. Advanced the notion of “Ramsey numbers” and the truth-table interpretations of logical systems. 
6. Introduced the notion of “self-reference” in logical systems and the studies of “recursive” functions. 
7. Conducted deep studies on the metamathematics of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and Turing’s Halting Problem. 
8. Constructed a hierarchy of “infinitely countable” numbers based on his invention of the combinatory logic. 
9. Devised a system of axioms of set theory that includes an elementary logic. 
10. Experimented with the properties of number theory, exploring relationships between set theory and arithmetic.

Born 25 May1919, Far Rockaway, Long Island, New York City, USA. Died 6 February 2017, Hudson, New York, USA.
