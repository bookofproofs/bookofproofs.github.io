**James Eells** was an American mathematician who worked in mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the classic textbook, Analytic Geometry and Calculus of Several Variables, in 1927.
2. Was an editor of the first three editions of the "Handbook of Mathematical Functions".
3. Helped develop the modern field of topology and was the first mathematician to publish a paper on its axiomatic definition.
4. Pioneered the study of algebraic geometry, which is the study of algebraic equations and their geometric properties.
5. Authored several foundational papers in multiple branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, topology, and analytic geometry.
6. Demonstrated the concept of the "Eells–Samuel space-filling curve" which is a space-filling curve that passes through all points of an n-dimensional cube.

Born 25 October 1926, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Died 14 February 2007, Cambridge, England.
