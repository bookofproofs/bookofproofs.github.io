**Edwin Ford Beckenbach** was an American mathematician best known for for his work on inequalities.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His research at Rice was supervised by Lester Ford, and Beckenbach was awarded his doctorate in 1931 for his dissertation Minimal Surfaces in Euclidean N-Space .
* After being awarded his doctorate Beckenbach was awarded a National Research Council Fellow for the two years 1931-33 which enabled him to study at Princeton, Ohio State University and the University of Chicago.
* Beckenbach returned to Rice in the autumn of 1933 where he was appointed as an instructor in mathematics.
* Among Beckenbach's first publications are The area and boundary of minimal surfaces (1932), and two papers written jointly with Tibor Rad√≥ and published in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society in 1933, namely Subharmonic functions and minimal surfaces and Subharmonic functions and surfaces of negative curvature.
* The topic of inequalities was of interest to Beckenbach for many years.
* Beckenbach contributed to mathematics with a series of texts for schools and colleges.
* Another major contribution made by Beckenbach was through his work for the American Mathematical Society.

Born 18 July 1906, Dallas, Texas, USA. Died 5 September 1982, Los Angeles, California, USA.
