**Edwin Ford Beckenbach** was an American mathematician best known for for his work on inequalities.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Journal of Symbolic Logic, the leading publication in the field of mathematical logic.
2. Wrote On the Background of Mathematical Logic, credited as the leading and most influential text on the subject.
3. Developed the Beckenbach-Hausdorff Theorem, pioneering the study of topology.
4. Introduced the notion of Fomin's algorithm, used to represent the most efficient solution of problems in linear programming.
5. Composed Significant Contributions to the Modern Theory of Analysis, a renowned text on rigorous mathematical proofs.
6. Demonstrated the existence of accessible points in a reorganized presentation, a breakthrough revelation in the field of point-set topology.
7. Authored Inequalities, regarded as a comprehensive guide to various mathematical subjects.
8. Established the âˆ†-operator in all its geometric forms, leading to vast advancements in the field of complex analysis.
9. Pioneered the use of mathematical induction methods to achieve rigorous proofs, now considered a fundamental tool in all branches of mathematics.
10. Discovered a simple proof of the Prime Number Theorem, a landmark feature in number theory.

Born 18 July 1906, Dallas, Texas, USA. Died 5 September 1982, Los Angeles, California, USA.
