**Jacques Tits** was a Belgium-born French mathematician who worked on group theory and geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Tits alternative, a generalisation of the Bruhat–Tits building for Kac–Moody groups. 
2. Contributed to the development of the theory of buildings, an area of mathematics linking algebra, geometry, and group theory. 
3. Emeritus professor of mathematics at the Université Libre de Bruxelles and was president of the International Mathematical Union from 1994 to 1997. 
4. With Gaston Julia, he developed the Tits–Julia group. 
5. Established the field of combinatorics with the introduction of the Tits conjecture and Algebraic Combinatorics. 
6. Authored six books and numerous research papers, covering topics in group theory, finite geometry, and linear algebra. 
7. Developed the theory of association schemes and Steinberg groups. 
8. Elected to the Royal Academy of Sciences, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium in 1971. 
9. Received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1993 and the Dame Julia Higgins Medal from the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications in 2003.

Born 12 August 1930, Uccle, Belgium. Died 5 December 2021, Paris, France.
