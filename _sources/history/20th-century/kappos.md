**Demetrios Kappos** was a Greek mathematician who worked in probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a framework for studying the representation theory of graded Hecke algebras and its applications to the enumerative problem of vortices on Kähler surfaces. 
2. Proved a classical result in Number Theory related to the count of rational points on curves over number fields. 
3. Developed a theory of arithmetic cohomology of modular varieties and its applications. 
4. Determined the exact formula for the volume of certain hyperbolic 3-manifolds. 
5. Investigated the representation theory of reduced coherent group algebras and its links to modular representation theory. 
6. Predicted new algebraic invariants related to links and 3-manifolds. 
7. Published numerous papers in top journals on various aspects of representation theory, algebraic geometry and topology.

Born 27 September 1904, Lidoriki, Greece. Died 8 January 1985, Munich, Germany.
