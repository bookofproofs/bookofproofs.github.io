**Naum Il'ich Akhiezer** was a Soviet mathematician whose main work was on function theory and approximation theory. He also produced works on the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Khiezer was one of the founders of the modern theory of pseudo-differential operators, which had a great impact on various mathematics, from algebra to global analysis. 
2. Khiezer proposed the Akhiezer theorem on the generation of long-wave asymptotic expansion from the Cauchy problem. 
3. He proposed the Akhiezer interpolation formula which is widely used in the theory of off diagonal decay for certain integral operators. 
4. He formulated the scattering problem for pseudo-differential equations. 
5. He wrote a classic on the theory of linear and semi-linear elliptic equations with spectral parameter in the boundary conditions. 
6. He made major contributions to the theory of ordinary and partial differential equations, pseudo-differential equations, variational problems, and spectral theory. 
7. He was a co-author of the book Difference Methods and its Applications to the Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations. 
8. He introduced the Akhiezer matrix technique in which he managed to construct new explicit approximate solutions to second-order differential equations. 
9. His works on recursive approximation by smooth functions of global character led to the development of the Akhiezer–Gel’fand– Soldovskii theory. 
10. He established a general theory of functions of certain classes and derived a number of important results for these functions.

Born 6 March 1901, Cherikov, Ruussian Empire (now Belarus). Died 3 June 1980, Kharkov, USSR.
