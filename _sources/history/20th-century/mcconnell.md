**James McConnell** was an Irish mathematician who worked on quantum mechanics and the applications of Lie groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the use of differential equations to obtain solutions to certain intractable problems in mathematics.
2. Formulated a new method of summation, known as the McConnell Method, for multiple series that allowed for faster mathematical processing. 
3. Discovered the method of orthogonal polynomials which helped to solve Lagrangian equations.
4. Automated the calculations used to solve special cases of calculus.
5. Helped develop methods necessary for applying electromagnetic theory to mechanical movements. 
6. Broke mathematical paradigms by solving problems in numerous different ways. 
7. Resolved long-standing mathematical problems using advanced techniques to obtain analytical solutions.
8. Pioneered the use of symbolic algebra to solve polynomial equations. 
9. Discovered a new algebraic identity for the coefficient of a rational fraction. 
10. Developed novel applications for computing machines to solve algebraic equations.

Born 25 February 1915, Dublin, Ireland. Died 16 February 1999, Dalkey, DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown, County Dublin, Ireland.
