**Georg Kreisel** was an Austrian-born mathematical logician who studied and worked in the United Kingdom and America and chiefly studied proof and computation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the notion of a “higher-order theory”, which was the foundation for later developments in model theory and proof theory.
2. Developed the notion of the “length” of informal proofs, which is now regarded as one of the earliest applications of complexity theory to mathematical reasoning.
3. Proved the downward Lowenheim-Skolem theorem, which was the first proof of a fundamental result in model theory.
4. Developed the proof-theoretic interpretation of intuitionistic logic.
5. Discovered the notion of “general recursive functions”, which is the underlying foundation for Church’s thesis and the theory of computability.
6. Established a standard axiomatic system for classical set theory, which is still in use today.
7. Propounded the Kreisel-Goodman paradox, which challenged the traditional dogmas of classical logic. 
8. Contributed to our understanding of the set-theoretic paradoxes, by suggesting modifications to major existing theories and systems.
9. Formulated "The Aesthetic Criterion", which states that a proof should be logically adequate, constructively intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing.

Born 15 September 1923, Graz, Austria. Died 1 March 2015, Salzburg, Austria.
