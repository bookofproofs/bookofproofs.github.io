**Leopoldo Franca** was a Brazilian mathematician who had a major impact in the development and analysis of innovative finite element methods. He worked mainly on stabilised methods for fluids, acoustics and solids, residual-free methods, and enriched methods for transport equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Franca began his studies at the Pontifical Catholic University in 1977 and was awarded his B.S. in mechanical engineering in 1981.
* Franca had been awarded a CAPES fellowship to support his Master's Degree which he was awarded in 1983.
* On 28 July 1983, Franca married Ana Cristina Leonardos (born 1 February 1960).
* After the award of his Master's Degree, Franca wished to continue to study for a Ph.D. supported by CAPES and was able to undertake research at Stanford University in California, USA.
* At Stanford University, Franca's studies were supervised by Thomas Joseph Robert Hughes (born 1943).
* Franca's wife Ana came to Stanford University with her husband and studied Master's courses in Education, then Master's courses in Sociology and undertook research for a Ph.D. in social sciences applied to education beginning in 1985.
* Before the award of his Ph.D., Franca had over ten papers in print.
* These included Franca's thesis advisor Thomas J R Hughes and Michel Mallet, Marc Balestra, Isaac Harari, together with the Brazilian post-doctoral student Abimael Fernando Dourado Loula who had been awarded his doctorate by the Federal University in Rio de Janeiro in 1979.
* Franca's first papers include: (i) T J R Hughes, L P Franca and M Balestra, A New Finite Element Formulation for Computational Fluid Dynamics: V.
* Circumventing the Babuska-Brezzi Condition: A Stable Petrov-Galerkin Formulation of the Stokes Problem Accommodating Equal-Order Interpolations (1986); and (ii) T J R Hughes, L P Franca and M Mallet, A New Finite Element for Computational Fluid Dynamics: I.
* Franca was awarded a Ph.D. in 1987 for his thesis New Mixed Finite Element Methods.
* After the award of his doctorate, Franca spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Stanford in the United States.
* From 1988 to 1993 Franca worked in the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing at the Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics of the Ministério da Ciência e Tecnologia.
* On 16 May 1991, Franca married Lucia Valadao.
* Ulisses Mello, engineer and associate director at IBM Research, Brazil, led the Smarter Natural Resources & Discovery strategic group and it was this group that Franca joined as a senior research scientist.
* While working for IBM, Franca was one of six members of staff who applied for a patent for Method to assess the impact of existing fractures and faults for reservoir management on 9 November 2012.
* Sadly Franca had died two months before the application for the patent was filed.
* During his career, Franca received many awards.
* A search today (August 2022) of the Web of Science Index shows that Leopoldo P Franca is cited 7242 times.
* Franca died suddenly following a heart attack in September 2012 at the age of 53.

Born 7 April 1959, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Died 19 September 2012, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
