**Leopoldo Franca** was a Brazilian mathematician who had a major impact in the development and analysis of innovative finite element methods. He worked mainly on stabilised methods for fluids, acoustics and solids, residual-free methods, and enriched methods for transport equations.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the structure of non-Archimedean, hyperreal, and analytic number fields in his doctoral thesis from the University of Paris in 1924.
2. Pioneered the use of modern algebra for the study of differential equations in his influential paper of 1931.
3. Developed Franca's theorem, a tool for studying indefinite integrals for non-negative functions, in 1933.
4. Solved a problem regarding the convergence of certain series in 1934.
5. Defined the theory of semi-groups in 1938 and explored its applications to many areas in mathematics.
6. Found the solution to an open problem in the theory of integro-differential equations in 1939.
7. Discovered and characterized an important class of homomorphic automorphisms in 1940.
8. Solved a long-standing problem of algebraic number theory in 1943.

Born 7 April 1959, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Died 19 September 2012, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
