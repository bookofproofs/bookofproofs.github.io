**Benoît Perthame** is a leading expert in partial differential equations and a pioneer in the field of mathematical biology

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Pierre-Louis Lions was not only important for supervising Perthame's thesis but he also influenced his whole career.
* After the award of his doctorate in 1983, Perthame was appointed as an Assistant Professor at the École Normale Supérieure.
* During the 80's, together with F Golse, R Sentis and P-L Lions, Professor Perthame discovered various compactness lemmas of fundamental importance, which initiated the modern theory of kinetic equations.
* His outstanding research contributions soon led to Perthame being awarded major prizes.
* In the same year Perthame became a Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Applications of the École Normale Supéieure.
* In 1998 Perthame became head of the M3N (Multi-Models and Numerical Methods) project and the BANG (Biophysics, Numerical Analysis and Geophysics) project, both at Inria.
* It was 2002 before biology publications by Perthame began to appear in print but by 2004 around half of his eleven papers were related to the life sciences while in 2006 all his papers were.
* On 19 November 2019 Perthame gave the lecture Turing and patterns in nature at the Hsu Shou-Chlien International Conference Center as part of the celebrations for the Tamkang University 70th Anniversary Tamkang Clement and Carrie Chair.
* Let us note some other presentations that Perthame has been invited to deliver.
* A major conference was organised from 3-14 June 2002 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its founding and Perthame was one of the invited lecturers giving the lecture The Helmholtz equations and its high frequency limit.
* In this talk, Professor Benoît Perthame, Professor of Mathematics at Sorbonne Université in Paris and the Director of the Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions, discussed several topics from biology: ecology, neuroscience, cell movement, dynamics of tissue growth through some famous equations of mathematical physics.
* Professor Perthame elaborated the Fundamental Principle of Dynamics described by the Newton equations.
* Professor Perthame shared his latest research result on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).
* Perthame has received many prizes and awards for his contributions to mathematical biology including the Blaise Pascal Medal in Mathematics from the European Academy of Sciences (2013), and the French Académie des Sciences Grand Prix Inria (2015).

Born 23 June 1959, Marcq-en-Baroeul, Hauts-de-France, France.
