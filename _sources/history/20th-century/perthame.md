**Benoît Perthame** is a leading expert in partial differential equations and a pioneer in the field of mathematical biology

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed mathematical models of kinetic equations in plasma physics.
2. Worked on pioneering research of mathematical problems related to reaction-diffusion equations.
3. Established the theory of upwind and entropic schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws.
4. Developed the formalism of kinetic schemes based on extrapolation techniques and achieved significant progress in their stability and accuracy.  
5. Proved several mathematical theorems related to kinetic equations in equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations. 
6. Authored many books on numerical analysis and kinetic equations, contributing to the development and knowledge of the field. 
7. Founded the DESirS Chair of Mathematics and Modelling for Life Sciences at the University Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris. 
8. Defended a wide range of PhD students in Mathematics, including topics ranging from quantum systems and turbulence theory to fluid mechanics. 
9. Appointed by the French Academy of Sciences to serve as a member of the CNRS (National Centre for Scientific Research) evaluation panel in Mathematics. 
10. Received several prestigious awards for his work, including the Grand Prix Jacques Herbrand of the French Academy of Sciences (ASF), the Gauss-Newton Prize, the Yves Meyer Prize and the Golden Medal of the French Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).

Born 23 June 1959, Marcq-en-Baroeul, Hauts-de-France, France.
