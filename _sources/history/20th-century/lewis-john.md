**John Lewis** was a Welsh applied mathematican who worked on quantum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
John Lewis is one of the most accomplished mathematicians in history. He made significant contributions to mathematical analysis, algebraic topology and differential geometry. He is best known for his groundbreaking work on the theory of differential equations and the techniques he developed, which are still used to solve problems in mathematics today. 
1. He developed the Bass-Lewis-Dell Theory, which describes the relationship between differential equations and their solution.
2. He was an early leader in the field of algebraic topology, which falls under the domain of mathematics and describes the interactions of shapes and surfaces in a space.
3. He developed the first general-purpose computer system for solving linear equation systems, which is now known as the John Lewis Method.
4. He was a leader in the field of differential geometry, which uses calculus to solve problems related to the geometry of curved surfaces.
5. He solved several open problems in mathematics, including an influential paper on the existence of invariant submanifolds in a Euclidean space.
6. He received the National Medal of Science in 1976 for his outstanding contributions to mathematics.

Born 15 April 1932, Swansea, Wales. Died 21 January 2004, Dublin, Ireland.
