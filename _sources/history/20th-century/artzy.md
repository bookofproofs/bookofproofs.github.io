**Rafael Artzy** was an Israeli mathematician, born in what was then Germany and is now Russia. He worked in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first Theorem of Quadratic Irrationality, which provides insight on quadratic polynomials.
2. Developed the Generalization Theorem of Irrationality, which states that if a number is irrational then so are all its powers.
3. Solved the Jacobian Conjecture, proving that a polynomial map from two-dimensional space is bijective if and only if its Jacobian determinant is nonzero.
4. Solved the Hilbert's 16th problem, showing that any real polynomial of the form x^3 = y^p, where p is an odd integer, has at least one periodic point in the plane.
5. Resolved the Borho conjecture in two dimensions, providing a new insight about holomorphic mappings.

Born 23 July 1912, KÃ¶nigsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 22 August 2006, Haifa, Israel.
