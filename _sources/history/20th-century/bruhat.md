### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the existence of regular, complete vector fields in any open set of a vector space in 1952.
2. Established the theory of $\omega$-complete lattices in 1955.
3. Constructed a counter-example to De Rham's conjecture in differential topology in 1958.
4. Proved the Levi-Malcev theorem in 1960.
5. Proved the Bruhat decomposition in 1964.
6. Characterized the actions of a finite group on a compact manifold in 1966.
