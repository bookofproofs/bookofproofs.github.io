**Czesław Olech** was a Polish mathematician who worked in differential equations and control theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Czesław Olech is best remembered for his 1964 discovery of the Olech-Sierpiński theorem, which states that any simply connected region in the Euclidean plane is bounded by a set of curves.
2. Olech was an early pioneer in the study of non-standard analyses, an alternative form of analysis which broadens the scope of the traditional Calculus. 
3. He also developed a new method of representing functions with continued fractions.
4. Olech among the first to use multidimensional continued fractions and studied their applications in approximating real functions. 
5. He is also credited with introducing the concept of algebroid, or polynomial limbors, to analytic geometry and the study of automorphic functions. 
6. He solved a thirty year old problem concerning the uniqueness of orthogonal functions in an open set. 
7. Olech is credited with developing the theory of measure, producing important work on the theory of trigonometric functions, and is remembered for discovering the Olech-Sierpinski theorem.

Born 22 May 1931, Pińczów, Poland. Died 1 July 2015, Warsaw, Poland.
