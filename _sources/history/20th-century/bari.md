**Nina Karlovna Bari** was a Russian mathematician known for her work on trigonometric series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Nina Karlovna was educated at a private school, L O Vyazemska's High School for Girls in Moscow, where she showed great potential in mathematics.
* However, Bari wanted to show her proficiency in mathematics so she took the highly unusual step of taking the boy's leaving examinations.
* After the October 1917 Revolution in Russia the Bolshevik Party introduced major educational reforms, the most relevant to Bari being that for the first time universities were open to women as well as men.
* The year 1918 was the first in which women were allowed to enter Moscow State University and this coincided nicely with Bari achieving the entrance qualifications.
* This was the period of intensive development of the Moscow real variable school, headed by N N Luzin, under whose guidance Nina Bari started her own mathematical work while still an undergraduate.
* Bari graduated in 1921, and having completed the four-year course in only three years, she became the first woman to graduate from Moscow State University.
* Bari began research at the Institute, with Luzin as her thesis advisor, but continued to hold her teaching posts.
* Bari's thesis On the uniqueness of trigonometric expansions was submitted in 1925 and the degree awarded after she defended her thesis in January 1926.
* After this Bari became a research assistant at the Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics in Moscow.
* The year Bari graduated from Moscow State University, Viktor Vladmirovich Nemytski entered the university to read mathematics.
* This left Bari and Menshov to take over his role of leading the School of Function Theory which they did in the 1940s.
* Bari was an outstanding research mathematician who wrote over fifty research articles.
* Bari also wrote textbooks for use in teaching training institutes such as Higher Algebra (1932) and The Theory of Series (1936).
* The image of Bari as a lively, straightforward person with an inexhaustible reserve of cheerfulness will remain forever in the hearths of all who knew her.

Born 19 November 1901, Moscow, Russia. Died 15 July 1961, Moscow, Russia.
