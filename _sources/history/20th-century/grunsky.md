**Helmut Grunsky** was a German mathematician who worked in complex analysis and geometric function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Helmut was brough up in Aalen where he attended high school.
* Grunsky worked on complex analysis for his doctorate but he took a job before submitting his thesis.
* In November 1930 Grunsky took a job with the journal Jahrbuchs über die Fortschritte der Mathematik Ⓣ(Yearbook on the progress of mathematics) which was published by the Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften.
* At this stage Grunsky continued his work for the journal Jahrbuchs über die Fortschritte der Mathematik Ⓣ(Yearbook on the progress of mathematics) while he worked on his habilitation thesis.
* This was Grunsky's thirteenth paper which was written as an habilitation dissertation.
* Grunsky became qualified to lecture just before the start of World War II.
* Difficulties at the end of the war did not allow him to enter university teaching even then so in 1945 Grunsky took a position as a high school teacher in Trossingen, Württemberg.
* It is worth noting that due to various circumstances Grunsky did not enter university teaching until he was 45 years old.
* Grunsky have an invited address at the International Congress of Mathematicians held at Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1950.
* In 1958 Grunsky moved to the University of Würzburg where he became a full Professor.
* Grunsky published three books and 44 papers, and he supervised eight doctoral students.
* is most closely related to Helmut Grunsky's overall activity and consists of a reworking of some of his most significant contributions to function theory, in many cases with a considerable simplification of exposition.

Born 11 July 1904, Aalen, Württemberg, Germany. Died 5 June 1986, Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany.
