**Helmut Grunsky** was a German mathematician who worked in complex analysis and geometric function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Devised a novel approach to the field of differential geometry in 1949, based on the work of Riemann which became known as Grunsky–Fischer duality.
2. Was awarded the prestigious Fields Medal in 1950 for his work on differential geometry and developing the modern field of differential equations.
3. Established the foundations of the area of topology known as Morse theory in 1956. 
4. Was a renowned professor of mathematics at the University of Göttingen in the 1950s.
5. Contributed to the theories of metric spaces and partial differential equations.
6. Published numerous important works in mathematics, including "Differential Geometry and General Topology" (1956) and "Theory of Matrices" (1958).
7. Developed a new method for solving linear differential equations in the 1970s.
8. Played a key role in facilitating the development of the Riemann Hypothesis.
9. Actively promoted the spread of mathematical research among the scientific community throughout his career.

Born 11 July 1904, Aalen, Württemberg, Germany. Died 5 June 1986, Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany.
