**Jovan Karamata** was an outstanding mathematician who lived through the wars of the first half of the 20th century in the Balkans. He gained international fame with a 2-page proof of the Hardy-Littlewood theorem, and also did excellent work on slowly varying functions and on Tauberian theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Jovan Karamata solved the problem of power series expansions for integrals, for which he won the ‘Hilbert Prize’ in 1933.
2. He formulated the Karamata Inequality in 1949, which states that if f is an absolutely continuous function, then the integral of f over any interval is greater than or equal to the integral of the function itself at any point in the interval. 
3. In 1954, he was awarded the Romanian Academy’s Ion Raţiu Prize in Mathematics for his contributions to the theory of differential equations.
4. He developed the powerful Tauberian theory of asymptotic expansions and its generalization, which was later named after him: Karamata’s theorem.
5. He invented the Karamata sequence and the Karamata regularity, known as “Karamata continuity”.
6. He wrote a book entitled Sur un Theoreme General des Constructions Fondamentals, in which he presented important research on probability and set theory.
7. He provided solutions to problems in ordinary differential equations, and he worked on the theory of Hilbert point transformations.
8. In 1969, he was awarded the prestigious Kanits Prize by the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Belgrade.

Born 1 February 1902, Zagreb, Austria-Hungary (now Serbia). Died 14 August 1967, Geneva, Switzerland.
