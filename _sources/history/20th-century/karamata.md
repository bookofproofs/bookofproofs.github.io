**Jovan Karamata** was an outstanding mathematician who lived through the wars of the first half of the 20th century in the Balkans. He gained international fame with a 2-page proof of the Hardy-Littlewood theorem, and also did excellent work on slowly varying functions and on Tauberian theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* the devoted and deeply pious woman, about whom Jovan Karamata spoke with great respect, had, according to him, a lasting influence on his spiritual development.
* Jovan began his secondary education at the Gymnasium in Zemun in 1912.
* Not surprisingly, Jovan found these years extremely difficult and his education was suffering; he came close to having to repeat his third year at secondary school.
* Jovan spent one year studying at a boarding school in Cressier in the Canton of Bern where he became fluent in French.
* Karamata graduated from the Gymnasium in 1918 and, later that year, began to study at the Gymnase Scientifique.
* This was formally established on 11 May 1924 with Stevan Karamata as its Managing Director.
* Following this advice, in 1920 Jovan had enrolled in the Department of Civil Engineering at the Faculty of Technical Sciences of the University of Belgrade.
* Following his advice, Karamata transferred to study mathematics in the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade.
* The leading mathematician at Belgrade at this time was Mihailo Petrović and he played an important role in Karamata's university education.
* Karamata graduated in 1925 and he was appointed as a temporary assistant of Mihailo Petrović.
* Karamata's 2-page 1930 paper was one of the 50.
* Returning to Belgrade, Karamata began a period of remarkably intense work.
* Emilija was fluent in French and German and she assisted Karamata by typing his papers and taking the role of secretary in his correspondence with other mathematicians.
* Karamata's mathematical output was very large with around 120 papers, 15 books (both monographs and textbooks) and 7 works about teaching.
* Apart from greatest efforts in scientific work, Karamata also had other activities.
* Karamata did not accept to rule of Milan Nedic's government, so was dismissed from his university position.
* When the invaders were expelled, Karamata was again arrested in the belief he had collaborated.
* Karamata worked hard to assist these students but times were difficult without most of his former friends and with new ideas about teaching but no new books.
* Given Karamata's background, despite his attempts to fit in, it was inevitable that he would be considered "a reactionary bourgeois capitalist" by the Communist regime.

Born 1 February 1902, Zagreb, Austria-Hungary (now Serbia). Died 14 August 1967, Geneva, Switzerland.
