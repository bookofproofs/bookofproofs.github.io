**Józef Marcinkiewicz** was a Polish mathematician who worked in real analysis and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Marcinkiewicz–Zygmund inequality, a problem in functional analysis.
2. Developed Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem, a topic in functional analysis.
3. Constructed the Marcinkiewicz–McIntosh–Zygmund operator, a topic in real analysis.
4. Developed the Marcinkiewicz theorem, which deals with the summability of series.
5. Proposed the Marcinkiewicz theorem in probability theory.
6. Proved several theorems related to trigonometric polynomial series.
7. Published several papers on the theory of functions and Brownian motion.
8. Contributed to the development of the boundary value problem for parabolic equations.
9. Developed a theorem on regularity of solutions to elliptic boundary value problems.

Born 30 March 1910, Cimoszka, Bialystok, Poland. Died 1940, possible Katyn, Russia.
