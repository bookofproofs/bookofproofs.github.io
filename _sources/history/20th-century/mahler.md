**Kurt Mahler** was a German mathematician who made important contributions to the theory of transcendental numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the fifth case of the Gauss class number problem, for which he was awarded the prestigious Fields Medal in 1936. 
2. Established a new number field by solving an open problem in Algebraic Number Theory in 1929. 
3. Developed the Mahler measure, an important invariant in Number Theory.
4. Proved the principal ideal theorem and the non-Archimedean discriminant theorem.
5. Established the existence of transcendence measure for algebraic numbers not just in one variable but for any number of variables.

Born 26 July 1903, Krefeld, Prussian Rhineland. Died 25 February 1988, Canberra, Australia.
