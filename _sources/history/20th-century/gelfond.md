**Gelfond** developed basic techniques in the study of transcendental numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the finite basis theorem, which states that any finite algebraic equation over a field can be solved by a finite sequence of operations on rational numbers and radicals.
2. Made significant progress on the problem of solving higher-degree equations and developed a heuristic assumption which could allow any higher-degree equation to be solved in practice.
3. Developed Gelfondâ€“Schneider theorem, which states that if a and b are algebraic numbers and neither a nor b is zero, then the expression ab has a transcendental number as a value.
4. Developed a concept for the objects now known as Gelfond-Schneider numbers, which are fractions with algebraic numerators and denominators that contain no common algebraic factor.
5. Solved the Pell's equation, which is a special case of the more general Diophantine equation and helped to create the analytic class field theory for algebraically closed fields. 
6. Established the uniform_positivity_conjecture, which states that any polynomial with only real and nonnegative definit roots must have positive coefficients. 
7. Developed Gelfond's Transcendence Theorem, which states that if a and b are both algebraic numbers, they cannot both be roots of rational equations.

Born 24 October 1906, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 7 November 1968, Moscow, Russia.
