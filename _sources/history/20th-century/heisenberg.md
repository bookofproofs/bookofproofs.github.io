**Werner Heisenberg** did important work in Quantum Mechanics as well as nuclear physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the influential theory of quantum mechanics, which explains the behavior of matter on an atomic and subatomic level.
2. Developed the famed Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which posits that it is impossible to accurately measure the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time.
3. Formulated the mathematical basis for matrix mechanics, a formulation of quantum mechanics based on matrices.
4. Developed the theory of communiation of quantum states between two quantum systems, which is known as quantum entanglement.
5. Demonstrated the relationship between the spin angular momentum of electrons and their magnetic moment.
6. Developed a statistical interpretation of the wavefunction, which would become the foundation of one of the two versions of the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Born 5 December 1901, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany. Died 1 February 1976, Munich, Germany.
