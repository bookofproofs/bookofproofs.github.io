**Albrecht Fröhlich** was a German mathematician who made important contributions to group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Froehlich Algorithm, an algorithm that simplified and extended results of Galerkin's Methods.
2. Authored more than 30 research papers focusing on topics in numerical analysis.
3. Pioneered the use of uniform partitioning methods to solve boundary value problems.
4. Developed a general software package for numerical methods such as spline algorithms, linear systems and nonlinear optimization problems.
5. Established mathematical models and methods of optimal design in biomechanical engineering.
6. Conducted research in numerical wave theory, a field at the intersection of applied mathematics and physics.
7. Co-authored a book on the numerical methods of linear functional equations.

Born 22 May1916, Munich, Germany. Died 8 November 2001, Cambridge, England.
