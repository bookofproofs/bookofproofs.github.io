**Benoit Mandelbrot** was largely responsible for the present interest in Fractal Geometry. He showed how Fractals can occur in many different places in both Mathematics and elsewhere in Nature.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed fractal geometry, a new way of looking at and understanding the world around us.
2. First to describe the notion of fractal dimension, which allows for the description of shapes that elude classical Euclidean geometry.
3. Coined the term "fractal" and developed the concept of self-similarity.
4. Established that many natural objects are self-similar and can be described by fractals.
5. Demonstrated the significant role of fractals in financial markets.
6. Was instrumental in introducing chaos theory and its applications to science.
7. Pioneered the field of fractal analysis by investigating and establishing the mathematics of fractals.
8. Contributed to developing mathematical tools to explain complexity and randomness in nature.
9. Discovered the Mandelbrot set, perhaps the most famous of all fractals.
10. Authored several books on fractal geometry and its applications.

Born 20 November 1924, Warsaw, Poland. Died 14 October 2010, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
