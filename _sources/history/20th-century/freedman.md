**Michael Freedman** is an American mathematician who won a Fields Medal for his work on the Poincaré conjecture.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Fields Medal in 1986 for his work on the Poincaré Conjecture, the first American to receive the honor.
2. Received the National Medal of Science in August 2017 for his fundamental contributions to topology, geometry, and geometric analysis.
3. Made significant contributions to the understanding of the structure of four-dimensional topology.
4. Resolved the Poincaré Conjecture, which was one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems set out by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000.
5. Developed a surgery method for constructing new topological manifolds.
6. Solved the generalized Schoenflies conjecture.
7. Proved the stability of the Casson invariant.
8. Developed the cobordism hypothesis concerning the classification of high-dimensional manifolds.
9. Demonstrated that certain types of manifolds are topologically rigid.
10. Established a deep connection between topology, geometry and analysis.

Born 21 April 1951, Los Angeles, California, USA.
