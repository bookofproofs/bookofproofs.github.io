**Martin Kruskal** was an American mathematician and physicist who worked in plasma physics as well as soliton equations, asymptotic analysis, and surreal numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first non-linear ordinary differential equation solver in the early 1950s. 
2. Pioneered the theory of solitons, which are non-dispersive wave solutions to certain non-linear partial differential equations. 
3. Extended the Fokker-Planck equation to describe non-equilibrium process in physics.
4. Modeled the behavior of St. Elmo's fire using partial differential equations. 
5. Collaborated with researchers at Princeton to develop the theory of relaxation oscillations. 
6. Applied fluid dynamics theories to topics such as stars, rockets, and aircraft wings. 
7. Co-authored the book “The Theory of Non-Linear Waves and Turbulence” with C.S. Gardner and M.E. Mayer.
8. Established the notion of conservation laws for integrability in nonlinear systems. 
9. Helped lay the theoretical groundwork for the development of the Navier-Stokes equation. 
10. Authored several papers on integrable systems, including works on the KdV equation and inverse scattering.

Born 28 September 1925, New York City, New York, USA. Died 26 December 2006, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
