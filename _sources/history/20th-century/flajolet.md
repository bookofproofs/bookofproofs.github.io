**Philippe Flajolet** was a French mathematician and computer scientist who worked on the analysis of algorithms.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the 'Average-Case Analysis' algorithm, which uses sophisticated numerical methods to analyze algorithms and understand their complexity.
2. Pioneered the development of the 'Analytic Combinatorics' theory, which provides precise asymptotic results for counting discrete structures.
3. Theoretically derived the 'Logarithmic Generating Functions' for combinatorial sequences, which provides powerful insight into the behavior of the sequences over long time horizons.
4. Authored the ‘PROBABILISTIC ALGORITHMS’ book, which discussed Flajolet's ground-breaking research into the field of probabilistic algorithms.
5. Supported the development of the 'Symbolic Method', by means of which generating functions can be efficiently evaluated.
6. Developed the 'Digital Tree Theory', which uses tree and graph theory to analyze certain types of algorithms.
7. Co-created the 'Analysis of Algorithms' course at University of Paris, which turned it into a leading center for algorithm research.

Born 1 December 1948, Lyon, France. Died 22 March 2011, Paris, France.
