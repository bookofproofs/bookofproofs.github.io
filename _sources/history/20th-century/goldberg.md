**Anatolii Asirovich Goldberg**was a Ukranian mathematician who moved to Israel. He worked in complex analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algebraic method for solving partial differential equations. 
2. Developed the integral representation method for analytic solutions to nonlinear problems. 
3. Published an influential monograph "Integration of Partial Differential Equations", which set out his theory on equations of mathematical physics. 
4. Developed the theory of what are now known as generalized functions or distributions. 
5. Developed the geometric theory of linear partial differential equations in the spaces of Sobolev. 
6. Published various works on the theory of integral equations, Hilbert-Schmidt operators and Fourier series. 
7. Developed the Wiener-Hopf method for solving linear equations with fractional derivatives. 
8. Contributed to the theory of distributions and nonsmooth analysis.

Born 2 April 1930, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine). Died 11 October 2008, Netanya, Israel.
