2. Made significant contributions to the field of chaos theory.
3. Demonstrated that the orbit of a comet could be modeled with the aid of differential equations.
4. Explored the mathematical foundations of fluid dynamics.
5. Uncovered a novel proof for the Gauss-Lucas theorem.
6. Derived an improved expression for an integral over Bessel functions.
7. Proposed a new way to calculate eigenvalues using the Laplace transform.
8. Published a treatise on complex analysis.
9. Developed a new method of calculating the derivatives of a function.
10. Discovered a new relationship between prime numbers and Fibonacci numbers.
