**Aleksei Vasilevich Pogorelov** was a Russian mathematician who worked in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved that the famous Cauchy-Kowalewsky theorem is true for some classes of plane curves. 
2. Developed a new method for solving nonlinear mathematical equations. 
3. Constructed an iterative method for solving a large class of variational problems and inequality problems. 
4. Proved the existence of meromorphic functions with a prescribed number of zeros and poles. 
5. Pioneered the use of various new methods of functional analysis and developed a large number of new results in this field. 
6. Discovered a new type of equation, now known as the Pogorelov equation, which has since been widely used in the theory of surfaces. 
7. Proposed the Pogorelov conjugacy principle which established a connection between the geometric theory of surfaces, the theory of conformal mappings, and the theory of moving frames. 
8. Developed a new approach to solving equations whose solutions depend on two independent variables. 
9. Constructed a new class of variational principles for finding extremal functions for some elliptic partial differential equations. 
10. Developed a new method for constructing a canonical form for certain classes of second order differential equations.

Born 3 March 1919, Korocha, now Belgorod Oblast, Russia. Died 17 December 2002, Moscow, Russia.
