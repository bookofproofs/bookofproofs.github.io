**Gary Roach** was a Welsh mathematician who spent much of his career in Scotland. His research was mainly in the area of applied analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* There Roach attended Southwell Minster School where he excelled as a sportsman.
* After graduating with his first degree, Roach joined the Royal Air Force.
* Back in the UK, Roach was appointed as a lecturer at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, Scotland.
* Roach was vice-convener of the committee from 1992 to 1996 and convener in 1996-97.
* Roach's research was mainly in the area of applied analysis.
* His early papers were: On the approximate solution of elliptic, self adjoint boundary value problems (1967); Fundamental solutions and surface distributions (1968); Approximate Green's functions and the solution of related integral equations (1970); and (jointly with Robert A Adams) An intrinsic approach to radiation conditions (1972).
* These were the first of over 150 papers published by Roach.
* In 1982 Roach published a second edition of the book which he had updated and added two additional chapters.
* Roach's last three books are: (1) Wave scattering by time-dependent perturbations.
* In his own CV, Roach gives his recreations as mountaineering, photography, philately, gardening, and music.
* In 1983 Gary joined The Nomads Club.
* This body, formed in 1895, exists as a forum for discussion and debate, and Gary presented an Annual Paper to the Club, on a matter chosen by the President of the year.
* This gave Gary considerable pleasure, owing to the subject usually having absolutely nothing to do with Science or Mathematics! He was President in Session 1998-99 and was made an Honorary Member in 2010.
* Roach received many honours including being elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1977), awarded a D.Sc. by the University of Manchester (1991), and awarded an honorary Sc.D. by the University of Łódź, Poland, in 1993.
* We note that Roach had a long list of letters after his name: OStJ, FRSE, FRSA, FRAS, BSc, MSc, PhD, DSc, ScD, CMath.

Born 8 October 1933, Penpedairheol, South Wales. Died 17 March 2012, Bannockburn, Stirlingshire, Scotland.
