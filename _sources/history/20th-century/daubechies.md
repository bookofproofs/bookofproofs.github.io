**Ingrid Daubechies** is a Belgium mathematician and physicist who has done important work on wavelets in image compression. She is on the Board of Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education, an organisation which helps women get advanced degrees in mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a family of wavelets, the “Daubechies wavelet”, which is now an important tool used in data compression and signal processing. 
2. In 1986, became the first female full professor in mathematics at Princeton University. 
3. Won the National Medal of Science in 2008, awarded by then President George W. Bush. 
4. Won the Lester R. Ford Award from the Mathematical Association of America in 2006. 
5. Awarded the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1992 for her work on wavelets. 
6. Recognized for transforming the world of digital signal processing and data compression by leveraging wavelet theory. 
7. Elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1994 and the American Philosophical Society in 2015. 
8. Recipient of the American Mathematical Society’s Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement in 1993.

Born 17 August 1954, Houthalen, Belgium.
