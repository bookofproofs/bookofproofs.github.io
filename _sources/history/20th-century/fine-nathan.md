**Nathan Fine** was an American mathematician who worked on the hypergeometric series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He was only at the University of Pennsylvania for a short while and Fine was lucky to have his doctoral studies supervised by such an outstanding mathematician.
* Fine was appointed to the position of Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 and in 1956 he was promoted to full professor.
* Fine held a number of fellowships such as an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in 1953-54 and a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowships presented by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation of New York City in 1958.
* Fine was honoured by being made Earle Raymond Hedrick Lecturer in 1966.
* As a mathematician Fine had wide interests publishing on many different topics including number theory, logic, combinatorics, group theory, linear algebra, partitions and functional and classical analysis.
* Fine was at that time engaged in his own special development of q-hypergeometric series, and as the years passed he kept adding to his results and polishing his presentation.
* The material that Fine was lecturing about fit in perfectly with my thesis work and introduced me to many aspects of this extensive subject.
* We became somewhat diverted while looking at Fine's text Basic hypergeometric series and applications when we began to look at Andrews' Introduction.
* Fine writes from the viewpoint of a number theorist, and his slim volume is rich with examples and results from the theory of partitions, the study of Ramanujan's mock theta functions, and modular equations.
* Many of Fine's papers were written jointly with other leading mathematicians.
* Fine was also interested in problem solving and contributed both problems and solutions to problems to several different journals.
* In this article Fine proved that here exist rational numbers aaa and bbb that are never sides of a rational triangle, and also there exists a rational triangle of any given rational area.

Born 22 October 1916, Philadelphia, USA. Died 18 November 1994, Deerfield Beach, Florida, USA.
