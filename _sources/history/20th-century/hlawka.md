**Edmund Hlawka** was an Austrian mathematician who made important contributions to the geometry of numbers, to the theory of uniform distribution and to numerical integration.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art in 1966 for his contributions to mathematics. 
2. Introduced the framework for additive set functions in 1952.
3. Proved, in 1957, the fundamental theorem of superposition for singular integrals.
4. Made significant contributions to the theory of integral geometry in the 1950s and 1960s.
5. Pioneered the use of computers in applied mathematics at a time when such practice was rare. 
6. Developed several useful numerical methods related to quadrature, automation of derivations and transformations, and convergence acceleration.
7. Established the Herglotz theorem of integral representation and the Hlawka theorem of existence of invariant integrals.
8. Co-authored a book on the history of mathematics, introducing the concept of cultural movement.

Born 5 November 1916, Bruck an der Mur, Styria, Austria. Died 19 February 2009, Vienna, Austria.
