**László Lovász** is a Hungarian mathematician best known for his work in combinatorics, for which he was awarded the 2021 Abel Prize.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2019 for his “outstanding contributions to combinatorial optimization, combinatorial number theory, and algebraic graph theory”. 
2. Awarded the Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology, for pioneering the development of algorithmic theory of complexity in 2008. 
3. Awarded the Knuth Prize in Computer Science (formerly called the ACM Turing Award) in 1993. 
4. Received the Franklin Institute's Benjamin Franklin Medal, in 2002, for his "revolutionary contributions to the research and development of algorithms and data structures".
5. Co-authored the textbooks Matching Theory (1986) and Combinatorial Optimization: Polyhedra and Efficiency (2004). 
6. Pioneered several key advances in graph theory, including the perfect graph theorem, which provides an important tool for algorithmic graph theory. 
7. Published the seminal paper “An Algorithmic Theory of Numbers, Graphs and Convexity” in 1975.

Born 9 March 1948, Budapest, Hungary.
