**Tjalling Charles Koopmans** was a Dutch American mathematician and economist. He won the Nobel prize in Economics for his work on the theory of the optimum allocation of resources.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored seminal papers on linear programming and its connection to economic output which laid the groundwork for modern mathematical optimization.
2. Developed the concept of activity analysis which is used to analyze complex systems. 
3. Helped to develop the mathematical formulation of the primal and dual linear programming problem known as the Koopmans–Beckmann problem and the KKT conditions.
4. Independently rediscovered, and extended, the practical problem of keeping track of a fleet of ships, called the “Economic Lot Sizing of Multi-Item Production Processes”.
5. Contributed to the formation of the Koopmans–Dantzig linear programming algorithm.
6. Made major contributions in the field of game theory by devising the minimax theorem.
7. Pioneered the use of linear algebra in operations research.
8. Co-developed the mathematical formulation of the Hungarian method, an efficient algorithm for solving the assignment problem.

Born 28 August 1910, 'sGraveland, Netherlands. Died 26 February 1985, New Haven Connecticut, USA.
