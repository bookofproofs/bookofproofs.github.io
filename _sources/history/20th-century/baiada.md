**Emilio Baiada** was an Italian mathematician who worked in analysis, topology and differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Not only did Baiada receive the laurea but he was awarded the Michel Prize for best dissertation.
* After the war ended, Baiada returned to his position at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa.
* Baiada attended the four hundred sixty-fifth meeting of the American Mathematical Society which was held at the University of Cincinnati on Friday and Saturday 23-24 February 1951.
* In 1952, after taking part in a competition for the Chair of Analysis at the University of Palermo, Baiada took up the position.
* This was a very active period for Baiada who, also in 1955, published the single-authored paper La limitatezza, gli zeri di una funzione e i coefficienti di Eulero-Fourier â“‰(Limits, the zeroes of a function and the Euler-Fourier coefficients).
* Baiada also did important work with Vinti on perimeters of sets.
* It is worth noting that this was just one of three jointly authored papers that Baiada published in the Proceedings of this Syracuse conference.
* Baiada left Palermo in 1961 and moved to Modena in when he was appointed Professor of Mathematical Analysis at the University of Modena.
* We have mentioned some of Baiada's publications above but we note that his output totals 60 scientific publications on a wide range of different fields in analysis: ordinary and partial differential equations, Fourier series and the series expansion of orthonormal functions, topology, real analysis, functional analysis, calculus of variations, measure and integration, optimisation, and the theory of functions.

Born 12 January 1914, Tunis, Tunisia. Died 14 May 1984, Modena, Italy.
