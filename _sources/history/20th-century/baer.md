**Reinhold Baer**'s mathematical work was wide ranging; topology, abelian groups and geometry. His most important work, however, was in group theory, on the extension problem for groups, finiteness conditions, soluble and nilpotent groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Baer–Krull Theorem, which provides a powerful factorization theorem in algebraic number theory
2. Wrote an influential paper on projective geometry, which became a foundational work in the field
3. Wrote a dissertation on algebraic curves, which laid the foundation for modern algebraic geometry
4. Proposed the concept of algebraic groups and hyperstructures, which have proven to be of great value in modern mathematics
5. Published papers on nonassociative algebra and studied systems of linear equations
6. Developed the axiomatics of Abelian groups and laid the foundation for the theory of modules
7. Solved a problem related to the four color theorem which was posed by David Hilbert
8. Researched the relationship between linear equations and Plato organs, thus contributing to the development of linear algebra
9. Pioneered the use of structures such as groups, rings, and fields in algebraic geometry
10. Discovered a class of Abelian groups which are now called Baer-Riesz Groups

Born 22 July 1902, Berlin, Germany. Died 22 October 1979, Zürich, Switzerland.
