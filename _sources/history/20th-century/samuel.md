**Pierre Samuel** was a French mathematician who worked in commutative algebra and its applications to algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Pierre studied at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly in Paris before entering the École Normale Supérieure where he studied for his Agrégé de mathematique.
* Returning to France, Samuel worked at the National Centre for Scientific research from 1947 to 1949.
* In 1949 Samuel was appointed as Maître de Conférences at the Faculty of Science at Clermont-Ferrand and was later appointed as professor there.
* Indeed Samuel is famed for his book so it is fitting that we look at some of these texts.
* It is for the two volume work Commutative algebra  by Zariski and Samuel that Samuel is perhaps best known.
* Another beautiful little book by Samuel is Anneaux factoriels Ⓣ(Factorial rings) which was published in 1963 and contained the lecture course that Samuel gave on unique factorisation domains in Paris in 1961-62.
* Another text is Lectures on old and new results on algebraic curves  which was published in 1963 and explained the results of Grauert and Samuel on Mordell's conjecture over function fields.
* Samuel has another, rather unusual interest.

Born 12 September 1921, Paris, France. Died 23 August 2009, Paris, France.
