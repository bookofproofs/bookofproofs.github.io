**Gerd Faltings** is a German mathematician whose work in algebraic geometry led to important results in number theory, including helping with the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Following the award of his doctorate, Faltings went to the United States where he spent a year doing postdoctoral work as a research fellow at Harvard University in 1978-79.
* In 1979 Faltings returned to Germany, taking up an appointment as professor of mathematics at the University of Wuppertal.
* In 1985 Faltings was appointed to the faculty at Princeton.
* Faltings proved conjectures by Mordell, Shafarevich and Tate during 1983.
* In 1986 Faltings received the highest honour that a young mathematician can receive when he was awarded a Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Berkeley.
* At the Congress B Mazur gave an address describing the work by Faltings which had led to the award.
* Faltings has been closely linked with the work leading to the final proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles.
* However, Faltings was the natural person that Wiles turned to when he wanted an opinion on the correctness of his repair of his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in 1994.
* In 1994 Faltings left Princeton when appointed a Scientific Member of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany.

Born 28 July 1954, Gelsenkirchen-Buer, Germany.
