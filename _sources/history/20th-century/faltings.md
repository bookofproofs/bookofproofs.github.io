**Gerd Faltings** is a German mathematician whose work in algebraic geometry led to important results in number theory, including helping with the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Fields Medal, the highest honor in mathematics, in 1986 for his work on the Mordell Conjecture. 
2. Awarded the Crafoord Prize in 1994, for his work on the arithmetic of elliptic curves. 
3. Proved the Finiteness Theorem, which is part of what is now known as the Mordell-Faltings theorem. 
4. Made contributions to arithmetic geometry and the theory of Shimura varieties. 
5. Developed the Faltings-Serre theory of modular forms. 
6. Proved the so-called Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture and Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem in 1995. 
7. Conducted research in number theory, analysis and algebraic geometry. 
8. Received honorary degrees from several universities in Europe and the United States.

Born 28 July 1954, Gelsenkirchen-Buer, Germany.
