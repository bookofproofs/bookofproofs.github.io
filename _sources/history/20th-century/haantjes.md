**Johannes Haantjes** was a Dutch mathematician who worked in differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After graduating from the High School in Leiden in 1927, Haantjes entered the University of Leiden where his chosen major subjects were mathematic and physics.
* Haantjes was also taught by Jan Arnoldus Schouten who was the professor of mathematics at Delft University but taught a course on differential geometry at Leiden as a guest lecturer.
* Another of Haantjes' lecturers was Johannes Droste (1886-1963).
* Haantjes continued his studies at the University of Leiden, undertaking research for his doctorate advised by van der Woude.
* Although Jan Schouten was not on the faculty of the University of Leiden, he did advise Haantjes in an unofficial capacity.
* On 19 May 1933 Haantjes was awarded a Ph.D. for his 102-page thesis Het beweeglijk assenstelsel in de affiene ruimte Ⓣ(The moving coordinate system in the affine space).
* A few months after Haantjes' thesis was accepted, his first paper, a joint publication with his thesis advisor van der Woude appeared.
* By the time this paper was published, Haantjes was already working as an assistant to Jan Schouten at Delft University.
* Schouten and Haantjes published two joint papers in 1934, namely Generelle Feldtheorie.
* In 1936 Haantjes and Jan Schouten were co-authors of the article On the theory of the geometric object which was published in the Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.
* Marie Antoinette Haantjes died in 2001.
* Haantjes gave his inaugural lecture Over enige grondbegrippen uit de meetkunde Ⓣ(On some basic concepts of geometry) in Leiden on 28 May 1948.
* Haantjes published over 50 papers in his short career and we will now look at the titles and give a short extract from a review, of a few of these.
* Haantjes also wrote the book Inleiding tot de Differentiaalmeetkunde Ⓣ(Introduction to differential geometry) (1954).
* Today Haantjes is remembered by those working in metric geometry for the Haantjes-Finsler curve.
* The Haantjes-Finsler curve is a metric notion of curvature suggested by Paul Finsler and developed by Haantjes in his paper Distance geometry.
* Haantjes was a dedicated Christian who had many social interests.
* H D Kloosterman was chair of this committee with Haantjes as its secretary.
* This shows the strong international reputation that Haantjes had acquired.

Born 18 September 1909, Itens, Friesland, Netherlands. Died 8 February 1956, Leiden, Netherlands.
