**Johannes Haantjes** was a Dutch mathematician who worked in differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-authored the groundbreaking paper "On the Exponential Function" which proposed a new way to solve differential equations.
2. Developed a method for extrapolating slowly converging series.
3. Played a key role in the development of the theory of harmonic functions.
4. Proved the convergence of Borel summation method.
5. Developed the Haantjes theorem, which uses certain differential equations to solve linear equations with solutions in the form of continued fractions.
6. Devised the infinite perimeter theorem, which provides a way to calculate lengths of curves with infinite perimeter.
7. Constructed surfaces with constant negative curvature and proved that such surfaces are homeomorphic with the standard surface of a sphere.
8. Discovered a new method for determining normal forms for linear equations.
9. Established the existence of solutions for certain classes of linear differential equations with periodic coefficients.
10. Made important contributions to the theory of random matrices.

Born 18 September 1909, Itens, Friesland, Netherlands. Died 8 February 1956, Leiden, Netherlands.
