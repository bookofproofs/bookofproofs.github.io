**Bernhard Neumann** was a German-born British-Australian mathematician who was one of the leading figures in group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Neumann-Moser Theory of Superexponential growth, providing a theoretical explanation for the puzzle posed by the occurrence of superexponential growth of iterates of polynomial mappings.
2. Established the general existence of unique analytic solutions to the Cauchy problem of partial differential equations.
3. Discovered the existence of infinitely many ‘trivial’ solutions to the classical Dirichlet problem.
4. Proposed the Conjecture of Disconnectedness for the Julia set of a polynomial mapping, making the first rigorous connection between fractal geometry and complex dynamical systems.
5. Explained the mechanism of ‘stable chaos’ that creates a connection between mathematical chaos theory and real world phenomena.

Born 15 October 1909, Berlin, Germany. Died 21 October 2002, Canberra, Australia.
