**Grigori Perelman** is a Russian mathematician who proved the Poincaré Conjecture and who refused to accept a Fields Medal or the $1 000 000 Clay Prize.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the soul conjecture, a landmark result in Riemannian geometry. 
2. He settled the Poincaré conjecture, one of the most notorious problems in mathematics. 
3. Designed a new algorithm for solving the Geometrization Conjecture of Thurston, which was used by Richard S. Hamilton to successfully settle the conjecture. 
4. Introduced and studied the Alexandrov Spaces, an important technique in analysis. 
5. Developed a new approach to Ricci flow, a powerful tool for studying geometric structures and providing rigorous proofs for various underlying conjectures. 
6. Discovered a novel method for describing sum-free sets, a topic in elementary number theory. 
7. Wrote several influential articles and volumes of research on topics in the fields of geometry and topology.

Born 13 June 1966, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
