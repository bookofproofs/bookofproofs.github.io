**Richard Hamming** was an American mathematician and computer scientist, best known for the so-called  _Hamming code_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In a paper published in Acta Mathematica in 1936, Trjitzinsky studied linear differential systems with two point boundary conditions of a particular type and Hamming extended this work in his thesis.
* In particular, Hamming investigated the Green's function and also the characteristic solutions for which he obtained asymptotic expressions.
* After the award of his doctorate, Hamming married Wanda Little on 5 September 1942.
* However by the time that Hamming was recruited to the project it was being undertaken at Los Alamos.
* In addition to Shannon and Tukey, some other young mathematicians had joined the Mathematical Research Department at Bell Labs just before Hamming.
* These included Donald Percy Ling (1912-1981) and Brockway McMillan (1915-) who had been at Los Alamos at the same time as Hamming.
* Hamming is best known for his work on error-detecting and error-correcting codes.
* Hamming codes, Hamming distance and Hamming metric are standard terms used today in coding theory but they are also used in many other areas of mathematics.
* How did Hamming come to do this work?
* In fact it was in 1947 when Hamming set computers at Bell Labs to work on a particular problem over the weekend.
* Hamming thought out a way not only to determine if a single error had occurred but also, by adding extra parity checks, to detect where it had occurred.
* Work in codes is related to packing problems and the error-correcting codes discovered by Hamming led to the solution of a packing problem for matrices over finite fields.
* In 1956 Hamming worked on the early computer, the IBM 650.
* Hamming also worked on numerical analysis, integrating differential equations, and the Hamming spectral window which is much used in computation for smoothing data before Fourier analysing it.
* Hamming has received many awards for his pioneering work.
* The IEEE named a medal "The Richard W.
* In 1996, in Munich, Hamming received the prestigious $130,000 Eduard Rheim Award for Achievement in Technology for his work on error correcting codes.
* In 1997 Hamming retired from teaching at the Naval Postgraduate School and was made Distinguished Professor Emeritus.

Born 11 February 1915, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Died 7 January 1998, Monterey, California, USA.
