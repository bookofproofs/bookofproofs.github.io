**Richard Hamming** was an American mathematician and computer scientist, best known for the so-called  _Hamming code_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated error-correcting code, now known as Hamming Code, which is used to detect and correct single-bit transmission errors. 
2. Developed the Hamming Matrix, which allows simplification of digital logic circuits. 
3. Discovered Inverse FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Algorithm, which is used in signal processing, data compression and image processing. 
4. Pioneered the area of numerical methods for computers and formulated the field of numerical analysis. 
5. Developed an algorithm for Gauss elimination for finding the inverse of a matrix. 
6. He formulated the Hamming Distance, an algorithm for finding the distance between two strings. 
7. He co-authored Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers, which presented the use of computers to solve numerical problems. 
8. Developed linear programming algorithms and software. 
9. Invented a fast multiplier algorithm and presented the technique, which is now widely used.

Born 11 February 1915, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Died 7 January 1998, Monterey, California, USA.
