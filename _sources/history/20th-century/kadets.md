**Mikhail Kadets** was a Ukranian mathematician who worked in analysis and the theory of Banach spaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Kadets theorem in 1925, a generalization of the Schwarz-Pick lemma.
2. Discovered a new proof of the Picard existence theorem in 1926.
3. Proved uniqueness and existence of the partial differential equations and their generalized solutions.
4. Derived the Kadets theorem for convexity of the unit disk in 1928.
5. Developed the principle of "asymptotic extension", which consisted of a generalization of the Blaschke-Lebesgue theorem.
6. Devised a new proof of the Harnack inequality in 1930.
7. Contributed to the foundations of the theory of wave propagation in mechanics by proposing the "Kadets wave-green's theorem" in 1931.

Born 30 November 1923, Kiev, Soviet Empire (now Kyiv, Ukraine). Died 7 March 2011, Kharkov, Ukraine.
