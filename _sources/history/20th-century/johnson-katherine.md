**Katherine Johnson** was an African-American mathematician who made contributions to NASA's space programmme. She was featured in the 2017 film _Hidden figures_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored “Determination of Azimuth Angle at Burnout for Placing a Satellite Over a Given Earth Position” (1961).
2. Co-authored research paper “Navigation System for Manned Space Flight to the Moon & Planets” (1960).
3. Calculated and verified trajectory for Alan Shepard’s 1961 Mercury flight, the first American in outer space.
4. Calculated the trajectory for Apollo 11 mission that resulted in the first Moon landing in 1969.
5. Developed the equations first used to calculate John Glenn’s Friendship 7 flight, the first human to orbit Earth.
6. Originated the method for creating more accurate flight trajectories for lunar orbit rendezvous used for Apollo 11 mission.
7. Developed the formulas to calculate Re-entry Dynamic Loads for the Space Shuttle Program (1982).
8. Contributed complex calculations to the Apollo 13 flight plan after an oxygen tank exploded, enabling its safe return.
