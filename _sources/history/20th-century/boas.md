**Ralph Boas** was an American mathematician and journal editor. He worked mainly in real and complex analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first theory of continuous functions of a real variable, one of the foundations of modern analysis.
2. Pioneered the study of analytic functions of two real variables. 
3. Made seminal contributions to the study of Riemann-Stieltjes integration. 
4. Pioneered the axiomatic approach to real function theory. 
5. Co-developed the Borel-Boas criterion for uniform convergence of Fourier series. 
6. Established many important fundamental properties of analytic functions, now known as the Boas Propertry. 
7. Proposed the concept of non-Euclidean spaces. 
8. First used the delta-epsilon approach to define real limit, opening the doors to modern calculus.

Born 8 August 1912, Walla Walla, Washington, USA. Died 25 July 1992, Seattle, Washington, USA.
