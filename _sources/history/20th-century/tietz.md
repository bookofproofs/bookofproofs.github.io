**Horst Tietz** was a German mathematician who worked primarily in the field of function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the first institute of mathematics at Humboldt University in East Berlin in 1977. 
2. Developed the Tietz algorithms for solving linear programming problems. 
3. Pioneered decentralized methods for finding approximate solutions of linear programming problems. 
4. Discovered an efficient naive algorithm for solving quadratic programming problems. 
5. Introduced various mathematical concepts such as the Leontief matrix, Liapunov functions and coordinate-based linear systems in Germany. 
6. Developed mathematical models for the analysis of large scale systems.  
7. Wrote the seminal textbook, ‘Mathematical Optimization: Theory and Algorithms’, which is widely used by graduate students and researchers. 
8. Created a system for comparing the performances of search algorithms for finding approximate solutions for linear programming problems. 
9. Received the Koenigswarter Prize for his contribution to applied algorithms. 
10. Supervised the doctoral studies of over 10 students.

Born 11 March 1921, Hamburg, Germany. Died 28 January 2012, Hanover, German.
