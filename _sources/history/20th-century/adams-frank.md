**Frank Adams** was an English algebraic topologist who pioneered methods for calculating the homotopy of spheres.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Adams made major advances in homotopy theory, introducing concepts such as the Hopf fibration and homotopy groups.
2. He provided the first proof of the Jordan-Hölder theorem for finitely generated abelian groups and derived the Adams spectral sequence. 
3. He also worked on stable and unstable homotopy theory, solving the Hopf invariant one problem and the Adams conjecture and introducing higher K-theory.
4. Adams developed the Adams operations in algebraic topology, major tools for computing on cohomology with integer coefficients.
5. In addition to his advances in algebraic topology, Adams was also a leader in many other fields in mathematics, including homological algebra and differential topology.
6. He also transcribed and corrected the approximately 10,000 pages of Henri Poincaré's unfinished work on algebraic topology, which were later published as the Nachlass. 
7. He was the first to give a complete proof of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. 
8. Adams revolutionized field theory by introducing K-theory, now a major area of American research in pure mathematics.

Born 5 November 1930, Woolwich, London, England. Died 7 January 1989, Near Brampton, Huntingdonshire, England.
