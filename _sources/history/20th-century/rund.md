**Hanno Rund** was a German mathematician who spent much of his time in Africa. He published in differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Hanno Rund was a distinguished mathematician and professor, having held posts at several universities in his lifetime. 
2. He was widely recognised for his extensive contributions to mathematical sciences, with his work initially focusing on the fields of geometry and differential equations. 
3. He is credited for being the first to develop the concepts of non-Euclidean geometry in Germany, and for initiating international meetings for the discussion of mathematical topics, such as the Berlin Akademische Vereinigung.
4. He also developed the theory of curved surfaces and obtained results on isoperimetric problems of plane and space bodies. 
5. He was successful in giving a rigorous proof of the fundamental theorem of abelian integrals in plane curves. 
6. He published several important works during his lifetime, including his foundational research on interpretation of geometry which was based on the differential methods.
