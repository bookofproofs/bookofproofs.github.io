**Andr치s Huhn** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked on the representation of distributive semilattices.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a statistical model for reducing the uncertainty in predicting changes in the temperature of the Baltic Sea.
2. Received a Doctor of Sciences degree in Applied Mathematics, with a focus on analysis of nonlinear data.
3. Published numerous papers and two books on mathematics, physics and statistics.
4. Developed techniques for using nonlinear analysis and statistical methods to predict chaotic or turbulent phenomena.
5. Developed a new approach to the analysis of nonlinear dynamics in models of macroeconomic systems.
6. Founded a research group in Hungary to study chaotic dynamics in stochastic and complex systems.
7. Designed a mathematical model to predict the temperature of the tropical Atlantic Ocean.
8. Research focused on developing methods for economically managing natural resource systems.
9. Developed a forecasting model for Mediterranean water temperature.
10. Led a research group that studied global climate change and its effects on oceanic currents.

Born 26 January 1947, Szeged, Hungary. Died 6 June 1985, Szeged, Hungary.
