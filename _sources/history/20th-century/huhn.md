### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* András was brought up in Szeged where he attended school and entered the József Attila University of Szeged in 1966.
* Huhn solved the problem by showing that there exists a finitely presented modular lattice with an infinite automorphism group.
* Huhn worked at the Department of Algebra at the József Attila University of Szeged from 1971, following the completion of his studies.
* An important development in Huhn's career was when he spent the academic year 1978-79 on research leave at the University of Manitoba, working with George Grätzer.
* Huhn was on the editorial board of Algebra Universalis and of Acta Scientiarum Mathematicum Szeged.
