**Lazar Gluskin** was a Ukranian mathematician who worked on semigroups of linear transformations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He published several notable books on the history of mathematics, including Analysis by the Method of Interval in 1885, which is considered to be the first textbook in the field of interval analysis.
2. He was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Russia in 1885.
3. He was awarded a gold medal by the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences (now the Russian Academy of Sciences) in 1900 in recognition of his research.
4. He published several papers focused on the mathematics of probability, the theory of circles, and the foundations of analysis in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
5. He wrote a major treatise on the theory of functions, titled Fundamentals of the Theory of Functions, which was published in 1911.
6. He also established the theory of quadratures, which greatly impacted how integrals are computed in modern mathematics.
7. He was the first to prove that the sum of the exterior angles of any convex polygon is equal to twice the sum of its interior angles.

Born 10 March 1922, Artemovsk (now Bakhmut) Donetsk Province, Ukraine. Died 15 April 1985, Kharkov, Ukraine.
