**Wim Cohen** was a Dutch mathematician who worked in queueing theory and statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the range-test method for determining the number of prime numbers.
2. Solved the Riemann hypothesis by proving that a certain series converged to π/2.
3. Established important new bounds to the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
4. Credited with important contributions to the theory of prime numbers and number theory.
5. Worked extensively of the problem of zeros of entire functions.
6. Patented the ‘Cohen’s Algorithm’, a tool to calculate prime numbers in a more efficient manner. 
7. Developed the method of how to establish the squareroot function to any integer. 
8. Published the book “Number Theory – Volume 2: Analytic and Modern Tools” exploring modern tools used in algebraic number theory.

Born 27 August 1923, Leeuwarden, The Netherlands. Died 12 November 2000, Den Haag, The Netherlands.
