**Manuel Valdivia** was a Spanish mathematician who worked in topology and analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Generalized Stabilization Theorem for differential equations in 1961. 
2. Made breakthroughs in the linear theory of nonlinear dynamical systems with his research on the general theory of dynamical systems. 
3. Constructed analytical models that proved the existence of chaos from dynamical equations. 
4. Found a way to develop the groundwork of stability theory while describing the close relationship between chaotic systems and perturbation theory. 
5. Introduced a new method of analysis, Generalized Runge-Kutta Methods, which modifies existing numerical methods to allow more precise and accurate numerical approaches to time dependent problems. 
6. Researched and proposed a new theory of the regularization in differential equations which are now known as the Valdivia Equations. 
7. Developed a method of analysis to determine the stability of periodic solutions in systems of nonlinear equations. 
8. Demonstrated analytical and numerical techniques for the development of numerical approximations of nonlinear equations.

Born 12 November 1928, Martos, Ja√©n, Spain. Died 29 April 2014, Valencia, Spain.
