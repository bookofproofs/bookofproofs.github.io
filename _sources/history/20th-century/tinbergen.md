**Jan Tinbergen** was a Dutch economist who was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Economics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Jan's other two siblings were Jacomiena (born 1905) and Dik (born 1909).
* Jan attended primary school gaining a certificate stating he was "a most excellent pupil".
* These schools allowed entry to the university system after passing additional examinations in Latin and Greek and this Tinbergen did.
* In fact some of Tinbergen's first publications were articles he wrote for the socialist newspaper Het Volk in which he examined the effects of the economic depression of 1920-22 on unemployment and how the lives of the poor had been affected.
* After completing his undergraduate degree at Leiden, Tinbergen continued to study at Leiden for his doctorate under Ehrenfest's supervision.
* Tinbergen was assigned to an administrative position at Rotterdam State prison where he was to serve for fifteen months.
* Tinbergen submitted his thesis Minimumproblemen in de natuurkunde en de ekonomie â“‰(Minimum problems in physics and in economics) in 1929.
* The importance of this work of Tinbergen was that it was one of the first examples of a new idea in mathematics, namely mathematical modelling.
* Of course mathematical physics had been studied throughout the history of mathematics but Tinbergen's work saw a new path for the applications of mathematics, where the applications could be to a wide variety of areas.
* Tinbergen, who had only just finished his dissertation and entered the staff of statisticians, was given charge of this new unit.
* Clearly influenced by the German business cycle research institutes in Berlin and Frankfurt, Tinbergen gradually tried to develop an empirical approach to dynamic problems in economics.
* This plan was based on Tinbergen's mathematically based principles of economics.
* In his contribution to the debate Tinbergen projected a 'quantitative stylising of the Dutch economy' to isolate the important factors and their effects by means of a set of definitions and equations.
* In the late 1930s Tinbergen worked as a scientific advisor for the League of Nations.
* Tinbergen was given two years leave of absence from the Central Bureau of Statistics in which to undertake this work.
* It is a pity that Tinbergen's work received such shabby critical treatment by Keynes (in 1939), but being the kind person that he was, he expressed no ill will towards Keynes.
* Tinbergen's reply to Keynes was in his paper On a Method of Statistical Research.
* Tinbergen later developed other econometric models, in particular he constructed an econometric model of the USA.
* That man is Jan Tinbergen.
* Jan Tinbergen is an unassuming man, who does not trumpet his achievements to the world.

Born 12 April 1903, The Hague, The Netherlands. Died 9 June 1994, The Hague, The Netherlands.
