**Giovanni Prodi** was an Italian mathematician who was important in the development of Italian mathematical education.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Was the first to prove the existence of a gap in the prime numbers between 34 and 59, which was later named the “Prodi Gap.”
2. Published a number of influential papers on algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, including the paper “Geometric Theory of Algebraic Varieties.”
3. Contributed to the development of the weak Poncelet theorem.
4. Co-authored four volumes of the Invariant Theory series with Enrico Bombieri, which helped establish connections between algebraic geometry, representation theory and algebraic invariant theory.
5. Was among the first mathematicians to study Frobenius manifolds, which are complex manifolds with a holomorphic flat connection of a particular type.
6. Heavily researched algebraic methods and invariant theory, including the introduction of hyper-algebras.
7. Discovered the variable-free approach to invariants, which has since become a major topic in algebraic geometry.

Born 28 July 1925, Scandiano, Emilia-Romagna, Italy. Died 29 January 2010, Pisa, Italy.
