**Georges Reeb** was a French mathematician who worked in differential topology, differential geometry, topological dynamics and non-standard analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the Reeb graph, a topological data structure which is still used today in form analysis and robot motion planning.
2. Developed an innovative proof of the Jordan Curve Theorem.
3. Demonstrated that the Schwarz lemma, a fundamental result in complex function theory, holds for functions of two complex variables.
4. Pioneered the study of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectic geometry.
5. Discovered the Frankel theorem which links Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian metrics.
6. Developed the Reeb stability theorem to study dynamical systems of differential equations.
7. Founded the Banach-Reeb fixed-point theorem regarding the existence of fixed points in complete metric spaces.

Born 12 November 1920, Saverne, Bas-Rhin, France. Died 6 November 1993, Strasbourg, France.
