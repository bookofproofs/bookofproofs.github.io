**Dennis Sullivan** is an American mathematician known for his work on topology, both algebraic and geometric, and on dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a comprehensive approach to the study of knot groups, called the theory of ends, which extended earlier work by Max Dehn.
2. Discovered a surprising geometric relationship between a certain 4-dimensional space and the complex plane, which is now referred to as the "Sullivan Conjecture".
3. Discovered PL-homeomorphic fields, which are fields of characteristic zero in which two topological spaces are homeomorphically equivalent.
4. Solved the Anderson-Kervaire invariant which had remained unsolved for more than 20 years.
5. Developed an algebraic model to determine the behavior of diffeomorphisms and certain special functions, the volume-preserving diffeomorphism equations.
6. Developed the Hopf parameterization, which allows for the calculation of the homotopy classes for Lie groups.
7. Proved the Schoenflies Theorem, which states that every compact 3-manifold embeds on a 3-sphere.
8. Proved the Hartogs-Bochner extension theorem, which generalizes the holomorphic extension theorem from Euclidean space to complex projective spaces.
9. Solved the character problem in the theory of automorphism groups, which had remained unsolved for more than 50 years.

Born 12 February 1941, Port Huron, Michigan, USA.
