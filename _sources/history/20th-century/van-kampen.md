**Egbert van Kampen** was a Belgian mathematician who made important contributions to topology and algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Improved the understanding of Bernoulli numbers, discovering a significant property of them.
2. Determined relations between partial derivatives of functions.
3. Solved the problem of "finding a function whose derivatives satisfy a given set of equations."
4. Developed the Egbert Van Kampen Theorem about the general solution of linear differential equations.
5. Published two monographs on the theory of linear differential equations.
6. Contributed greatly to the field of calculus of variations, with an article covering the subject of double integrals.
7. Established connections between integrals and partial differential equations.
8. Investigated the equations of equilibrium in the calculus of variations.
9. Wrote a paper concerning normal forms of singular points of differential equations.
10. Developed a method of linear algebraic geometry.

Born 28 May 1908, Berchem, Antwerp, Belgium. Died 11 February 1942, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
