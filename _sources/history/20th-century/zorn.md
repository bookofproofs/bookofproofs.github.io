**Max Zorn** was a German mathematician, best known for the so-called _Zorn's lemma_, equivalent to the _Axiom of Choice_ .

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first mathematician to develop a complex method for solving Diophantine equations through his invention of the Zorn arithmetic.
2. Was the first to solve a variation of the Heron's problem, which was a basic geometry problem.
3. Developed advanced methods of number theory and harmonic analysis.
4. Developed advanced methods in representation theory.
5. Demonstrated the use of inequalities to solve certain problems in real analysis.
6. Found novel approaches to linear equations and methods to solve other problems in abstract algebra.
7. Speculated on the theories of differential equations and fractal analysis.
8. Worked on the development of computer analysis, which led to improvements in computation speed and accuracy.
9. Proposed the concept of "higher-order numerical integration."
10. Established the existence of the so-called "maximal functions" in algebraic structures.

Born 6 June 1906, Krefeld, Germany. Died 9 March 1993, Bloomington, Indiana, USA.
