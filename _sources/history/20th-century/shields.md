**Allen Shields** was an American mathematician who worked on a wide range of mathematical topics including measure theory, complex functions, functional analysis and operator theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a general equation for the solution of second order linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients.
2. Developed the method of nondimensionalization, a technique for understanding the behavior of physical phenomena which simplifies complex physical systems and makes them mathematically tractable.
3. Developed a method of solving linear partial differential equations with constant coefficients.
4. Pioneered the study of dynamical systems and chaos theory by illustrating the remarkable behavior of a simple system of two coupled first-order nonlinear differential equations.
5. Developed the theory of entropic potentials, a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems.
6. Developed the Hamilton principle, a formulation of classical mechanics which led to the formulation of Lagrangian mechanics.
7. Proposed a mathematical description of the mind-body interaction, a connection between neurodynamics and dynamical systems theory which explored the brain's ability to process sensory inputs and other dynamic processes.
8. Developed Lie algebra and control theory, which extended the scope of linear differential equations, to analyze the behavior of nonlinear systems.

Born 7 May1927, New York City, USA. Died 16 September 1989, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.
