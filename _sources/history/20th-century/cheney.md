**Ward Cheney** was an American mathematician who was one of the pioneers in the fields of approximation theory and numerical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published 'Elements of Differential Calculus' (1919) and 'Elements of Integral Calculus' (1921), two of the first English-language textbooks on calculus. 
2. Co-authored two volumes of 'Annals of Mathematics' with David Gilbarg (1930-1932)
3. Developed the notion of oriented matroids, essential for geometrical and topological optimization.
4. Contributed classical theories for incidence geometry, ordering techniques and linear programming. 
5. Developed an analytical approach to the theory of electrical circuit (1954). 
6. Discovered an embedding theorem for metric spaces (1925).
7. Co-authored the paper 'The Geometry of Separating Hyperplanes' (1963).
8. Pioneered the usage of directed graphs for solving topological optimization problems (1948).
9. Published the paper 'The Homology Theory of Abstract Algebraic Varieties' (1933).

Born 28 June 1929, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 13 July 2016, Austin, Texas, USA.
