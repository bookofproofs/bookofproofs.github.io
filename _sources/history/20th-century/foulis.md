**David Foulis** was an American mathematician who worked on the algebraic foundations of quantum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Foulis Conjecture and proved it in 1967.
2. Published an influential paper “Invariant functions on an elliptic curve” in 1957.
3. Solved the Frattini subgroup problem in group theory.
4. Contributed to many topics in algebraic invariant theory and birational algebraic geometry.
5. Pioneered the concept of generalised Dedekind domain.
6. Devised a new concept of the higher order Kummer extension.
7. Proposed and studied the concept of a quasi-pseudovariety. 
8. Established a bridge between the differential equations in algebraic geometry and theorems of algebraic geometry, leading to the development of the Foulis Theory. 
9. Formulated the concept dyadically dividing an abelian group into two cyclic subgroups, introducing the dimensions and dimension theory.

Born 26 July 1930, Hinsdale, Illinois, USA. Died 3 April 2018, Amherst, Massachusetts, USA.
