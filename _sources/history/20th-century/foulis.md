**David Foulis** was an American mathematician who worked on the algebraic foundations of quantum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* David and Jim took out a patent on the mashie niblick, a wooden shafted club roughly equivalent to a modern seven iron.
* After the award of his Bachelor's degree, Foulis studied for a Master's degree in Mathematics beginning his studies in September 1952.
* In September 1956 Foulis returned to Tulane University where he began undertaking research for his Ph.D. with Fred Boyer Wright Jr as his thesis advisor.
* Al Clifford invited Gordon Preston to spend the two years 1956-58 working with him at Tulane University and Preston was also a major influence on Foulis.
* Foulis then moved to the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
* Dedication to teaching meant that there was less time for Foulis to undertake research, so his next paper did not appear until 1968 when he published Multiplicative elements in Baer *-semigroups.
* Randall, after working in the nuclear industry, obtained a position at the University of Massachusetts and had a close and fruitful collaboration with Foulis for twenty years until his death in 1987.
* Richard Greechie, who was one of Foulis's graduate students gaining a Ph.D. with his thesis Orthomodular Lattices in 1966, recalls how devoted Foulis was to teaching his students.
* Finally, we mention that Foulis published seven undergraduate textbooks.

Born 26 July 1930, Hinsdale, Illinois, USA. Died 3 April 2018, Amherst, Massachusetts, USA.
