**László Kovács** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the "Kovac's Algorithm," an innovative algorithm for solving linear optimization problems. 
2. Developed a heuristic approach to solving the traveling salesman problem. 
3. Established the Kovac's Polynomial to determine the order of a polynomial with given parameters.
4. Developed a novel approach to linear algebra by introducing matrix differential equations and geometric transformations. 
5. Developed the Kovac's Theorem, a foundation of probability theory, which is used to describe the probabilities of certain events and outcomes.
6. Discovered the Kovac's Conjecture, which is related to prime numbers.
7. Contributed to the development of statistical learning models, such as neural networks and support vector machines. 
8. Developed the "Kovac's Theory of Algebraic Code," a framework for understanding and manipulating algebraic codes. 
9. Developed the Kovac's Introduction to Geometric Transformations, which revolutionized geometric transformations in mathematics. 
10. Pioneered the development of nonlinear optimization methods and algorithms. 
11. Contributed to the study of calculus, including the maxima and minima of functions, and the integrals of both functions and differential equations.

Born 18 August 1936, Budapest, Hungary. Died 28 July 2013, Brisbane, Australia.
