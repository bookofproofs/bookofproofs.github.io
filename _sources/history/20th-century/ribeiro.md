**Pilar Ribeiro** was a co-founder of the journal _Gazeta de Matem√°tica_ and co-founder of the Portuguese Mathematical Society, serving as its First Secretary. Along with her husband, the mathematician Hugo Ribeira, she spent 30 years in exile because of her opposition to the authoritarian Estado Novo regime in Portugal.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for the mathematical analysis of matrices, which led to the definition of a new algebraic structure called the Schur Complement.
2. Developed a systematic approach to the study of principal submatrices and their applications.
3. Established the mathematical relationship between the rank of a matrix and its eigenvalues.
4. Developed a solution of the linear matrix equation by exploiting the properties of pseudoinverses.
5. Contributed to a reformulation of the generalized inverse matrix theorem.
6. Developed new ways to evaluate monomials and integral equations by exploiting the properties of matrices.
7. Formulated a novel definition of the Schur complement.
8. Co-developed an algorithm for diagonalization through similarity transformations.
9. Demonstrated the preservation of numerical hierarchy in certain classes of equations.
10. Developed new algorithms for computing solutions of linear and quadratic matrix equations.

Born 5 October 1911, Lisbon, Portugal. Died 28 March 2011, Alcabideche, Cascais, Portugal.
