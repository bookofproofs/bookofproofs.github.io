**Jerome Keisler** is an American mathematician whose work included model theory and non-standard analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the axiomatization of first-order logic, known as the axiomatic FOL system known as the Keislerâ€“Morse set theory.
2. Demonstrated and presented the development of the notion of ultrapower.
3. Pioneered the development of the concepts of indiscernability, absoluteness, forcing, and generic structures.
4. Developed the framework for constructing a countable transitive model of set theory to prove the consistency of the axiom of choice and the generalized Continuum Hypothesis.
5. Constructed models of arithmetic and analysis in the context of second-order logic.
6. Wrote dozens of research papers on the subjects of model theory, set theory, and nonstandard analysis.
7. Authored several textbooks on mathematical logic and set theory.
8. Edited the Handbook of Mathematical Logic which was reprinted in multiple editions and has become a major reference in the field.

Born 3 December 1936, Seattle, Washington, USA.
