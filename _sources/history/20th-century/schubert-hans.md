**Hans Schubert** was a German mathematician who worked on differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1918, when Hans was ten years old, he entered the Realgymnasium in the nearby town of Crimmitschau.
* In fact Heisenberg was appointed to a chair at Leipzig and started teaching there in the year in which Schubert began his undergraduate career.
* It was the applied mathematician L Lichtenstein who became Schubert's thesis advisor in 1933 and under his guidance Schubert wrote a thesis Über einige Lichtensteinsche Hilfssätze der Potentialtheorie und ihre Anwendung auf die Hydrodynamik Ⓣ(About some lemmas of Lichtenstein on potential theory and its application to the hydrodynamics)  on potential theory and its applications to hydrodynamics.
* On 1 April of that year Schubert was appointed as an assistant to H Schmidt in Köthen, a position which he held until October.
* The years during which Schubert was undertaking research were the years during which there were huge changes in Germany.
* Schubert, with his expertise in hydrodynamics, was exactly the right person to work on aviation research and from 1 November 1936 until 1 April 1945 he undertook research at the aviation laboratory in Berlin-Adlershof.
* Now working in Berlin, Schubert took part in the mathematical activities that the city offered.
* Schubert had published eight papers between his doctoral thesis and his habititation thesis.
* Schubert, therefore, continued in his position as a school teacher until the end of January, taking up his duties at Rostock on 1 March 1947, and lecturing on Why applied mathematics?
* Over the next two years Schubert turned down offers of posts at the University of Jena and at the Bergakademie in Freiberg.
* He was appointed a full professor at the University of Rostock on 1 April 1950 but on 7 September 1951 Harry Schmidt, who held the chair of mathematics at the Martin-Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, died and Schubert accepted the offer of the post, taking up his duties on 1 October 1952.
* Let us look briefly at some of the papers which Schubert published.
* In 1970, the year he retired, Schubert published a survey of the literature on the Poincaré boundary value problem.
* At Halle Schubert taught a variety of different courses such as differential and integral calculus,  partial differential equation, and integral equations.

Born 1 May 1908, Weida, Thüringen Germany. Died 24 November 1987, Halle, Germany.
