**Hans Schubert** was a German mathematician who worked on differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new method of calculating the probability of a given event, known as the Schubert calculus.
2. Pioneered fundamental work in a variety of fields including linear algebra and combinatorics.
3. Strengthened the notion of linearity in algebra, allowing for the clear explanation of phenomena and solutions.
4. Contributed to the development of mathematical models for physical systems as well as the study of chaos.
5. Solidified and codified various important theorems and results in algebra, geometry, and combinatorics.
6. Increased the conceptual understanding of mathematical concepts, making mathematics more accessible and accessible to more people.
7. Developed a new form of algebraic topology known as Schubert calculus.
8. Discovered and popularized geometric methods in combinatorics and established the branch of combinatorial geometry.
9. Revolutionized the way in which mathematics was used in modeling physical systems and advances in chaos theory.
10. Developed new methods for studying the behavior of systems in mathematical and physical settings.

Born 1 May1908, Weida, Th√ºringen Germany. Died 24 November 1987, Halle, Germany.
