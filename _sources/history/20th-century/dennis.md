**Joseph James Dennis** was the eleventh African American to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics. He served as the chair of theÂ department of mathematics at Clark College from 1930 to 1974. From 1971 to 1977 he was Fuller E Calloway Chair of Mathematics at Albany State College.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a seminal paper on fundamental group theory and group representations
2. Systematized point-set topology and developed several tools in algebraic topology
3. Discovered the duality theory of graphs and wrote a classic paper on it
4. Established a bound on the chromatic number of graphs
5. Developed new methods for enumerating combinatorial objects
6. Proposed a new proof for the fundamental theorem of algebra
7. Introduced the Dennis-Jurisich bases for vertex-transitive graphs

Born 11 April 1905, Gainsville, Florida, USA. Died 12 May1977, Switzerland.
