* In 1974 Davies published a major monograph The physics of time asymmetry.
* Much of Davies's work during his time at King's College appears in his 1982 monograph Quantum fields in curved space written with Nicholas D Birrell who wrote his thesis The Application of Quantum Field Theory to Cosmology and Astrophysics (1979) while being advised by Davies.
* In 1980 Davies was named Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.
* In 1990 Davies went to Australia when appointed as Professor of Mathematical Physics at the University of Adelaide.
* In 2003 he married Pauline, a science broadcaster.
* Among Davies's better-known media productions were a series of 45 minute BBC Radio 3 science documentaries.

* Certainly the Templeton Prize was a very major award but Davies continued to receive a host of others including: the Asteroid 1992 OG was renamed (6870) Pauldavies (1999); he received the Kelvin Medal from the UK Institute of Physics (2001); he received the Michael Faraday Prize from the Royal Society (2002); he received the American Institute of Physics Science Writing Award (2003); he received the Trotter Prize from Texas A & M University, USA (2004); and received an honorary D.Sc. from Macquarie University (2006).
