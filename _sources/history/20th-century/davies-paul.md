**Paul Davies** is an English theoretical physicist and astrobiologist who has popularised issues such as the origin of life and extraterrestrial intelligence.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered a relationship between the Jacobi theta functions and the Dirichlet divisor functions. 
2. Proved theorems about on-lines in the plane. 
3. Found a relationship between the asymptotic properties of the Selberg zeta function and the prime number theorem. 
4. Constructed an algorithm that solves linear equations using number theory. 
5. Established a theorem concerning the existence of infinitely many prime numbers. 
6. Developed a new theorem concerning the theory of Diophantine approximation of real numbers. 
7. Constructed a method for approximating lines, circles and other geometric shapes. 
8. Constructed a model for the expansion of the universe based on the differential geometry of curved space.

Born 22 April 1946, London, England.
