**Vladimir Abramovich Rokhlin** was a mathematician who was born in what is now Azerbaijan and worked in algebraic topology and geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new branch of mathematics, known as "Rokhlin algebra". 
2. First to outline a proof of the Kontsevich-Rokhlin theorem, which states that every closed 3-manifold can be decomposed into manifolds cubulated by polytopes. 
3. Played a crucial role in creating the foundations for homology theory, which is an area of mathematics concerned with the relations between spaces.
4. Systematically applied mathematics to the study of topology, in particular to the theory of manifolds and complex surfaces.
5. Pioneered the theory of characteristic classes, which relate topology and differential geometry.
6. Proved important results in the geometry and topology of 3-manifolds, such as the existence of exotic structures. 
7. Invented several important invariants of triangulated manifolds, including the Rokhlin invariant, the Rokhlin-Thom classes, and the Thurston-Rokhlin invariant. 
8. Conducted extensive research on the algebraic and geometric aspects of calculus, as well as its applications to physics and astronomy. 
9. Demonstrated a deep understanding of algebraic geometry, especially in relation to complex analytic varieties. 
10. Published several important results in homology, algebraic geometry, and differential geometry.

Born 23 August 1919, Baku, Russian Empire (now Azerbaijan). Died 3 December 1984, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
