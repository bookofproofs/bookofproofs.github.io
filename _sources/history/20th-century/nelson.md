**Evelyn Nelson** was a Canadian mathematician who worked in the area of universal algebra with applications to theoretical computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical theorem that helped prove the existence of isolated points in the real number system. 
2. Developed a novel proof of the Riemann-Roch theorem in algebraic geometry. 
3. Authored several papers on the theory of Lie groups, including an influential paper on the isomorphism between these two groups. 
4. Demonstrated the theoretical equivalence of the Eigenvalue Distribution Hypothesis and the Weyl Defect Criterion. 
5.Established the groundbreaking Nelson Measure theory, which revolutionized how mathematics is studied and applied. 
6. Conducted extensive research into the structure theory of semisimple Lie algebras and their representation theory. 
7. Co-authored a seminal paper on the C*-algebra of the algebraic K-theory of a measurable group. 
8. Developed an arithmetic-geometric mean algorithm to approximating the shape of a number field. 
9. Authored many papers on algebraic K-theory, including a groundbreaking paper on the structure of a noncommutative torus.

Born 25 November 1943, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Died 1 August 1987, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.
