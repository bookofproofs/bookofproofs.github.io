**Ernst Carl Gerlach Stueckelberg** was a Swiss mathematician and physicist. Although he made important advances never received the recognition for his achievements which many felt that he clearly deserved.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Stueckelberg theory of space-time to further our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the universe.
2. Developed the mathematical theory of electron spin, which has important implications for quantum mechanics.
3. Advanced our understanding of the mathematical foundations of quantum field theory.
4. Established the mathematical formalism for renormalized quantum electrodynamics.
5. Proposed a unified field theory, which advanced our understanding of physical theories.
6. He helped to establish the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics.
7. Pioneered the concept of virtual particles, which has become a cornerstone of modern physics.
8. Pioneered the concept of gauge invariance, which has become a fundamental concept in physical theories.
9. Developed new methods in mathematical physics, such as the multiple time-scale transformation method.
10. Pioneered the concept of renormalization group theory.

Born 1 February 1905, Basel, Switzerland. Died 4 September 1984, Geneva, Switzerland.
