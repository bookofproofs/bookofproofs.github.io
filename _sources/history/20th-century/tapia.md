**Richard Tapia** is an American mathematician who worked in mathematical optimisation. He is known as a champion of diversity in US education.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was an interest which Richard continued to enjoy and he went on to hold a drag racing world record in 1968.
* Instead of going to the University of California, Tapia studied at Harbor Junior College in Wilmington, California.
* The University of California at Los Angeles awarded Tapia an B.A. in 1961.
* Tapia did not proceed immediately to graduate studies but first he was employed as a mathematician working on ship design at Todd Shipyards, San Pedro, California.
* In 1970 Hamel versus Schauder dimension was published by Tapia in the American Mathematical Monthly.
* It was in this year of 1970 that Tapia moved to Rice University in Houston, Texas, where he was promoted to associate professor two years later, and then to full professor in 1976.
* Tapia has seen two different, but closely related, strands to his career.
