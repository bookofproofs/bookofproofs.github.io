**Richard Tapia** is an American mathematician who worked in mathematical optimisation. He is known as a champion of diversity in US education.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received the National Medal of Science in 2012 for his contributions to mathematics, science education, and for being a role model for Hispanic Americans in these fields. 
2. Appointed to the National Science Board and served as a member from 2002–2008. 
3. Established the groundbreaking education program, Expanding Your Horizons in Science & Mathematics, in 1975.
4. Was appointed Rice University’s Maxfield and Oshman Professor in the Practice in Engineering in 1992. 
5. Authored four books on optimization, including the first textbook on nonlinear programming (1973).
6. His research on nonlinear equations has been applied to fields as diverse as chemistry and petroleum engineering. 
7. Won the G.W. Stewart Prize for “his pioneering work in numerical linear algebra, nonlinear optimization, learning theory, and computer algorithms” in 1993. 
8. Met with NASA to help design the Space Shuttle Discovery mission in 1991.
9. Made significant contributions to the understanding of optimization algorithms and the optimization of complicated, highly nonlinear systems.
10. Created the Tapia Center for Excellence and Equity at Rice University in 2002.

Born 25 March 1939, Santa Monica, California, USA.
