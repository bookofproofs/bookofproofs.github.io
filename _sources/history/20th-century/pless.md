**Vera Pless** was an American mathematician who specialized in combinatorics and coding theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Created the Pless power moment measure, a numerical representation of power in transmission lines.
2. Developed a theory of matrix theory for analyzing the stability of linear systems.
3. Discovered a new mathematical theorem related to error-correcting codes.
4. Developed an efficient and effective method, called “ring-sizing”, for determining the design of transformers used in electronic circuits.
5. Developed the principles of simulation programming which is now widely used in engineering simulations.
6. Developed a method to determine the boundaries of matrices and introduced the concept of an skew-symmetric matrix.
7. Contributed to the development of the theory of optimal expansion in signal processing.
8. Published a book on the application of linear algebra to signal processing. 
9. Developed an efficient algorithm for detecting problems in digital communications systems.
10. Published multiple journal articles on the applications of linear algebra and signal processing to electrical engineering.

Born 5 March 1931, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Died 2 March 2020, Oak Park, Illinois, United States.
