**Paul Dirac** is famous as the creator of the complete theoretical formulation of quantum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Dirac equation in 1928, a relativistic quantum mechanical equation that predicted the existence of antimatter. 
2. Formulated the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of operators and transformation theory in 1930. 
3. Developed the delta function in 1931 for dealing with discontinuous problems in mathematical physics.
4. Proposed an interpretation of quantum mechanics in 1932, which is now known as the Dirac principle. 
5. Won the Nobel Prize in 1933 for the discovery of the relativistic nature of the electron and the prediction of the existence of antimatter. 
6. Introduced the concept of Fermi-Dirac statistics in 1936 to describe the behavior of electrons in systems with many particles. 
7. Published Principles of Quantum Mechanics in 1930, which became a classic text in the field and is still in use today.

Born 8 August 1902, Bristol, England. Died 20 October 1984, Tallahassee, Florida, USA.
