**Schwinger** formulated quantum electrodynamics and thus reconciled quantum mechanics with Einstein's special theory of relativity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He proposed the concepts of renormalization, couplings constant renormalization, and Schwinger's renormalization group.
2. He made substantial contributions to the quantum theory of electrodynamics, including the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum electrodynamic corrections in quantum field theory.
3. He derived the Schwinger–Dyson equation for calculating the vacuum polarization. 
4. He received Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for his outstanding work on QED. 
5. He introduced the concept of superselection rules and the theory of supersymmetry. 
6. He was amongst the earliest scientists to recognize the importance of renormalization in calculation of physical laws in the 1930s. 
7. He made important contributions to the development of gauge theory in particle physics. 
8. He worked on the C-theorem, a mathematical proof of renormalizability. 
9. He introduced the method of virtual pairs in quantizing a system.
10. He also worked on the mathematics of the path integrals in quantum mechanics and derived the heat kernel expansion.

Born 12 February 1918, New York, USA. Died 16 July 1994, Los Angeles, California, USA.
