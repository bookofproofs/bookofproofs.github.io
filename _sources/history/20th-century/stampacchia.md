**Guido Stampacchia** was an Italian mathematician who worked on the calculus of variations and elliptic partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He played a key role in developing calculus of variations, which is an important technique for solving optimization problems in engineering, economics, and physics.
2. He was one of the first to recognize that existence and uniqueness of solutions for a class of partial differential equations is guaranteed for appropriate boundary conditions.
3. His research on integral equations allowed him to prove some major results in elasticity and fluid mechanics.
4. He won the Wolf Prize in Mathematics for his contributions to the theory of variational problems and partial differential equations.
5. He developed an important technique for solving boundary-value elliptic partial differential equations, known as the Stampacchia theorem.
6. He authored over 260 papers and five monographs that elucidated the structure of ill-posed problems in partial differential equations.
7. He established a mathematical theory of plasticity and buckling of slabs and columns.
8. His research laid the foundations for mathematical aspects of the study of composite materials.

Born 26 March 1922, Naples, Italy. Died 27 April 1978, Paris, France.
