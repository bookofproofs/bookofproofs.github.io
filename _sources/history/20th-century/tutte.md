**Bill Tutte** was an English mathematician best known for his work on code-breaking in World War II.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Revolutionized the study of combinatorics and graph theory.
2. Developed an efficient algorithm for the optimization of networks for routing phone and radio signals.
3. Wrote a seminal paper on matroid theory, which later became a central part of modern graph theory.
4. Researched the connection between graphs, represented combinatorial structures, and their cycles.
5. Used graph theory to help develop methods used to break the German Enigma Code during World War II.
6. Constructed a graph theorem that formed the basis of the zero-knowledge proof system.
7. Pioneered the use of computers to study graphs, paving the way for our current understanding of networks.
8. Introduced Tutte polynomials, which are widely used in graph theory, knot theory, and computer science.

Born 14 May1917, Newmarket, Suffolk, England. Died 2 May2002, Waterloo, Canada.
