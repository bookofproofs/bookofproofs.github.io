**Bill Tutte** was an English mathematician best known for his work on code-breaking in World War II.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1935 Tutte went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, to study the Natural Sciences Tripos taking chemistry as his major subject.
* It was, however, with his mathematical friends R Leonard Brooks, Cedric A B Smith and Arthur H Stone that Tutte wrote his next paper.
* In the paper which Tutte and his three friends published in the Duke Mathematical Journal in 1940 they associated a graph with a squaring and by looking at the flow of an electrical current through the graph reproved Dehn's theorems and proved many new ones.
* Although this work was for many years covered by the Official Secrets Act, Tutte felt able to talk about it at his 80th  birthday celebrations in 1997.
* Using these two messages Tutte was able to deduce the structure of the machine sending the message after four months of intense work.
* By examining patterns in the characters, Tutte deduced that the machine sending the message had one wheel with 41 sprockets, and a second wheel with 31 sprockets.
* Having worked out the structure of the encoding machine purely from the messages, a seemingly impossibly difficult task, Tutte set about writing algorithms decode FISH messages.
* In 1943 the sophistication of the coding was increased and hand decoding using Tutte's algorithms became too hard.
* A computer called Colossus was built to run Tutte's decoding algorithms and their success played a vital role towards the end of the war.
* Rather strangely, although many such as Turing were honoured for their contributions at Bletchley Park, Tutte never received similar honours.
* Despite having no formal qualifications at this stage, Trinity College elected Tutte to a Research Fellowship in Mathematics.
* Tutte was soon publishing papers on many different aspects of graph theory.
* Tutte's paper The dissection of equilateral triangles into equilateral triangles (1948) follows a similar theme to his first mathematics paper on squaring rectangles.
* Donald Coxeter at the University of Toronto had reviewed some of these papers and was certainly fully aware of Tutte's remarkable potential.
* After the award of his doctorate in 1948 Coxeter invited Tutte to take up a post at the University of Toronto.
* Tutte remained at Toronto until 1962 when he joined the faculty at the University of Waterloo.
* Tutte wrote many outstanding papers (Mathematical Reviews lists 168 papers by Tutte) and books.
* Indeed, the style and content of the book betray throughout the influence of Professor Tutte's own work and the distinctive flavour of his personal approach to the subject.
* Tutte has received many high honours for his work.
* In 2001 Tutte received the $5,000 prize from the Centre de recherches math√©matiques in Montreal and the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences in Toronto.
* Outstanding mathematicians were attracted to work in this field, many of them inspired by Tutte's earlier results.

Born 14 May 1917, Newmarket, Suffolk, England. Died 2 May 2002, Waterloo, Canada.
