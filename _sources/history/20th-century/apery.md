**Roger Apéry** was a French mathematician best known for proving that ζ(3) is an irrational number.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered and proved Apéry's theorem, which states that the irrational number ζ(3) (zeta of three) is equal to π2/6
2.Characterized the irrationality of ζ(3) and three other values
3. Demonstrated how to calculate the irrationality measure of a number
4. Shared some of his results in his 1973 book "Irrationalité de ζ(2) et ζ(3)"
5. Provided an important insight into the Riemann zeta function, an important mathematical function in the theory of numbers

Born 14 November 1916, Rouen, France. Died 18 December 1994, Caen, France.
