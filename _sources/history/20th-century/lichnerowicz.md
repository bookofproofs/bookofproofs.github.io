**André Lichnerowicz** was a French mathematician who worked in differential geometry and mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications. 
2. Introduced the concept of “tensorial calculus” which is used to study partial differential equations in geometry.
3. Pioneered the development of differential geometry with Ricci calculus.
4. Helped establish the field of algebraic topology.
5. Proved the Riemannian structure of general relativity in 1949. 
6. Proposed the infamous Lichnerowicz equation for the Hamiltonian constraint in general relativity. 
7. Developed a theory of geometric quantization.
8. Re-defined the theory of Lagrangian theory mechanics. 
9. Formulated an electromagnetic model that explained light polarization and the photography effect.
10. Solved the equations of motion of a relativistic particle by introducing an invariant action.

Born 21 January 1915, Bourbon-l'Archambault, Allier, France. Died 11 December 1998, Paris, France.
