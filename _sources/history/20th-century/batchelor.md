**George Batchelor** was an Australian applied mathematician who worked in fluid dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Batchelor-Swan theorem for transforming an incompressible Navier-Stokes equation into an equivalent diffusion equation.
2. Discovered the similarity of turbulent and laminar flow, establishing the mathematical framework for turbulent mechanics.
3. Developed theoretical insights into the nature of turbulence and its related phenomena, advancing the mathematical understanding of fluid dynamics.
4. Published groundbreaking works on fluid mixing and aerosols.
5. Founded the field of applied mathematics, introducing new concepts and strategies for solving complex physics problems.
6. Helped develop the first practical numerical simulation of aerodynamic flow.
7. Advanced the development of boundary layer calculus, providing a general formula for calculating air pressure over curved surfaces.
8. Discovered the existence of spiral-wave solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations, significantly advancing the mathematical modelling of processes in nature.
9. Proved the existence of chaos, leading to profound implications for deterministic models in scientific research.
10. Developed an approach to solving chaotic initial-value problems, expanding the theoretical foundation of chaos theory.

Born 8 March 1920, Melbourne, Australia. Died 30 March 2000, Cambridge, England.
