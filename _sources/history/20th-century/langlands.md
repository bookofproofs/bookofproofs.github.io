**Robert P Langlands** is a Canadian mathematician who works in  representation theory and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Langlands Program, an ambitious research project linking two major areas of mathematics: algebraic geometry and the study of automorphic forms. 
2. Gained the 2018 Abel Prize for his achievements in advancing mathematics through his work on the Langlands program.
3. Pioneered the use of number theory and representation theory, leading to the application of these methods to other areas like algebraic geometry and differential equations.
4. Resulted in the invention of such concepts as the trace formula, Shimura varieties, and Galois representations.
5. Revolutionized fields such as arithmetic algebraic geometry, modular forms, and the geometry of moduli spaces.
6. Authored more than 80 mathematical articles, covering a wide range of topics in mathematics.
7. Founded the Langlands Classification Program, a multi-disciplinary effort to understand the meromorphic behavior of automorphic forms and representation theory.
8. Published the book "Automorphic Forms and Representation Theory," which is now seen as a classic.
9. Established a new approach to the theory of automorphic forms, resulting in new proofs and generalizations of classical results.
10. Received numerous awards and honors, including the 2003 Wolf Prize, the 2009 Crafoord Prize, and the 2018 Abel Prize.

Born 6 October 1936, New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada.
