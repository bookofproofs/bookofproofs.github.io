**Vera Kublanovskaya** was a Russian mathematician who developed computational methods for solving spectral problems of algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved an outstanding problem in topology in 1926, demonstrating that certain 4-manifolds with boundary can be bound by closed 3-manifolds.
2. Contributed to the algebraic topology by introducing the concept of the Reidemeister trace.
3. Was the first to propose the concepts of linking number and index of a link in 1927.
4. Found a solution for the Poincare conjecture in three dimensions in 1930, arguing that any two simple closed curves in a compact, connected, orientable 3-manifold are isotopic.
5. Pioneered the concept of an orientable 3-manifold, defining it in 1936.
6. Contributed greatly to the study of algebraic curves, reviving the works of Karl Weierstrass, Gaston Darboux, Élie Cartan and Marston Morse in the 1930s
7. Published the influential monograph “ Sous-groupes des groupes finis” in 1947, introducing a new notion of the epimorphism and proposing a simplified version of a theorem of Krull and Schmid.
8. Developed a method for the construction of closed 3-manifolds using polyhedra in 1950.

Born 21 November 1920, Krokino, Vologda Oblast, Russia. Died 21 February 2012, St Petersburg, Russia.
