**Georgi Bradistilov** was a Bulgarian mathematician who worked on nonlinear differential equations and their applications to mechanics and electrotechnics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Delcho and Nona Bradistilov had three children, two girls Penka Delcheva Bradistilova (1897-1972) and Raina Delcheva Bradistilova (1901-1923), and one son Georgi, the subject of this biography.
* Georgi was the youngest of his parents' children.
* Bradistilov attended the Third Gymnasium of Sofia, completing his studies in 1923.
* When Bradistilov began his studies he was one of around 2400 students.
* In fact while he was studying at the university the construction of new university buildings was taking place but they were not opened until several years after Bradistilov graduated.
* Interestingly, Bradistilov was one of the last students to take Arnold Sommerfeld's course in theoretical physics before his retirement.
* After the award of his doctorate, Bradistilov was appointed as a docent at the St Kliment Ohridski University of Sofia.
* In May 1943 Bradistilov was appointed as an Extraordinary Professor and Head of the Department of Applied Mathematics in the Higher Technical School.
* Two years later, on 15 October 1945, the Higher Technical School was renamed the State Polytechnic University and Bradistilov was elected as a full professor.
* Bradistilov was appointed as Head of the Department of Mathematics in the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering.
* Not only was Bradistilov an excellent researcher and an excellent teacher but he was also a well-organised administrator.
* Here are a few of these papers which we quote as examples of his contributions: The position of a system of three consecutively connected mathematical pendulums in one plane in their periodic motion about a position of stable equilibrium (Bulgarian) (1954); Sur les solutions périodiques et asymptotiques du mouvement autour de l'état d'équilibre d'un système de N-pendules physiques successivement liés dans un plan Ⓣ(On the periodic and asymptotic solutions of the motion around the steady state of a system of successively linked physical N-pendulums in a plane) (1955); (with George Boyadjiev) Existenz periodischer Bewegungen eines n-fachen Pendels im Falle, dass einige Wurzeln seiner charakteristischen Gleichung ein Vielfaches einer anderen sind Ⓣ(The existence of periodic motions of an n-fold pendulum in the event that some roots of its characteristic equation are a multiple of another) (1959); Periodic and asymptotic motions of compound physical pendula coupled in a vertical plane (Russian) (1963); (with George Boyadjiev) Periodic solutions of an autonomous system and their application to autogenerators with n oscillating circles (Bulgarian) (1964); (with George Boyadjiev) The periodic solutions and the stability of a quasilinear autonomous system of differential equations in the case of multiple roots of the fundamental equations (Bulgarian) (1966); (with Georgi Boyadjiev) On the periodic solutions of an autonomous system of differential equations of second order in a critical case (1970); (with Spas Manolov) On a certain algebraic condition for periodic trajectories in the case of autonomous systems of differential equations with polynomial nonlinearities of a certain class (Bulgarian) (1973); and Une condition nécessaire et suffisante pour l'existence de solutions périodiques d'un système d'équations différentielles de second ordre Ⓣ(A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of periodic solutions of a system of second-order differential equations) (1975).
* Bradistilov participated in many international conferences, in particular meetings which took place in Dresden, Edinburgh, Moscow, Kiev, Warsaw, Berlin, Milan, Budapest, Munich, lmenau, and Athens.
* In the foyer of the House there were pictures painted by Professor Bradistilov's wife, our talented artist.
* Bradistilov received many honours from his country for his outstanding contributions to science and education in Bulgaria: Honoured Scientist (1965), National Order Of Labour (1974), Order Of The Red Banner Of Labour (1959), Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius First Class (1957), Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius First Class (1963), and Order Of The People's Republic Of Bulgaria 2nd Class (1964).
* Following his death, Bradistilov was buried in Sofia central cemetery.

Born 12 October 1904, Panagyurishte, Bulgaria. Died 18 July 1977, Sofia, Bulgaria.
