**Georgi Bradistilov** was a Bulgarian mathematician who worked on nonlinear differential equations and their applications to mechanics and electrotechnics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the ‘Bradistilov Transformation’, a system of linear equations that can be used to simplify solutions to higher-order polynomial equations. 
2. Developed an algorithm to calculate the same numerical values for higher orders of the polynomial. 
3. Developed a method for designing and solving algebraic curves with rational coefficients. 
4. Devised a new approach to generating and viewing the solutions of high-dimensional polynomials. 
5. Developed a constructive proof for the Abel–Ruffini theorem, which showed that there is no general solution for polynomial equations with 5 or more terms. 
6. Developed a method for analyzing computation complexity and finding the most efficient algorithms for solving certain types of math problems.

Born 12 October 1904, Panagyurishte, Bulgaria. Died 18 July 1977, Sofia, Bulgaria.
