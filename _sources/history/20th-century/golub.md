**Gene Golub** was an Amercian mathematician who worked in numerical linear algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Golub's home was not in the Jewish area of Chicago, but he attended Haugan Elementary School which was in the Jewish area.
* In his final semester Golub had taken the Digital Computer Programming course and he was offered a position as an assistant in the computing laboratory.
* Had it not been for the Korean War, Golub may have ended his education at this point but remaining at the University of Illinois to study for a doctorate allowed him to get a draft deferment.
* Following the award of his doctorate, Golub had a number of short-term posts.
* He was invited by Eugene Isaacson to spend the year 1965-66 at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University where he was an Adjunct Assistant Professor.
* In 1980 Golub lectured on the numerical solution of large linear systems at a summer school in France.
* In 1992 Golub, jointly with James M Ortega, published Scientific computing and differential equations.
* Then in 2005, jointly with Moody T Chu, Golub published Inverse eigenvalue problems: theory, algorithms, and applications.
* The list of honours Golub received for his outstanding contributions is too long to list here.
* However, his condition got worse nevertheless, he was feeling generally unwell and in particular his legs hurt very much.
* Golub could not spend a day without other people.
* Anywhere in the world, a numerical analyst knows who is meant by 'Gene'.
* They knew that it would fall to them to do most of the writing; but Golub saw the connections, knew the literature, and made the paper happen.
* Gene Golub was restless and never entirely happy.
* He was a demanding friend; behind his back, we all had Gene stories to tell.
* It was a huge back: Gene was big, dominating any room he was in, and grew more impressive and imposing with the years.

Born 29 February 1932, Chicago, USA. Died 16 November 2007, Stanford, USA.
