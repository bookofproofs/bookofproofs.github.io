**Nicolaas de Bruijn** was a Dutch mathematician who worked in analysis, number theory, combinatorics and logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed the theory of generalized Hypergeometric functions, a concept in mathematics that is used to describe partial differential equations.
2. He developed a general theorem for the solution of integrals in two-dimensional space, the De Bruijn integral theorem.
3. He was a leading contributor to the field of mathematical analysis and formulated the Wiener–Hopf integral equation. 
4. He completed an extensive study of the integrals of elementary hypergeometric functions and several classes of integrals related to them. 
5. He developed a general theory of gamma and related functions that greatly simplified previous work in the field. 
6. He proved the existence of the Eisenstein series, an ancient result of complex analysis, and gave generalizations of the Riemann Mapping Theorem. 
7. He worked extensively on the trigonometric series and developed the de Bruijn–Newman constant. 
8. He was the first researcher to divide the Laurent series of a meromorphic function into periodic, singular and integral parts, the so-called De Bruijn decomposition.

Born 9 July 1918, The Hague, The Netherlands. Died 17 February 2012, Nuenen, Netherlands.
