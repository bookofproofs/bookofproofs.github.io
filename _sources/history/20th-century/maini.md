**Philip Maini** is an Irish mathematical biologist who works in modelling processes in biology and medicine.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the partial differential equation (PDE) model for tumor growth, which is used to assess the effectiveness of chemotherapy treatments.
2. Used mathematical techniques to explore how cancer cells can take over healthy tissue in the body.
3. Proposed the Turing instability hypothesis to define the mechanism that allows tumor cells to migrate in the body.
4. Authored several papers in the emerging field of mathematical oncology.
5. Co-authored a book on mathematical oncology featuring models and techniques used in the field.
6. Helped found the Edinburgh Mathematical Biology Group, which focuses on mathematics and its applications in biology.
7. Established mathematical models of cardiovascular physiology, which are used in the medical research industry.
8. Pioneered the use of tools such as imaging, nuclear magnetic resonance, and biochemical analysis to gain insights into biological systems.

Born 16 October 1959, Magherafelt, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
