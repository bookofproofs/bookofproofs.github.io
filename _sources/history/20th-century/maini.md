**Philip Maini** is an Irish mathematical biologist who works in modelling processes in biology and medicine.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Satya Wati and Philip's elder brother Arvind did not arrive in Northern Ireland until 1957.
* Maini attended the Rainey Endowed School, known colloquially as "The Rainey", a grammar school in the town of his birth, Magherafelt, which had been founded in 1707.
* 'Doc Gwilliam' is Alfred E Gwilliam who had joined the Rainey in around 1944 and was the Head of Mathematics when Maini began his studies.
* Let us note at this point that Maini's brother Arvind studied at the Rainey Endowed School from 1964 to 1971, then trained in medicine and became a GP in Belfast.
* After graduating from the Rainey, Maini studied mathematics at Balliol College, Oxford and was awarded a B.A. with Honours in Mathematics in 1982.
* Maini also attended the conference 'Nonlinear oscillations in biology and chemistry' held in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1985.
* In 1985 Maini was awarded a D.Phil.
* After he had completed his D.Phil., Maini was appointed as a Research assistant at the Centre for Mathematical Biology in Oxford in 1985.
* After the year teaching mathematics at Eton College, Maini returned to Oxford in 1987 where he was appointed as a Junior Research Fellow at Wolfson College.
* After spending one year in this position, Maini returned to Salt Lake City in 1988 when he was appointed as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics of the University of Utah.
* In fact Maini advised a large number of doctoral students and within ten years of Sherratt obtaining his D.Phil., at least fifteen further students advised by Maini had been awarded doctorates.
* In 1997 the paper Mathematical modeling of corneal epithelial wound healing by Maini, written in collaboration with Paul D Dale and Jonathan A Sherratt, was awarded the Bellman Prize.
* In 1998 Maini was appointed as Director of the Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology at Oxford (previously called the Centre for Mathematical Biology) and, in the same year, Titular Professor of Mathematical Biology at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford.
* Most of Maini's papers are written as multi-author works with two, three or four authors.
* In 2015 Maini was elected to the Royal Society of London.
* This was one of many honours given to Maini and we list here only a few of these.
* Also in 2017, Maini was elected to he Academy of Medical Sciences.
* Let us end with the comment that Maini lists football, travel and volunteer dog-walking as his recreations.

Born 16 October 1959, Magherafelt, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
