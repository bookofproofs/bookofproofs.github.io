**Marina Ratner** was a Russian mathematician who worked in Israel and America. She worked in ergodic theory. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Demonstrated her groundbreaking work on rigidity of orbits in homogeneous dynamical systems, which has been called a "seminal breakthrough in the field".
2. Won the Alan T. Waterman Award, the nation’s highest honor for nonmedical researchers under the age of 35.
3. Her research on homogeneous dynamics includes various arithmetical problems, and she laid the groundwork for both algebraic and geometric aspects.
4. Received the National Science Foundation’s Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1985.
5. Became a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2000.
6. Appointed to the National Academy of Sciences in 2005 for her “pioneering work on homogeneous dynamics, especially on rigidity.”
7. Won the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2009.
8. Received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2012.
9. Won the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition for her work on the Langlands programme.
10. Appointed to the National Academy of Sciences’ Mathematical Sciences Section in 2015.

Born 30 October 1938, Moscow, Russia. Died 7 July 2017, El Cerrito, California, USA.
