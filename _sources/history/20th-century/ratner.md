**Marina Ratner** was a Russian mathematician who worked in Israel and America. She worked in ergodic theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Marina grew up in Moscow where she attended school.
* After leaving school, Ratner applied to study at Moscow State University.
* Ratner graduated in 1961 having studied mathematics and physics as her main subjects.
* After graduating, Ratner worked for four years in Kolmogorov's applied statistics group and in his special school for gifted high school students.
* Of course Kolmogorov was an important influence on her during these years but a perhaps even greater influence was Yakov Grigorevich Sinai who was only three years older than Ratner and had been one of Kolmogorov's most outstanding students.
* During these years, Ratner's daughter was born.
* In 1969, after submitting her thesis Geodesic Flows on Unit Tangent Bundles of Compact Surfaces of Negative Curvature, Ratner graduated with a degree equivalent to a Ph.D. In this thesis she studied the ergodic theory of geodesic flows on negatively curved surfaces, dynamical systems with very random behaviour which arise geometrically.
* After applying for a visa to emigrate to Israel, Ratner was dismissed from her position at the Engineering School in 1970.
* At Berkeley, Ratner was promoted steadily until she reached the rank of full professor in 1982.
* Marina's much acclaimed work of the last few years - the Raghunathan conjecture - are a far-reaching generalisation and application of these ideas to an important situation.
* Marina saw that her methods were appropriate ones for this type of question, and eventually she gave a complete proof of the Raghunathan conjecture.
* Ratner was an invited plenary speaker at the congress.
* Ratner's lecture was entitled Interactions between ergodic theory, Lie groups and number theory.
* We have used quotations from awards that were given to Ratner to illustrate the importance of her mathematical contributions.

Born 30 October 1938, Moscow, Russia. Died 7 July 2017, El Cerrito, California, USA.
