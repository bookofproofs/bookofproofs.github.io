**Rimhak Ree** was a Korean-born Canadian mathematician who worked in group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new approach to the mathematical field of group theory, referred to as "Ree's Theory of Groups".
2. Wrote several books, including Introduction to Linear Algebra and The Elements of Modern Algebra, which are considered foundational works in the field of mathematics.
3. Developed the concept of a quasi-elementary group, a type of matrix group.
4. Received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics.
5. Published various groundbreaking mathematical papers on topics such as linear algebra and group theory.
6. Instituted the Ree number system, which is used in fields such as algebraic geometry and topology.
7. Contributed to the area of algebraic topology, including the development of homology theory.
8. Investigated the relationship between Lie groups and the generalized Heisenberg group.

Born 18 December 1922, Hamhung, South Hamgyong Province, Korea (now North Korea). Died 9 January 2005, Vancouver, Canada.
