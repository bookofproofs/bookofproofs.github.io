**Donald Greenspan** was expert in numerical analysis and computational modelling who wrote many books, many of which took a different approach to teaching applied mathematics using numerical methods instead of the differential and integral calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel system of interpolation and approximation theory for solving boundary-value problems.
2. Developed a robust software tool for computational mathematics, the Numerical Interpolation and Approximation Algorithm (NIAA).
3. Co-authored several papers on the properties of complex dynamics, including the theory of automorphic functions.
4. Developed an algorithm for solving elliptic differential equations called the Generalized Inverse Mapping Method.
5. Performed pioneering research in mathematical optimization and control theory, which revolutionized the field of numerical mathematics.
6. Published a highly acclaimed textbook on mathematical foundations of computer science.
7. Co-authored several papers on the numerical solution of functional equations.
8. Devised the concept of divide-and-conquer algorithms and implemented them in practice.
9. Proved a number of important results on theuse of multigrid methods in the solution of partial differential equations.
10. Developed algorithms for numerical quadrature using Clenshawâ€“Curtis formulae.

Born 24 January 1928, Brooklyn, New York, USA. Died 2 May2010, Arlington, Texas, USA.
