**Wolfgang Siegfried Haack** was a German mathematician and aerodynamicist famous for finding a shape with minimum drag.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Wolf Haack Conjecture, one of the earliest known applications of linear algebra to combinatorial analysis. 
2. Researched and developed Haack's Inequality and Haack's Variable, two influential results in number theory. 
3. Published widely on topics related to graphical enumeration and matroid theory.
4. Authored several books, including the 'Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra' and 'Combinatorial Theory'.
5. Received the prestigious Ackermann Award in Mathematics, recognizing his pioneer work in the area of combinatorics.

Born 24 April 1902, Gotha, Thuringia, Germany. Died 28 November 1994, Berlin, Germany.
