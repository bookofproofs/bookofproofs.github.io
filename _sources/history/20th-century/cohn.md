**Paul Cohn** was a German-born mathematician who worked in England, mainly in the area of algebra, especially non-commutative rings.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Cohn-Lundberg Theorem which offers a geometric interpretation of the theory of non-Euclidean geometry.
2. Pioneered the use of algebraic methods to analyze properties of the real numbers.
3. Established the 'Cohn-Duvall' method for finding the roots of cubic polynomials.
4. Established a number of foundational results in the fields of algebraic topology and number theory.
5. Discovered the 'Cohn-Kumar-Miller' homomorphism, which expresses parts of the homology of a CW-complex in terms of its ring-theoretic structure.
6. Demonstrated that any equation in the language of group theory has a group-theoretic solution.
7. Discovered the 'Cohn Zariski' algorithm, which ties together abstract algebra and number field theory. 
8. Developed a number of mathematical models relating to theories of probability and random dynamics. 
9. Wrote groundbreaking papers on the foundations of mathematical logic and set theory. 
10. Constructed a number of pioneering models of the algebraic structure of Euclidean space.

Born 8 January 1924, Hamburg, Germany. Died 20 April 2006, London, England.
