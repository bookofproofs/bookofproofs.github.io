**John Nash** was an American mathematician who won the Nobel Prize for Economics for his work in game theory. He achieved fame through the film _A Beautiful Mind_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994 for his work in game theory.
2. Co-developed the Nash equilibrium and the Nash program in game theory.
3. Published major works in the fields of mathematics including game theory, partial differential equations, and real algebraic geometry.
4. Developed the concept of governing dynamics and the Nash embedding theorem.
5. Made significant contributions to the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and the geometric theory of differential equations.
6. Known for his works on the theory of non-cooperative games and demonstrated the fundamental importance of the nonlinear equations in the theory of analysis.
7. Established the Nash bargaining solution and proposed a new concept of bargaining.
8. Provided a proof that every Riemannian manifold is isometric to a Euclidean space.

Born 13 June 1928, Bluefield, West Virginia, USA. Died 23 May2015, New Jersey, USA.
