**Alexander Buchan** was a Scottish mathematician who went on to become a lecturer at Moray House College of Education.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the modern symbolic notations used in vector calculus.
2. Pioneered the development of differential geometry.
3. Formulated an axiomatic foundation for linear algebra.
4. Advanced the theory of probability with his concept of risk aversion.
5. Discovered the false position method for solving equations.
6. Worked on the wave equation, contributing to the development of wave mechanics.
7. Developed the field of dynamical systems theory.
8. Established a fundamental link between integrals and partial differential equations.
9. Advanced the fields of functional analysis and graph theory.
10. Co-developed Hamiltonian mechanics.

Born 6 July 1904, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 10 January 1976, Edinburgh, Scotland.
