**Ernest Corominas** was a Catalan mathematician who worked in South America and ended up in France. He worked on generalised derivatives and ordered sets.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ernest Corominas was brought up in Barcelona where he entered the University of Barcelona.
* Spain was plunged into a civil war in July 1936, close to the time that Corominas graduated.
* One of these was around Barcelona where Corominas was part of the Republican defenders when the Nationalists launched an all out assault late in December 1938.
* The campaign was fought in January and February 1939 with Corominas ordered to destroy bridges to ensure that the remnants of the Republican army could escape.
* By February 1939 Corominas, together with many of his fellow soldiers and civilian refugees, had escaped to France.
* Corominas was now one of around 500,000 Spanish refugees in France but they were not welcomed there, especially the Republican soldiers.
* Corominas sailed for Chile on the SS Winnipeg from Port Trompeloup Pauillac, north of Bordeaux, on 4 August 1939.
* With Corominas and fellow Republican soldiers on board, the SS Winnipeg sailed through the Panama Canal and at that time they learnt of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union made on 23 August.
* Corominas had not had a chance to take up employment due to the Spanish Civil War.
* He had been in Barcelona when Corominas was studying at the University and they had met at this time.
* Rey Pastor offered Corominas the position of Assistant in Mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires.
* This was quite a bold move since Corominas had not had the opportunity to study mathematics any further after graduating with his first degree.
* However, strongly encouraged by Rey Pastor, Corominas spent a year at the University of Buenos Aires making good use of the library there to read advanced mathematical texts.
* Corominas now began to undertake research in mathematics and publish his results.
* Continuing to work on generalised derivatives, Corominas published On Peano's generalized derivatives (Spanish) in 1946 which improves on results obtained by Arnaud Denjoy on Peano derivatives.
* While living in Mendoza, Corominas met Maria Edith Guevara, the cousin of Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who later became a revolutionary and friend of Fidel Castro.
* Corominas was dismissed from his position but Arnaud Denjoy, who had been impressed by Corominas's papers, offered him a position at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris in 1947.
* He invited Corominas to join him at the CSIC so, in 1952, Corominas returned to Barcelona taking up a position at the CSIC.
* Once settled into his new position Corominas produced a remarkable result published in two joint papers with Ferran Sunyer i Balaguer.
* Corominas hoped that he would be able to set up a research school in Barcelona but, despite Rey Pastor's best efforts, he only ever had temporary appointments which were badly-paid.
* Hopeful that this would give him the right atmosphere for teaching and research, Corominas had accepted a position at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas.
* However, Caracas did not provide Corominas with the peace he looked for to devote himself to mathematics.
* There was a military siege of the Central University where Corominas was working.
* Corominas had no fellow mathematicians interested in the topics that he studied so, when he was offered a professorship at the Claude Bernard University of Lyon in France in 1964 he was happy to accept.
* Retirement certainly did not stop Corominas continuing to attend seminars and conferences.

Born 1 February 1913, Barcelona, Spain. Died 24 January 1992, Lyon, France.
