**Ernest Corominas** was a Catalan mathematician who worked in South America and ended up in France. He worked on generalised derivatives and ordered sets.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-authored several papers in mathematical logic and set theory in Spanish and international journals.
2. Appointed by the Spanish government to chair a commission to develop criteria for evaluating mathematics courses. 
3. Authored the book "The Absolute Arithmetic", a pioneering monograph in the development of mathematical logic in Spain.
4. Creator of the Corominas Transform, a computational method used in the fields of algebraic integration and complex analysis.
5. Developed a theoretical system for reasoning in elementary mathematics.
6. Developed a theory of integrating and counting algebraic curves.
7. Discovered a novel mechanism that could both build and update solvable systems in algebra and number theory.
8. Named professor emeritus at several Spanish universities for his contributions to the field.
9. Received accolades from several Spanish and international math institutions for his achievements.

Born 1 February 1913, Barcelona, Spain. Died 24 January 1992, Lyon, France.
