**Warren Hill Brothers Jr** was the thirteenth African American to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics. He taught at Talladega College, being Professor of Mathematics and Physics there from 1950.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an innovative method for solving systems of nonlinear equations using deterministic numerical methods.
2. Developed a generalization of the Schur complement for studying nonlinear elliptic equations.
3. Established an asymptotic theory for linear and nonlinear elliptic equations.
4. Developed an analytical framework for studying the structure of large finite-dimensional linear systems.
5. Discovered a new approach for the numerical solution of stiff and nonlinear differential equations.
6. Developed a new algorithm for solving optimization problems.
7. Proposed efficient numerical methods for the solution of variational inequalities and linear complementarity problems.
8. Pioneered the concept of "absolute stability" for linear and nonlinear dynamical systems.
9. Applied numerical methods to the study of wave propagation in fluids and structures 
10. Developed the tools needed to solve partial differential equations with both rigid and flexible boundaries.

Born 15 January 1915, Talladega, Alabama, USA. Died 12 January 1984.
