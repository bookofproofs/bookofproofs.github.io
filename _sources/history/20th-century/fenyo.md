**István Fenyő** was a Hungarian applied mathematician who worked in analysis, algebra, geometry and integral equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed series-based methods for solving and recognizing nonlinear differential equations.
2. Published on methods and techniques to solve inequalities of oscillation type, as well as periodic differential equations.
3. Established an analytical approach for solving scalar nonlinear boundary value problems expressed by partial derivatives and boundary conditions.
4. Demonstrated the occurrence of peculiar solutions in certain classes of nonlinear analytical and numerical models.
5. Extended certain parts of mathematical analysis and formulated various types of local and global inverse problems.
6. Provided a systematic and rigorous approach to the numerical solution of quasilinear Volterra integral equations.
7. Investigated the theory of singular integrals and the approximation of functions.
8. Discovered connections between variational inequalities within the context of nonconvex optimization problems.
9. Discovered a deep and robust theory of constructive mathematics.
10. Discovered connections between matrix functions and Markov processes.

Born 5 March 1917, Budapest, Hungary. Died 28 July 1987, Budapest, Hungary.
