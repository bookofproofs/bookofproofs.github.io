**István Fenyő** was a Hungarian applied mathematician who worked in analysis, algebra, geometry and integral equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* They provided an environment in which István, from a young age, was able to enjoy a wide variety of art forms as well as interesting himself in the humanities and sciences.
* In 1939 Fenyő graduated with a qualification which allowed him to teach mathematics and physics at secondary school in Hungary.
* Fenyő wrote a number of famous textbooks on applications of mathematics to chemistry and technology.
* Fenyő's Hungarian text Mathematics in electrical engineering  was written with Thomas Frey and published in two volumes, the first in 1964 with the second appearing in the following year.
* Fenyő also wrote Moderne mathematische Methoden in der Technik Ⓣ(Modern mathematical methods in technology), a three volume work published in 1967, 1971 and 1980.
* The first volume was written jointly with Thomas Frey, but the second volume was written by Fenyő alone.
* The third volume published in 1980, although still presenting methods for engineers, is more involved with one of Fenyő's main research topics, namely integral equations.
* Other books by Fenyő on integral equations are Integral equations - a book of problems (Hungarian) (1957), and the four volume work (written with H-W Stolle) Theorie und Praxis der linearen Integralgleichungen Ⓣ(Theory and practice of linear integral equations) (1982, 1983, 1983, 1984).
* The soundness of his basic culture, coupled with his innate curiosity, led István Fenyő to seek the solution of problems in various areas of mathematics.

Born 5 March 1917, Budapest, Hungary. Died 28 July 1987, Budapest, Hungary.
