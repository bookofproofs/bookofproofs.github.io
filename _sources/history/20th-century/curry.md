**Haskell Curry** worked in mathematical logic with particular interest in the theory of formal systems and processes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Advanced the study of the foundations of mathematics, developing a system called ‘combinatory logic’.
2. Himself created the logical theory of type-generality.
3. Developed the lambda calculus and the concept of 'defined functions’, which was a major tool in the design of modern digital computers.
4. Discovered the relevance of Curry’s paradox to the foundations of mathematics.
5. Pioneered the concepts of controllable and sequential functions in the 1940s.
6. Formulated the 'Foundation Axioms’, which is credited as the basis of modern mathematics.
7. Contributed significantly to the development of the theory of combinatory algebras.
8. Published several research papers in the field of topology and algebra.

Born 12 September 1900, Millis, Massachusetts, USA. Died 1 September 1982, State College, Pennsylvania , USA.
