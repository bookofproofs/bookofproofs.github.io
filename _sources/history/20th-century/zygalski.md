**Henryk Zygalski** was a Polish mathematician and cryptologist who worked at breaking German Enigma ciphers before and during World War II.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Zygalski is best known for his work on the Polish Cipher Bureau’s breaking of the Enigma code in World War II.
2. Developed a system for solving linear equations with multiple unknowns, known as the Zygalski Sheets, as an essential component of the Enigma decryptions.
3. Authored a rare mathematics textbook called Theory of Number Systems, in which he described the fundamental principles of linear algebra, algebraic systems, and applications of the algebraic method to polynomial equations.
4. Pioneered the concept of machine-assisted decryptions of ciphers, laying the foundations for the Colossus computers used in World War II.
5. Formulated the Zygalski Square, a technique that used mathematical equations to compare the encrypted and decrypted messages of the Enigma to determine the cipher.

Born 15 July 1908, Posen, German Empire (now Poznań, Poland). Died 30 August 1978, Liss, Hampshire, England.
