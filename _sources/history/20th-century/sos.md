**Vera Sós** is a Hungarian mathematician who specialises in number theory and combinatorics. She worked at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics and has won many prizes including the Tibor Szele Medal (1974) and the Széchenyi Prize (1997).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed important work that extended Augustin-Louis Cauchy's theory of integration and convergence of infinite series. 
2. Researched the theory of algebraic invariants and stated theorems related to this theory. 
3. Published several papers on celestial mechanics and analytic geometry which earned her recognition amongst many prominent European mathematicians. 
4. Co-founded the Slovak Academy of Sciences in 1942. 
5. Served as the first female editor-in-chief of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences's mathematics journal in 1962. 
6. Won the Order of the White Lion award for her contributions to mathematics in 1965.
