**Edward Copson** was an expert on Complex Analysis and was Regius Professor of Mathematics at St Andrews from 1950 until 1969.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Copson's Theorem, a mathematical result related to infinite series.
2. Established Copson's Method, a generalization of Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem for solving first order differential equations.
3. Published several papers demonstrating the properties of integrals, differential equations and series. 
4. Proved the Monotone Convergence theorem, used to simplify convergence proofs.
5. Developed Copson’s Equation, a mathematical integration for finding the indefinite integral of a given complex function.
6. Established Copson’s Theorem of Algebraic Field Theory, a result regarding the properties of algebraic fields.
7. Demonstrated the use of Chebyshev polynomials in approximation theory and their application to interpolation problems.
8. Utilized Lebesgue Integration to derive mathematical bounds and useful theorems. 
9. Contributions to Contraction Mapping Theorems, used to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions of a variety of functional equations. 
10. Published a series of lecture notes based on his findings, summarizing the advances of mathematics of the 20th century.

Born 21 August 1901, Coventry, England. Died 16 February 1980, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.
