**Roger Godement** was a French mathematician, known for his work in functional analysis and for his expository books. He was an active member of Bourbaki.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the homogeneous theory of Hilbert modular forms. 
2. Proved Hochschildâ€“Serre and Tate's local duality theorem. 
3. Proved a theorem concerning the structure of semi-simple Lie algebras.
4. Discovered a new proof for Artin's reciprocity law, the key theorem underlying class field theory. 
5. Developed the correspondance between fields of cohomology and coherent sheaves. 
6. Developed analytic continuation methods for generalising the functions of a single complex variable to several variables. 
7. Developed a representation theory of Lie Groups. 
8. Developed an abstract theory of algebraic homology. 
9. Contributed to the Weil conjectures, which concern the topology of algebraic varieties.  
10. Developed a theory for partial differential equations on Riemannian manifolds.

Born 1 October 1921, Le Havre, France. Died 21 July 2016, Paris, France.
