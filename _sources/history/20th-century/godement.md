**Roger Godement** was a French mathematician, known for his work in functional analysis and for his expository books. He was an active member of Bourbaki.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* For the first 19 years of his life Roger lived about 10 km away from the city of Le Havre.
* Godement graduated with his Agrégé de Mathématiques in 1943 and continued to undertake research at the university for his doctorate.
* Godement published three further papers in 1945, namely: Sur la presque-périodicité des fonctions spectrales Ⓣ(On the almost-periodicity of the spectral functions); Sur les fonctions de type positif Ⓣ(On the positive type functions); and Sur les propriétés ergodiques des fonctions de type positif Ⓣ(On the positive properties of ergodic type functions).
* Let us note that the "functions of positive type" that Godement was studying in these papers were members of a special class of functions defined on a Banach space of bounded, complex-valued continuous functions on a locally compact group.
* Godement defended his thesis Les fonctions de type positif et la théorie des groupes Ⓣ(The positive type functions and group theory) in Paris in July 1946.
* Following the award of his doctorate, Godement was appointed to the University of Nancy in 1946.
* Godement was married to Sonia who even attended a Bourbaki meeting.
* Godement is an exception to this, for he took a strong ethical position against the military; in particular he hated to see mathematics being used to develop weapons and other means of war.
* Godement had published nine books: Topologie Algébrique et théorie des faisceaux Ⓣ(Algebraic topology and sheaf theory) (1958); Variétés différentiables.
* On 1 October 2011, Godement celebrated his ninetieth birthday.

Born 1 October 1921, Le Havre, France. Died 21 July 2016, Paris, France.
