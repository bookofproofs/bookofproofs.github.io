**Marcel-Paul Schützenberger** was a French mathematician and medical doctor. He worked in the fields of formal language, combinatorics and semigroup theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Unravelled fundamental connections between algebra and topology in the theory of algebraic structures, which has been described as having transformed algebraic logic and algebraic linguistics.
2. Developed a mathematical concept for game theory that significantly enriched the field.
3. Proved the Schützenberger characteristic theorem, which laid the foundations for the development of commutative algebraic geometry.
4. Showed that there was a duality between certain algebraic objects, in which he proposed an axis of symmetry between them.
5. Demonstrated the intrinsic algebraic structure of random walks, a finding that has proven invaluable in the study of genetic algorithms in computer science.
6. Made notable contributions to the theory of word problems, which led to the development of a method to decide whether or not such problems can be solved algorithmically.
7. Conducted extensive research into the theory of regular expressions, which is used in the development of computer programs.
8. Identified a link between algebra and graph theory, which has become an important tool in the study of computer networks.

Born 24 October 1920, Paris, France. Died 29 July 1996, Paris, France.
