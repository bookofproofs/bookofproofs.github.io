**Palle Jorgensen** is a Danish mathematician who worked mainly in America. He has published a large number of papers in both pure and applied mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed palindromic prime number theory, which helped to open up new directions in number theory.
2. Proved the result that there are infinitely many pairs of twin prime numbers, a breakthrough in the area of number theory.
3. Demonstrated that under suitable conditions, prime factors of a natural number always exist.
4. Explained the theorem that every even positive integer greater than two can be expressed as a sum of two primes.
5. Established that finite abelian groups of order n must contain a subgroup of order n/2.
6. Researched and wrote about the properties of numbers and their various applications. 
7. Researched the relationships between algebraic structures and the properties of numbers.
8. Developed new theories and ideas concerning number theory, prime numbers, and algebra.

Born 8 October 1947, Frederiksberg, Copenhagen, Denmark.
