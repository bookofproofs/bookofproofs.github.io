**Anatoliy Skorokhod** was a Ukrainian mathematician who worked in  probability theory, stochastic processes and mathematical statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Skorokhod Representation Theorem, an important result in the theory of stochastic processes;
2. Demonstrated the importance of calculus of variations in many areas of probability theory;
3. Published several influential monographs in probability theory and its applications;
4. Constructed an operator theoretic approach to the theory of stochastic processes; 
5. Provided new insights into the Lagrange multipliers theorem for variational problems;
6. Formulated and studied advanced martingale theory and its applications;
7. Formulated and proved the convergence of random processes to uniform distribution;
8. Developed the notion of "weak solution" to obtain analytical solutions to stochastic differential equations;
9. Established new analytical techniques to attack problems of limit theorems in probability theory;
10. Pioneered the "stochastic-geometric" approach to measure theory.

Born 10 September 1930, Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine. Died 3 January 2011, Lansing, Michigan, USA.
