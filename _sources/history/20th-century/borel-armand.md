**Armand Borel** was a Swiss mathematician who worked in algebraic topology and in the theory of linear algebraic groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the landmark 1965 paper The Ubiquity of Properties of Lattices in Lie Groups, which put forth a groundbreaking result: any connected split reductive group is a product of its maximal split torus and its unipotent radical.
2. Demonstrated the existence of a Haar measure for a semisimple compact Lie group.
3. Developed the theory of supercharacters for compact Lie groups.
4. Contributed to the fields of ergodic theory, representation theory, and algebraic groups. 
5. Authored a book on algebraic groups, which focused on their geometry, covering topics such as solvable, reductive, and linear groups. 
6. Established the term “adelic groups”, which denotes a generalization of topological groups, and studies the relationship between algebra and geometry representing a global point of view in mathematics.
7. Proved Borel's Theorem, which along with Serre's Theorem resolves the so-called irrationality problem in algebraic K-theory of fields.
8. Obtained a major breakthrough in understanding the structure of unimodular groups, in particular, co-authored a paper that appeared in Inventiones Mathematicae.
9. Authored a paper that demonstrates the existence of nonarchimedean measures.
10. Co-authored a paper that links differential equations and holomorphic bundles and provided a new understanding of the geometric structure of the group of rational points of certain algebraic varieties.

Born 21 May1923, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Died 11 August 2003, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
