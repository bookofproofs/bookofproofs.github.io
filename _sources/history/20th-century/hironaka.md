**Heisuke Hironaka** is a Japanese mathematician who won a Fields Medal in 1970 for his contributions to algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* This was not an occupation he wanted but he was forced into the family business when his father (Heisuke's paternal grandfather) died while he was still a schoolboy.
* Heisuke's mother was his father's third wife.
* Heisuke's parents then had ten children of their own (six boys and four girls), so Heisuke grew up in a family of fifteen children.
* Of his parents' ten children, Heisuke was the second eldest having one older sister.
* Two of Heisuke's half-brothers were killed, one fighting against the Americans and one fighting against the Chinese.
* Heisuke's father was devastated and as a consequence sold his textile factory and gave up work.
* Heisuke attended elementary school and then middle school where he began to develop a liking for mathematics.
* The town of Yamaguchi is about 80 km from Hiroshima and on Monday, 6 August 1945, at 8.15 in the morning, Heisuke's father witnessed the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
* After middle school, Heisuke attended the boys' junior high school in Yanai.
* After a mathematics professor from Hiroshima University gave a lecture at the junior high school, Heisuke became enthusiastic and applied to study mathematics at Hiroshima University.
* By the time Hironaka entered Kyoto University in 1949, it had been integrated into a mass higher education system but had maintained its prestige.
* In his first year Hironaka studied physics, chemistry and biology.
* Yasuo Akizuki, a pioneer of modern algebra in Japan, was a major influence on Hironaka during his time at Kyoto.
* While at Harvard, Hironaka became friends with Alexander Grothendieck who spent the academic year 1958-59 there.
* He invited Hironaka to the Institut des Hautes Ã‰tudes Scientifique in Paris in 1959-60 where he found himself the only visiting fellow.
* After completing his studies at Harvard, Hironaka was appointed to the staff at Brandeis University.
* Heisuke and Wakako Hironaka had one son Jo and one daughter Eriko.
* After being on the faculty at Brandeis University, Hironaka was appointed to Columbia University, and then to Harvard in 1968.
* Hironaka gave a general solution of this problem in any dimension in 1964 in Resolution of singularities of an algebraic variety over a field of characteristic zero.
* Hironaka talked about his solution in his lecture On resolution of singularities (characteristic zero) to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm in 1962.
* In 1975 Hironaka returned to Japan where he was appointed a professor in the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences of Kyoto University.
* Throughout this book one recognizes again the importance of the preparation theorem, and one finds good introductions to the study of the advanced theory of Stein spaces, the works of A Douady, and the theory of the resolution of singularities, to which Hironaka has contributed deeply.
* Hironaka was Director of the Research Institute in Kyoto from 1983 to 1985, retiring in 1991 when he was made Professor Emeritus.
* Hironaka was invited to give one of the featured lectures on recent research advances and he spoke on Resolution of Singularities in Algebraic Geometry.

Born 9 April 1931, Yamaguchi, Japan.
