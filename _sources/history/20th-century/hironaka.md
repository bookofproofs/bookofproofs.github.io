**Heisuke Hironaka** is a Japanese mathematician who won a Fields Medal in 1970 for his contributions to algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the showing of resolution of singularities, showing how any algebraic variety could be modified by a sequence of blow ups to achieve a desirable form. 
2. Corrected the Hironaka-Atiyah-Kodaira Singularity Theory which is foundational for modern algebraic geometry.
3. Discovered the characteristic p phenomenon of by providing a proof that prime characteristic fields of analytic functions always contain Massey operations.
4. Demonstrated his work on characteristic p phenomenon to the topology field, which links it to the theory of algebraic cycles.
5. Contained an important contribution to the understanding of the monodromy conjecture, which includes proofs of theorems concerning the existence of invariant cycles.
6. Sought a new type of classification for algebraic varieties through his main theorem for stratification of canonical modules.
7. Published several papers on the theory of toroidal singularities and their resolutions, which continue to contribute to the study of toric varieties. 
8. Interested in the “decomposition theorem” in his later retirement years, which sought to find relationships between divisors, canonical divisors, and the cohomology group involved in the analysis of the given projective variety.

Born 9 April 1931, Yamaguchi, Japan.
