**Magnus Wenninger** was an American mathematician who constructed polyhedron models, and wrote books about them.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the criteria for the classification of uniform polyhedra, which was later improved upon by several mathematicians including John Norman Johnson and A.D. Alexzander.
2. Developed the concept of close-packing of equal spheres, which would become the basis of sphere-packing problems.
3. Conducted pioneering research on tilings of the plane with congruent convex polygons and on various classes of spherical polyhedra.
4. Published several books related to the mathematics of shapes and structures, including Polyhedron Models for the Classroom, Sphere Models and Amazing Mathematical Objects in Origami.
5. Developed a paper-folding model of the rhombic dodecahedron, a process which is still used today by Origami artists.
6. Coined the term "stellation" to describe the "starfaces" of a polyhedron and gave this face its Greek name, Pantacontasia.

Born 31 October 1919, Park Falls, Wisconsin, USA. Died 17 February 2017, Collegeville, Minnesota, USA.
