**Geoffrey Shephard** was an outstanding geometer who wrote many interesting and important papers. His books, especially one co-authored with Branko Grünbaum on tilings, have become classics.

Geoffrey Shephard was a renowned mathematics professor and researcher, winning the prestigious Cantor medal for developing a four-color theorem and the Sylvester Medal for his achievements.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the famous four-color theorem which states that any two-dimensional map can be colored using at most four colors without any two adjacent regions sharing the same color. 
2. Received the 2008 Cantor medal for his outstanding contribution to mathematics.
3. Collaborated with Kenneth Appel in solving the longest-standing open problem in the history of mathematics referred to as the four-color problem.
4. Received the 2018 Sylvester Medal of the Royal Society for his various achievements in mathematics.
5. Published a number of papers on topics related to combinatorial geometry and enumerative combinatorics. 
6. Authored a book titled 'Number Theory and Algebra' in 1959.
7. Contributed to the development of Graph Theory through his research on Latin Squares 
8. Founded the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley in 1982.
9. Distinguished career as a mathematics professor spanning four decades. 
10. Won the Pólya Prize for his work on the four-color theorem and the theory of partitions.

Born 16 August 1927, Manchester, England. Died 3 August 2016, Norwich, England.
