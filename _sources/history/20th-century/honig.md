**Chaim Samuel Hönig** was born in Berlin but became a Brazilian citizen. He was the founder of the Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium in 1957 and its first organiser. He was also a founder of the Brazilian Mathematical Society in 1969 and its first president.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* They moved to Germany and were living in Berlin when their first child Chaim Samuel Hönig, the subject of this biography, was born in 1926.
* Three years later, in 1929, their second child, a daughter Eugenia Hönig, was born.
* Chaim began his schooling in Germany but he explained in a 2003 interview that he did not excel in his studies at this time.
* Moisés taught Chaim basic mathematics and encouraged him by setting challenging little problems for his son to solve.
* For a Jewish boy studying in Germany at this time, life must have been extremely difficulty and this may well explain why Chaim only excelled in a subject he was taught by his father.
* The Hönig family decided to emigrate.
* Returning to Poland, or to another country bordering Germany, already looked like a bad move to the Hönigs.
* The Hönigs were fortunate in that Chaim's uncle, Don Leistner (1900-1955), had been living in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, since the 1920s so they decided to join him.
* Chaim was eleven years old and his sister Eugenia was eight when the family arrived in Brazil.
* Within three months, Chaim and Eugenia were only speaking Portuguese to each other, although for a while they still needed to speak German with their parents who took longer to learn the language.
* Hönig began his schooling in Porto Alegre in 1937, attending a Junior School until 1939.
* In fact when Hönig began his studies there in 1939 the school was named Instituto Júlio de Castilhos (named in honour of a Rio Grande do Sul politician) but, halfway through his studies, its name became Colégio Estadual Júlio de Castilhos.
* Unlike his experience in the German school system, Hönig now showed himself a brilliant student in all his subjects.
* It was through them that Chaim learned about the existence of the undergraduate course in Mathematics at the Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras of the University of São Paulo.
* Hönig was advised by the two professors who told him that if he wanted to study mathematics in Brazil, the best place was at the Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras of the University of São Paulo.
* When he passed the oral entrance examinations in Portuguese, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry for the Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras of the University of São Paulo in 1946, Hönig's parents relented and agreed to fund their son for a year at São Paulo.
* It was indeed an excellent Department containing leading international mathematicians that provided Hönig with an inspiring environment in which to study.
* He was awarded a Ph.D. in 1950 for his thesis entitled "Sôbre a medida de Lebesgue." In 1951, Hönig was appointed as Farah's assistant in Higher Analysis, becoming in charge of the exercise classes.
* Hönig had become a Brazilian citizen in 1950, something which was necessary before he could be appointed to an academic position.
* Hönig had been undertaking research for his doctorate from the time he graduated with a Licentiate in Mathematics, officially advised by Edison Farah although in practice he received most help from Leopoldo Nachbin.
* Hönig submitted his 44-page thesis Sôbre um método de refinamento de topologias Ⓣ(On a topology refinement method) and was awarded his doctorate in 1952.
* The 1951 paper is, in fact, Hönig's Ph.D. thesis in which he constructs examples of curious topological spaces.
* Cândido Lima da Silva Dias suggested that, because the teaching and research at São Paulo had been heavily influenced by members of Bourbaki, Hönig would benefit from postdoctoral studies in Paris.
* With financial support from both the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development and from the French Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Hönig was a postdoctoral fellow at the Henri Poincaré Institute in France from 1953 to 1955.
* In 1957 the series of Brazilian Mathematics Colloquia was begun by Hönig.
* By the time of the Sixth Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium held from 2 July to 22 July 1967 there had been a change in format and Hönig delivered the Improvement course Introdução às Funções de uma Variável Complexa Ⓣ(Introduction to functions of a complex variable.).
* In 1959, Leopoldo Nachbin invited Hönig to work simultaneously at the IMPA and at the Mathematics Department in São Paulo.
* In the early 1960s Hönig was told that he was no longer required as an assistant in Higher Analysis.
* Hönig spent the years from 1961 to 1964, working as a visiting professor at the Faculté des Sciences in Rennes, France.
* Hönig was leading the move to establish the Society and he was elected as the first President.
* The Society began publishing a Bulletin in 1970 and Hönig wrote the Introduction to the first part of the first volume.
* Hönig also acted as coordinator of the Mathematics Advisory Board of the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Educational Personnel), of the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico - CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) and Fundação de Amparo e Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo - FAPESP (São Paulo Research Foundation).
* We are especially grateful to Professor Chaim for his immense generosity in donating his personal collection to our library.

Born 1 February 1926, Berlin, Germany. Died 19 March 2018, São Paulo, Brazil.
