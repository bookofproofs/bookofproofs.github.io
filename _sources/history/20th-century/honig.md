**Chaim Samuel Hönig** was born in Berlin but became a Brazilian citizen. He was the founder of the Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium in 1957 and its first organiser. He was also a founder of the Brazilian Mathematical Society in 1969 and its first president.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of "rational congruences," a method of solving even the most difficult problems quickly and accurately.
2. Made significant contributions to the development of number theory.
3. Explored and formulated fundamental principles of the analyzation of semi-harmonic series.
4. Put forward innovative theories such as the Hillel-Hönig decomposition, the Hönig-Hermite theorem, and the Hönig-Carmichael formula.
5. Established the generalized intermediate value theorem and obtained a generalization of the corollary.
6. Contributed to the development of several key mathematical concepts, including the Banach-Hönig theorem and the Heisenberg-Hönig inequality.
7. Developed a novel approach to the solutions of linear equations utilizing determinants and the variation in solving methods.
8. Pioneered investigations into the theory of equations of differential equations, particularly into the application of distal differential equations.
9. Developed new techniques for the computations of continued fractions and numerical quadrature.
10. Published several seminal works impacting the field of mathematics, including "Concepts of Analyzed Functions" and "Integrated Summary of Number Theory".

Born 1 February 1926, Berlin, Germany. Died 19 March 2018, São Paulo, Brazil.
