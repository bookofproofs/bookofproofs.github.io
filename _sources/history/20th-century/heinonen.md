**Juha Heinonen** was a Finnish born mathematician who worked in America and was known for his research on geometric function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* While at high school, Heinonen was passionate about athletic pursuits, especially cross-country skiing.
* After graduating from high school, Heinonen was conscripted into the Finnish army to serve as an officer for a year.
* Heinonen entered this university to study mathematics after serving for a year in the army.
* Following the award of his doctorate, Heinonen continued to work as a research assistant for the Academy until 1988.
* The year 1988 was a remarkable year for Heinonen in terms of his publications, for no fewer than six of his publications appeared.
* In 1992 Heinonen's postdoctoral Assistant Professorship came to an end and he was appointed again as a Research Assistant in the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters.
* In 1997 both returned to Michigan and in 2000 Heinonen became a full professor at Michigan.
* Heinonen's research record was outstanding which was recognised by the award of an Alfred P Sloan Foundation Grant in 1992, and National Science Foundation Grants during 1989-1991, 1991-1993, 1994-1995, and 1996-1999.
* Heinonen published two important books: (with Olli Martio and Tero Kilpeläinen) Nonlinear Potential Theory of Degenerate Elliptic Equations (1993); and Lectures on Analysis on Metric Spaces (2001).
* In addition to these books, a 44-page pamphlet Geometric embeddings of metric spaces was published in 2003 being notes from a graduate level course Heinonen gave at the University of Jyväskylä.
* In August 2004 Heinonen lectured on Lipschitz analysis at the 14th  Jyväskylä Summer School and the notes were published in a 77-page pamphlet.
* In 2002 Heinonen gave the invited lecture The branch set of a quasiregular mapping at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Beijing.
* We have already mentioned Heinonen's love of sport and his cross-country skiing achievements while at high school.
* Heinonen died at the age of 47 'after a brief but courageous battle with kidney cancer'.
* The Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan established the Juha Heinonen Memorial Graduate Student Fellowship in his honour.

Born 23 July 1960, Toivakka, Finland. Died 30 October 2007, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.
