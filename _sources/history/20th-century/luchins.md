**Edith Luchins** was a Polish-American mathematician who applied mathematical methods to problems in the philosophy of science and psychology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Edith Hirsch was brought up in Poland for the first six years of her life then, in 1928, her family emigrated to the United States.
* While at high school Edith had taken a course on psychology taught by Abraham Samuel Luchins (born 8 March 1914), who was then a graduate student in educational psychology at New York University.
* Not only did this course give her a life-long interest in psychology but a friendship with Abraham Luchins developed and they married a few months after Edith obtained a B.A. At this time Abraham Luchins was Max Wertheimer's research assistant.
* Edith Luchins spent the year 1942-43 working as a government inspector of Antiaircraft Director at the Sperry Gyroscope Company, Long Island, as part of the war effort.
* She then studied for a Master's Degree at New York University entering in 1943 while Abraham Luchins served in the army.
* As well as undertaking research, Luchins also was appointed as an instructor in mathematics at Brooklyn College.
* A second child born in 1948 meant that she never completed her doctorate under Friedrichs and Courant for in 1949 Abraham Luchins was appointed to a post in McGill University in Montreal, Canada.
* This child, born on 1 July, was Daniel Jonathan Luchins who became a leading psychiatrist, writing works with his two parents.
* Despite having to interrupt her doctoral studies, Luchins began to publish a series of papers with her husband including: Towards Intrinsic Methods in Testing (1946), A Structural Approach to the Teaching of the Concept of Area in Intuitive Geometry (1947), The Satiation Theory of Figural After-Effects and Gestalt Principles of Perception (1953), and Variables and Functions (1954).
* The Luchins family spent five years in Montreal during which time they had two further children.
* Edith did not give up academic work despite having four children to bring up but, as indicated by the publications we noted above, worked with her husband on the psychology of mathematical education.
* In 1954 Abraham Luchins was appointed to a position at the University of Oregon and despite having four children under eight years of age, she registered for a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Oregon.
* At Oregon her thesis advisor was Bertram Yood, and Luchins submitted her thesis On Some Properties of Certain Banach Algebras in 1957.
* Luchins held faculty positions at Brooklyn College and the University of Miami before she was appointed to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, eastern New York, in 1962.
* Luchins wrote many books and papers, many jointly with her husband, and it is impossible to give more than just a brief indication of their range.
* Of course this was written by Luchins in 1979 and much has changed in the thirty years since then.
* But let us stress that the changes in attitudes today which make the piece above sound very dated are in no small part due to Luchins herself.
* Luchins received many honours for her outstanding contributions including the Rensselaer Distinguished Teaching Award, the Darrin Counseling Award, the Martin Luther King Jr Award, and the Rensselaer Alumni Association Outstanding Faculty Award.
* Edith Hirsch Luchins died at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, New York.
* Abraham Luchins died on 27 December 2005.

Born 21 December 1921, Brzeziny, Poland. Died 18 November 2002, Suffern, New York, USA.
