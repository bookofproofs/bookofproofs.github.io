**Edith Luchins** was a Polish-American mathematician who applied mathematical methods to problems in the philosophy of science and psychology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Luchins ‘water jug’ experiment which explored problem solving under the constraints of rigid rules.
2. Pioneered research in proof schemas (stages in the development of mathematical proofs among undergraduates).
3. Published numerous papers on mathematics and mathematical problem solving.
4. Investigated the effects of heuristics (rules of thumb) on problem solving.
5. Authored the book “An Experimental Manual of Mathematical Problem Solving,” introducing a wide variety of problems for exploration and creative problem solving.
6. Identified a theoretical model for mathematical problem solving.
7. Developed an influential teaching system for mathematical problem solving.
8. Developed a strategy for mathematical ideas and problem solving development dubbed ‘problem solving circle.’

Born 21 December 1921, Brzeziny, Poland. Died 18 November 2002, Suffern, New York, USA.
