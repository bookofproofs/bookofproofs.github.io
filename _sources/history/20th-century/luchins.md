**Edith Luchins** was a Polish-American mathematician who applied mathematical methods to problems in the philosophy of science and psychology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* While at high school Edith had taken a course on psychology taught by Abraham Samuel Luchins (born 8 March 1914), who was then a graduate student in educational psychology at New York University.
* Edith Luchins spent the year 1942-43 working as a government inspector of Antiaircraft Director at the Sperry Gyroscope Company, Long Island, as part of the war effort.
* She then studied for a Master's Degree at New York University entering in 1943 while Abraham Luchins served in the army.
* As well as undertaking research, Luchins also was appointed as an instructor in mathematics at Brooklyn College.
* At Oregon her thesis advisor was Bertram Yood, and Luchins submitted her thesis On Some Properties of Certain Banach Algebras in 1957.
* Luchins held faculty positions at Brooklyn College and the University of Miami before she was appointed to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, eastern New York, in 1962.
* Of course this was written by Luchins in 1979 and much has changed in the thirty years since then.
* But let us stress that the changes in attitudes today which make the piece above sound very dated are in no small part due to Luchins herself.
* Luchins received many honours for her outstanding contributions including the Rensselaer Distinguished Teaching Award, the Darrin Counseling Award, the Martin Luther King Jr Award, and the Rensselaer Alumni Association Outstanding Faculty Award.
* Edith Hirsch Luchins died at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, New York.
* Abraham Luchins died on 27 December 2005.

Born 21 December 1921, Brzeziny, Poland. Died 18 November 2002, Suffern, New York, USA.
