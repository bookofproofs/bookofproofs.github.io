**Sheila Edmonds** was an English mathematician who worked infinite series and went on to become Vice-Principal of Newnham College, Cambridge.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Although women could attend classes and take the examinations at the University of Cambridge in Edmonds' time, they could still not graduate with a degree which only became possible in 1947.
* Edmonds' doctoral thesis Some multiplication problems was completed in 1944.
* In the second of the two papers Edmonds looks at conditions under which the integral from 0 to ∞ of the product of two functions f(x)f (x)f(x) and g(x)g(x)g(x) is equal to the integral from 0 to ∞ of the product of the cosine transforms of the two functions f(x)f (x)f(x) and g(x)g(x)g(x).
* In a series of papers published over the following years Edmonds examined a whole variety of different conditions on the functions fff and ggg which give the required equalities.
* In 1957 Edmonds published Sums of powers of the natural numbers.
* Edmonds wished to give this aspect of her job 100% of her effort, so after 1957 she published no further papers.
* Edmonds made important contributions in addition to her teaching.

Born 1 April 1916, Kingston, Kent, England. Died 2 September 2002, Cambridge, England.
