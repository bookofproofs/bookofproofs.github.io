**Eugene Paul Wigner** was a Hungarian-American theoretical physicist and mathematician who won a Nobel prize for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and  elementary particles.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Wigner quasi-probability distribution which is a tool in quantum mechanics. 
2. Developed Wigner-Jordan transformation, an important tool in quantum mechanics. 
3. Received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles. 
4. Co-authored the foundational paper on symmetry principles in quantum mechanics with German mathematician, Wolfgang Pauli.
5. Pioneered the use of group theory in quantum mechanics.
6. Co-originated the Noetherâ€™s theorem, a basic law of the conservation of energy.
7. Introduced an infinite hierarchy of conservation laws motivated by the stability of atoms and molecules.
8. Formulated Wigner-Eckart theorem, a general method of coupling two angular moments.

Born 17 November 1902, Budapest, Hungary. Died 1 January 1995, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
