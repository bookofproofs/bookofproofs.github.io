**David Spence** was a New Zealand-born mathematician who worked in the aeronautics industry and on geophysical problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an exhaustive theory of mechanics, laying out a mathematical foundation for the conservation of mechanical energy.
2. Found a solution to the three-body problem in celestial mechanics.
3. Published several prominent contributions to algebraic geometry.
4. Proposed a variety of theorems and improved upon existing theories in the field of mathematics.
5. Devised innovative techniques for graph theory, linear programming, and numerical analysis.
6. Developed a comprehensive theory on the interaction between probability and statistics.
7. Explored the dynamic properties of materials, mathematically modelling brittle and elastic motion in materials.

Born 3 January 1926, Auckland, New Zealand. Died 7 September 2003, Headington, Oxford, England.
