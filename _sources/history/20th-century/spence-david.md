**David Spence** was a New Zealand-born mathematician who worked in the aeronautics industry and on geophysical problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* David grew up, attended school, and did his undergraduate work in New Zealand.
* Spence did not enter the academic world after his doctorate but went to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough.
* Spence studied a two-dimensional airfoil placed in an inviscid, incompressible, steady fluid flow, in particular a thin jet coming from its trailing edge of the airfoil.
* Obtaining equations under special conditions, Spence found numerical results for lift, pitching moment, and jet shape, which he compared with experimental results obtained from a wind tunnel.
* In 1964 Spence left the Royal Aircraft Establishment to enter the academic world.
* Spence applied his results on compression of solids to obtain a better understanding of geophysical problems.
* Spence retired from his chair at Imperial College, London, in 1991 when he reached the age of 65.

Born 3 January 1926, Auckland, New Zealand. Died 7 September 2003, Headington, Oxford, England.
