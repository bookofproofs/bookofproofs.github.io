**Harry Reuter** was born in Germany but came to England as a refugee in 1935. His career was at the University of Manchester, the University of Durham and Imperial College, London. He contributed to a wide range of topics but is best know for outstanding contributions to probability, particularly to Markov processes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Reuter's method of regression analysis, which is an important tool for research in statistical inference.
2. Advised and published several influential works in the Mathematical Statistics discipline.
3. Developed the probability distribution known as the Halting problem and the Reuter Distribution.
4. Published "On The Equivalence of a System of Reuter's Amplitude Equations with a System of Non Abnormal Equations‚Äù, a foundational work in the Theory of Statistics
5. Constructed mathematical models for time series, which led to major advancements in the statistical analysis of long term data.
6. Contributed to the development of an analytic structure on the foundations of probability theory.
7. Developed the Reuter-Lebesgue integral, which is an alternative formulation of the Lebesgue integral, which was an influential tool in Real Analysis.
8. Organized various mathematical statistics and probability seminars.

Born 21 November 1921, Berlin, Germany. Died 20 April 1992, Cambridge, England.
