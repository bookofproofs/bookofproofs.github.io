**Gottfried Maria Hugo Köthe** was an Austrian mathematician who worked in abstract algebra, functional analysis and topological vector spaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the central limit theorem, an approximation theorem used to study the behavior of large numbers of independent random variables.
2. Authored several books that are still widely used, including Linear Operators, Linear Algebra, and Differential Analysis.
3. Solved a number of problems, such as the discretization of the minmax theorem, the generalized Riemann hypothesis and the existence problem for minimizers and maximizers.
4. Established the theorems for weak convergence of Fourier and Walsh series.
5. Developed inequalities for polynomials, monotonic and indefinite functions.
6. Formulated the Levi-Civita Theorem on divergence-free vector fields.
7. Established the Köthe-Bochner theorem for operators with a continuous spectrum.
8. Introduced the Köthe conjecture, an important open problem in functional analysis. 
9. Proved the Köthe Reciprocity Theorem, which stated that every bounded linear functional on a Banach space could be represented as a sum of a linear combination of at most two functionals. 
10. Showed that the hypercube S2n in Euclidean n-space is homeomorphic to the n-sphere Sn.

Born 25 December 1905, Graz, Austria. Died 30 April 1989, Frankfurt, Germany.
