**Georges de Rham** was a Swiss mathematician, known for his contributions to differential topology and to algebraic topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a powerful approach to differential and algebraic geometry known as the De Rham cohomology.
2. Developed the De Rham-Hilbert lemma, which provides a unified approach to the study of algebraic and differential geometry.
3. Developed the Poincaré duality theorem, which connects topology and geometry of a space.
4. Published the first application of cohomology theory to the study of soluble Lie groups.
5. Developed the classical Hodge theory which combined the algebra of differential forms with the theory of harmonic functions.
6. Discovered the family of Bruhat-Tits buildings which describes the non-archimedean analytic geometry of Lie groups.
7. Isolated and proved a characterization of differentiable functions of several variables.
8. Developed the notion of "orientation" in mathematical topology.
9. Discovered the generalization of hyperbolic geometry to any number of dimensions.
10. Introduce the homology-on-manifolds theory involving the integration of calculus on manifolds.

Born 10 September 1903, Roche, Canton Vaud, Switzerland. Died 9 October 1990, Lausanne, Switzerland.
