**Wilhelm Magnus** was a German American mathematician who worked in combinatorial group theory, Lie algebras, mathematical physics, elliptic functions, and the study of tessellations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed important theorems related to group theory, algebra, topology and linear algebra.
2. Established the Magnus-Tits-Solomon Theorem, considered a breakthrough in group theory.
3. Published a research paper entitled 'On the Structure of Finite Groups' which provided a structure theorem for finitely presented groups.
4. Was one of the first mathematics to study group theory from the standpoint of topological properties.
5. Proved the important and influential theorems known as the Magnus Embedding Theorems and the Magnus Approximation Theorem.
6. Discovered the concept of infinite presentations and coined the term "action" to refer to the study of infinite presentations.
7. Helped to develop the field of homological algebra and contributed several important results to the field.
8. Authored over 50 articles detailing his research in mathematics, including a book on the theory of groups.

Born 5 February 1907, Berlin, Germany. Died 15 October 1990, New Rochelle, New York, USA.
