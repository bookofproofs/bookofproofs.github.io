**Patrick Brendan Kennedy** was an Irish mathematician who worked in complex analysis. As a young man he was an outstanding chess player.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1937 when Paddy was eight years old, after a year in Ballylongford, he did manage to achieve the transfer to Cork and, in 1941, Paddy entered the North Monastery secondary school in Cork.
* In 1946, while at the North Monastery School, Kennedy won the Honan Scholarship to University College Cork.
* Kennedy entered University College Cork in 1946 aiming at a science degree.
* In the year he graduated, Kennedy took part in the Irish Chess Championship which was held in Galway.
* Kennedy won each of the 7 rounds achieving the maximum score of 7/7.
* After graduating with a B.Sc. from Cork, Kennedy continued to study there for his Master's Degree.
* In 1951 Kennedy completed his M.Sc. studies and was examined by Vicenzo Consolato Antonino Ferraro (1902-1974) who, at that time, was professor of applied mathematics at the University College of the South West at Exeter (now the University of Exeter).
* Ferraro was particularly impressed by Kennedy's work in analysis and recommended that he study for a Ph.D. with Walter Hayman at Exeter.
* Kennedy was awarded an M.Sc. with First Class Honours from the National University of Ireland, and was awarded the Travelling Studentship in Mathematical Sciences of the National University of Ireland.
* Hayman had been appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics at Exeter in 1947 and Kennedy became his first research student.
* Paddy was a wonderful conversationalist and tremendous good company.
* Kennedy's first paper was On a conjecture of Heins which he submitted to the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society on 12 September 1953.
* Kennedy promises a further paper giving an example of a class of integral functions which shows these positive results are best possible and provides a counter-example to Heins' conjecture.
* Kennedy was appointed as an assistant lecturer in mathematics at Aberystwyth in autumn 1953.
* Some of Kennedy's papers listed below also acknowledge the same source of support.
* Paddy Barry was a research student at Cork advised by Kennedy.
* Kennedy was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Cork in 1956.
* Kennedy was the first professor of mathematics, appointed before the university opened.
* In 1965 Kennedy was appointed as External Examiner in Mathematics for the National University of Ireland.
* On the night of 8 June 1966, Kennedy took his own life in a hotel in Nottingham.
* We should say a little more about Kennedy's chess career.
* At the time of his death Kennedy was writing a book on the applications of subharmonic functions to function theory.

Born 20 July 1929, Clarecastle, County Clare, Ireland. Died 8 June 1966, Nottingham, England.
