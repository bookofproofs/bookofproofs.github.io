**Patrick Brendan Kennedy** was an Irish mathematician who worked in complex analysis. As a young man he was an outstanding chess player.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Pat and Kit Kennedy were married in 1920 and had five children: Tadhg Kennedy, Mary Anne (Nancy) Kennedy, Patrick Brendan Kennedy, Kitty Kennedy and Joan Kennedy.
* Pat Kennedy, Paddy's father, had been an apprentice carpenter in his father's firm but, despite being the eldest son, had gone against the tradition of following the family trade and he had joined the police force in 1923.
* Paddy's mother Kit was the daughter of the blacksmith Patrick O'Sullivan from near Castlemaine.
* The family moved to Ballylongford in 1936 when Pat Kennedy was stationed there.
* In 1937 when Paddy was eight years old, after a year in Ballylongford, he did manage to achieve the transfer to Cork and, in 1941, Paddy entered the North Monastery secondary school in Cork.
* In 1946, while at the North Monastery School, Kennedy won the Honan Scholarship to University College Cork.
* Kennedy entered University College Cork in 1946 aiming at a science degree.
* In the year he graduated, Kennedy took part in the Irish Chess Championship which was held in Galway.
* Kennedy won each of the 7 rounds achieving the maximum score of 7/7.
* After graduating with a B.Sc. from Cork, Kennedy continued to study there for his Master's Degree.
* In 1951 Kennedy completed his M.Sc. studies and was examined by Vicenzo Consolato Antonino Ferraro (1902-1974) who, at that time, was professor of applied mathematics at the University College of the South West at Exeter (now the University of Exeter).
* Ferraro was particularly impressed by Kennedy's work in analysis and recommended that he study for a Ph.D. with Walter Hayman at Exeter.
* Kennedy was awarded an M.Sc. with First Class Honours from the National University of Ireland, and was awarded the Travelling Studentship in Mathematical Sciences of the National University of Ireland.
* Hayman had been appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics at Exeter in 1947 and Kennedy became his first research student.
* Paddy was a wonderful conversationalist and tremendous good company.
* Kennedy's first paper was On a conjecture of Heins which he submitted to the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society on 12 September 1953.
* Kennedy promises a further paper giving an example of a class of integral functions which shows these positive results are best possible and provides a counter-example to Heins' conjecture.
* Kennedy was appointed as an assistant lecturer in mathematics at Aberystwyth in autumn 1953.
* He married Pamela Fishwick in March 1954 in Aberystwyth; they had three children, David Patrick Kennedy, Anne Deirdre Kennedy, and Jane C Deborah Kennedy.
* Some of Kennedy's papers listed below also acknowledge the same source of support.
* Paddy Barry was a research student at Cork advised by Kennedy.
* Kennedy was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Cork in 1956.
* Kennedy was the first professor of mathematics, appointed before the university opened.
* In 1965 Kennedy was appointed as External Examiner in Mathematics for the National University of Ireland.
* On the night of 8 June 1966, Kennedy took his own life in a hotel in Nottingham.
* We should say a little more about Kennedy's chess career.
* At the time of his death Kennedy was writing a book on the applications of subharmonic functions to function theory.

Born 20 July 1929, Clarecastle, County Clare, Ireland. Died 8 June 1966, Nottingham, England.
