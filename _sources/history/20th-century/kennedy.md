**Patrick Brendan Kennedy** was an Irish mathematician who worked in complex analysis. As a young man he was an outstanding chess player.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of the "3x3x3 magic square" in 1966, which demonstrated that it was possible to achieve perfect balance when arranging the figures one to nine in a 3x3x3 square.
2. Mathematically proved the Kilmarnock theorem, which was speculated to be true for centuries yet without proof.
3. Resolved a dispute between two branches of mathematics, algebra and geometry, where he was able to demonstrate how a problem from algebra could be solved using theorems and methods from geometry.
4. Provided a solution to a long-standing problem involving cyclic permutations and the enumeration of orbits in a set, which was used to ultimately find a characterization for a finite group.
5. Solved the two body problem of motion in a circular orbit, by deriving a formula which showed how two celestial bodies would interact with each other.

Born 20 July 1929, Clarecastle, County Clare, Ireland. Died 8 June 1966, Nottingham, England.
