**Edouard Zeckendorf** was a Belgian medical doctor and mathematician  best known for his work on Fibonacci numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new method for measuring volume using integral calculus as a basis.
2. Developed the Zeckendorf Representation Theorem in 1972, which describesthe unique decomposition of a positive integer into sums of distinct Fibonacci numbers.
3. Published "The Number System of Modern Mathematics", a foundational book on the structure of number theory.
4. Developed the Zeckendorf's Theorem of arithmetic, which states that every positive integer can be expressed as a sum of one or more distinct Fibonacci numbers.
5. Discovered the Zeckendorf’s Identity, the equation which allows one to calculate Fibonacci patterns from the ending digits of a number.
6. Proved theorems on the primality and divisibility of Fibonacci numbers.
7. Published the well-known equation F_n + F_n+1 + F_n+2 = F_2n+1.

Born 2 May1901, Liège, Belgium. Died 16 May1983, Liège, Belgium.
