**Edouard Zeckendorf** was a Belgian medical doctor and mathematician  best known for his work on Fibonacci numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Dr Abraham Zeckendorf was a dentist and he set up a dental practice in Liège near the end of the 19th  century.
* The city was occupied by Germany for the whole of the war so almost all of Zeckendorf's school education took place under German occupation.
* The war ended in 1918 and Zeckendorf graduated from the school in the following year following which he began his studies at the University of Liège.
* Eduourd and Elsa Zeckendorf had a major common interest.
* Zeckendorf too was keen on drawing and this was a hobby which he enjoyed whenever he had some spare time.
* Zeckendorf had another hobby, in addition to art, for he was an excellent amateur mathematician.
* This is called Zeckendorf's theorem, and the subsequence of Fibonacci numbers which add up to a given integer is called its Zeckendorf representation.
* Zeckendorf's parents fled as soon as the invasion began and they settled in Nice, France.
* By 14 May German troops had reached Liège where Zeckendorf continued to work at the hospital.
* (An 'Oflag' was an 'Officierenlager', a camp for imprisoned officers, as contrasted to a 'Stalag'.) During his captivity Dr Zeckendorf provided medical care to allied prisoners of war.
* Zeckendorf escaped from a camp, and afterwards, his status as a nonpracticing Jew was ignored by the Germans.
* Zeckendorf chose to continue his care of prisoners of war in Germany despite opportunities to return to his home.
* Zeckendorf was liberated and, after the surrender of all German troops in Belgium in early May, he was able to return to his home in Liège.
* Following the German surrender in 1945, American troops moved into the house and that was the state of affairs when Zeckendorf reached Liège.
* On 16 March 1949 Zeckendorf went to India at the head of a Belgium contingent which was part of the United Nations effort.
* This resulted in a 800 km ceasefire line between the two countries and Zeckendorf was put in charge of inspecting this ceasefire line.
* MathSciNet list 53 papers with Zeckendorf's name in the title.
* It occurs as "Zeckendorf numbers", "Zeckendorf representations", "Zeckendorf decompositions", "Zeckendorf trees", "Zeckendorf arrays", "Zeckendorf identities", and "Zeckendorf expansions".
* There are over 100 papers in which Zeckendorf's name appears in the review.
* Zeckendorf was elected as an associate member of the Societe Royale des Sciences de Liège on 20 June 1957.
* During the eighteen years of their marriage, Dr and Mrs Zeckendorf enjoyed an active life, visiting exhibits and museums, travelling and visiting cities of artistic interest, and reading.
* After his second wife's death in July 1977, Dr Zeckendorf continued his activities, even after the discovery of cancer.
