**Bob Dilworth** was an American mathematician who worked in lattice theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Caltech was to play a very important role in Dilworth's life, for it was the Institution that he was associated with for almost the whole of his career.
* At Caltech, Dilworth's doctoral studies were supervised by Morgan Ward.
* Dilworth obtained his doctorate in 1939 and was then awarded a Sterling Research fellowship to study at Yale.
* At this point Dilworth was back at Caltech and he was to remain there for the rest of his career.
* Back at Caltech, Dilworth was promoted to Associate Professor in 1945 and then full Professor in 1950.
* Let us now turn to Dilworth's research contributions.
* By the time Dilworth began his research, the motivation behind much of lattice theory was to develop methods to attack problems in group theory.
* The main topics in lattice theory to which Dilworth contributed are: Chain partitions in ordered sets, in particular his chain decomposition theorem for partially ordered sets; Uniquely complemented lattices; Lattices with unique irreducible decompositions; Modular and distributive lattices, in particular his covering theorem for modular lattices; Geometric and semimodular lattices; and Multiplicative lattices, where he studied, among other topics, abstract ideal theory, and the representation and embedding theorems for Noether lattices and rrr-lattices.
* One important aspect of Dilworth's research was that he always attacked the big problems in lattice theory.
* Let us now turn to Dilworth as a teacher.
* Teaching and examining mathematics played an important part in Dilworth's career.
* Dilworth was Chairman of this Committee from 1957 to 1961.
* In addition Dilworth served on numerous other bodies concerned with the teaching and examining of mathematics.
* Finally we should say a little about Dilworth other than his mathematical interests.

Born 2 December 1914, Hemet, California, USA. Died 29 October 1993, California, USA.
