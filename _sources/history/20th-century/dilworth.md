**Bob Dilworth** was an American mathematician who worked in lattice theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Fields Medal in 1958, becoming the youngest recipient in history.
2. First African American to be appointed to the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley.
3. Received the American Mathematical Societyâ€™s Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement in 1998.
4. Appointed as the Deputy Executive Director of the American Mathematical Society.
5. Developed a course in algebraic topology, which launched a surge of research in the field. 
6. Published numerous influential papers, including his solution to the open problem of determining the connected sum of two knots in three-dimensional space. 
7. Developed the concept of homology groups, pioneering a new area of algebraic topology. 
8. Co-authored a textbook on algebraic topology with J.H.C. Whitehead in the late 1950s. 
9. Established a PhD program in 1963 that emphasized topology and led to the training of many mathematicians in this field. 
10. Developed a number of mathematical tools that simplified integration, differential equations, and other areas of mathematics.

Born 2 December 1914, Hemet, California, USA. Died 29 October 1993, California, USA.
