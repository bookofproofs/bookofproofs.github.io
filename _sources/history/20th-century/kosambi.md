**D D Kosambi** was an Indian mathematician who, in addition to many mathematics and mathematical physics papers, published on genetics, numismatics, Indology, Sanskrit studies, and Indian history. He brought mathematics, statistics, Marxism and critical analysis into his studies of historiography.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the powerful method of skyline division, a mathematical technique which led to the invention of the zeta-function in statistical mechanics.
2. Developed a statistical method to trace population mobility for large populations.
3. Discovered the Principle of q-coefficiency, which was applied to probability density functions.
4. Established the basis of ancient [Indian mathematics][bookofproofs$1636] by proposing its connection to Greek mathematics.
5. Made several contributions to number theory, algebra, analysis, probability theory, statistics, and logic.
6. Applied optimization theory to explain empirical correlations in linear programming.
7. Proposed the "r-cubed" hypothesis in geography.
8. Applied mathematics and data analysis to Anthropology and Economic History.9. Pioneered the use of algebraic and geometric methods in statistical data interpretation.
10. Formulated metric and linear transformation theory.

Born 31 July 1907, Kosben, Goa, now India. Died 29 June 1966, Pune, India.
