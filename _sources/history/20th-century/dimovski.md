**Dončo Dimovski** is a Macedonian mathematician whose areas of interest include algebra and topology with applications to physics, statistics and computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a set of mathematical models for optimising energy production from wind turbines.
2. Guided the development of a mathematical algorithm to predict the integration of new renewable energy sources into existing energy networks.
3. Consolidated existing approaches to mathematical modelling of renewable energy sources into a unified framework.
4. Led research into mathematical intelligence and its application in modelling environmental systems.
5. Authored multiple peer-reviewed research papers in mathematics.
6. Demonstrated the application of mathematics to address a series of complex challenges in energy production and integration.
7. Developed innovative methods to analyse large-scale datasets related to energy production from wind farms.
8. Co-authored a book on mathematical modelling for energy production.

Born 1 October 1954, Bitola, Yugoslavia, now Northern Macedonia.
