**Dončo Dimovski** is a Macedonian mathematician whose areas of interest include algebra and topology with applications to physics, statistics and computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We note that when Dimovski was born, Macedonia was officially part of the People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and was one of the six republics of the Yugoslav federation.
* In was in Bitola that Dimovski completed both his primary and secondary education, graduating from the high school in 1973.
* This University had been founded in 1946 but it was almost completely destroyed in an earthquake in 1963 and so the university that Dimovski entered was a large modern one completely rebuilt after the earthquake.
* Dimovski graduated in June 1976, having competed the course in less than three years, continuing to demonstrate his outstanding abilities with an average grade of 9.48.
* At the time that he was advising Dimovski, Čupona was working on representations of universal algebras and on quasigroups.
* Dimovski's project, Additive semigroups of integers (Macedonian), was an excellent piece of work and was published in 1977 by the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts.
* In this work Dimovski studied decompositions of the semigroup of positive integers under addition.
* In January 1974 she returned to the University of Skopje and, two years later, she began supervising Dimovski's Master's Degree.
* Dimovski worked as an associate at the Institute of Mathematics in Skopje in 1976 and 1977.
* In September 1980 Dimovski enrolled in doctoral studies at the State University of New York at Binghamton, USA.
* Dimovski submitted his Ph.D. thesis Non-simply connected Casson Handles and defended this doctoral dissertation in May 1983.
* In fact, before submitting his thesis, Dimovski had published another paper, this one in English with a Macedonian summary, in 1982 entitled Some existence conditions for vector valued groups.
* Returning to Macedonia, Dimovski was appointed as an assistant professor in the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the University of Skopje in 1984.
* Dimovski was promoted to associate professor in 1989 and then, in 1994, to full professor.
* For his outstanding contributions, Dimovski was awarded the "Goce Delčev" state prize for 1989, for the research results he had obtained in the fields of value vector algebra, topology and combinatorial structures.
* Dimovski is a Member of the Union of Mathematicians of Macedonia and its Management Board, the American Mathematical Society, and the Balkan Mathematical Union and its Executive Board.

Born 1 October 1954, Bitola, Yugoslavia, now Northern Macedonia.
