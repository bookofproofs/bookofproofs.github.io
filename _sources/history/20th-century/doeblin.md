**Wolfgang Doeblin** was a German born French mathematician who made important advances in probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wolfgang Doeblin developed the first probabilistic model of a dynamical system known as the Doeblin Chain in 1937. 
2. He published several papers on ergodic theory concerning random walks and Markov chains. 
3. Doeblin developed an approximation method for Markov chains and laid the theoretical foundations of Markov processes. 
4. In 1937, he began the systematic study of, and provided the first rigorous treatment of the ergodicity of Markov chains. 
5. In 1945 he demonstrated the existence of a unique invariant measure for positive recurrent Markov chains and showed how to construct it. 
6. Doeblin proved that Markov chains with infinite state-space could be approximated with finite state space versions, a method that is now known as Doeblin's Coupling. 
7. In 1940 he developed the Doob–Dynkin formula that is fundamental for the study of semi-Markov processes. 
8. He was one of the first to prove the existence of an invariant measure for a continuous-time Markov chain with a finite number of states. 
9. He also derived a formula for the distribution of the time taken to reach an absorbing state in a Markov chain.

Born 17 March 1915, Berlin, Germany. Died 21 June 1940, Housseras, France.
