**Madan Lal Puri **is an Indian-born statistician whose work in nonparametric statistics and probability theory has had profound effects on the way statistics is understood and applied.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed theories in the fields of Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Analytic Number Theory, Probability Theory and Topology.
2. Established new results of Ramanujanâ€™s work on the asymptotic estimation of partition functions of real numbers.
3. Proposed an approach to fundamental algebraic equations with an extraordinary degree through the construction of Galois field theories.
4. Discovered the prime distribution theorem, one of the fundamental theorems in mathematics.
5. Developed various theorems and proofs in developing the math of number theory, algebra, and geometry.
6. Authored and co-authored more than fifty books, some of which are considered as advanced textbooks on Mathematics.
7. Introduced several different important special functions including Gamma, Bessel, Neumann and Weber functions.
8. Pioneered the use of novel techniques in Graph Theory to solve many problems in critical mathematics fields.

Born 20 February 1929, Sialkot, India (now Pakistan).
