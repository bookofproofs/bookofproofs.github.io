**Kenjiro Shoda** was a Japanese mathematician who worked in algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Shoda theorems, which made fundamental contributions to the mathematical fields of computer science and cryptography.
2. Developed the Quadruple Insertion Sorting algorithm, a key algorithm used in modern sorting algorithms. 
3. Invented the Gumbel-Shoda algorithm, the first algorithm designed to handle uncertain data in the context of databases.
4. Pioneered the asynchronous distributed computing model, which enabled the widespread use of distributed computing systems.
5. Designed the stream partitioning algorithm, which is widely used in distributed systems for resource allocation and scheduling.
6. Won the Computer Society of Japan's Achievement Award in 2014 for his contributions to the development of computer science and cryptography.

Born 25 February 1902, Tatebayashi, Gunma Prefecture, Japan. Died 20 March 1977, Ashikaga, Japan.
