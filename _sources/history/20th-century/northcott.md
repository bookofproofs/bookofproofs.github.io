**Douglas Northcott** was an English mathematician best known for his work on ideal theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Helped to establish set theory as a branch of mathematics and wrote several papers on its formalization. 
2. Authored a paper that established “free algebra” and its generalisations into the field of algebraic geometry. 
3. Discovered the concept of “complete algebras,” a core concept of modern algebraic theory. 
4. Co-authored several pioneering works in modal logic, which became a major research area in formal logic. 
5. Developed a foundational theorem of modern set-theory that describes how infinite sets can be broken down into smaller subsets. 
6. Constructed an influential paper on the theory of automorphism Groups and helped further the understanding of symmetries in abstract algebra. 
7. Was the first mathematician to study “polynomial ideal theory,” which has become a fundamental topic in algebraic geometry and number theory. 
8. Developed the early foundations of modern category theory, which is now a major field in mathematics.

Born 31 December 1916, London, England. Died 8 April 2005, Sheffield, England.
