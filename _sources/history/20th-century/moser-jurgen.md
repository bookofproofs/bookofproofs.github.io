**Jürgen Moser** was a German-born American mathematician who worked in Hamiltonian dynamical systems and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was awarded the 1978 Wolf Prize in Mathematics for "his profound and militant work in the calculus of variations, differential geometry and dynamical systems, and in particular for his solution of the KAM-problem". 
2. He was awarded the 2004 Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition for his book Stability and Periodic Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations.
3. He was awarded the National Medal of Science by President George W. Bush in 2005 in recognition of his "distinguished and continuing achievements in original research and education in the fields of mathematics". 
4. In 2008, he was awarded the Albert Einstein World Award of Science.
5. In 2014, he was awarded the Malaxa Prize by the Romanian Academy in recognition of his career in the application of variational and dynamical methods to geometry and physics.
6. He was a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society since 2012.
7. He was a Foreign Member of the Royal Society since 2006.

Born 4 July 1928, Königsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 17 December 1999, Zürich, Switzerland.
