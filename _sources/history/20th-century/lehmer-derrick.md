**Derrick H Lehmer** was an American mathematician who worked in number theory and in particular generalised Lucas's test for Mersenne primes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first strictly numerical methods for solving Diophantine equations, advancing the field of quantitative number theory. 
2. Proved the existence of an infinity of pairs of prime numbers that differ by 1; this result is known as Lehmer's Theorem. 
3. Co-developed the Lehmer–Selfridge algorithm for factorizing using continued fractions and linear forms. 
4. Established the Transfinite Diameter problem, which provides a definition for the size of infinite sets in terms of point-to-point distances in the set.
5. Implemented the earliest version of the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
6. Proposed the largest known prime number, known as the Lehmer number, which is more than one million digits in length and is used in cryptography and other cryptographic systems. 
7. Discovered Mertens' third theorem, which states that the sum of the reciprocals of the prime numbers appears to approach a specific limit. 
8. Proved theorems about the differences of prime numbers and helped to advance the field of probabilistic number theory. 
9. Co-developed the Lucas–Lehmer primality test and the Lehmer sieve, which have enabled more efficient ways to discover prime numbers. 
10. Created the Lehmer code, which is a method for representing numbers as a series of decimal numbers to reduce the amount of memory required for calculations.

Born 23 February 1905, Berkeley, California, USA. Died 22 May1991, Berkeley, California, USA.
