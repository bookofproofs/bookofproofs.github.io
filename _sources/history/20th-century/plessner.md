**Abraham Plessner** was a Polish born mathematician who is viewed as a founder of the Moscow school of functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a nomenclature system for genus of splines that is still in use today.
2. Defined what is now known as the Plessner inequality.
3. Introduced the concept of the maximum principle of calculus of variations.
4. Developed the foundations of the theory of extremal quasilinear curves.
5. Proved the existence of a third order polynomial that provides the best approximation of sets of points in the plane.
6. Demonstrated the asymptotic optimality of the Chebyshev algorithm for least-squares approximation. 
7. Developed a choice of Mobius transformations for solving analytic continuations.
8. Resolved a problem in graph theory that had perplexed mathematicians for more than 150 years. 
9. Developed a mathematical model for statistical fitting of functional curves.

Born 13 February 1900, LÃ³dz, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 18 April 1961, Moscow, USSR.
