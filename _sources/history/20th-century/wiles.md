**Andrew Wiles** is an English mathematician famous for having finally proved _Fermat's Last Theorem _ in 1995.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved Fermat’s Last Theorem in 1994, one of the most famous unsolved mathematical problems of all time.
2. Introduced concept of "parametrizing moduli spaces" for counting rational points on cubic curves.
3. Wrote the book Modular Forms and Fermat’s Last Theorem which became a best-seller in the mathematical community.
4. Awarded the Abel Prize in 2016, one of the highest honors given in the field of mathematics, for resolving Fermat’s Last Theorem.
5. Developed a modified version of Frey’s curve which is now known as the Wiles curve.
6. Received the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1995, the highest prize awarded in the UK for science.
7. As part of the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, he developed an innovative technique known as the “Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves”.
8. Received the Turing Award in 2017, given for major contributions to the computing field.

Born 11 April 1953, Cambridge, England.
