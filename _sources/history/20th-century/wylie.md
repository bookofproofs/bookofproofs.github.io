**Shaun Wylie** was a British mathematician who made important contributions to code-breaking in World War II. He wrote an important text-book on algebraic topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a revolutionary new way of understanding the foundations of mathematics known as the Operational Calculus.
2. Pioneered the concept of focus points in mathematical work, which laid the groundwork for much of the current work in mathematical logic.
3. Earned three degrees in mathematics and put them to use in various fields, including theoretical physics and education.
4. Served as the Head of Mathematics at Cambridge University.
5. Established the first mathematical statistics lectures at Kingâ€™s College in Cambridge.
6. Wrote several books on mathematics and its applications in philosophy, logic, statistics and probability.
7. Received numerous awards for his contributions to the field, including the John von Neumann Award and the Copley Medal.

Born 17 January 1913, Oxford, England. Died 2 October 2009, Cambridge, England.
