**Shaun Wylie** was a British mathematician who made important contributions to code-breaking in World War II. He wrote an important text-book on algebraic topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Francis Wylie had married Kathleen, the daughter of Edmond Kelly, an American lawyer living in Paris, on 18 August 1904.
* Shaun was the youngest of his parents' sons.
* Shaun was brought up in Oxford in a home often filled by American scholars who were Rhodes Scholars at the University of Oxford.
* (One of the founders was a Mr George and this led to the name 'Dragon School'.) From the Dragon School, Wylie won a scholarship to Winchester College, one of the best independent schools in England.
* The school is situated in Winchester, south west of London, and there Wylie received an outstanding secondary education.
* Wylie, however, loved mathematics and the College arranged it so that he could study both subjects.
* Wylie was able to offer both classics and mathematics for the scholarship examinations.
* Wylie was awarded a Ph.D. in 1937 for his thesis Duality and Intersection in General Complexes.
* For the year 1937-38 Wylie undertook post-doctoral research at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.
* His father had a Scottish background which qualified Wylie to play for Scotland.
* At Princeton, Wylie had met a fellow British student Alan Turing who was there during 1936-38.
* In December 1940 he wrote to Wylie and invited him to work at Bletchley Park.
* In February 1941 Wylie began to work with Turing in Hut 8 on the problem of decoding the German Enigma device.
* except for Turing, no one made a bigger contribution to the success of Hut 8 than Wylie; he was easily the best all-rounder in the section, astonishingly quick and resourceful.
* In late 1943 Wylie moved from work on decoding the German Navy Enigma messages to attacking the more demanding messages sent by Lorenz machines.
* Wylie joined the section in F Block which had been built close to Hut 11 in early 1943.
* Also in 1943 Wylie met and married Odette Murray, a Wren working at Bletchley Park.
* When the war ended Wylie took up his academic career again.
* Mathematics is not perhaps the most hilarious of subjects, but in Shaun's hands - and voice - it was pretty close.
* In 1958 Wylie returned to intelligence work when he took up an appointment as chief mathematician at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham.
* Retirement was for Wylie an opportunity to return to one of the things he enjoyed most in life, namely teaching children.
* But we should mention a few of Wylie's other interests.
* Wylie was an expert setter of crosswords and he set the crosswords in the Listener for many years.
* He used the nom-de-plume of Petti and the reader would need to have abilities like those of Wylie to even understand why.
* There is an old (15th  century) Scottish word wyliecoat which means a petticoat (an underskirt worn by women).
* Now the link Wylie - wyliecoat - petticoat - Petti become clear.

Born 17 January 1913, Oxford, England. Died 2 October 2009, Cambridge, England.
