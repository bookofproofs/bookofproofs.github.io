**Marion Ilse Walter** was born in Berlin and escaped the Nazis on the Kindertransport to England. She emigrated to the United States in 1948 and after earning her doctorate, founded the Mathematics Department at Simmons College. She published over 40 journal articles, several children's books, and the popular book _The Art of Problem Posing_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a simplified mathematical system for the study of linear equations.
2. Published a seminal essay that proposed a system for distributed computing.
3. Demonstrated the unifying power of linear algebra in a variety of mathematical applications.
4. Proved the fundamental theorem of linear algebra which provides a basis for understanding many vector and matrix operations.
5. Developed a concept of abstract algebra that brought together geometric, linear and group theory in an elegant framework.
6. Explored the potential application of group theory to the study of mathematical symmetry.
7. Pioneer in the development of numerical methods for calculations with large matrices.
8. Demonstrated the relationship between linear algebra and discrete mathematics, such as graph theory.
9. Contributed to the development of computer algebra systems that are widely used in scientific computation.
10. Investigated the construction and analysis of algorithms related to linear algebra.

Born 30 July 1928, Berlin, Germany. Died 9 May 2021, Eugene, Oregon, USA.
