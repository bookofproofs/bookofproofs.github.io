**William Gordon Welchman** was an English mathematician who played an important part in the World War II codebreaking at Bletchley Park.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. As a Cambridge mathematics scholar, Gordon Welchman designed the first secure speech scrambler which protected communications sent by General Dwight Eisenhower during World War II. 
2. He later helped to design the British Bombe machines which were used to decipher the encoded messages sent by Nazis during the war. 
3. He was given an honorary degree of Doctor of Science by Cambridge University for his important mathematical contributions. 
4. He worked on the development of SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment), a pioneering computerized air defense system.
5. Welchman's mathematical work contributed to the development of the Colossus, the first programmable electronic computer used in code breaking. 
6. He wrote the book The Hut Six Story: Breaking the Enigma Codes which was published in 1982. 
7. He pioneered the 'Universal Machine' concept, an early theoretical model of a programmable computer which helped to design the first modern computers.

Born 15 June 1906, Fishponds, near Bristol, England. Died 8 October 1985, Newburyport, Massachusetts, USA.
