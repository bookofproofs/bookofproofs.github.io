**Alexei Kostrikin** was a Russian mathematician who worked in algebra and algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1947 Kostrikin entered Saratov State University.
* Kostrikin worked with Shafarevich as a post-graduate at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and successfully submitted a candidate's dissertation (equivalent to a Ph.D.) there in 1956.
* Kostrikin joined the staff of the Steklov Institute in 1956 and continued his association with the Steklov Institute for the rest of his career.
* Kostrikin was recognized as an outstanding teacher and mentor to many young mathematicians.
* Kostrikin writes in the Foreword about his ideas on algebra and how it should be taught.
* In 1980 Kostrikin co-authored another famous textbook Linear algebra and geometry  with Yuri Ivanovich Manin.
* In the 1950's, Kostrikin's research centred on the restricted Burnside problem for groups of prime exponent.
* In the 1990's, Kostrikin discovered, with many young mathematicians, a theory of integral lattices in simple Lie algebras which are invariant under the Killing form.
* Among the honours which were given to Kostrikin for his outstanding contributions we mention the State Prize of the USSR in 1968, election to corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of USSR in 1976, the Lomonosov Prize in 1997, his invitation to address the International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm 1962 and also at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice 1970.

Born 12 February 1929, Bolshoi Morets, Yelan district, Volgograd, Russia. Died 22 September 2000, Moscow, Russia.
