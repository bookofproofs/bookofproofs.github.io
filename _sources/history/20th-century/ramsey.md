**Frank Ramsey** was an English mathematician most important for his work on the foundations of mathematics and philosophy, but best known for his so-called Ramsey theory in combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Ramsey theory, which established fundamental results in the field of combinatorics. 
2. Developed the Ramsey theorem in 1930, which provided an exact characterization of what might be called "order". 
3. Formulated the foundations of simple game theory and was the first to apply game theoretic techniques to situations in economics. 
4. Disproved the Kauffman–Lucas conjecture for two-variable polynomials and initiated research that led to the development of Hilbert’s Tenth Problem. 
5. Developed the Ramsey theory of coloring, which gives conditions sufficient to guarantee a problem can be solved. 
6. Independently discovered the Single Transferable Vote system of proportional representation. 
7. Developed a mathematical proof of the existence of economic equilibria in 1920. 
8. Developed implications of the utility theorem, emphasizing that there should be a greater consideration of risk and uncertainty.

Born 22 February 1903, Cambridge, England. Died 19 January 1930, London, England.
