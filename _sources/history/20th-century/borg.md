**Göran Borg** was a Swedish mathematician who worked in differential equation theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We note that Erik Borg (born 1943) became a famous Swedish audiologist.
* Borg was awarded his Ph.D. in 1945 for his thesis Eine Umkehrung der Sturm-Liouvilleschen Eigenwertaufgabe: Bestimmung der Differentialgleichung durch die Eigenwerte Ⓣ(A Reversal of Sturm-Liouville's Eigen Value Problem: Determination of the Differential Equation by the Eigenvalues.).
* Borg attended the Tenth Scandinavian Mathematical Congress held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in July 1946 and delivered the paper Inverse problems in the theory of characteristic values of differential systems which was published in the Proceedings of the Congress.
* In this, Borg surveyed the results of his thesis and indicated extensions to problems which are not self-adjoint.
* The publication of his thesis was not Borg's first paper, for he had published Über die Stabilität gewisser Klassen von linearen Differentialgleichungen Ⓣ(On the Stability of Certain Classes of Linear Differential Equations) in 1944.
* After the award of his doctorate, Borg was appointed as a docent at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Uppsala in 1945.
* Borg was going to the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Cambridge, Massachusetts from 30 August 30 to 6 September 1950.
* At the Congress Borg presented the paper An inversion formula to the Mathematical Physics and Applied Mathematics Section on 4 September and it was published in the Proceedings of the Congress.
* In 1953 Borg was appointed as Professor of Mathematics at the Royal Institute Technology in Stockholm.
* My advisor was Göran Borg, a former Beurling student who had made ground-breaking contributions to the inverse spectral problem for Sturm-Liouville operators.
* Borg attended the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Amsterdam from 2 September - 9 September 1954.
* This decision was endorsed by the Swedish Mathematical Society on 30 November 1958 and a joint invitation was issued to the mathematicians of the world, signed by the chairmen of the National Committee for Mathematics and the Swedish Mathematical Society, Åke Pleijel and Göran Borg repecticely.
* MathSciNet lists eleven papers by Borg, the last A condition for the existence of orbitally stable solutions of dynamical systems being published in 1960.
* Professor Göran Borg ...
* The Swedish Institute of Applied Mathematics was founded in 1971 with Borg playing an important role in forming the Institute and serving on the Board from the start.
* In particular Professors Ulf Grenander (mathematical statistics) and Göran Borg (mathematical analysis) were instrumental in the formation of the ITM.
* Borg is a member of the board of the Institute.
* The third contribution of Borg's that we wish to highlight is his role as a Board Member of the L M Ericsson Telephone Company 1972-1980.
* Göran Borg is a board member of L M Ericsson and he is also Dean of the Royal Institute of Technology here in Stockholm.
* Being a mathematician himself, Professor Borg has a good insight and knowledge of our problems and working methods.
* Borg was one of the contributors to the publication Strategier för förnyelse: kunskap som nydanare av teknik och industri Ⓣ(Strategies for renewal: knowledge as innovators of technology and industry) (Stockholm Studieförb, 1980).
* Borg was honoured with election as chairman of the Swedish Mathematical Society, serving 1957-1960, election to the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering in 1962 and being awarded the Honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by the University of Dundee, Scotland, on 12 July 1971.

Born 19 November 1913, Kumla, Närke, Sweden. Died 6 January 1997, Bromma, Stockholm, Sweden.
