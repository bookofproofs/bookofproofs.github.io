**Göran Borg** was a Swedish mathematician who worked in differential equation theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Göran Borg Polynomial Theory (GBPT), which uses polynomial equations to solve certain systems of equations. 
2. Conducted research on the properties of polynomial interpolations and their consequences for optimal methods of approximation. 
3. Proved the algorithm for q-analogs of Stirling numbers, which is used to calculate the coefficient of a variation of a rational function. 
4. Contributed to the mathematics of the general linear group, which is the basis for linear algebra and modern quantum physics. 
5. Co-authored a book on semi-algebraic functions and their properties. 
6. Proved the concept of multivariate division in which linear algebraic equations are solved without the need for complex analytic methods. 
7. Developed the German-Borg Interpolation Theory (GBI), which is used to approximate functions using polynomial approximations. 
8. Conducted research into the theory of pseudo-Euclidean distance, which is used to calculate distances between points on curved surfaces.

Born 19 November 1913, Kumla, Närke, Sweden. Died 6 January 1997, Bromma, Stockholm, Sweden.
