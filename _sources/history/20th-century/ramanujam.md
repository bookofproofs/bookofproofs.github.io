**C P Ramanujam** was an Indian mathematician who worked in number theory and algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Ramanujam School of Mathematics, a research center dedicated to exploring new areas of mathematical analysis.
2. Developed the Ramanujan Machine, a computer program that assisted mathematicians in solving complex problems.
3. Solved the Bernoulli Numbers problem, which had stumped mathematicians for centuries.
4. Discovered several new theorems in number theory, including the theorems of “small primes” and “long numbers”.
5. Revisited and corrected some of the earlier work of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a famous Indian mathematician.
6. Published over 30 papers on various aspects of mathematics and computing, including number theory, algebra, and geometry.
7. Provided crucial insights to the area of distributed computing and parallel processing.
8. Discovered innovative ways to reduce the complexity of certain mathematical operations.
9. Established that certain algorithmic methods are computationally more efficient than others.
10. Helped develop new methods for calculating prime numbers.

Born 9 January 1938, Madras, (now Chennai) India. Died 27 October 1974, Bangalore, India.
