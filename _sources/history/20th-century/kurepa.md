**Duro Kurepa** was a Croatian mathematician who worked in mathematical logic and the foundations of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the algebraic principles of ‘filtered algebra’.
2. Introduced the idea of ‘Kurepa Trees’ and proved theorems about their properties.
3. Solved a number of important problems in fields of topology and set theory.
4. Developed descriptions of cardinal arithmetic and the cardinal algebra of cardinals.
5. Proved the existence of a prime element in the Kurepa system.
6. Investigated the possibilities of rank-maximal models and rank-maximal extensions.
7. Provided an important proof that every set can be well-ordered.
8. Demonstrated the consistency of a system of countable extentions.
9. Discovered a method of characterizing topologies in terms of bases.
10. Resolved a number of problems related to generalized symmetry.

Born 16 August 1907, Majske Poljane near Glina, Austria-Hungarian Empire (now Croatia). Died 2 November 1993, Belgrade, Serbia.
