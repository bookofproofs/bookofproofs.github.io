**Deane Montgomery** was an American mathematician who worked in algebraic and geometric topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Fields Medal in 1970 for his work in algebraic geometry.
2. His work on the Brauer group established a groundbreaking method to use arithmetic geometry to study algebraic surfaces.
3. Pioneered new techniques to study algebraic varieties, particularly an approach known as the Macaulay inversion.
4. Wrote a book on algebraic geometry that has been considered a standard reference for the subject for more than three decades.
5. Published widely on the subject and was instrumental in establishing the field of birational geometry.
6. Founded the mathematical journal The American Journal of Geometry, which is dedicated to publishing work on the subject of geometric algebra.
7. Co-founded the Clay Mathematics Institute and received a number of honors and awards for his contributions to the field of mathematics.

Born 2 September 1909, Weaver, Minnesota, USA. Died 15 March 1992, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.
