**Umirzak Sultangazin** was a Kazakhstan mathematician who did excellent work on kinetic transport theory. He was an important figure in building up mathematics in Kazakhstan and was involved in the Mir and Soyuz space programmes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm allowing him to calculate sums and products of large numbers in his head 
2. Discovered a system of formulas to calculate the volume of any geometric figure 
3. Developed the idea of using different magnitudes of measurement for calculation
4. Demonstrated exceptional ability in predicting the outcome of sums and products without recourse to arithmetic
5. Created novel and innovative techniques for solving difficult arithmetic problems
6. Demonstrated a capacity for understanding the properties of space and time through his work in mathematics 
7. Constructed original solutions to mathematical problems, including solutions to three-dimensional problems with four unknowns
8. Derived innovative ways to generalize algebra and geometry to reach deeper understanding of mathematics

Born 4 October 1936, Karaoba, Sarykol district, Kostanay region, Kazakh SSR, USSR (now Kazakhstan). Died 23 May2005, Berlin, Germany.
