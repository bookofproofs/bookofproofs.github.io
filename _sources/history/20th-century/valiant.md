**Leslie Valiant** is a British American computer scientist who has made fundamental contributions to many aspects of theoretical computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning model in 1984, a breakthrough in machine learning.
2. Received the 1986 Nevanlinna Prize for his contributions to computational complexity theory.
3. Won the 2008 Turing Award for his fundamental contributions to the theory of computation and the cost of computation.
4. Was the first to bridge the theoretical gap (1974) between the principles of artificial intelligence and computational complexity theory.
5. Made significant contributions (1973) to the theory of computational learning as part of the Valiantâ€“Vazirani approach.
6. Established (1979) a computational complexity theory aimed at reconstructing the computational complexity of natural processes.
7. Awarded (2012) the National Medal of Science for his advancements in computational complexity theory.
8. Published seminal works on computational learning theory, cryptography, finite automata theory, alternating Turing machines, circuit complexity, and digital circuits.

Born 28 March 1949, Budapest, Hungary.
