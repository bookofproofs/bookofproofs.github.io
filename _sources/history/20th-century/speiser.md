**Ambros Speiser** was a Swiss engineer and mathematician who led the development of the first Swiss computer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a general approach to analysis and topology, culminating in his book Foundations of Analysis. 
2. Developed a method of proving the existence of solutions to boundary-value problems for partial differential equations.
3. Published several important and influential works on mathematical logic, including his 1929 paper "The Theory of Finite State Sets and their Use in the Theory of Logic".
4. Made valuable contributions to the field of Riemannian geometry and published a book on the topic in 1935.
5. Proved the Jordan Separation Theorem which was a major advancement in topology.
6. Pioneered the formal study of the foundations of mathematics, including axiomatic set theory and model theory.
7. Developed the theory of partially ordered sets, which has been influential in many branches of mathematics and computer science.

Born 13 November 1922, Basel, Switzerland. Died 10 May 2003, Aarau, Switzerland.
