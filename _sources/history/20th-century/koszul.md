**Jean-Louis Koszul** was a French mathematician who worked in geometry. He was a member of Bourbaki.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1) Jean-Louis Koszul contributed to the development of new branches of mathematics, particularly in homological algebra and algebraic topology.
2) He was one of the first to define and study what are now called Koszul complexes and Koszul duality, a major result in homological algebra. 
3) He also invented the Massey product, an operation in algebraic topology. 
4) He introduced and studied the Koszul brackets, a powerful tool in homological algebra, as well as being a major contribution to deformation theory. 
5) Additionally, he formulated several important theorems in geometry and the theory of Lie algebras, including the Koszul–Malgrange theorem and the fundamental theorem on the existence of 1-parameter families of Lie algebras. 
6) He also co-authored several books on geometry and algorithms, such as "Algorithmes d'Algèbre Linéaire" and "Algèbre homologique et homotopie".

Born 3 January 1921, Strasbourg, Bas-Rhin, France. Died 12 January 2018, Fontanil-Cornillon, Grenoble, France.
