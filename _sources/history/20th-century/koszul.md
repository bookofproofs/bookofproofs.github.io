**Jean-Louis Koszul** was a French mathematician who worked in geometry. He was a member of Bourbaki.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* André was a university professor in Strasbourg and his parents (Jean-Louis grandparents) were Julien Stanislas Koszul and Hélène Ludivine Rosalie Marie Salome.
* In 1947 Koszul published three papers in Comptes rendus de l'Academie des sciences.
* Koszul was appointed as Maître de Conférences at the University of Strasbourg in 1949.
* The main topics on which Koszul undertook research included: homology and cohomology of Lie algebra; relative cohomology; reductive subalgebras and the transgression theorem; the formalism of spectral sequences; "Koszul complexes"; proper and differentiable actions of Lie groups; slices; hermitian forms on complex homogeneous domains; bounded domains; locally flat manifolds; convex homogeneous domains; simplicial spaces; themes related to Gelfand-Fuks theory and supergeometry.
* In 1950 Koszul published a major 62 page paper Homologie et cohomologie des algèbres de Lie Ⓣ(Homology and cohomology of Lie algebras)  in which he studied the connections between the homology and cohomology (with real coefficients) of a compact connected Lie group GGG and purely algebraic problems on the Lie algebra associated with GGG.
* Koszul gave a lecture course in São Paulo on Faisceaux et cohomologie Ⓣ(Bundles and cohomology).
* After a number of further important publications which appeared in the proceedings of various conferences that Koszul attended such as Convegno sui Gruppi Topologici e Gruppi di Lie in Rome (1974), Symplectic geometry in Toulouse (1981), an international meeting on geometry and physics in Florence (1982), he published Introduction to symplectic geometry  in Chinese in 1986.
* Koszul was honoured with election to the Academy of Sciences in Paris on 28 January 1980.
* In 1994 a volume containing 24 articles by Koszul were published under the title Selected papers of J-L Koszul.
* The book contains a commentary by Koszul which explains the problems with which he was concerned at the time he invented what is now called the "Koszul complex".
* Among Koszul's hobbies was mountaineering and he was a member of the Club Alpin Français.

Born 3 January 1921, Strasbourg, Bas-Rhin, France. Died 12 January 2018, Fontanil-Cornillon, Grenoble, France.
