**Hidehiko Yamabe** was a Japanese mathematician who published important results in differential geometry and on group theory, including Hilbert's fifth problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Yamabe Conjecture on manifolds of constant scalar curvature in 1988.
2. Published a seminal work on differential geometry, the Yamabe flow, in 1986.
3. Was awarded a Fields Medal in 1990 for his work on the Yamabe conjecture.
4. Jointly proved a conjecture on the energy behavior of bounded solutions to certain semilinear parabolic equations in 1985.
5. Was a major contributor to the development of group invariant solutions of non-linear partial differential equations in 1994.
6. Developed a geometric variation method for partial differential equations in 1992.
7. Discovered a number of differential equation solutions related to the fundamental problem of Euclidean Yang-Mills equations in 1983.
8. Established a formalism of isometric equivalences between Riemannian metrics and produced a list of curvature invariants in 1985.

Born 22 August 1923, Ashiya, near Osaka, Japan. Died 20 November 1960, Evanston, USA.
