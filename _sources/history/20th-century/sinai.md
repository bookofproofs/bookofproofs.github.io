**Yakov Grigorevich Sinai **is a Russian mathematician known for his work on dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy (K–S entropy) which measures the complexity of a system.
2. Proved the mathematical criterion of randomness, which is now referred to as the Sinai–Lifshitz (−Kolmogorov) criterion.
3. Showed that qualitatively new effects may arise in nonlinear systems.
4. Applied mathematical approaches to statistical physics and dynamical systems.
5. Recognized the importance of chaotic behavior in deterministic dynamical systems.
6. Developed some of the foundations of ergodic theory.
7. Established the concept of a Markov partition, important to symbolic dynamics.
8. Researched mathematical methods related to exponential dichotomy, and dynamic classification of zeroLyapunov exponents.
9. Coined the term ‘dynamic billiards in non-convex domains', now an academic discipline.
10. Awarded the Nemmers Prize in Mathematics in 1998, and the Abels Prize in 2003.

Born 21 September 1935, Moscow, Russia.
