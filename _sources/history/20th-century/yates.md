**Frank Yates** was an English  statistician whose work was important in the development of the subject.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Edith and Percy Yates had five children, with Frank being the eldest with four younger sisters.
* He was educated at Wadham House, a private school where the mathematics master was both an excellent mathematician and teacher who encouraged Frank into this direction.
* By chance Yates met R A Fisher and, after applying to him for a post, he was appointed assistant statistician at Rothamsted Experimental Station in August 1931.
* When Fisher was appointed to a chair in University College London in 1933, Yates became Head of Statistics at Rothamsted.
* In 1933 Yates and his wife obtained a divorce and he married again on 14 July 1939 to Prascovie (Pauline) Tchitchkine.
* Pauline's father was Vladimir Choubersky who was a railway engineer, and like Yates she was divorced, having been married to Alexis Tchitchkine.
* Pauline died in 1976 and after this Yates married for a third time, to Ruth Hunt in 1981.
* Yates was 79 years old at the time but they still enjoyed 13 years of marriage; Ruth died in 1999.
* Yates worked on experimental design, often collaborating with Fisher.
* Yates introduced the 'continuity correction' in 1934 and published an extremely important volume of statistical tables jointly with Fisher in 1936.
* Yates' monograph on factorial design published in 1937 was another important publication.
* In a paper in the Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1939, Yates discussed the Behrens-Fisher test of the significance of the difference of means of pairs of samples independently drawn from normal populations in which the variances are not assumed to be equal.
* Yates published a major paper on Systematic sampling in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1948.
* A survey Yates wrote in 1951 on the design of experiments Quelques développements modernes dans la planification des expériences discussed topics such as: factorial experiments, including a discussion of the weighing problem; the theory of confounding in factorial experiments; fractional replications; split plot designs; balanced and partially balanced incomplete block designs; lattices; lattice squares; and quasi-Latin squares.
* In his Presidential Address Yates pointed out that, as well as making the impossible possible, computers provided speed, thoroughness and a fairly complete mechanisation of techniques for work which would previously have been done by hand.
* The last of these, Yates suggested, is particularly important for specialists such as biologists.
* Yates remarked that most of the calculations which were possible by hand calculation were still being done that way, probably because no code had been written and made available.
* Yates was an extremely good Departmental Head.

Born 12 May 1902, Manchester, England. Died 17 June 1994, Harpenden, England.
