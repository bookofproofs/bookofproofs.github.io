**Frank Yates** was an English  statistician whose work was important in the development of the subject.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made seminal contributions to the field of mathematical statistics, including the use of contingency tables and the chi-square test.
2. Developed the F-test for comparing variances of two samples.
3. Co-developed the Student's t-test, which is used to test whether two populations have the same mean value.
4. Discovered a more efficient method for fitting a straight line to a data set.
5. Developed an exact solution to the problem of obtaining the optimal quality control chart.
6. Developed the distributed lag model, a statistical technique for estimating the impact of certain variables on a particular type of data.
7. Proposed to analyse more complex mathematical models by breaking them into two simpler models and solving them separately.

Born 12 May1902, Manchester, England. Died 17 June 1994, Harpenden, England.
