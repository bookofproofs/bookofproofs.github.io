**Barry Johnson** was an English mathematician who worked on operator algebras.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Barry's mother was a secretary at Warner Brothers.
* Barry was the oldest of his parents three children, having one younger brother and a younger adopted sister.
* Johnson studied mathematics as his main subject but he was also extremely successful in his subsidiary subjects of physics and chemistry, winning a prize from the Royal Australian Chemical Institute.
* Johnson's contribution to these, as well as his penetrating and challenging (but never aggressive) questioning of views expressed in lectures left no doubt among his teachers that we were contributing in a modest way to the training of a mathematical giant.
* In order to undertake research in pure mathematics Johnson returned to England but he first taught at a grammar school in Tamworth before he began research in functional analysis at Gonville and Caius College of the University of Cambridge in October 1958.
* Johnson completed his doctorate in 1961 with a thesis Centralisers in topological algebras.
* While in the United States Johnson married Jennifer Munday in Reno.
* The newly married couple returned to England in 1963 when Johnson was appointed as a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Exeter.
* Johnson spent the year 1970-71 as a visiting professor at Yale University.
* This was during a year in which Johnson was visiting professor at the University of California at Los Angelos, at Santa Barbara, and at Berkeley.
* In 1978 Johnson was honoured by being elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London.
* Johnson served the London Mathematical Society as a member of the Council during 1975-78, then as the 60th  president of the Society in 1980-82.
* Johnson firmly believed, however, that the London Mathematical Society must remain totally non-political and that members of the Society could express their political views only as individuals.
* Johnson was a governor of the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle from 1987.
* Johnson is well known for his work on Banach algebras and operator algebras, in particular, studying cohomology in these algebras.
* In 1972 Johnson wrote a joint paper with Ringrose and Kadison on cohomology of operator algebras and in the same year his book Cohomology in Banach algebras (1972) appeared.
* We mentioned above that Johnson was President of the London Mathematical Society during 1980-82.
* Barry also liked listening to music and doing his own repairs and alterations to their house and their cottage on the Scottish borders.

Born 1 August 1937, Woolwich, London, England. Died 5 May 2002, Newcastle upon Tyne, England.
