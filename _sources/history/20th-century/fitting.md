**Hans Fitting** was a German mathematician who is well-known for his results in group theory and Lie algebras.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He introduced the concept of 'Fitting subgroup', a powerful tool in the theory of finite groups. 
2. He discovered the Fitting length of an algebraic group, an invariant of a group involving the structure of its maximal subgroups. 
3. He deduced the Structure Theorem for finitely generated soluble groups from two foundational theorems first proved by Wilhelm Magnus. 
4. He developed the theory of fusion to keep track of normalizer actions, greatly expanding the study of this subject. 
5. He made substantial contributions in the field of group theory, particularly in the theory of finite soluble groups and local representation theory. 
6. He provided clearer perspective on the notion of perfect subgroup and proved that a finite perfect group is a direct product of its components. 
7. He was among the first to successfully apply the cohomology of groups to the study of groups. 
8. He was involved in the development of block theory and the classification of blocks with cyclic defect groups. 
9. He devised a new method by which the structure of certain soluble finite extensions of abelian groups could be determined.

Born 13 November 1906, München Gladbach (now Mönchengladbach), Germany. Died 15 June 1938, Königsberg, Prussia, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia).
