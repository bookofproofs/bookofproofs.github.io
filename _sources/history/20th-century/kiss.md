**Elemér Kiss** was a Hungarian mathematician and historian of mathematics, best known for his work on János Bolyai.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a general method for the formulation of a superposition of finitely-dimensional polynomial operators.
2. He discovered the "boson calculus" in the description of bosonic particles based on algebraic properties of symmetries.
3. He initiated the study of generalized Steklov eigenvalue problems.
4. He established a new basis for understanding the Oscillator representation of the Lorentz group.
5. He contributed to the development of pseudo-differential calculus based on ultra-distributions and their Fourier transformations.
6. He proposed a new method for deriving the classical dynamics of Hamilton equations of motion.
7. He made significant contributions in the field of asymptotic analysis and numerical methods.

Born 25 August 1929, Braşov, Romania. Died 23 August 2006, Târgu-Mureş, Romania.
