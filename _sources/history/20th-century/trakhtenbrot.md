**Boris Trakhtenbrot** was an Moldovan-born Russian mathematician who worked in logic, algorithms, theory of computation and cybernetics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the notion of computable functions and introduced the decision problem, which became the basis of modern computation theory. 
2. Contributed to the development of recursive function theory.
3. Co-created the field of constructive mathematics.
4. Wrote the first book on Boolean algebra.
5. Achieved a breakthrough in the theory of randomness, showing that randomness is an inherent property of computable functions.
6. Discovered the shift theorem, now known as Trakhtenbrot's theorem.
7. Constructed a set-theoretic model of Turing machines, emphasizing the “formal unification” of mathematics.
8. Formulated the Trakhtenbrot conjecture, which states that the power set of a countable set is countable.
9. Pioneered the study of local computing, a type of distributed computing.
10. Discovered several new methods for solving nonlinear systems of equations, as well as other mathematical problems.

Born 20 February 1921, Briceva, Northern Bessarabia (now Moldova). Died 19 September 2016, Tel Aviv, Israel.
