**Mikhail Lavrent'ev** is remembered for an outstanding book on conformal mappings and he made many important contributions to that topic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made fundamental contributions to the mathematical theory of elasticity by introducing a new notion of a generalized plane strain in 1934. 
2. Was the first to introduce the technique of incremental methods in solving plane-strain problems of plane elasticity in 1934.
3. Developed the pioneering plane elasticity theory in 1937.
4. Conducted research on problems of kinematics and hydrostatics of a non-uniformly rotating fluid.
5. Proposed methods for analyzing nonlinear shell problems in the 1930s.
6. Co-developed the theory of wave propagation in isotropic and anisotropic media in 1950.
7. Developed a method of solving the equations of linear and non-linear elasticity in three-dimensional space in 1959.
8. Developed a mathematical theory for problems of rod vibrations and wave propagation in 1960.
9. Developed the theory of wave propagation in cylindrical and spherical media in 1961.
10. Developed integral identities for integro-differential equations of mechanics in the 1960s.

Born 19 November 1900, Kazan, Russia. Died 15 October 1980, Moscow, Russia.
