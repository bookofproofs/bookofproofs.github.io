**Yuri Prokhorov** was a Russian mathematician who worked in probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Several generations of the family had lived in Moscow and Yurii attended school there.
* Yurii had completed four years of schooling at this time but was unable to continue attending school since his family were evacuated to Chistopol, the second largest town in Kazan province.
* Yurii fully intending to follow his father and become an engineer so in 1944, after graduating from the high school, he entered the Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School which, since 1989, has been known as the Bauman Moscow State Technical University.
* Yushkevich's course quickly convinced Prokhorov that mathematics was the subject he loved rather than engineering.
* At the University Prokhorov took courses in analysis and number theory.
* At the same time Kolmogorov began teaching a course on probability theory which Prokhorov also attended.
* In 1960 Prokhorov succeeded Kolmogorov as Head of Department, a position he continues to hold.
* In addition, Prokhorov also lectured at Moscow State University, being appointed to the Mechanics-Mathematics Department.
* In 1967, in collaboration with Yurii A Rozanov, he published the 500-page book in Russian Probability theory: Fundamental concepts, limit theorems, random processes.
* We use a quote from one of Prokhorov's papers to give further information about the research in which he was involved at the Steklov Mathematical Institute.
* In addition to his research contributions, Prokhorov has made major contributions in his editorial work and in organising scientific activities.
* Prokhorov has received many honours for his outstanding contributions in addition to those mentioned above.

Born 15 December 1929, Moscow, Russia. Died 16 July 2013, Moscow, Russia.
