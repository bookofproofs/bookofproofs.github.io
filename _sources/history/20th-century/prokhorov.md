**Yuri Prokhorov** was a Russian mathematician who worked in probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Yushkevich's course quickly convinced Prokhorov that mathematics was the subject he loved rather than engineering.
* At the University Prokhorov took courses in analysis and number theory.
* At the same time Kolmogorov began teaching a course on probability theory which Prokhorov also attended.
* In 1960 Prokhorov succeeded Kolmogorov as Head of Department, a position he continues to hold.
* In addition, Prokhorov also lectured at Moscow State University, being appointed to the Mechanics-Mathematics Department.
* In 1967, in collaboration with Yurii A Rozanov, he published the 500-page book in Russian Probability theory: Fundamental concepts, limit theorems, random processes.
* We use a quote from one of Prokhorov's papers to give further information about the research in which he was involved at the Steklov Mathematical Institute.
* In addition to his research contributions, Prokhorov has made major contributions in his editorial work and in organising scientific activities.
* Prokhorov has received many honours for his outstanding contributions in addition to those mentioned above.

Born 15 December 1929, Moscow, Russia. Died 16 July 2013, Moscow, Russia.
