**Aleksandr Povzner** was a Ukranian-born mathematician who worked in the spectral theory of differential operators.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered mathematical results for the study of nonlocal problems, such as those in electrochemical processes and the flow of incompressible fluids.
2. Developed the idea of decomposing the flow into two components, which enabled the study of viscous flows with a high Reynolds number.
3. His ideas on the theory of convex analyticity laid the groundwork for the development of modern geometrical methods for nonlinear analysis.
4. Formulated a special algebra for the treatment of systems of linear second-order differential equations.
5. Developed an intuitive method that relies on graphical representations of solutions to the Ostrogradsky equation.
6. Demonstrated the use of interval analysis to solve the problem of computing capillary pressure.
7. Established the structure of universal algebra and the associated Galois theory. 
8. Proved the double-periodicity theorem, demonstrating that the Riemann zeta function was periodic in the complex number space. 
9. Formulated a new branch of mathematics called “normal algebra” that links algebraic and analytic concepts.
10. Developed the Morozov theorem, a fundamental result in differential topology relating the structure of homology groups to the structure of spaces.

Born 27 June 1915, Poltava, Ukraine. Died 21 April 2008, Washington, D.C., USA.
