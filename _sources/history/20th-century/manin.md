**Yuri Ivanovich Manin** was a Soviet  mathematician, known for work in algebraic geometry and diophantine geometry. He also wrote on mathematical logic, computing and theoretical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1963 Manin submitted his habilitation thesis to the Steklov Mathematical Institute and two years later, in 1965, he was appointed Professor of Algebra at Moscow State University.
* Manin presented a paper Rational surfaces and Galois cohomology  in which he gave a survey of results, mainly due to himself, on classifying rational algebraic surfaces.
* The breadth of Manin's contributions have been remarkable.
* Let us look now at some of the books that Manin has published.
* In 1984 Manin published Linear algebra and geometry in Russian, it was translated into English in 1997.
* Manin, in collaboration with A A Panchishkin, published Introduction to number theory in Russian in 1990 (English translation 1995, with a second edition in 2005).
* Other books by Manin include Cubic forms: algebra, geometry, arithmetic (Russian) (1972), A course in mathematical logic (1977), Computable and noncomputable (Russian) (1980), Quantum groups and noncommutative geometry (1988), Topics in noncommutative geometry (1991), Frobenius manifolds, quantum cohomology, and moduli spaces (1999).
* In our list above we have not mentioned Manin's fascinating book Mathematics and physics (1981).
* Manin has received, and continues to receive, many hoours for his outstanding mathematicl contributions.
* Three issues of the Moscow Mathematical Journal  where dedicated to Manin for his 65th  birthday.
* Manin has published research and expository papers in literature, linguistics, glotto-genesis, mythology, semiotics, physics, history of culture, and philosophy of science.

Born 16 February 1937, Simferopol, Crimean Autonomous Soviet Republic (now Ukraine -- occupied by Russia). Died 8 January 2023.
