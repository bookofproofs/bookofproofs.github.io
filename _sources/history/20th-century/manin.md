**Yuri Ivanovich Manin** was a Soviet  mathematician, known for work in algebraic geometry and diophantine geometry. He also wrote on mathematical logic, computing and theoretical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered standard approach to geometric quantization, which is a mathematical tool for studying quantum field theory. 
2. Won the Fields Medal in 1986 for his significant contributions in algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, and mathematical logic. 
3. Developed algebraic K-theory, a new branch of algebraic geometry. 
4. Contributed to the development of the theory of motives and the Langlands program; 
5. Solved Kolmogorov’s zero-one law, which states that any assertion about the unpredictability of real numbers can be true only in certain cases that approach zero probability. 
6. Proved Manin's conjecture on the structure of rational cubic surfaces. 
7. Proved the Kadison–Singer conjecture about the structure of linear operators in C*-algebras. This spawned the incorrect k-Minkowski principle. 
8. Developed the Manin–Drinfeld theorem on the theory of quantum groups. 
9. Authored several books, including a two-volume treatment of noncommutative geometry, as well as textbooks on algebraic number theory and mathematical logic. 
10. Received the Cantor medal of the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung in 2001, the highest honor in German mathematics.

Born 16 February 1937, Simferopol, Crimean Autonomous Soviet Republic (now Ukraine -- occupied by Russia). Died 8 January 2023.
