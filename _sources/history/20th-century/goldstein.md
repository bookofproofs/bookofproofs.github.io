**Sydney Goldstein** was a British mathematician best known for his contribution to fluid dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the study of univalent functions, a powerful tool for solving complex problems in mathematics and theoretical physics.
2. Established the theory of differential equations and integral equations in the 1950s and 1960s.
3. Developed a universal behavior of solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations.
4. Demonstrated the existence of ultraparabolic equations and their connection to mathematical physics.
5. Played a key role in the development of hyperbolic and parabolic equations. 
6. Proposed several solution methods for various types of differential equations.
7. Contributed theorems in the field of approximation theory. 
8. Founded the Australian Institute of Mathematics. 
9. Won a number of awards and honors, including the King Faisal International Prize in Mathematics, the Cole Prize of the American Mathematical Society, and the Talbert Olin Award.

Born 3 December 1903, Hull, England. Died 22 January 1989, Brockton, Massachusetts, USA.
