**John Milnor** is an American mathematician known for his work in differential topology, K-theory and dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. In 1956, he was awarded the Fields Medal for his work on differential topology.
2. He introduced the idea of ​​a shrinkable vector field and studied exotic spheres of the seven and higher dimensions.
3. He developed the concept of the Euler characteristic for differentiable manifolds and solved the seven-dimensional sphere problem.
4. He developed Morse theory, a method of studying and gaining information from the features of a real-valued function.
5. In 1962, he founded the field of K-theory with his work on the topology of objects.
6. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1966 for his work on fractional dimensions and topology.
7. He was awarded the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1989 for his work on complex dynamics.
8. He was recognised with the Abel Prize in 2011 for "his penetrating achievements in geometry and topology".

Born 20 February 1931, Orange, New Jersey, USA.
