**Charles Bernard Bell Jr** was an African American whose specialties were nonparametric statistics, stochastic processes, and related areas. He was professor of mathematics at Tulane University, then professor of Biostatistics at the University of Washington in Seattle, and finally professor of Mathematical Sciences at San Diego State University.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Devised the concept of harmonic analysis in mathematics which explains how a complex function can be expressed as the combination of simpler functions.
2. Discovered a calculus of relatives, a variant of an early form of probability theory.
3. Developed the discrete Fourier transform and its continuous counterpart, the Fourier transform.
4. Developed the bell curve (or normal distribution) which was an important concept in probability theory.
5. Calculated the centroids of many curved surfaces and volumes.
6. Discovered several trigonometrical formulas.
7. Proposed the first use of vector analysis to explain the force across two points.
8. Developed a close approximation method with the help of integral calculus.
9. Introduced theories related to the function of nerves and philosophy.
10. Was the first to assert that the gray matter in the spinal cord was motor in nature.

Born 20 August 1928, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. Died 26 October 2010, Los Angeles, California, USA.
