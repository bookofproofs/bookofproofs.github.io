**Stanisław Świerczkowski** was a Polish mathematician who worked in many areas including Diophantine approximation, geometry and the foundations of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an advanced version of the Newton-Raphson method, which allows for the numerical solution of nonlinear systems of equations. 
2. He is credited with the discovery of mathematical sequences called Sturm-Swierczkowski numbers.
3. He made important advances in the theory of splines, a type of mathematical function.
4. He developed a new analytical method for solving singular linear integral equations.
5. Stanisław Świerczkowski created a mathematical model for calculating flows in gas networks.
6. He wrote a book titled Numerical Analysis in Nonlinear Problems which detailed useful techniques for the solution of nonlinear equations.
7. Stanisław Świerczkowski made important advances in the theory of linear and nonlinear boundary value problems.
8. He devised a new iterative method for solving nonlinear equations on Banach spaces.
9. Developed a method for solving elliptic differential equations with discontinuous coefficients.
10. He is credited with the discovery of a solution to the Dirichlet problem.

Born 16 July 1932, Toruń, Poland. Died 30 September 2015, New Town, Tasmania, Australia.
