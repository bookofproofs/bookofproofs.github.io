**Brooke Benjamin** was an English mathematician who specialised in fluid mechanics and the theory of waves.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Brooke's parents recognised his brilliance before he entered primary school at Wallasey, where his teachers quickly saw his exceptional abilities.
* In 1947 Benjamin entered Liverpool University where he studied engineering but continued to occupy a large part of his time with the Liverpool University Music Society, conducting several concerts in Liverpool.
* Benjamin began working on bubbles in liquids, in particular studying how the bubbles collapse when pressure rises.
* In fact, like most of his projects, Benjamin returned to them throughout his career.
* In the Journal of Fluid Mechanics in 1995 he published the paper Verification of the Benjamin-Lighthill conjecture about steady water waves.
* In 1958 Benjamin was appointed as Assistant Director of research, a post which saw him work partly in the Engineering Department and partly in the Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics Department.
* Benjamin helped set up the fluid mechanics laboratory at Cambridge in 1964 and three years later he was promoted to Reader in Hydrodynamics.
* In 1979 Benjamin was appointed to the Sedleian Chair of Natural Philosophy a the University of Oxford.
* We have commented on one of Benjamin's early papers above.
* Benjamin received many honours for his achievements, including the Fellowship of the Royal Society referred to above.

Born 15 April 1929, Wallasey, Cheshire, England. Died 16 August 1995, Oxford, England.
