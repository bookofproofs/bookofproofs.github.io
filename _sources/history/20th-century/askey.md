**Richard Askey** was an American mathematician who worked in special functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of orthogonal polynomials and their applications (including the theory of harmonic functions and two-point boundary value problems, the Askey-Wilson polynomials, and the theory of continued fractions).
2. Discovered several identities for special functions that are used in more complex applications of mathematical analysis.
3. Pioneered research on the asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials and the computational aspects of special function theory.
4. Edited several collections of mathematical literature, including The Collected Works of Carl Gustav Jacobi and The Collected Works of Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev.
5. Developed the concept of hypergeometric functions, which have applications in probability theory and theoretical physics.
6. Worked on the theory of quasi-orthogonal polynomials and its applications to differential equations and elliptic curves.
7. Authored several books, including A Treatise on Orthogonal Polynomials, Orthogonal Polynomials and Special Functions, and Asymptotics and Special Functions.

Born 4 June 1933, St Louis, Missouri, USA. Died 9 October 2019, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.
