**Zygmunt Wilhelm Birnbaum** was a Polish-born American mathematician and statistician who contributed to functional analysis, nonparametric testing and estimation, probability inequalities, survival distributions, competing risks, and reliability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the "Normal Binomial Distribution" which allowed for the analysis of large sets of data with many unique values.
2. Pioneered the use of relatively large sample sizes (over 600) in studies of probability.
3. Introduced a fundamental concept in probability theory, called the "binomial theorem," which is essential to understanding modern probability models.
4. Conducted the first mathematical study of the effects of mean values on variance.
5. Developed a computer simulation of the "Central Limit Theorem" which established the averaging out of large numbers of independent variables.
6. Developed a new method for calculating probability in large data sets, called the "Significance Test," which is used extensively in the contemporary practice of statistics.
7. Established innovative methods of calculating confidence levels through the use of "chebyshev's inequality."
8. Developed the "coconut theorem," which provides a mathematical explanation of maximum-likelihood estimation.
9. Pioneered statistical methods of analyzing trends, and wrote a book on the subject which is still widely used today.
10. Developed "Monte Carlo Simulation," a method of stochastic simulations which are used to model complex systems.

Born 18 October 1903, Lemberg, Austrian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 15 December 2000, Seattle, USA.
