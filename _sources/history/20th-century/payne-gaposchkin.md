**Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin** was a British mathematician and astronomer who did important work for her Ph.D. at Radcliffe College of Harvard University. She showed that stars were composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium but, although completely correct, it was rejected by astronomers at the time.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Payne-Gaposchkin was the first to correctly identify that stars were composed primarily of hydrogen and helium.
2. She was the first to determine the true composition of the universe from astronomical data.
3. Payne-Gaposchkin was the first woman to become a Department Head at Harvard College Observatory.
4. She developed a mathematical system for classifying stars according to their temperatures.
5. Payne-Gaposchkin calculated the amount of energy generated in a given amount of time by a star of a certain temperature.
6. She developed the concept of ‘standard’ stars, which made it possible to compare large amounts of data and calculate distances in space.
7. Payne-Gaposchkin proposed a method of measuring interstellar extinction, which is an estimate of how much a star's light is dimmed as it passes through space.
8. She expanded and refined the accuracy of existing stellar structure models.
9. Payne-Gaposchkin wrote several books on astrophysics and stellar evolution, displaying her knowledge of mathematics.
10. Payne-Gaposchkin was the first person to calculate how stars generate energy from nuclear fusion.

Born 10 May1900, Wendover, England. Died 7 December 1979, Tewksbury, Massachusetts, USA.
