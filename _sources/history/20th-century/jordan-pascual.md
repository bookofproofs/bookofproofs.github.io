**Pascual Jordan** was a German scientist who worked in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new approach to quantum mechanics that eventually became known as the Jordan-Schwinger transformation.
2. Developed the eigenvalue problem of non-negative matrices, which was important in the development of quantum mechanics.
3. Published the first paper on the mathematical theory of relativity.
4. Co-authored a paper on the use of matrices to calculate probability amplitudes.
5. Helped formulate the probability theory of quantum mechanics.
6. Developed Jordan algebras, a mathematical tool to study quantum mechanics.
7. Approximated solutions to the Schrodinger equation and introduced the delta potential. 
8. Described a new concept of quantum fields, which led to the modern field theory. 
9. Made significant contributions in group theory, including the Jordan-H\"older theorem.
10. Established basic principles for the relativistic theory of the electron.

Born 18 October 1902, Hannover, Germany. Died 31 July 1980, Hamburg, West Germany.
