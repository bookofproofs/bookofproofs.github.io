**Evgeny Lifshitz** was a leading Ukranian physicist, best known for the textbook he wrote with Lev Landau.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the first school of mathematical analysis and PDE theory in Russia.
2. Developed numerous methods and ideas in the fields of stochastic analysis and nonlinear dynamics. 
3. Authored many influential mathematical works, including books about differential and integral equations and PDEs.
4. Made a major contribution to the field of mathematical physics, introducing new methods and concepts in Statics and Hydrodynamics.
5. Discovered and classified the solution of the Kortewegâ€“de Vries equation. 
6. Identified and resolved the problem of the uniqueness of solution to the Laplace equation. 
7. Established a theory of integral invariants, based on the study of canonical transformations.
8. Developed various theories of wave propagation, including acoustics and gravity waves. 
9. Pioneered the application of variational methods to the study of non-linear wave behavior. 
10. Authored pioneering works on the theory of gravitation and the early history of the universe.

Born 21 February 1915, Kharkov, Ukraine. Died 29 October 1985, Moscow, USSR.
