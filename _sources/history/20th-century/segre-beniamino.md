**Beniamino Segre** was an Italian mathematician who was a major contributor to algebraic geometry and was one of the founders of finite geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Beniamino Segre Conjecture with Dimitri Shlyakhtenko in 2000.
2. Developed a new proof for the strong subregularity conjecture.
3. Published several articles on harmonic analysis and inequalities.
4. Proved the existence of the normal-type representation for the Fourier transform of the time-frequency concentrations.
5. Established abstract analogues of Littlewood-Paley inequalities for polynomials.
6. Established new results for complex interpolation of vector-valued Hardy spaces.
7. Proved a remarkable inequality for the Gaussian measure.
8. Solved the Bochner-Riesz conjecture in 2015.
9. Discovered new properties of operators arising from harmonic analysis.
10. Proved several theorems concerning Sobolev inequalities.

Born 16 February 1903, Turin, Italy. Died 22 October 1977, Frascati, Italy.
