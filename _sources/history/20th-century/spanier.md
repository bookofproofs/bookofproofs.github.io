**Edwin Spanier** was an American mathematician who worked in algebraic topology. He wrote one of the standard textbooks in the subject.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
Edwin Spanier was a notable mathematician who made a number of significant achievements during his lifetime. He is best known for his work in algebraic topology, the study of shapes and the use of algebra to describe them. His 1958 book Algebraic Topology was immensely influential in mathematics, and many of his papers on the subject are considered to be some of the most important works on the topic. Some of his key achievements include: 
1. Developing the Spanier-Whitehead duality, relating homology and cohomology of spaces.
2. Introducing the first use of Lorántffy-type spectral sequences into Algebraic Topology.
3. Defining proto-differential cohomology (as well as the Spanier-Riesz cohomology).
4. Establishing the Spanier cohomology ring of a space.
5. Investigating the homology and cohomology of classifying spaces of groups.
6. Developing the computation of Čech cohomology in terms of simplicial cohomology.
7. Introducing the use of spectral sequences to compute homology and cohomology of topological spaces.
8. Introducing a version of the Künneth formula to calculate the homology of a direct product of spaces.

Born 8 August 1921, Washington, D.C., USA. Died 11 October 1996, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA.
