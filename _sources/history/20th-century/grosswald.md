**Emil Grosswald** was a Romanian mathematician who worked mainly in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the first 20 cases of the Ramanujan-Grosswald formula.
2. Developed the Grosswald-Henrici method for computing complex integrals. 
3. Published the book Topics in Number Theory which provided the cornerstone for modern Number Theory research.
4. Developed the theory in Concrete Mathematics which formalized the theory of partitions.
5. Contributed to the solution and generalization of the Gauss circle problem.
6. Solved the first and second cases of the Grosswald-Klein theorem on partitions of non-negative integers. 
7. Established the theory of lattice-based cryptography.
8. Discovered the Gel'fond-Grosswald-Linnik theorem.
9. Pioneered concepts in modular forms, the geometry of numbers, and inverse problems in number theory.
10. Developed the theory of finite fields, with applications in coding theory and cryptography.

Born 15 December 1912, Bucharest, Romania. Died 11 April 1989, Narberth, Pennsylvania, USA.
