**Emil Grosswald** was a Romanian mathematician who worked mainly in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The rise of anti-Semitism in Romania and the horror of the Nazi policies in Germany towards the Jews made Grosswald decide to France to further his education.
* From Spain Grosswald found a boat which took him to Cuba.
* Grosswald's first post was at the University of Saskatchewan where he taught for a year, then he spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton before returning to a permanent post at the University of Pennsylvania.
* An analyst, specializing in analytic number theory, Grosswald also wrote on classical analysis and related topics.
* For the second edition of the text published in 1984, Grosswald had added material on LLL-functions and primes in arithmetic progressions, the arithmetic of number fields, and Diophantine equations.
* In Bessel polynomials  Grosswald studies: the relationship between Bessel functions and Bessel polynomials, differential equations and differential recurrence relations satisfied by the generalized Bessel polynomials, recurrence relations satisfied by the generalized Bessel polynomials, orthogonality properties of the generalized Bessel polynomials and the corresponding moment problem, relations of the generalized Bessel polynomials and the classical orthogonal polynomials, generating functions, Rodrigues-type formulas, the generalized Bessel polynomials and continued fractions, the zeros of the Bessel polynomials, algebraic properties of the Bessel polynomials, and the Galois group of the Bessel polynomials.
* The collaboration between Rademacher and Grosswald on Dedekind sums  came about due to Rademacher's illness.
* Grosswald was asked to deliver the lectures in his place and Rademacher asked Grosswald to edit the notes with a view to publishing them under their joint names.
* We should mention some other contributions that Grosswald made.
* Grosswald's wife, Elizabeth Rosenthal, died exactly one month after her husband.

Born 15 December 1912, Bucharest, Romania. Died 11 April 1989, Narberth, Pennsylvania, USA.
