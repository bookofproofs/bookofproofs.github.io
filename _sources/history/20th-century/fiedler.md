**Miroslav Fiedler** was a Czech mathematician who worked in linear algebra, graph theory and algebraic graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneering research in the areas of algebraic curves, algebraic surfaces and complex projective geometry.
2. Development of notions of limit linear series and adjoint linear systems.
3. Proved the Mordell-Fiedler conjecture which provided a more general geometric description of curves with rational points.
4. Pioneering work on the geometric theory of algebraic curves, which provided a deeper understanding of the relationships between a given curve and its associated algebraic structures.
5. Co-authored the book “Algebraic Geometry” in 1996.
6. President of the European Mathematical Society from 1995-1997.
7. Received the Czech Fermi Award in 1998.

Born 7 April 1926, Prague, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic). Died 20 November 2015, Prague, Czech Republic.
