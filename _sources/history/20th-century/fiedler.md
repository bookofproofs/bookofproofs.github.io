**Miroslav Fiedler** was a Czech mathematician who worked in linear algebra, graph theory and algebraic graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After graduating from high school in 1945, Fiedler entered the Charles University of Prague to study mathematics and physics.
* For this thesis, which contained generalizations of Bydzovsky's results, Fiedler was awarded the degree of RNDr (rerum naturalium doctor) in 1950.
* Following the award of the RNDr, Fiedler undertook research at the Central Institute of Mathematics in Prague.
* At this time the Central Institute of Mathematics in which Fiedler was undertaking research became part of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.
* Fiedler was already undertaking research supervised by Eduard Cech when the new degree was introduced and he became one of the first to be awarded the degree in 1955 for his thesis Geometry of the simplex.
* Over the next few years Fiedler's research activities were remarkable not only for the depth of the results he achieved but also for the diverse areas of mathematics in which he worked.
* Fiedler's impressive contributions soon gained him an international reputation and he was given invitations to lecture at many conferences and also to make longer research visits to several universities.
* The above quoted appreciation mentions Fiedler's six books.
* Many of Fiedler's results published over the years 1985-2000 were collected together in the book Linear optimization problems with inexact data (2006) which he co-authored with Josef Nedoma, Jaroslav Ramik, Jiri Rohn and Karel Zimmermann.
* Fiedler has received many honours for his contributions.
* Fiedler has also been awarded, jointly with Vlastimil Pt√°k, the National Prize of the Czech Republic in 1978.
* Fiedler was elected an honorary member of the Union of Czechoslovak Mathematicians and Physicists in 1985, received the Bernard Bolzano Gold Medal from the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in 1986, and the De Scientia et Humanitate Optime Meritis of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic in 2006, this being the highest medal of the Academy.

Born 7 April 1926, Prague, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic). Died 20 November 2015, Prague, Czech Republic.
