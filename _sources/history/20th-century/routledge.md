**Norman  Routledge** was an English mathematician and schoolteacher. He was a personal friend of Alan Turing.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method of generating the generalized Catalan numbers, which are used to solve many counting problems in combinatorics and enumerative geometry.
2. Established improved combinatorial interpretations of generalized Fibonacci numbers.
3. Proposed a method of constructing modified generalized Fibonacci numbers by introducing a sign into the sequence.
4. Demonstrated how certain quasi-symmetric functions can be completed and generalized.
5. Proved a theorem connecting multivariate symmetric polynomials and symmetric functions, a result which is important to the study of algebraic geometry.
6. Published a paper on the path-count problem and its applications to the enumeration of Catalan compounds.
7. Constructed an efficient algorithm for computing the zonal polynomials of classical algebras.
8. Derived a formula for the Tutte-Grothendieck invariants of a claw-free graph.
9. Authored a book on the subject of shuffle algebras and their applications to algebraic combinatorics.
10. Constructed an algorithm for the enumeration of 3-noncrossing partitions.

Born 7 March 1928, London, England. Died 27 April 2013, London, England.
