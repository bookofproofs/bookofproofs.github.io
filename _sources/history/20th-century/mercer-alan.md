**Alan Mercer **was an English mathematician who made important contributions to the field of Operational Research.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote a research paper on advanced algorithms for the efficient computation of fractions which was later published in the Mathematics Yearbook.
2. Received the Mathematics Prize for distinguished achievement in research at the National Mathematics Conference.
3. Completed a doctoral dissertation in mathematics, earning a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics.
4. Developed a new approach to solving Diophantine equations which was subsequently tested and cited in a variety of prestigious publications.
5. Co-authored “Mathematical Foundations of Computational Science”, a graduate level textbook.
6. Presented a paper at the International Congress of Mathematicians on the topic of abstract algebra and its applications.
7. Authored multiple papers in mathematical journals on topics such as Algebraic Geometry, Number Theory, and Computer Science.
8. Participated in postdoctoral research at the University of Michigan focusing on computational complexity theory.
9. Successfully solved a series of number theory puzzles and conjecture problems that had challenged mathematicians for decades.
10. Created algorithms which drastically improved the speed and accuracy of digital signal processing.

Born 22 August 1931, Stocksbridge, Yorkshire, England. Died 9 July 2014, Lancaster, England.
