**Richard Borcherds** is a South African born mathematician known for his work in lattices, group theory and infinite-dimensional algebras, for which he was awarded the Fields Medal in 1998.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He won a Fields Medal in 1998 for his work in arithmetic algebraic geometry, vertex operator algebras, finite groups and hyperbolic reflection groups.
2. He was awarded the Von Neumann Prize in 2019 for his work in producing a constant expansion formula for the 26-dimensions of the Monster group.
3. He was the first person to discover the Borcherds product, a kind of generalized infinite product introduced to the theory of automorphic forms.
4. He introduced the notion of vertex algebras, which can be seen as a generalization of vertex operators.
5. He is also credited for his work in the theory of buildings which form a key concept in theoretical physics.
6. He was also the first person to prove the uniqueness of some modular forms.
7. He developed ideas to determine the structure of some Kac-Moody Lie algebras.
8. He has solved two long-standing conjectures known as 'moonshine conjectures' which were associated with the finite simple groups.

Born 29 November 1959, Cape Town, South Africa.
