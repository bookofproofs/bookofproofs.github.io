**Richard Borcherds** is a South African born mathematician known for his work in lattices, group theory and infinite-dimensional algebras, for which he was awarded the Fields Medal in 1998.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After the award of an M.Sc. and Ph.D. in physics, Peter Borcherds became a lecturer in physics at the University of Cape Town.
* Peter and Margaret had four children; two of Richard's three brothers went on to become mathematics teachers, Michael Borcherds being particularly well known as the lead developer of the mathematics teaching package GeoGebra.
* When Richard was about a year old his parents left South Africa and went to Aldermaston in England.
* Peter Borcherds went on to became a lecturer in physics at Birmingham University; Peter's particular interests are the use of computers in physics and the involvement of scientists in politics.
* Richard attended King Edward's School in Birmingham.
* Borcherds entered Trinity College, Cambridge where he was an undergraduate.
* Borcherds had been appointed as a Research Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1983 and held this post until 1987.
* Borcherds invented the notion of a vertex algebra and used it to solve the Conway-Norton conjecture, which concerns the representation theory of the monster group (this theory is sometimes called "monstrous moonshine").
* Borcherds's work is also important in physics, as it lays rigorous groundwork for conformal field theory in two dimensions.
* Borcherds remained as a Royal Society University Research Fellow at Cambridge until 1992, and then spent the following year as a lecturer at Cambridge.
* In 1992 Borcherds was awarded a Junior Whitehead Prize by the London Mathematical Society.
* Borcherds has made a number of important and original contributions to mathematics, with striking and surprising applications.
* Another important concept invented by Borcherds is that of a 'vertex operator algebra'.
* In a marvellous synthesis of the ideas which he has been developing, Borcherds has proved conjectures of Conway and Norton on the 'Moonshine' module for the Monster group.
* for his contributions to algebra, the theory of automorphic forms, and mathematical physics, including the introduction of vertex algebras and Borcherds' Lie Algebras, the proof of the Conway-Norton moonshine conjecture and the discovery of a new class of automorphic infinite products.
* Borcherds is married to the topologist Ursula Gritsch and has two daughters.

Born 29 November 1959, Cape Town, South Africa.
