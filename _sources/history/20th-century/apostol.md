### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published 9 books on calculus, which have become a standard reference in high-level education. 
2. Developed the modern geometric interpretation of the Multiplication Theorem of Calculus.
3. Ratified theorems related to the Euler-Maclaurin Formula.
4. Originated the notion of principal kinematic pairs.
5. Co-authored five other mathematical texts, including "Theory and Problems of Calculus" and "Mathematics: Calculator-Based Laboratory Manual".
6. Authored the "Apostol Calculus" column for the Mathematical Association of America.
7. Created a series of lecture notes and seminars on advanced mathematics.
8. Developed the field of applied mathematical analysis.
