Pioneering **Kathleen Booth** developed the first assembly language, co-invented the Booth multiplier and linking loader, and co-commercialized the first compiler.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first assembly language, allowing computers to process math problems at record speed.
2. Formulated the concept of an index register in reference to an efficient and economical method of addressing memory.
3. Pioneered the development of software for automated sorting and facial recognition, leading to the widespread production of computers.
4. Helped produce the Autocoder – a programming language which enabled computers to economically render and process information. 
5. Led a team in the development and publication of ‘Programming Techniques’ – the first book providing a comprehensive overview of programming languages.
6. Co-invented and implemented the linking loader, improving on the existing programming, problem resolution, and solution methods for computers.
7. Co-invented and commercialized the first compiler which enabled symbolic programming in computers and led to wider access to computer technology. 
8. Worked collaboratively to build the first high-level computer programming language.

Born 9 July 1922, Stourbridge, Worcestershire, England. Died 29 September 2022, Sooke, Vancouver Island, Canada.
