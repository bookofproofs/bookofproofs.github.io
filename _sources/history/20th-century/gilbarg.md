**David Gilbarg** was an American mathematician who worked in fluid dynamics and nonlinear partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Artin became Gilbarg's thesis advisor and, after undertaking research in algebra, Gilbarg was awarded his doctorate in 1941 for his thesis on algebraic number theory On the structure of the group of p-adic 1-units.
* In 1949 Gilbarg published A generalization of the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation, and A characterization of non-isentropic irrotational flows.
* For many mathematicians, Gilbarg is best known for his remarkable book Elliptic Partial Differential Equations of Second Order written in collaboration with Neil Trudinger and published in 1977.
* Trudinger had written his Ph.D. thesis at Stanford University advised by Gilbarg.
* Sadly Gilbarg could not share this award as he died seven years earlier.
* My topics were Sobolev spaces and their application to linear elliptic PDE, and we decided to start by blending these with earlier notes of Dave Gilbarg on the Schauder theory.
* During an eleven year period when Gilbarg was Chairman of the Stanford Department of Mathematics, namely 1959-1970, appointments were made to the Department including Paul Cohen, Lars HÃ¶rmander, Kunichiro Kodaira, Donald Ornstein, Ralph Phillips, Hans Samelson, and Donald Spencer.
* Particularly warm tributes were paid by former PhD students, citing Gilbarg's ability to convey a love of mathematics, his unstinting support, his encouragement in development of not only their general mathematical skills but also the ability to recognize and use the important key ideas within a field, and his insistence on exactness and clarity in their writing.

Born 17 September 1918, Boston, Massachussets, USA. Died 20 April 2001, Palo Alto, California, USA.
