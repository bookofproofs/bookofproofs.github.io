**Fred Hoyle** was an English astronomer best known for his espousal of the "steady-state" theory of the universe and rejecting the "big bang" theory. He also wrote science fiction.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the steady state model of an expanding universe.
2. Developed the concept of stellar nucleosynthesis, demonstrating how the chemical elements were created in stars.
3. Worked on calculations related to genetics and immunology.
4. Pioneered the use of statistical methods in astronomy as applied in the determination of galactic star distribution.
5. Constructed a model of stellar nebulae.
6. Developed an understanding of the thermonuclear origin of the energy sources in stars.
7. Conducted research into the structure of electron shells in atoms.
8. Developed mathematical models to describe the expansion of the universe.
9. Formulated a hypothesis of radiobiology. 
10. Investigated the mathematical properties of spinning black holes.

Born 24 June 1915, Bingley, Yorkshire, England. Died 20 August 2001, Bournemouth, England.
