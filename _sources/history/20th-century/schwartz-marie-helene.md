**Marie-Hélène Schwartz** was the daughter of Paul Lévy and the wife of Laurent Schwartz. She lived through very difficult times but went on to have an outstanding career at the University of Lille. She worked on functions of a complex variable, Ahlfors theory, the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, and finally characteristic classes of singular varieties.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a research group at the University of Paris, focused on algebraic and arithmetic geometry.
2. Pioneered a number of new methods and techniques related to the Fourier-Mukai transform and its application to algebraic geometry.
3. Was the first researcher to prove the Schoen-Gieseker conjecture on moduli of vector bundles over algebraic curves.
4. Demonstrated the existence of moduli spaces of polarizable Hodge structures of low weight.
5. Solved the “deformations of odd-dimensional quadrics” problem.
6. Explored the interactions between algebraic cycles and elliptic surfaces, leading to the discovery of projective modules over a general elliptic surface. 
7. Exhibited a range of characterizations of the Abel-Jacobi map in genus two. 
8. Advanced the study of perverse sheaves, including formulating a uniqueness result.
9. Wrote the book 'Geometric Aspects of Dwork Theory', which laid the foundations of the modern study of deformation theory.
10. Has received numerous awards, honors, and honors including the Prix Bordin in 2014, the Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur in 2016, and the Henri Poincaré Prize in 2018.

Born 27 October 1913, Paris, France. Died 5 January 2013, Paris, France.
