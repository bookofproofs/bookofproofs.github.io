**Wilhelm Cauer** was a German mathematician and physicist who is best known for his work on the analysis and synthesis of electrical filters.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first theoretical basis for the synthesis of passive linear networks, known as Cauer’s Synthesis and which is now a fundamental tool in electrical engineering. 
2. Introduced two original designs of two-terminal filters based on the synthesized networks, which is the prototype of today’s filters. 
3. Discovered an important theorem when studying symmetrical filters, now known as Cauer’s Rule. 
4. Developed novel methods and insights into the synthesis, analysis, and design of various electrical filters, oscillators and pulse-shaping circuits. 
5. Developed the theory of δ-operator networks, also known as bi-rational transfer functions, which is important in mathematical analysis of electric systems.
6. Developed the circuit theory of equivalence, which is used to represent complicated circuits of resistors, capacitors and inductors by a single electric impedance.

Born 24 June 1900, Berlin, Germany. Died 22 April 1945, Berlin, Germany.
