**John Todd** graduated from Cambridge and stayed on to do research under Baker. After a period at Manchester and Princeton he returned to Cambridge where he spent the rest of his career. He worked on invariant theory, group theory and canonical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* John Todd was educated at Liverpool Collegiate School and, having sat the scholarship examination for Cambridge, he was awarded an entrance scholarship to Trinity College.
* After graduation Todd remained at Trinity to study for his doctorate in geometry under H F Baker's supervision.
* After an impressive prize winning record Todd hoped for a Research Fellowship at Trinity but he failed in three attempts, on one occasion losing out to Coxeter who won the Fellowship.
* Disappointed at his failure to win the Fellowship, Todd left Cambridge and accepted Mordell's offer of an assistant lectureship at the University of Manchester in 1931.
* An important year for Todd's mathematical development was the session 1933-34 which he spent at Princeton on a Rockefeller Scholarship.
* Lefschetz proved the major influence on Todd during this year in the United States, and this broadened Todd's geometrical interests beyond the classical approach he had learnt under Baker.
* In until 1937 Todd was appointed a lecturer at Cambridge.
* Todd and Hodge began to change the geometry at Cambridge to areas that were then of great interest internationally.
* Sadly, by the time peace had returned and progress could recommence, Todd was no longer a young reformer.
* In 1948 Todd had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and, given his long association with Trinity College, it seemed inconceivable that he would not be elected a Fellow of the College.
* Despite strong backing by mathematicians in the College, Todd failed to on a number of occasions to be elected.
* By 1958 disillusioned with his treatment by Trinity, Todd went to Downing College.
* Every well-equipped College should have a John Todd and we were privileged to have had him and to have enjoyed his company.
* Todd was a superb technician and manipulator of formulae but he also brought to bear a keen appreciation of the underlying geometry.
* Todd generalised the arithmetic genus and the invariants of the canonical system on an algebraic variety to a system of invariants of every codimension.
* This work is the origin of the Todd genus and Todd polynomials which were named after him.
* Todd polynomials, and certain other closely related polynomials, are much studied today and have played a major role in the study and classification of manifolds.
* In group theory Todd provided, certainly according to Coxeter, the main contribution to their joint work on the Todd-Coxeter procedure which they published in 1936.
* The Todd-Coxeter procedure became the most fundamental idea in the development of computational group theory yet the authors found difficulty in getting their paper published.
* It was at a British Mathematical Colloquium (Todd attended the Colloquium for each one of its first 25 years) where Todd talked on Mathieu groups, a subject to which he made considerable contributions.
* Some young research students in the audience heckled Todd, presumably they considered his mathematics old fashioned.

Born 23 August 1908, Liverpool, England. Died 22 December 1994, Croydon, England.
