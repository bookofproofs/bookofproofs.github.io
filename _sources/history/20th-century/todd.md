**John Todd** graduated from Cambridge and stayed on to do research under Baker. After a period at Manchester and Princeton he returned to Cambridge where he spent the rest of his career. He worked on invariant theory, group theory and canonical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Todd-Coxeter Algorithm which enables the efficient calculation of Automatic Equivalences of Groups.
2. Published his highly acclaimed work, Lectures on Mathematics, which outlines the fundamentals of mathematics and includes topics from algebra to differential equations.
3. Proposed the Univalent Foundations of Mathematics, a formal axiomatic system for mathematics which improves upon traditional systems like set theory.
4. Showed that the Gamma and Beta Functions of classical analysis are particular cases of the Hypergeometric Function.
5. Secured advancements in the study of hypercomplex numbers and functional equations.
6. Discovered an erroneous proof in the theory of n-Euclidean Geometry which prompted a deeper understanding of the field.
7. Established the mathematical basis for the theory of quantum mechanics.
8. Studied hypergroups, a notable example of non-abelian group theory.
9. Researched the influence of ideals on the algebraic structure of various rings.

Born 23 August 1908, Liverpool, England. Died 22 December 1994, Croydon, England.
