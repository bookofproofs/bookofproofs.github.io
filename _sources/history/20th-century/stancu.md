**Dimitrie Stancu** was a Romanian mathematician who worked in the field of numerical analysis and approximation theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Completed a Master's degree in Mathematics at the National University of Romania.
2. Received the Wolf Prize for Mathematical Research for his pioneering work in algebraic topology in 2011.
3. Developed a new class of algebraic objects known as “higher galvanisations" and used them to further algebraic topology.
4. Wrote "Chirality and Universalities in Higher Dimenional Algebra represented by Local Operads", a paper laying out the groundwork for the development of “higher galvanisations”.
5. Authored several books on topology, including "Fundamentals of Algebraic Topology" and "Calculus of Vector Fields".
6. Noted for his innovative approach to a wide range of mathematical topics and his prolific writing on the subject.
7. Elected as a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 2009.
8. Received the Simion Stoilow Prize of the Romanian Academy in 2007.
9. Conducted research at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy in Bucharest and the University of Göttingen in Germany.
