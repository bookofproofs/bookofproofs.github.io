**Serge Nikolski** was a Russian mathematician who worked in functional analysis and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The second comment is to say that his name appears in various different transliterations, the most common versions of his first name being Serge and Sergey while that of his family name is Nikol'ski, Nikolski, Nikolski, and Nikolsky.
* We have never seen anything other than Mikhalovich for his patronymic.
* Serge Mikhalovich Nikolski was the son of Mikhal Dmitrievich Nikolski and Lyudmila Mikhalovna Fedorova.
* Serge Mikhalovich was the fourth of his parents' six children and he spent his early years in the region of Poland which had become part of the Russian Empire in 1795 when its lands were divided between Prussia, the Austrian Empire and the Russian Empire.
* Soon after Sergei's birth his father began working at the Augustow forest, near the Prussian border, and the young boy began his education in the city of Suwalki.
* With the outbreak of war, the Nikolski family moved to Chernigov (now known as Chernihiv in Ukraine), where Sergei Mikhalovich continued to study at the gymnasium.
* At the age of fourteen Serge Mikhalovich began working as a forester but also had a job as an observer at the Krasnyi Kordon meteorological station, one of around twenty large and well-equipped meteorological stations then existing in Russia.
* His father was fond of mathematics and had taught Serge the basic properties of the differential and integral calculus.
* By 1921 Serge's father Mikhal Dmitrievich, seeing that his son was a talented mathematician, thought that Serge should become an engineer.
* After Mikhal Dmitrievich's murder, Serge, his siblings and his mother returned to Chernigov where Serge worked at the Professional School of the Local Department of Political Education.
* Nikolski tried in 1925 to enter the Kiev Polytechnical Institute without a recommendation, but he was rejected, not even given an examination.
* Thus, Nikolski found himself in Ekaterinoslav (now Dnepropetrovsk).
* Nikolski's family were not able to give him financial support so when he arrived in Ekaterinoslav, in addition to full time study, he took a labouring job in a metallurgical factory.
* We have given quite a few details about Gruzintsev since we believe that he was important in changing Nikolski from a career in engineering to one in mathematics.
* Nikolski graduated from Dnipropetrovsk University in 1929 and began teaching at the University as an assistant professor.
* Nikolski taught mathematics courses at several of these new educational establishments.
* Pavel Sergeevich Aleksandrov, Benjamin Fedorovich Kagan, Ivan Georgievich Petrovsky and Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov made frequent visits and gave lectures at Dnipropetrovsk.
* Kolmogorov, who had been appointed a professor at Moscow University in 1931, was very impressed by Nikolski's work and began to advise him on writing a Candidate's thesis (equivalent to a Ph.D.).
* Nikolski married Nina Ivanovna Shlepkina (20 August 1910 - 23 January 1998) who was born in a small town of Kulebaki, which is located on the Oka river and is famous for metallurgical production.
* Nikolski was allowed to spend 1934-35 as a graduate student at Moscow State University where he attended lecture courses on functional analysis by Abraham Ezechiel Plessner and Lazar Aronovich Lyusternik (1899-1981), as well as seminars by Kolmogorov and Igor' Nikolaevich Khlodovskii (1903-1951) on approximation theory.
* Nikolski submitted his Candidate's Thesis Linear equations in Banach space in 1935 and, after defending his thesis, was awarded the degree.
* German armies advanced towards Moscow and Nikolski played his part in defending the city by working for the Moscow fire brigade and also, along with Alexey Andreevich Lyapunov (1911-1973) (a mathematician working at the Steklov Mathematical Institute), helped with constructing anti-tank fortifications in Maloyaroslavets about 125 km south west of Moscow.
* Nikolski was later awarded the medal "For the Defence of Moscow".
* In late 1941 members of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow were evacuated to Kazan where they were housed in Kazan University and Nikolski was one of those evacuated.
* In 1947 Nikolski was appointed as a professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT).
* Over the following fifty years, Nikolski worked at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, at the Steklov Mathematical Institute, and at MIPT.
* Nikolski was a plenary speaker delivering the lecture Einige Fragen der Approximation von Funktionen durch Polynome â“‰(Some questions on approximation of functions by polynomials.).
* The Russian school in this subject, which is now led by Nikolski, has been particularly active during the past two decades.
* As we noted right at the start of this biography, Nikolski lived to be 1907 years old.

Born 30 April 1905, Zavod Talitsa, Perm Province, Russian Empire. Died 9 November 2012, Moscow, Russia.
