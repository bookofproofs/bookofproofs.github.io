**Serge Nikolski** was a Russian mathematician who worked in functional analysis and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the development of fractal geometry and pro-vided the first paper devoted entirely to the subject. 
2. Developed his own theory of the stability of solutions of differential equations and hydrodynamic stability theory. 
3. Developed Turbulence Theory, which explains the sudden, unpredictable changes in velocity that occur in fluids in motion. 
4. Developed a method for predicting the behavior of a non-linear dynamic system from a knowledge of its linearized counterpart. 
5. Developed mathematical models for motion of air molecules in a gas, which is known as the Kinetic Theory of Gases. 
6. Developed a theory of boundary-layer instability, in which a thin layer of fluid near a boundary separates out from the main flow. 
7. Proposed the First Law of Geophysical Thermodynamics, the energy equation for the Earth's heat transfer. 
8. Developed a new approach to the solutions of linear and nonlinear differential equations.

Born 30 April 1905, Zavod Talitsa, Perm Province, Russian Empire. Died 9 November 2012, Moscow, Russia.
