**Mikhael Gromov** is a French-Russian mathematician best-known for his geometry. He won the Abel prize in 2009.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Fields Medal in 1982 for his work in topology, geometry and algebraic geometry.
2. Developed the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves which was used as an essential part of the proof of the Gromov-Witten conjecture.
3. Solved Grisha Perelman’s Poincaré conjecture by constructing a counterexample.
4. Established the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, which allows the comparison of metric spaces.
5. Coined the term “hyperbolic groups” to study their properties in geometry.
6. Was awarded the Abel Prize in 2009 for in part for his pioneering contributions to symplectic topology and geometric group theory.
7. Published groundbreaking works on partial differential equations, foliations and geometric transformation groups.

Born 23 December 1943, Boksitogorsk, Russia.
