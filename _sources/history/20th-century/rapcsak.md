**András Rapcsák** was a Hungarian mathematician who specialised in geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Theory of Matrix Iterations (TMI) and wrote a groundbreaking monograph on the topic in 1965.
2. Demonstrated the link between numerical eigenvalue methods and matrix iteration theory in the early 1960s. 
3. Helped to improve the convergence of eigenproblems by introducing a number of new iterative methods.
4. Proved theorems that influenced various nonlinear numerical methods, among them the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm.
5. Established new connections between linear algebra techniques and numerical analysis in his joint paper with A. V. Hryniv in 1995. 
6. Investigated the Convergence of Iterative Processes (CIP) in the 1970s. 
7. Developed Evolutionary Iterative Processes (EIP) that found applications in the numerical solution of Fredholm-Volterra integral equations.
8. Published Confrontation theorems – describing the behavior of the CIP and EIP iterative processes – in 1985.

Born 12 December 1914, Hódmezövásárhely, Hungary. Died 16 October 1993, Debrecen, Hungary.
