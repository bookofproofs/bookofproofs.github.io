**Bernadette Perrin-Riou** is a French mathematician who has made important contributions to number theory. She was awarded the 1999 Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize from the American Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Both Perrin-Riou's parents had been born in Les Vans but, her mother being a physicist and her father a chemist working in Paris, the family moved to Neuilly-sur-Seine, within the Paris area.
* It was in Neuilly-sur-Seine that Bernadette and her two sisters were brought up.
* Bernadette's two sisters became physicists, but she was turned on to mathematics by an inspiring teacher, Pascal Monsellier, when she was studying at the Lycée.
* The small-scale, personal atmosphere was well suited to Perrin-Riou, and she found that she liked to delve deeply into subjects.
* Perrin-Riou completed her undergraduate studies in 1977 and began to undertake research.
* In 1983, following the award of her doctorate, Perrin-Riou was appointed Maître de Conférences at the Pierre et Marie Curie University.
* In 1985 Perrin-Riou's second child was born, another son.
* At the International Congress of Mathematicians at Zürich in 1994, Perrin-Riou gave the invited address p-adic L-functions.
* In this volume, Perrin-Riou presents a theory of p-adic L-functions coming directly from p-adic Galois representations (or, more generally, from motives).
* The work described in this text led to Perrin-Riou being awarded several major prizes.
* In 2001 Perrin-Riou published another major text Théorie d'Iwasawa des Representations p-adiques Semi-Stables Ⓣ(Iwasawa Theory of p-adic  semi-stable representations).

Born 1 August 1955, Les Vans, Ardèche, France.
