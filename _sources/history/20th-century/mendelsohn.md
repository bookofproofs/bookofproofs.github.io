**Nathan Mendelsohn** was an American-born Canadian mathematician who worked in several areas of discrete mathematics, including group theory and combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* They settled in Euclid Avenue, a particularly appropriate place for the future mathematician Nathan! As a high school student, he quickly understood his own mathematical abilities when he realised he knew far more mathematics than his teacher.
* With a four-year scholarship, Mendelsohn entered the University of Toronto to study mathematics.
* After completing his first degree, Mendelsohn remained in Toronto to study for a Master's Degree.
* After completing his doctorate Mendelsohn undertook war work.
* he settled in Winnipeg, where the University of Manitoba welcomed any and all to build its fledgling math department, and where Prof Mendelsohn became deeply involved in the city's vibrant Jewish community.
* This paper is particularly singled out when Mendelsohn was awarded the Henry Marshall Tory Medal of the Royal Society of Canada in 1979.
* However there was much more to say about Mendelsohn's contributions to mathematics, particularly in Canada, beyond research contributions.
* Mendelsohn's interests outside mathematics were, like his mathematical interests, varied.
* Eric Mendelsohn obtained his doctorate in mathematics from McGill University in 1968 and is currently Professor of Mathematics at the University of Toronto.
* Three great heroes of mine were Donald Coxeter, Willie Moser and Nathan Mendelsohn who all had made stunning contributions to producing algorithms to study groups given by generators and relations.

Born 14 April 1917, Brooklyn, New York, USA. Died 4 July 2006, Toronto, Canada.
