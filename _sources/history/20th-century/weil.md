**André Weil** was a French mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry and  number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Worked on the Langlands Program and provided new insights into the abstract concept of Galois theory.
2. Founded the influential Bourbaki group, which sought to create a comprehensive and rigorous foundation of mathematics.
3. Pioneered the use of deep modern abstract algebra, spearheading its use in number theory and algebraic geometry.
4. Introduced the Weil Conjecture, which proposed a way to estimate the number of points on a given algebraic variety.
5. Helped to create new fields of mathematics by introducing the concept of Shimura varieties.
6. Proved the Riemann Hypothesis in the form of the Weil Conjecture.
7. Devised a unified structure for mathematics that revolutionized the way mathematics is understood.
8. Established the field of K-theory (algebraic K-theory) by introducing novel methods and insights.
9. Demonstrated a foundational insight into the relationship between arithmetic algebraic geometry and number theory that was later termed Weil reciprocity.

Born 6 May1906, Paris, France. Died 6 August 1998, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
