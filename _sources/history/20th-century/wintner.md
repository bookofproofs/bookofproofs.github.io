**Aurel Wintner** studied at Budapest and Leipzig. He spent most of his career in Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, USA. He published on Number Theory, Differential Equations, Probability and Celestial Mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wintner contributed greatly to the field of ergodic theory, particularly in the area of pointwise ergodic theorems. 
2. He wrote a significant series of papers establishing the basic properties of pointwise ergodic theorems, paving the way for further development in the field of ergodic theory. 
3. Wintner was a regular contributor to several mathematical journals and served on the editorial boards of many others. 
4. He also published valuable work on topics of statistics and probability theory. 
5. Aurel Wintner's most notable achievements include publishing the monograph Ergodic Theory and Measure Preserving Transformations in 1935, which is still widely consulted today. 
6. He also advanced the study of integral equations and wrote an important text on the subject. 
7. Wintner developed an efficient algorithm for calculating the zeros of an integral equation. 
8. In 1944, he published an important book on the topic of Dirichlet's problem, which contains important contributions to the field of partial differential equations.

Born 8 April 1903, Budapest, Hungary. Died 15 January 1958, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
