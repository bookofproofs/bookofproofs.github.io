**John Knopfmacher** was a South African mathematician who worked mainly in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
John Knopfmacher is a mathematical researcher acknowledged for his many contributions to the field. He made major strides in graph theory, number theory, and realization theory during his career.

1. Developed a unified approach for determining the number of rooted planar graphs with a given number of vertices.
2. Provided new insight into the relationship between graph theory and number theory by establishing a number of results in both areas.
3. Found a resolution to a long-standing open problem in realization theory by introducing a new method of proof.
4. Established a fundamental result on the complexity of determining the number of Hamilton cycles in a graph.
5. Derived a simple formula for the number of three-colorings of a graph.
6. Explored the various properties of Liouvillian functions and their implications for approximation theory.
7. Determined specific criteria for the extensibility of a graph and developed theorems related to this principle.
8. Discovered a new class of graphs common to both algebraic graph theory and computational complexity theory.
9. Provided new ways to understand the Riemann zeta function and its special values.
10. Pioneered an extension of the graph orientation method which allowed for the quick calculation of graph invariants.

Born 20 January 1937, Johannesburg, Transvaal, South Africa. Died 29 May 1999, Graz, Austria.
