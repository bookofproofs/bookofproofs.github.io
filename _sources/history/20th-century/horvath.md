**János Horváth** was a Hungarian who worked at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris before going to Colombia where he taught several courses and held seminars on the latest mathematical developments.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* These were Carlo Federici (1906-2004) and János Horváth (1924-2015) and since their role in the founding of the Colombian Mathematical Society is vital, we give some details of them.
* János Horváth (known as Juan Horváth in Colombia and as John Horváth in the United States) was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 30 July 1924.
* Influenced by Federici and Horváth he had become aware of the need to develop mathematics as an independent topic, and its importance to the future of Colombia.
* In addition to Julio Carrizosa Valenzuela, Carlo Federici Casa and Juan Horváth, the founding members of the Society were: Antonio María Gómez (1913-1979); Dario Rozo (1881-1964); Erwin Von Der Walde (1927-2016); Gabriel Poveda Ramos (1931); Guillermo Castillo Torres (1923-2000); Gustavo Perry Zubieta (1912-1986); Henry Yerly (1901-1984); Jorge Acosta Villaveces (1891-1965); Jose Ignacio Nieto (1930); Leopoldo Guerra Portocarrero (1911-1964); Luciano Mora Osejo (1928-2016); Luis De Greiff Bravo (1908-1967); Luis Ignacio Soriano (1903-1973); Michel Valero (1928-2008); Otto De Greiff (1903-1995); and Pablo Casas Santofimio (1927-1983).

Born 30 July 1924, Budapest, Hungary. Died March 12, 2015.
