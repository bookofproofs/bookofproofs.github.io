### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced a new class of exact solutions for nonlinear hyperbolic equations known as pseudo-spherical systems of conservation laws.
2. Developed a novel technique for calculating small-amplitude solutions with large frequencies of over-reflexive KdV equations.
3. Pioneered a unique approach to study integrable systems by displaying their solutions in terms of modular functions.
4. Showed how the class of solitary wave solutions of nonlinear hyperbolic systems could be generalized to include multipoles.
5. Established the connection between nonlinear hyperbolic systems and the Fermionic Toda lattice.
6. Developed an analytical method to study the 1D nonlinear Schrödinger equation by utilizing ideas from the theory of integrable systems.
7. Published numerous works on the theory of integrable systems and its applications to plasma physics.

Born 30 July 1924, Budapest, Hungary. Died March 12, 2015.
