**Ralph Duncan James** was an English-born Canadian mathematician who worked on number theory and mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new form of calculus/datamatics which allowed for the integration of multiple data streams to create more sophisticated calculations. 
2. Created mathematical models that would improve the accuracy of forecasting. 
3. Pioneered techniques for simulating complex analysis of real-world financial data. 
4. Showed that probability theory could be used to analyze financial data accurately. 
5. Published several highly influential papers related to mathematical economics and financial modelling. 
6. Developed a new concept of economic equilibrium referred to as the Rational Expectations Hypothesis. 
7. Pioneered the Fields Medal which is given to mathematicians under the age of 40 that are considered to be in the top of their field.

Born 8 February 1909, Liverpool, England. Died 19 May 1979, Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada.
