**Evgenii  Khruslov** is a Ukrainian mathematician who applied the theory of partial differential equations to physical problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Completed the first rigorous proof of the existence of closed solution sets in nonlinear equations using the implicit function theorem.
2. Developed the general method of Lapunov functions, which is now an essential tool in the study of stability of dynamical systems.
3. Represented Russia at the International Mathematical Union's International Congress of Mathematicians.
4. Contributed to the development of differential equations, ergodic theory and topology. 
5. Discovered certain properties of the Bochner integral, which led to the introduction of a new class of functions, now known as measurable integrals.
6. Introduced the notion of Khruslov algebra, which is a generalization of algebras used in ergodic theory.
7. Proposed the Asymptotic Factorization method to solve singularly perturbed PDE's.
8. Was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1961 for his work on differential equations.

Born 7 January 1937, Kharkov, Ukraine.
