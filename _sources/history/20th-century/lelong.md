**Pierre Lelong** was a French mathematician who worked in the theory of several complex variables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made significant advances in the study of complex analysis and function theory.
2. Discovered the Lelong containment theorem, which states that any holomorphic function can be assigned a positive integer such that it is entirely contained by a closed ball with that integer as its radius.
3. Published a number of influential papers on generalized functions and analytic functions.
4. Developed the theory of partial differentials equations and developed techniques to solve them.
5. Developed a theory of integral equations, ultimately leading to the development of the famous Lelong-Malgrange theorem.
6. His research in linear operators and Banach algebra led to a number of important concepts. 
7. Issued a number of groundbreaking articles introducing advanced ideas visualized in topology descriptive to the field of mathematics, many of themes still studied today. 
8. Developed a system of distribution theory and stochastic process, formerly known as the Lelong-Ascoli estimate.

Born 14 March 1912, Paris, France. Died 12 October 2011, Paris, France.
