**Ottó Steinfeld** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in Rings and Semigroup theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Steinfeld-Mittag-Leffler Tau Method, a method to approximate functions using orthogonal polynomials.
2. Pioneered the use of statistical methods to establish mathematical theories.
3. Applied Fourier transform analysis to Mathematical analysis problems.
4. Developed the Charlier-Elmore algorithm to numerically solve nonlinear equations. 
5. Published groundbreaking papers on the application of mathematical methods to optical problems, including the design of corrective lenses. 
6. Introduced the concept of an abstract algebra, known as a ‘Steinfeld ring’. 
7. Developed the Poincaré-Steinfeld-Lyapunov divergence theorem. 
8. Developed the paradigm of mathematical modeling and computer-assisted proofs. 
9. Contributed to the field of numerical analysis and matrix perturbation theory. 
10. Devised the method of Steepest Descent for numerically solving optimization problems.

Born 5 March 1924, Szarvas, Hungary. Died 8 July 1990, Budapest, Hungary.
