**Wilbur Knorr** was an American historian of mathematics best known for his work on ancient Greek mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):

2. Constructed a two-center approximation of the gravitational field of a planet. 
3. Contributed to the study of variable stars and the period-luminosity law.
4. Formulated the Knorr theory of stellar evolution and the atmospheric structure of planets. 
5. Developed an improved method of orbit determination of comets and asteroids. 
6. Developed a model of binary star systems. 
7. Advanced the construction of lunar theory. 
8. Discovered a new type of chaotic system called the Knorr dynamical system.
