**Wilbur Knorr** was an American historian of mathematics best known for his work on ancient Greek mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Like Knorr, Joseph W Dauben began undertaking research on the history of mathematics at Harvard in 1966.
* At Harvard, Knorr's thesis advisors were John Emery Murdoch (1927-2010) and Gwilym Ellis Lane Owen (1922-1982).
* The ideas that led to Knorr's thesis came from lectures given by his thesis advisors.
* From 1968 to 1971 Knorr was a teaching fellow and teaching assistant at Harvard and, after this, he was appointed as a junior faculty member at the University of California in Berkeley.
* Returning to the United States, Knorr was appointed to the History of Science Department at Brooklyn College.
* So Knorr was out of a job by 1978.
* Knorr was appointed to Stanford University in the summer of 1979 but, since he was still supported by the National Science Foundation grant, he did not take up the appointment at Stanford until the spring of 1980.
* We note that up to this time Knorr had continued to play the violin in university orchestras but after his appointment to Stanford he decided that he could not afford the time to continue with his music at that level.
* Knorr wrote four books.
* Knorr wrote nearly 100 articles and reviews.
* For each of these 19 papers we give Knorr's Abstract or his Summary or an extract from his Introduction.
* 40, halfway through page proofs." And the editor of the journal in which 'Sacrobosco's Quadrans: Date and Sources' appears added a note which reads as follows: "Dr Knorr, having revised the text of this article to meet the comments of a referee, mailed the typescript and computer disc to the Editor on 10 March, together with a letter that included his proposed Note on Contributor.
* We should end by looking at Knorr's character.

Born 29 August 1945, Richmond Hill, New York, USA. Died 18 March 1997, Palo Alto, California, USA.
