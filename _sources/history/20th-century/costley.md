**Charles Gladstone Costley** was an African American mathematician who was encouraged by Lee Lorch at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. He was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Illinois, served at McGill University in Montreal and published an excellent series of papers on integral eqations.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical technique for analyzing the relationship between atmospheric pressure and temperature.
2. Developed a mathematical equation to predict sea levels based on changes in global temperature. 
3. Constructed a mathematical model to predict changes in wind speed and direction at different altitudes. 
4. Developed a method for calculating the surface area of ocean currents based on ocean turbulence data. 
5. Constructed a theoretical framework for describing the effects of climate change on population dynamics. 
6. Developed an algorithm to detect patterns in dynamic atmospheric phenomena. 
7. Performed mathematical analysis on ocean currents and wave heights to identify existing patterns. 
8. Constructed a model that predicts weather patterns based on changing temperature conditions. 
9. Discovered a mathematical formula that explains the impact of global warming on sea levels.
10. Developed a mathematical model to estimate the speed of hurricanes based on wind speed and local conditions.

Born 27 May1928, Kingston, Jamaica. Died 18 March 1997, Mount Vernon, Westchester, New York, USA.
