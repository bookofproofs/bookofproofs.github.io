**John Crank** was an English numerical analyst who worked on the heat equation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Crank is quoted as saying that to "burn a piece of wood" numerically then could take a week.
* The instability was not recognised until lengthy numerical computations were carried out by Crank, Nicolson and others.
* Crank and Nicolson's method, which is numerically stable, requires the solution of a very simple system of linear equations (a tridiagonal system) at each time level.

Born 6 February 1916, Hindley, Lancashire, England. Died 3 October 2006, Ruislip, London, England.
