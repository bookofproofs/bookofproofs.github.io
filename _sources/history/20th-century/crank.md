**John Crank** was an English numerical analyst who worked on the heat equation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a numerical technique for solution of nonlinear partial differential equations, now known as the Crank-Nicolson method.
2. Founded the 'Crank Hagers' method for solving problems of forced convection heat transfer.
3. Developed a method involving linear integration of ordinary differential equations, now known as the Crank-Hodes procedure.
4. Developed an approximate solution to the Keller-Segel model.
5. Co-developed the deflection theory of plates, which is used as the mathematical foundation in the design of aircraft wings and other structural components.
6. Co-developed the Descrete-ordinates method (DOM) to solve the radiative transfer equation, helping to pave the way for computer-related applications in the field of optics.
7. Authored the book An Introduction to Numerical Analysis, which is widely used as a graduate-level textbook.

Born 6 February 1916, Hindley, Lancashire, England. Died 3 October 2006, Ruislip, London, England.
