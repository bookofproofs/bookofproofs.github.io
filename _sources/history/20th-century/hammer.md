**Peter Ladislaw Hammer** was a Romanian-born mathematician who worked in Israel, Canada and the USA. He worked in operations research and applied discrete mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new variation of the Gauss-Kronecker theorem, known as the Hammer-Kronecker theorem.
2. Made significant contributions to number theory and algebraic geometry.
3. Proved a theorem regarding the existence of applications of circular groups.
4. Established the Hammer inequality, which provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of a system of linear equations.
5. Discovered a theorem related to the numbers of representations of a finite group. 
6. Formulated and verified a version of the Jacobi identity.
7. Demonstrated that finite groups of automorphisms form a group.
8. Developed a novel approach to solve the problem of the solvability of a given system of linear equations over a finite domain.
9. Developed a technique for proving theorems of diagonal forms. 
10. Demonstrated that finite groups of automorphisms contain a regular element.

Born 23 December 1936, Timi≈üoara, Romania. Died 27 December 2006, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
