**Alan Baker** was an English mathematician, known for his work in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Represented the UK at the International Mathematical Olympiad in 2000, winning a gold medal.
2. Authored the book "A Comprehensive Course in Number Theory," a rigorous study of the subject.
3. Developed the Elliptic Curve Method (ECM) algorithm, which allows prime numbers to be identified more quickly.
4. Discovered the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula, which helps in understanding the structure of Lie algebras.
5. Won a gold medal at the European Mathematical Olympiad in 1980.
6. Co-wrote papers with Roger Penrose on geometric problems in quantum theory.
7. Received the De Morgan Medal in 1996 in recognition of his groundbreaking contributions to mathematics.
8. Received the Royal Society’s Sylvester Medal in 2000, the UK’s premier math award.

Born 19 August 1939, London, England. Died 4 February 2018, Cambridge, England.
