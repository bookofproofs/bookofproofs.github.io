**Cathleen Morawetz** was a Canadian mathematician who worked on the  partial differential equations governing fluid flow, particularly those of mixed type occurring in transonic flow.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Both Cathleen's parents were Irish but she was born in Toronto while her father held the position of assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto.
* When Cathleen was seven years old the family returned to Toronto and it was in Toronto that she attended school.
* Cathleen won a scholarship and entered the University of Toronto to study mathematics.
* Cecilia Krieger, who taught Cathleen mathematics while she was an undergraduate, had been a family friend for many years.
* She strongly encouraged Cathleen continue her study of mathematics.
* Cathleen married Herbert Morawetz, who was a chemist, on 28 October 1945.
* However, strongly encouraged by Cecilia Krieger to study for her doctorate, Morawetz went to New York University to undertake research.
* During this period Morawetz applied for US citizenship and she was granted this in 1950.
* In 1978 Morawetz became the associate director of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences a position which she held until 1984 when she was appointed Director of the Courant Institute.
* Morawetz's predictions have been confirmed subsequently through both actual experiments and careful numerical simulation which indicate the appearance of shock waves in the flow past the purturbed profile.
* In the 1960s Morawetz worked on the scattering of sound waves and electromagnetic waves striking objects.
* Morawetz showed that, for a medium with constant light speed outside a reflecting star-shaped object, high frequency waves are, asymptotically, streams of particles moving along the rays.
* In 1998 Morawetz was awarded the National Medal of Science.
* The list of honours which Morawetz has received certainly does not stop at those already mentioned above.
* In 2001 Morawetz was made an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society.

Born 5 May 1923, Toronto, Canada. Died 8 August 2017, New York City, New York, USA.
