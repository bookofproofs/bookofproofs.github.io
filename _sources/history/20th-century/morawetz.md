**Cathleen Morawetz** was a Canadian mathematician who worked on the  partial differential equations governing fluid flow, particularly those of mixed type occurring in transonic flow.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new theory for the extension and simplified interpretation of Exton's method for studying wave motion, thereby creating a new and unified approach for solving equations related to wave motion. 
2. Used the techniques of asymptotic analysis to develop a novel technique for solving nonlinear hyperbolic systems of equations in two dimensions. 
3. Authored several papers on the solution of problems related to the wave equation, including a proof of the Lax-Phillips conjecture. 
4. Worked in the field of conservation laws and showed that non-characteristic boundary value problems can be solved by applying appropriate boundary conditions. 
5. Received the National Medal of Science in 1974 and was the first woman president of the American Mathematical Society. 
6. Credited with the invention of the Morawetz multiplier which helps in the study of exact solutions to equations with vortical fluid flows.
7. Received the Georgia Tech AIChE Founderâ€™s Award in 1991 for her contributions to the understanding of wave motion. 
8. Won the L"osch Medal for her pioneering work in acoustic wave equations. 
9. Received the Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition in 1988 for her highly innovative use of ideas in her work on wave equations. 
10. Appointed Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 1974.

Born 5 May1923, Toronto, Canada. Died 8 August 2017, New York City, New York, USA.
