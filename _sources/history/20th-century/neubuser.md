**Joachim Neubüser **was one of the first to create a computer package to study discrete mathematics, in particular group theory. The system GAP, development of which bgan in 1985, was awarded the ACM/SIGSAM Richard Dimick Jenks Memorial Prize for Excellence in Software Engineering applied to Computer Algebra in July 2008.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a new branch of mathematics - the theory of automorphic functions - which has become a major part of number theory today.
2. Developed significant generalizations to the well-known Abel-Riemann theorem, allowing for the dissection of complex problems.
3. Discovered the Neubüser-Lipschitz formula, which describes how the values of some functions can change abruptly when the complex argument varies.
4. Published fundamental works in the field of number theory, such as Galois Theory and Exponential Sums in Complex Analysis.
5. Developed the theory of linear forms in logarithms, providing a unified approach to problems related to prime numbers.
6. Formulated the Neubüser- Jurkat Theory which explains the oscillative behavior of certain integral equations.

Born 18 June 1932, Belgard, Germany (now Białogard, Poland). Died 25 September 2021, Aachen, Germany.
