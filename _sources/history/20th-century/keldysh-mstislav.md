**Mstislav Keldysh** was a Latvian-born Soviet mathematician and engineer who did important work on aerohydrodynamics. He also worked on functions of a complex variable and differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made groundbreaking contributions to the fields of differential equations, functional analysis, and partial differential equations, specifically in the areas of existence theorems, integral equations, and algebraic systems. 
2. Established the foundations of the modern theory of linear operators and of semigroups, which are a key component of many mathematical subjects.
3. Developed the method of variational iterations, now known as the Keldysh algorithm, which is a computational approach used to solve large systems of equations. 
4. Established a correspondence between the integral equations of scattering theory and the Fredholm equations. 
5. Appointed as the first President of the Moscow Mathematical Society in 1958 and served as Chairman of the Soviet Science Academy from 1961-1974. 
6. Awarded the Lenin Prize in 1971, the Order of Lenin, and the Hero of Socialist Labor in 1975. 
7. Made major contributions to developing the space industry in the Soviet Union by working on the mathematics for rocket launches, satellite motion and predicting the motion of space vehicles. 
8. Was one of the authors of the book "Equations of Mathematical Physics", which is now considered to be a classic of its field.

Born 10 February 1911, Riga, Latvia. Died 24 June 1978, Moscow, Russia.
