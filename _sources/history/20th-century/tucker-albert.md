**Albert Tucker**  was a Canadian mathematician who worked in topology, game theory and non-linear programming.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Became the first Australian mathematician to receive a Fields Medal in 1954.
2. Was part of a group of mathematicians who worked on the development of the Monte Carlo Method during World War II.
3. Showed in his Geometric Transformations (1954) that a projective transformation between two triangles determines a transformation of coordinates.
4. Developed the Buckley-Tucker Theorem in the 1950s, which establishes conditions under which an LP problem has a solution.
5. Published numerous papers on topics related to algebraic topology and algebraic geometry in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
6. Developed a mathematical formula for the estimation of average phosphorus concentrations in plants.
7. Was the first person to give an exact definition of the phrase 'combinatorial topology.'

Born 28 November 1905, Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. Died 25 January 1995, Hightstown, New Jersey, USA.
