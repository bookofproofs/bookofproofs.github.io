**Jerzy Słupecki** was a Chinese-born Polish mathematician who made important contributions to logic.

Jerzy Słupecki was a Polish mathematician who applied number theory and polynomial algorithms to solve differential equations & contributed to various fields such as theory of linear integral equations, signal analysis, and Słupecki Covering.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He attended the seminar of, and wrote a 1938 doctorate under, Jan Łukasiewicz.
2. In 1963, when at Wroclaw University, where he had been since 1945, he became editor of Studia Logica.
3. He showed how the many-valued logics of Łukasiewicz could be included in the theory of Post systems.
4. He gave a functionally complete version of the three-valued logic.
5. In the logic of categorical sentences, he found a rule that made the theory decidable.
6. He continued the work of Stanisław Leśniewski, and wrote on his system ("protothetics") in 1953, in Studia Logica.
9. He lead the Institute of Mathematical Logic at the Wroclaw University for almost 30 years until his retirement in 1974.

Born 29 August 1904, Harbin, Manchuria, (now China). Died 15 January 1987, Wrocław, Poland.
