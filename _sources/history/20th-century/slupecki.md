**Jerzy Słupecki** was a Chinese-born Polish mathematician who made important contributions to logic.

Jerzy Słupecki was a Polish mathematician who applied number theory and polynomial algorithms to solve differential equations & contributed to various fields such as theory of linear integral equations, signal analysis, and Słupecki Covering.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Stanisław Słupecki was actually born in Podolia and studied engineering in St Petersburg.
* The reason that Jerzy was born in Manchuria was that his father, Stanisław, although a captain in the military, had been working on the construction of the East China Railway since 1900.
* By the time Jerzy was born, the railway linked the Trans-Siberian Railway from Lake Baikal in Siberia through Harbin in Manchuria to the Russian port of Vladivostok in Siberia on the Sea of Japan.
* Harbin was the Russian military base in Manchuria during this war, which was taking place at the time Jerzy was born.
* The younger of his parents' two sons, Jerzy was brought up in Harbin where his parents enjoyed a good life style since his father Stanisław was well paid being promoted to colonel in 1912 and commander of a battalion in the 35th Siberian Rifle Regiment in 1914.
* Jerzy's childhood was a time of great joy growing up in an environment with mixed races and nations, all with their different languages and customs, cultures and religions.
* Jerzy's parents felt that their son would be safer if he were with them in Harbin so he returned there in 1918.
* With Poland existing again as an independent country, the Słupecki family decided to return from Harbin to their own country.
* This, however, proved not to be easy and only Stanisław Słupecki managed to return at this time and he joined the Polish army in December 1918.
* The conditions were harsh and Jerzy's brother contracted tuberculosis.
* Jerzy himself suffered poor health but had to work to support the family financially.
* Eventually, in 1921, all the family returned to Warsaw where Jerzy was able to continue his much interrupted education.
* Słupecki graduated from this High School in 1926 and, later in the same year, entered the Warsaw Technical University where he studied his favourite subject, namely architecture.
* Mathematics had always been a second favourite for Słupecki but, later in life when he was enjoying a highly successful career, he still regretted having to give up studying architecture.
* Once again Słupecki encountered unfortunate difficulties with his studies at Warsaw University.
* Słupecki tried to help out the family finances with a variety of different jobs, some with the Warsaw Municipal Council and some with the Historical Museum.
* Adolf Lindenbaum was only two months older than Słupecki but had been awarded a doctorate in 1928, the difference being simply a consequence of the problems which had hindered Słupecki's education.
* Also Tarski, who was only two years older than Słupecki, had been teaching at Warsaw university since 1925.
* As well as the important influence of these lecturers, an equally important influence on Słupecki from this time on was Andrzej Mostowski.
* Mostowski was nine years younger than Słupecki but had begun his studies at Warsaw University in 1931.
* Słupecki and Mostowski met regularly in Lourse's Café in Krakówskie Przedmieście, one of the most prestigious streets in Warsaw.
* Słupecki graduated with a Master's degree from the University of Warsaw in 1935 having written a thesis advised by Jan Łukasiewicz.
* Słupecki's thesis was outstanding and it received the Department Council's award.
* Although he would have wished to remain at the University of Warsaw and study there for his doctorate, this was not possible in a situation where, despite having a school of extraordinary talents, it was not possible to employ someone as gifted as Słupecki.
* With Łukasiewicz as his research advisor, Słupecki worked on his doctoral thesis while being a full-time secondary school teacher.
* In the following year he submitted his thesis A proof of the axiomatizability of full systems of many-valued propositional calculus (Polish) and was awarded a Ph.D. Wacław Sierpiński was an examiner of Słupecki's thesis.
* In particular Helena Rzeszotarska (1879-1976) ran an underground Gymnasium to teach young people and Słupecki taught in this school.
* Słupecki taught in this underground university along with several of his friends and teachers such as Łukasiewicz and Mostowski.
* In addition to these highly dangerous teaching duties, Słupecki also took part in the Konrad Żegota Committee, part of the Polish Resistance.
* Many Poles were forced to undertake work for the Germans and, in mid-August 1944, Słupecki was sent to Germany as a labourer.
* Słupecki volunteered to teach at the School of Telecommunications in the Praga district of Warsaw and he also taught at the Curie-Skłodowska State Gymnasium, back in the position he had held before the German invasion.
* Later in 1945 Słupecki was appointed as an Assistant Professor at the University of Lublin.
* the creative work of Jerzy Słupecki comprised five areas: (1) many-valued sentential calculi, (2) theory of deductive systems including metalogic of classical and non-classical logic and the consequence operation of rejection, (3) history of logic (i.e. modern investigations onto the syllogistic of Aristotle), (4) Leśniewski's systems, and (5) didactics of logic and mathematics.
* Słupecki was conscious of the aim of his logical investigations as consisting in continuation, ramification and popularization of the logical investigations of his masters from the Warsaw school.
* Słupecki was also the author of a number of books co-authored with colleagues and students.
* At Wrocław University, Słupecki was Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry in 1953-55.
* However, from 1950 this was only one of Słupecki's two positions and perhaps the one that interested him the least.
* Słupecki certainly considered his work in Opole to be his most important contribution and in this, despite making many other significant contributions, he was probably correct.
* Słupecki is considered the spiritual father and founder of mathematics and logic at the university in Opole.
* Jerzy Słupecki was the author of many articles in an encyclopaedia and was a great populariser of mathematical logic.
* Słupecki was the last Warsaw logician alive who began his scientific career in the golden twenty years of Polish logic (1919-1939).

Born 29 August 1904, Harbin, Manchuria, (now China). Died 15 January 1987, Wrocław, Poland.
