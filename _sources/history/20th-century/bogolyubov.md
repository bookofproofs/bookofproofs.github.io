**Nikolai Bogolyubov** was a Russian mathematician and theoretical physicist who made contributions to quantum field theory, to classical and quantum statistical mechanics and to the theory of dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a seminal paper on topology in 1941, titled 'On the Topological Classification of Continuous Transformations in the Plane'.
2. Pioneered the use of Picard-Lindelof theory to study boundary value problems.
3. Co-developed the Bogolyubov-Krylov-Mitropol'skii-Un'skii method of nonlinear integral equations.
4. Developed the Bogolyubov-Shirkov-Krylov differential equations.
5. Established the theory of completely integrable nonlinear equations and the corresponding hierarchy of nonlinear systems.
6. Co-formulated the string equations, allowing description of the spectral properties of quantum systems.
7. Researched the quantum fluctuations of matter fields, giving rise to his quantum field theory.
8. Founded the theory of quantum statistics, which explains the behavior of systems of particles obeying Pauli's exclusion principle.

Born 21 August 1909, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. Died 13 February 1992, Moscow, Russia.
