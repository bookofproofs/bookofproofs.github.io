**Raoul Bott** was a Hungarian-born mathematician who made fundamental contributions to topology and differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Lauded for his openness to various methods of proof, Bott was awarded the prestigious Fields Medal in 1954. 
2. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1965.
3. He is considered a pioneer in the modern use of differential forms, a notion which unifies disparate branches of mathematics and has numerous physical applications.
4. He developed a key technique called localization that enables researchers to solve problems that reach beyond classical methods of investigation. 
5. He solved the famous «Bott Periodicity Conjecture», which proposed the existence of the first generically differentiable manifold.
6. He developed a technique called Morse theory, which provides a powerful way to analyze the topology of manifolds. 
7. He also contributed to the resolution of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch conjecture.
8. He proposed a number of conjectures in geometry and analysis and aided in solving important problems in the field of differential topology.

Born 24 September 1923, Budapest, Hungary. Died 20 December 2005, San Diego, USA.
