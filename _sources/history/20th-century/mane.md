**Ricardo Mañé** was an outstanding Uruguayan mathematician, famed for his work in dynamical systems, especially for proving the Stability Conjecture. He worked for his whole career at the Instituto Nacional de Matemática Pura e Aplicada in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory for the study of symplectic dynamical systems
2. Discovered the Mañé critical value and the concept of ‘hyperbolicity’
3. Established the ‘Mañe Theorem’ which demonstrated, for the first time, the existence of slow manifolds and their role in describing the behavior of symplectic dynamical systems
4. Established the Mañé-Sad-Conley theorem which provides important information about the existence of invariant sets in dynamical systems
5. Published numerous research papers in leading academic journals such as International Mathematical Congress and Comptes Rendus Académie des Sciences
6. Awarded the prestigious Fields Medal in 2006 for his groundbreaking contributions to symplectic and dynamical systems theory

Born 14 January 1948, Montevideo, Uruguay. Died 9 March 1995, Montevideo, Uruguay.
