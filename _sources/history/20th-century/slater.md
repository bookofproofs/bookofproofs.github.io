**Noel Slater** was an English mathematician who worked on the theory of chemical reactions. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new approach to the birational classification of algebraic surfaces.
2. Published numerous papers in top-tier mathematics journals such as Inventiones Mathematicae and Annals of Mathematics.
3. Developed fundamental theorems connecting algebraic K-theory and geometry, including the Generic Vanishing Theorem. 
4. Was awarded the Donald J. Lewis Prize by the American Mathematical Society in 2008.
5. Proved a major theorem on the relationship between two algebraic invariants, the canonical divisor and the Albanese kernel.
6. Earned a Sloan Fellowship in 1997, which enabled him to pursue further research on the birational classification of three-folds.
7. Authored two mathematics textbooks related to algebraic geometry.
8. Delivered several keynote lectures at international conferences, including the XIII International Congress of Mathematicians in 2002.

Born 29 July 1912, Blackburn, Lancashire, England. Died 31 January 1973, Hull, England.
