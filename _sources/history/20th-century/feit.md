**Walter Feit** was an Austrian mathematician who (with John Thompson) proved one of the most important theorems about finite simple groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He and John Thompson proved the Odd Order Theorem in 1959, which states that all non-abelian finite simple groups of odd order are necessarily of the form X2n+1(q), where X is one of Li, PSL, PSp, POH, or two of PGL.
2. He solved a major conjecture in finite group theory, the Feit-Thompson Theorem, which states that any group with an odd number of elements must be solvable.
3. In 1965, he was awarded the Cole Prize in Algebra by the American Mathematical Society for his work on finite groups.
4. He developed the techniques of symplectic geometry, which were fundamental to the development of the modern theory of finite groups.
5. He helped to shape the modern theory of finite groups as an advisor for John Thompson, an influential researcher in the field.
6. He collaborated with John Thompson in the development of succinct mathematical notation for describing finite groups.
7. He worked closely with colleagues at the Institute for Advanced Study, including Saharon Shelah and Ernst Specker, on difficult problems in set theory.
8. He worked closely with the Topical Group on Finite Groups, of which he was an early member, and delivered a number of talks on the topic at math conferences.

Born 26 October 1930, Vienna, Austria. Died 29 July 2004, Branford, Connecticut, USA.
