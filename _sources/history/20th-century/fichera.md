**Gaetano Fichera** was an Italian mathematician who worked in mathematical analysis, linear elasticity, partial differential equations and several complex variables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the use of mathematical techniques to characterize variational problems in elasticity.
2. Established a firm analytical foundation for the linear theories of plates and shells.
3. Developed methods which led to the study of boundary value problems of elliptic and parabolic type.
4. Wrote influential monographs on Partial Differential Equations of Elliptic Type, Functionals and Differential Operators, and Variational Principles in Elasticity and in Dynamics.
5. Developed the analytical basis of the Finite Element Method. 
6. Authored over 200 research articles and reviews on numerous topics in mathematics and its applications.

Born 8 February 1922, Acireale, Catania, Sicily, Italy. Died 1 June 1996, Rome, Italy.
