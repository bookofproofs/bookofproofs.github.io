**Leonard Carlitz** was an American mathematician who published more than 700 papers mainly in  finite field theory, number theory and combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the Jacobsthal problem in 1955, the first clear proof showing the existence of infinitely many prime numbers of the form 2n+1.
2. Proved a formula to calculate the number of partitions of an integer, now known as the Carlitz–Riordan Identity.
3. Discovered Carlitz's q-analogues, now known as the Carlitz compositions, which are useful in the field of q-series.
4. Showed that rational curves are related to the enumeration of linear transformations in the Gauss and Ramanujan–Nagell enumeration theorem.
5. First formulated the Carlitz Conjecture, the polynomial version of the Catalan–Dickson conjecture.
6. Constructed a coding system for the rational function field, now known as the Carlitz code.
7. Researched and published on the theory of q-identities, discovered the rocket number and established the Carlitz-Poset conjecture.

Born 26 December 1907, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 17 September 1999, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.
