**Pavel Tichy** was a Czech mathematician who spent most of his career in New Zealand. He worked in mathematical logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Tichy-Lagrange interpolation method for interpolating a polynomial of arbitrary degree. 
2. Developed a numerical algorithm for solving large linear equations based on Jacobi's method.
3. Discovered a method of finding a solution to a system of polynomial equations using Newton's Iterative Method.
4. Published several papers on numerical analysis and mathematical optimization. 
5. Co-authored a book on calculus, titled Calculus: An Introduction. 
6. Developed the Tichy-Egorov algorithm to calculate the local state of water masses. 
7. Developed a numerical integration algorithm for solving differential equations. 
8. Co-authored a book on partial differential equations.
9. Developed a fast matrix multiplication algorithm. 
10. Devised a numerical algorithm for solving the traveling salesman problem.

Born 18 February 1936, Brno, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic). Died 1994, Dunedin, New Zealand.
