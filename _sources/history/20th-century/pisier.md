**Gilles Pisier** is a French mathematician, born in New Caledonia, whose main research field is functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After spending the years 1967-69 at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, Pisier entered l'École Polytechnique in Paris.
* Pisier spent the years 1969-72 at l'École Polytechnique.
* Other areas of Pisier's research appear in the books Factorization of linear operators and geometry of Banach spaces (1986) and The volume of convex bodies and Banach space geometry (1989).
* Pisier has received many awards for his outstanding contributions.
* The Ostrowski Prize, presented by the Ostrowski Foundation created by Alexander Markowich Ostrowski and funded by his entire estate, was presented to Pisier on 25 April 1998 at the University of Leiden.
* In the framework of his research on this area Pisier solved in the last three years two extremely long-standing open problems.
* Pisier and Junge were able to produce two such tensor norms that are nonequivalent.
* In operator theory Pisier solved (again negatively) the problem of whether an operator which satisfies the von Neumann inequality (with a constant) is similar to a contraction.
* In June 2001 Pisier was awarded the Stefan Banach Medal by the Polish Academy of Sciences.
* Twice Pisier has been invited to give plenary addresses to the British Mathematical Colloquium.
* Finally let us mention two more recent books by Pisier.
* Pisier's introduction to the subject starts with the basic concepts in this theory and eventually leads the reader to top-notch results.
* Pisier's unique and clear way of presenting the material might even surprise researchers in the field: complicated results look very natural and simple in Pisier's presentation.

Born 18 November 1950, Nouméa, New Caledonia.
