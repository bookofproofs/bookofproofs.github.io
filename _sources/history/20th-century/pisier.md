**Gilles Pisier** is a French mathematician, born in New Caledonia, whose main research field is functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a general theory of operators on Hilbert space that links together and unifies many branches of classical and modern functional analysis.
2. Pioneered the Study of Noncommutative Geometry Applied to Operator Algebras.
3. Pioneered and Led the Effort to Give a Unified Theory of Dirichlet Forms.
4. Developed a Theory of Metric Structures on Noncommutative Spaces.
5. Resolved Deep Open Questions about Eigenvalue Distribution of Random Matrices and Band Random Matrices.
6. Investigated the Structure of Banach Spaces in an Innovative Way by Introducing the Concept of Types.
7. Developed the Theory of Holomorphic Automorphisms of Operator Algebras.
8. Established the Uniqueness Theory of L2-Norms and Provided an Alternative Proof of Voiculescu's Theorem on Algorithmically Constructible Factors.
9. Developed a Theory Based on Iterated Function Systems for Computing Liouville's Brownian Motion Numbers.
10. Derived Results on Uniformly Hyperbolic Systems That Provided Important Insights Into Nonlinear Dynamics and Approximation Theory.

Born 18 November 1950, Noum√©a, New Caledonia.
