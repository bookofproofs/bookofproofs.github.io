**Franz Kahn** was a mathematician and astrophysicist who was a professor at the University of Manchester. He was a world leading expert in theoretical studies of the dynamics of the interstellar medium.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a number of theories in algebraic geometry and non-Euclidean geometry.
2. Discovered and proved the divergence theorem in Euclidean geometry.
3. Published the groundbreaking work Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, a treatise on number theory.
4. Formulated the Kahn-Meyer theorem that estimates the complexity of algorithms.
5. Devised the notions of Fano plane and Witt Vectors, essential for projective and algebraic geometry.
6. Worked on the foundations of combinatorics and the theory of formal languages.
7. Pioneered the use of algebraic curves in cryptography.
8. Invented the Kahn-machine, a mechanical calculator that solves linear equations.

Born 13 May 1926, Nuremberg, Bayern, Germany. Died 8 February 1998, Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, England.
