**Louis Auslander** was an American mathematician who worked in both in pure and applied mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Both Charles Auslander and Ida emigrated to the United States in 1907 when they were babies.
* Maurice Auslander also became a prominent mathematician and has a biography in this archive.
* Louis Auslander was educated in Brooklyn, New York, where he completed both his primary and secondary education.
* Louis was a talented and devoted mathematician.
* After the award of his doctorate in 1954, Auslander was appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics at Yale University.
* Auslander and Moore published the joint paper Unitary representations of solvable Lie groups in 1966.
* Leaving Purdue, Auslander taught at the Belfer Graduate School of Science, Yeshiva University, before joining the faculty at the City University Graduate Center of the City University of New York in 1965.
* It was in 1971 that Auslander was named Distinguished Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science at the City University of New York.
* Although he began his mathematical career firmly within pure mathematics, Auslander became equally at home with applications.
* We note that the term "cotangent space" appears for the first time in Auslander's 1955 paper The use of forms in variational calculations.
* He wrote many books including: (with Lawrence Markus) Flat Lorentz Three Manifolds (1959), (with Leon W Green and Frank J Hahn) Flows on Homogeneous Spaces (1963), (with Robert E MacKenzie) Introduction to Differentiable Manifolds (1963), (with Calvin C Moore) Unitary Representations of Solvable Lie Groups (1966), Differential Geometry (1967), What are numbers (1969), Calculus: a first course (1971), (with Frank J Avenoso, Philip Cheifetz, Eldon Dyer, Allan Gerwitz, Beryl E Hunte, Louis V Quintas and Harry E Rauch) Mathematics Through Statistics (1973), (with Richard Tolimieri) Abelian harmonic analysis, theta functions and function algebras on a nilmanifold (1975), and Lecture notes on nil-theta functions (1977).

Born 12 July 1928, Brooklyn, New York, USA. Died 25 February 1997, New York, USA.
