**Louis Auslander** was an American mathematician who worked in both in pure and applied mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach in 1946, providing a central meeting point for mathematicians from universities across Europe.
2. Co-authored a widely-used textbook on algebraic topology with Karl Reidemeister.
3. Developed the homological techniques for solving partial differential equations.
4. Co-developed the Brouwer fixed point theorem with Dirk Struik.
5. Successfully implemented the concept of a professor for algebra in the University of Freiburg, creating a leading center for research and teaching in algebraic geometry.

Born 12 July 1928, Brooklyn, New York, USA. Died 25 February 1997, New York, USA.
