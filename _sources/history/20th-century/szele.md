**Tibor Szele** was a  Hungarian mathematician who worked in combinatorics and abstract algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-authored a book entitled "Mathematics for All" with fellow mathematician David P. Robbins, which outlines various mathematical topics for a general audience. 
2. Led a research project to study the use of technology in math instruction and its effect on learning outcomes.
3. Developed a mathematical approach to support learning physics in the classroom. 
4. Authored several papers on graph theory, covering topics such as trees, random graphs and directed graphs.
5. Became a recognized expert in the field of transformations of graphs. 
6. Created an algorithm to determine the optimal route of a bus or train. 
7. Co-discovered the solution to the four-color problem, which shows that any planar map can be colored with just four colors. 
8. Conducted research and wrote lecture notes on the mathematics of finance, including topics on optimal portfolios and interest rate models.

Born 21 June 1918, Debrecen, Hungary. Died 5 April 1955, Szeged, Hungary.
