**Domokos Szász** is a Hungarian mathematician known for his work in mathematical physics and dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Domokos Szász contributed to the development of algebraic topology, one of the most important fields of mathematics.
2. He worked on Poincaré duality, providing independent proofs of Poincaré’s fundamental results.
3. He provided fundamental contributions to the spectral sequence theory, a powerful tool in homological algebra.
4. He extended the definition of the homology of CW complexes to G-spaces, a class of topological spaces with a group action of a topological group.
5. He constructed the Szász-Fomin homology to study group actions on CW complexes.
6. He was the first to realize the significance of surgery theory and to find a way to axiomatize some aspects of surgery theory.
7. He also studied finite abelian groups, their cohomology and projective modules, linking them to Poincaré duality.

Born 18 August 1941, Budapest, Hungary.
