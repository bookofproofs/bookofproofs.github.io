**Domokos Szász** is a Hungarian mathematician known for his work in mathematical physics and dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1969 Szász received the Géza Grünwald Commemorative Prize from the János Bolyai Mathematical Society, an award given to outstanding young mathematicians.
* This was a highly productive time for Szász who published six papers in 1971, one in English, two in Hungarian and three in Russian.
* Szász was appointed to the Mathematical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1971.
* The prize was presented to Szász on National Day (15 March) by Ferenc Mádl, the President of Hungary.
* Let us look briefly at a couple of the problems to which Szász has made major contributions.
* The Boltzmann-Sinai conjecture was proved for three balls in 1991 by A Krámli, N Simányi and D Szász.
* Szász, working with different co-investigators, examined the recurrence of such a system when there is a periodic configuration of scatterers.
* Szász married in 1975 and has a daughter and two sons.

Born 18 August 1941, Budapest, Hungary.
