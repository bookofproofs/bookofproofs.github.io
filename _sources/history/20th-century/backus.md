**John Backus** was an American mathematician best known for the invention of FORTRAN and for the BNF notation for describing the syntax of a programming language.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Backus-Naur form (BNF), the widely-used notation for describing the syntax of programming languages.
2. Formulated a practical system for numerical integration which is now used in computers to calculate integrals.
3. Developed FORTRAN, which is considered the first successful high-level language. 
4. Was one of four IBMers who won the Turing Award in 1977.
5. Led the IBM team which developed the Mathematical Formula Translating System (MFT), one of the first autocoded programs. 
6. Demonstrated the values of compilers and system programming and their significance to computer technology.

Born 3 December 1924, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 17 March 2007, Ashland, Jackson, Oregon, USA.
