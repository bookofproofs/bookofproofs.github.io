**John Backus** was an American mathematician best known for the invention of FORTRAN and for the BNF notation for describing the syntax of a programming language.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Elizabeth Edsall, John's mother, was the daughter of a Wilmington physician.
* They had three children, Anne Hall Backus (born 25 March 1922), John Warner Backus (the subject of this biography) and Cecil Franklin Backus Jr. The family were well off and during the years that Cecil and Elizabeth Backus were married they collected high quality American antique furniture.
* After John's mother Elizabeth died, his father married Alice Beaver Candee (1901-1992) on 12 June 1935 in Wilmington, New Castle, Delaware.
* John spent his first years in Wilmington, Delaware and then attended the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania.
* John Backus entered the University of Virginia to study chemistry at his father's request.
* The Battle of the Bulge, the major German offensive in December 1944, saw the largest number of American casualties in the war and many of Backus's friends were killed.
* Backus married Marjorie; they had two daughters Karen and Paula.
* As a consequence, Backus entered Columbia University, New York, to study mathematics.
* The test was a puzzle set by Robert R Seeber, known as Rex, and after Backus solved it he was offered a job on the spot.
* Backus joined IBM as a programmer in the Pure and Applied Science Departments in 1950.
* Understanding the difficulties of programming, Backus invented a program he named Speedcoding.
* The team, appointed by Backus to assist him develop FORTRAN whose specifications he had already drawn up, was headed by Backus.
* In 1959 he invented what is now called the Backus Naur Form (BNF), a standard notation to describe the syntax of a high level programming language.
* Let us return to give a few more details of Backus's personal life.
* In 1966 Backus and his wife Marjorie were divorced.
* Just before they split up, Marjorie introduced Backus to Barbara Una Stannard (1927-2004) who was born Barbara Garlitz.
* Backus and Barbara, a poet and author with a Ph.D. from Harvard, were married on 18 July 1968 in San Francisco County, California.
* Backus received many honours for his outstanding contributions to computer science.
* We should say a few words about Backus's political views.
* Backus was also an opponent of the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative set up in 1984.
* Backus retired in 1991 and, after the death of his wife in 2004, he went to live in Ashland, Oregon to be near one of his daughters.

Born 3 December 1924, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 17 March 2007, Ashland, Jackson, Oregon, USA.
