**John Backus** was an American mathematician best known for the invention of FORTRAN and for the BNF notation for describing the syntax of a programming language.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* John spent his first years in Wilmington, Delaware and then attended the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania.
* The Battle of the Bulge, the major German offensive in December 1944, saw the largest number of American casualties in the war and many of Backus's friends were killed.
* As a consequence, Backus entered Columbia University, New York, to study mathematics.
* The test was a puzzle set by Robert R Seeber, known as Rex, and after Backus solved it he was offered a job on the spot.
* Backus joined IBM as a programmer in the Pure and Applied Science Departments in 1950.
* Understanding the difficulties of programming, Backus invented a program he named Speedcoding.
* The team, appointed by Backus to assist him develop FORTRAN whose specifications he had already drawn up, was headed by Backus.
* In 1959 he invented what is now called the Backus Naur Form (BNF), a standard notation to describe the syntax of a high level programming language.
* Let us return to give a few more details of Backus's personal life.
* Just before they split up, Marjorie introduced Backus to Barbara Una Stannard (1927-2004) who was born Barbara Garlitz.
* Backus received many honours for his outstanding contributions to computer science.
* Backus was also an opponent of the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative set up in 1984.

Born 3 December 1924, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 17 March 2007, Ashland, Jackson, Oregon, USA.
