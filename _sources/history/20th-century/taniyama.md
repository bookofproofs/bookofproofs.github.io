**Yutaka Taniyama** was a Japanese mathematician best known for the Tanayama-Shimura conjecture, whose proof led to a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He introduced the concept of "zeta functions" in his doctoral thesis in 1940, which embedded the theory of numbers in a broader context. 
2. He introduced the “Taniyama–Shimura Conjecture” (also known as “Modularity Theorem"), which states that every elliptic curve over the rational numbers is associated with a modular form (i.e., a certain kind of analytic function defined on the upper half plane).
3. He helped discovered the "Taniyama–Shimura–Weil theorem," which has a major role in the field of Number Theory. 
4. He was the first to suggest a link between Fermat's Last Theorem and elliptic curves in 1955.
5. He developed the Langlands correspondence, an influential theory linking number theory and algebraic geometry to representation theory. 
6. He helped develop the Shimura–Taniyama conjecture, which is a far-reaching generalization of the modularity theorem. 
7. He was the first to introduce the idea of the "zeta function" of an elliptic curve.

Born 12 November 1927, Kisai (north of Tokyo), Japan. Died 17 November 1958, Tokyo, Japan.
