**Yutaka Taniyama** was a Japanese mathematician best known for the Tanayama-Shimura conjecture, whose proof led to a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was intended to be Toyo Taniyama but most people read it as Yutaka, a more common form, and Taniyama eventually came to use Yutaka himself.
* His parents were Sahei, a medical doctor, and Kaku Taniyama.
* His meeting with Andr√© Weil at this symposium was to have a major influence on Taniyama's work.
* Other than these two papers the only other paper Taniyama published was Distribution of positive 0-cycles in absolute classes of an algebraic variety with finite constant field (1958).
* Although they planned an English version, they lost enthusiasm and never found the time to write it before Taniyama's death.
* One might reasonably ask what Taniyama's interests were other than mathematics.

Born 12 November 1927, Kisai (north of Tokyo), Japan. Died 17 November 1958, Tokyo, Japan.
