**Maxim Kontsevich** is a Russian and French mathematician best known for his work on geometric aspects of mathematical physics including knot theory, quantisation, and mirror symmetry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Fields Medal in 1998 for his work on algebraic geometrical mirror symmetry.
2. Received the Crafoord Prize in 2008 for his work in Algebraic and Symplectic Geometry.
3. Solved Kontsevich's conjecture on some mathematical conjectures related to the homological mirror theory.
4. Developed a mathematical framework that could be used to calculate the number of solutions to integrals that other mathematicians previously found impossible to calculate.
5. Co-founded and established the first mathematical seminar at the independent University of the Masses in Moscow in 1992.
6. Given credits for the development of a new homological field theory related to the Grothendieck-Teichmüller group.
7. Created a new branch of mathematics, known as motivic integration.
8. Received the Dannie Heineman Mathematical Prize in 2013 for his work in algebraic geometry and topology.

Born 25 August 1964, Khimki, near Moscow, Russia.
