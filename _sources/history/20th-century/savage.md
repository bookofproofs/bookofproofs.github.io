**Leonard Jimmie Savage** was an American mathematician and statistician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical foundations of subjective probability and decision theory, which laid the foundation of modern Bayesian statistics.
2. Awarded the National Medal of Science for his contributions to the decision sciences. 
3. Pioneered a mathematical research program focusing on the foundations of rational decision-making.
4. Authored a series of papers establishing the principle of maximum entropy in data analysis and statistical decision theory. 
5. Developed the Savage–Dickey density ratio for testing goodness-of-fit of hypotheses.
6. Co-authored a study that defined three principles of decision-making that are now known as the Savage axioms.
7. Wrote the book The Foundations of Statistics, which is considered one of the most influential textbooks in the discipline.
8. Developed the first central limit theorem specifically formulated for a subjective probability distribution. 
9. Authored a book on measurements error and errors of statistics, The Axioms of Symmetry.
10. Drafted the first general formula for Bayes' theorem.

Born 20 November 1917, Detroit, Michigan, USA. Died 1 November 1971, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.
