**Olga Oleinik** was a Ukrainian mathematician who worked on the theory of partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Given Petrovsky's expertise in differential equations, the topology of algebraic curves and surfaces and mathematical physics, it is not difficult to see his influence on the direction that Oleinik's work would take.
* It is a work in three chapters which studies the mathematical theory of perforated elastic bodies and builds into one volume many papers that Oleinik and her two coauthors had produced in the preceding 10 years.
* It is self-contained and the reader with background in partial differential equations and continuum mechanics can learn the homogenization techniques developed by Oleinik and her coauthors.
* In 1993, together with V V Zhikov and S M Kozlov, Oleinik published a Russian work Averaging of differential operators and in the following year an English translation appeared with the title Homogenization of differential operators and integral functionals.
* In 1996 Oleinik published Some asymptotic problems in the theory of partial differential equations.
* Many results which Oleinik obtained over the previous years appear in this volume for the first time.
* Oleinik considers equations satisying Dirichlet boundary conditions and ones which satisfy Neumann boundary conditions.
* Oleinik also studies the homogenization problem for linear elliptic equations in domains with the property that half is perforated and half contains no holes.
* Oleinik published Mathematical methods in boundary-layer theory in 1997, jointly with V N Samokhin.
* Oleinik and her many collaborators are responsible for developing most of this theory over the last four decades.
* Oleinik received many honours for her work.
* In 1981 University of Rome gave Oleinik an honorary doctorate and in 1996 Oleinik was the Association for Women in Mathematics Noether Lecturer.

Born 2 July 1925, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine). Died 13 October 2001, Moscow, Russia.
