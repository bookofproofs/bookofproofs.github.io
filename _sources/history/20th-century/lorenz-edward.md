**Edward Lorenz** was an American mathematician and meteorologist first recognised the phenomenum of chaos in complex systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Lorenz attractor, a dynamical system underlying chaotic phenomena.
2. Originated the system of equations that shaped modern chaos theory.
3. Developed the mathematical theory of prediction based on chaotic systems.
4. Constructed a mathematical model that could predict how small changes in input could drastically affect the output.
5. Pioneered the idea of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, commonly known as the butterfly effect, which has become a metaphor for chaotic behavior.
6. Made significant contributions to predicting weather patterns using mathematics.
7. Formulated a precise, mathematical definition of turbulence and its relation to chaos.
8. Developed the continued fraction map as a new method for describing chaotic systems.
9. Conducted pioneering research on nonlinear dynamics and their application to meteorology and other disciplines.

Born 23 May1917, West Hartford, Connecticut, USA. Died 16 April 2008, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
