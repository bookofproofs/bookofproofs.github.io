**László Rédei** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked on algebraic number theory and abstract algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In the following year he was awarded his doctorate but, before the award of his doctorate, Rédei had already become a secondary teacher of mathematics, taking up his first teaching appointment in 1921.
* For nearly twenty years Rédei worked as a secondary school teacher.
* By 1940, the year he moved from secondary school teaching to become a lecturer at Szeged University, Rédei had published over 35 papers on algebraic number theory, particularly on class groups of quadratic number fields.
* To understand how a vacancy occurred at the University in Szeged we need to look at the events which began while Rédei was undertaking research in Budapest.
* However Gyula Szokefalvi-Nagy left the Bolyai Institute in Szeged and moved to Cluj, with Rédei becoming his replacement.
* In 1941 Rédei was appointed to the Chair of Geometry in Szeged but later he was appointed to the Chair of Algebra and Number Theory.
* Let us look now at Rédei's work on algebraic number theory.
* However, when Rédei started work on the problem there was no information on the size of the cyclic components.
* This was not the only problem concerning quadratic number fields which Rédei investigated over this period.
* There are actually 21 such fields but Rédei did not achieve this classification.
* The other two main areas to which Rédei contributed are group theory and semigroup theory.
* One of Rédei's most important contributions to semigroup theory is his proof that every finitely generated commutative semigroup is finitely presented.
* Let us mention other important books written by Rédei.

Born 15 November 1900, Rákoskeresztur, Budapest, Hungary. Died 21 November 1980, Budapest, Hungary.
