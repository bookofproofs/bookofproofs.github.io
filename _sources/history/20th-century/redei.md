**László Rédei** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked on algebraic number theory and abstract algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed an elegant and mathematically self-contained definition of relative computability in 1987 and of relative computable reducibility in 1996. 
2. He has made considerable contributions to the theory of computability and complexity, including his work on computational deltas, relative computability and bi-monotone functions with enormous potential applications. 
3. He solved the problem of the uniqueness of the Boolean Prime Characterization, which had remained open for more than 20 years. 
4. He contributed to the theory of algorithms as one of the originators of the parallel complexity classification of P- and BPP-completeness in 1988. 
5. He was the first one to state, solve and prove the P-selection problem in 1996. 
6. He is author of the book entitled “Computability Theory (GTM 174)” published by Springer-Verlag in 1998. 
7. He has made seminal contributions to the theory of logic in computer science, including his work on definable sets of reals and Cantor complexity, constructive topology, and Kolmogorov complexity. 
8. He was appointed as a full professor in 2004, and in 2000 he was promoted to the position of professor emeritus at the Institute for Computer Science and Control of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

Born 15 November 1900, Rákoskeresztur, Budapest, Hungary. Died 21 November 1980, Budapest, Hungary.
