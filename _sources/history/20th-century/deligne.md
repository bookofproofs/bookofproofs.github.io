**Pierre Deligne** is a Belgian mathematician who won a Fields Medal for his work on algebraic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Deligne won the Fields Medal in 1978 for his work on the Weil conjectures. 
2. Deligne is acknowledged as one of the major figures in algebraic geometry of the twentieth century.
3. Deligne was instrumental in developing the concept of schemes and moduli spaces, two of the most important objects in algebraic geometry.
4. He is credited with the proof of the last of the Weil conjectures in 1973, putting a delicate class of algebraic varieties on a rigorous footing. 
5. He was awarded the Crafoord Prize in 1988 for his work in algebraic geometry, and the Abel Prize in 2013 for his contribution to the field of mathematics.
6. Deligne's proof of the Riemann Hypothesis for Varieties over Finite Fields won him the prestigious Fields Medal in 1978.
7. He further contributed to the proof of the Fermat's Last Theorem, a famous conjecture from the 17th century that had defied mathematicians for centuries.
8. Deligne has also worked on the results of the Grothendieck-Serre correspondence, and the general weight-monodromy conjecture.

Born 3 October 1944, Etterbeek, Brussels, Belgium.
