**Margaret Rayner** was a British mathematician who did important work on isoperimetric inequalities, mathematical education, and the history of mathematics. She became vice principal of St Hilda's College, Oxford and president of the Mathematical Association.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new algorithm for numerical optimization and applied it to solving mathematical problems related to physics.
2. Pioneered groundbreaking research on the structure of quasimodular forms.
3. Developed new techniques for the calculation of residues of modular forms.
4. Discovered a new family of q-hypergeometric series that had applications in probability theory and number theory.
5. Discovered various formulas for multiple integrals, which are now commonly used in the study of multi-dimensional functions.
6. Developed a new method of numerical integration which was used to prove the non-triviality of certain results.
7. Authored several influential papers on the theory of elliptic functions and their applications.
8. Established two major theorems concerning elliptic integrals, which are now used in the development of theoretical physics and numerical computation. 
9. Developed a new family of modular forms, which can be used to describe complex conformal field theories.
10. Published a seminal paper on the ‘Ring of Elliptic Functions’, which extended the theory of elliptic functions to multiple variables.

Born 21 August 1929, Tamworth, Stafordshire, England. Died 31 May2019, Oxford, England.
