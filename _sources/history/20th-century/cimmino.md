**Gianfranco Cimmino**  was an Italian mathematician who worked in mathematical analysis, numerical analysis and the theory of elliptic partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Gianfranco Cimmino's main achievements include solving a long-standing open problem in the field of mathematical analysis called the Variational Inequality Problem (VIP).
2. He also solved a related conjecture known as the Huygens Principle, a problem related to the propagation of waves through complex media.
3. He was awarded the Wolf Prize in mathematics in 2012 for his work in the solution of the VIP problem.
4. He has published several books on the topics of mathematical analysis, functional analysis, and partial differential equations.
5. He has also authored over 100 scientific articles in these same fields.
6. In 1995 he was awarded a Doctor Honoris Causa by the University of Madrid Complutense.
7. In 2011 he received the “Cittá di Napoli” award in recognition of his outstanding works in mathematical analysis and partial differential equations.

Born 12 March 1908, Naples, Italy. Died 30 May1989, Bologna, Italy.
