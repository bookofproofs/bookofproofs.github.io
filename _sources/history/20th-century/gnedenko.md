**Boris Gnedenko** was a Soviet mathematician  best known for his work in probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Central Limit Theorem, which states that under certain conditions the statistical average of samples of a given population distribution tends towards a normal distribution.
2. Established the theory of random walks in mathematics. 
3. Proved the criterion for the stability of a linear stochastic process.
4. Established Gnedenkoâ€™s law for the behavior of characteristic functions of probability distributions. 
5. Discovered a method of calculating the asymptotic distribution of sums of independent random variables.
6. Gave the first proof of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov convergence theorem.
7. Developed a theoretical framework to describe the behavior of random sequences in probability theory. 
8. Devised the family of generalized gamma distributions. 
9. Found a method of constructing an estimator for a density of an unknown variable.
10. Developed the theory of extremes of sums and sums sums of independent random variables.

Born 1 January 1912, Simbirsk (now Ulyanovskaya), Russia. Died 27 December 1995, Moscow, Russia.
