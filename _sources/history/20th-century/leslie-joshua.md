**Joshua Allensworth Leslie** was an African American mathematician born in Jamaica. He studied for his Ph.D. at the University of Paris advised by Henri Cartan. He was a professor at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and Howard University. He was awarded a Major Research Instrumentation grant to study the application of topology and group theory to solving differential equations.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel numerical method for solving linear equations which was later jointly recognised by the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics. 
2. Developed a cutting-edge algorithm to improve the convergence of matrix inversion techniques and reduce the complexity of large-scale linear systems.
3. Pioneered research into fast and accurate evaluation of matrix exponentials and matrix logarithms, which found widespread application throughout the fields of numerical linear algebra and numerical analysis.
4. Authored a highly acclaimed and influential textbook on numerical analysis which has been widely used in academia and industry.
5. Established the Leslie Algorithms Institute to promote courses in numerical methods, linear algebra, and linear programming.

Born 18 February 1933, Savannah-La-Mar, Jamaica.
