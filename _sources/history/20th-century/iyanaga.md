**Shokichi Iyanaga** was a Japanese mathematician who published some papers in topology, functional analysis, and geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to give a complete proof for the Mordell–Weil theorem on elliptic curves.
2. He gave a proof of the algebraic independence of certain combinations of values of the zeta function.
3. He proved the existence of a nonstandard model of arithmetic in which the usual laws of arithmetic fail.
4. He formulated the Iyanaga's Theorem on the number of prime numbers.
5. He established the complete theory of uniform algebraic topology.
6. He provided a formula for calculating general multiple zeta values.
7. He identified six problems, known as the Iyanaga Problems, which are still unsolved.
8. He developed an intermediate Jacobian theory in the theory of abelian varieties.
9. He formulated the notion of normal functions in the theory of algebraic curves.

Born 2 April 1906, Tokyo, Japan. Died 1 June 2006, Tokyo, Japan.
