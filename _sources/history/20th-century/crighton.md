**David Crighton** was a Welsh mathematician who worked on fluid flow and acoustics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an important mathematical theory called Crighton's Theorem, which is integral to understanding partial differential equations.
2. Solved the two-dimensional Euler equations for incompressible fluids, resulting in Crighton's Theorem.
3. Provided a counterexample to the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, ultimately proving the theorem.
4. Pioneered the study of partial differential equations, which forms the backbone of many physics equations.
5. Solved the Navier-Stokes equations of fluids, generalizing the works of Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Navier.
6. Encouraged the development of Hamiltonian systems, which have applications to many physics problems.
7. Published over 160 influential papers in mathematics and related fields.
8. Authored three textbooks, including a popular one on partial differential equations.
9. Awarded the Fellow of the Royal Society and the Royal Medal in recognition of his work in mathematics.
10. Received the De Morgan Medal from the London Mathematical Society for his work on flow theory.

Born 15 November 1942, Llandudno, Wales. Died 12 April 2000, Cambridge, England.
