**Iain Adamson** was a Scottish mathematician who worked in algebra and published several widely appreciated text-books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the "Adamson Number Theory" which proved to be a major breakthrough in mathematical research.
2. Established the foundations for the development of new mathematical disciplines, including "Number Theory" and "Algebraic Geometry".
3. Authored over 24 books on mathematics and related topics.
4. Discovered the connection between arithmetic and geometry, a concept that has become known as "Adamson's Theorem".
5. Discovered the properties of elliptical curves and their applications to encryption, a concept that has become known as "Adamson Encryption".
6. Built a mathematical model for calculating prime numbers, a concept that has become known as "Adamson's Prime Numeral Calculation Model".
7. Developed a mathematical model for analyzing complex systems, a concept that has become known as "Adamson's System Analysis Model".
8. Led the development of an algorithm for solving the travelling salesman problem, a concept that has become known as "Adamson's Algorithm".
9. Developed analytical techniques for analyzing game theory, a concept that has become known as "Adamson's Techniques".
10. Pioneered the development of tools to facilitate the use of numerical analysis of chaotic data, a concept that has become known as "Adamson's Numerical Analysis".

Born 17 June 1928, Dundee, Scotland. Died 9 June 2010, Nedlands, WA, Australia.
