**Iain Adamson** was a Scottish mathematician who worked in algebra and published several widely appreciated text-books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Iain's secondary education was at Morgan Academy in Dundee and, in 1945, he graduated as Dux of the Academy.
* After graduating from the University of St Andrews, Adamson went to Princeton University in the United States where he undertook research in algebra supervised by Emil Artin.
* Also in 1967, Queen's College became the new University of Dundee and Iain automatically changed from being employed by the University of St Andrews to being a lecturer in the University of Dundee.
* We will look at other aspects of Adamson's life later in this biography, but first we want to look at his greatest mathematical contribution which was as a writer of textbooks.
* Adamson's first textbook was Introduction to field theory (1964).
* Adamson's next book Rings, modules and algebras (1971) was again in his own specialist area of algebra.
* Adamson turned to analysis for his next textbook Elementary mathematical analysis (1975).
* From the information given above of Adamson's three papers on teaching elementary analysis, we could guess that his approach in this book would be innovative; indeed it is.
* Perhaps the two most successfully innovative textbooks by Adamson are A general topology workbook (1996), and A set theory workbook (1998).
* Also in 1996, Adamson published Data structures and algorithms.
* We promised to return to what we can only describe as "another side" of Adamson's life.
* When the University of Dundee asked if members of staff would consider early retirement with part-time re-engagement, Adamson accepted the offer.
* Iain quickly became a well known and well respected Minister, especially in regard to pastoral care where his willingness to be a listener rather than a speaker endeared him to people with problems.
* In 2001 Iain and Robin Adamson decided to go to Australia and take up permanent residence in Nedlands.

Born 17 June 1928, Dundee, Scotland. Died 9 June 2010, Nedlands, WA, Australia.
