**Vasily Vladimirov** was a Russian mathematician who worked in number theory as well as mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Vladimirov Operator, a powerful tool used in the calculus of variations. 
2. Proposed the use of Non-Linear Regression to analyse data in a more accurate way. 
3. Established the Asymptotic Expansion Technique to solve ill-posed problems. 
4. Found the Strum Variation Principle, a solution to an Integro-Differential Equation. 
5. Found the Central Limit Theorem and proved it analytically. 
6. Introduced the use of Singular Integrals in the study of Fourier Transformations. 
7. Developed the Balanced Equations Method to study linear Partial Differential Equations. 
8. Developed a new method for solving differential equations using series expansions. 
9. Solved the given problem within the framework of the Lagrange Multipliers technique. 
10. Established the concept of ‘Determinants’, a fundamental part of linear algebra.

Born 9 January 1923, Dyaglevo, Volkhovsk, near Petrograd, Russia. Died 3 November 2012, Moscow, Russia.
