**Friedrich  Schmidt** was a German mathematician who made contributions to algebra and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Schmidt Decomposition, a powerful tool for analyzing partial differential equations.
2. Found a generalization of the Goursat problem to nonlinear hyperbolic equations.
3. Researched and wrote the book "Theorie der Gewöhnlichen Differentialgleichungen" (Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations).
4. Demonstrated a general relationship between the instability of a single particle system and the linear stability of the equilibrium.
5. Contributed significantly to the foundations of numerical analysis.
6. Published several important articles in the journal "Mathematische Zeitschrift".
7. Pioneered the use of analytic and numerical techniques for analyzing nonlinear partial differential equations.
8. Demonstrated a theory of strong stability for nonlinear hyperbolic equations.

Born 22 September 1901, Düsseldorf, Germany. Died 25 January 1977, Heidelberg, Germany.
