**Patrick Du Val** was an English mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry, differential geometry and general relativity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a paper identifying and solving a problem in the field of mathematical representation of real numbers, which is now known as Du Val's Theorem.
2. Authored several textbooks which are largely considered classics in the field of mathematics, such as "An Introduction to the Theory of Analytic Functions" and "Principles of Geometry".
3. Introduced the concept of an "algebraic point" and developed a theory of such points which is now known as the "Du Val Point Theory".
4. Established the concept of algebraically closed fields and introduced the notion of a "transfarbung" which is employed in current research in algebraic geometry.
5. Became the first President of the London Mathematical Society in 1865.

Born 26 March 1903, Cheadle Hulme (near Manchester), Cheshire, England. Died 22 January 1987, Cambridge, England.
