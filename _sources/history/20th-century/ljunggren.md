**Wilhelm Ljunggren** was a Norwegian mathematician who specialised in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Wilhelm attended secondary school in Oslo, graduating in 1925.
* Ljunggren won the prize in his final year at secondary school.
* Ljunggren graduated in 1931 and Thoralf Skolem, who was a student of Axel Thue, had advised him during the research for his Master's thesis.
* Skolem moved to the Christian Michelsen's Institute in Bergen as a Research Associate in 1930 and so Ljunggren, who wished to keep in contact with Skolem, accepted a position as a secondary school teacher in Bergen.
* Ljunggren undertook research in number theory during the years he taught at the secondary school in Bergen and he submitted his doctoral thesis to the University of Oslo in 1937.
* Ljunggren followed Skolem to Oslo, for in 1938 he became a teacher at the Hegedehaugen School.
* The University of Bergen was founded in 1946 and, three years later, Ljunggren was appointed as professor of mathematics there.
* Although Ljunggren quickly built up a strong teaching department in Bergen he took the opportunity to return to Oslo in 1956 when he was offered the chair of mathematics there.
* By this time Skolem was retiring and Ljunggren took over the responsibilities of keeping Oslo as a leading institution for mathematics.
* Ljunggren taught part-time at the Technical Institute to help his friend build its reputation.
* Almost all of Ljunggren's research was on Diophantine equations.
* One of Ljunggren's main interests was Diophantine equations of degree 4.
* In the paper Ljunggren found bounds for the number of integer solutions for some special equations of this type.
* Here is one further example of the results obtained by Ljunggren.
* On the other hand, Ljunggren submitted also many problems, addressed to university students as well as high-school pupils.

Born 7 October 1905, Oslo, Norway. Died 25 January 1973, Oslo, Norway.
