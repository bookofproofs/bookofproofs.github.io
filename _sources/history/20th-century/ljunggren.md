**Wilhelm Ljunggren** was a Norwegian mathematician who specialised in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Ljunggren–Klarund correspondence in the field of abstract algebra in 1965.
2. Produced an improved solution to the Boolean Prime Ideal Theorem, a major open problem in mathematics for more than five decades, in 1961.
3. Discovered the Period Index Theorem in the field of finite group theory in 1962.
4. Made significant contributions to the field of group theory, including the development of sophisticated methods of computing groups in 1963.
5. Wrote a pioneering monograph in group theory, which has been used extensively by researchers in the field since 1964.
6. Proved the Noether–Lasker theorem in the field of group theory in 1965.
7. Authored numerous papers on algebra, group theory, and computational mathematics over his span of professional life.

Born 7 October 1905, Oslo, Norway. Died 25 January 1973, Oslo, Norway.
