**George Okikiolu** is a Nigerian mathematician and inventor who published papers on integral operators on Banach spaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* James Okikiolu was a Yoruba from Abeokuta in Western Nigeria while Anwan was a daughter of the Obong of Calabar, a title which essentially means the King of Calabar.
* George had a twin sister Elizabeth O Okikiolu.
* Their parents gave their children the names George and Elizabeth after the recently crowned king and queen of Great Britain.
* In 1959 George, his twin sister Elizabeth, and a younger brother Victor O Okikiolu (born 6 May 1944) sailed from Lagos to England on the ship Aureol.
* George and his twin sister Elizabeth took accommodation at 29 Ravenshaw Street, Hampstead, London, and George Okikiolu matriculated at Sir John Cass College on Jewry Street.
* George and Patricia Okikiolu were married on 19 September 1962.
* After the marriage Okikiolu, his wife, and his sister, all lived at 29 Ravenshaw Street, Hampstead.
* In 1963 Okikiolu graduated with a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics, from the University of London.
* After the award of his first degree, in 1964 Okikiolu accepted an assistant lectureship at Battersea College, London, while continuing to study for a Master's Degree from the University of London.
* While on the one-year appointment at Battersea College, Okikiolu applied for assistant lectureships in various universities and was offered an appointment at the University of Sussex.
* We note that by 1965 only Elizabeth Okikiolu is at 29 Ravenshaw Street, Hampstead, while George and Patricia Okikiolu were living at 11 Beverley Gardens, Richmond upon Thames, England.
* George and Patricia Okikiolu's first child was Jeannie Adetokunbo Okikiolu.
* Their second daughter, Katherine Adebola Okikiolu (born 1965), known at Kate Okikiolu, became a mathematician and has a biography in this archive.
* After one year at the University of Sussex, Okikiolu was offered an appointment at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, Suffolk, which he took up in 1966.
* Okikiolu did not write a Ph.D. thesis but published extensively in the leading mathematical journals.
* Indeed it was one of "a number of papers", being one of the nine papers that Okikiolu published in 1966.
* By 1970 Okikiolu had published 24 papers and was writing the book Aspects of the Theory of Bounded Integral Operators in Lp  Spaces, which was published by Academic Press in 1971.
* Okikiolu took his 24 papers and this book and submitted them to the University of London for a D.Sc. which he was awarded in 1971.
* In 1972 he set up the Okikiolu Science and Industrial Organisation, London, and began to create inventions and apply for patents for them.
* In fact his paper Uniformly bounded projections and semi-groups of operators, published in 1974, gives his address as Okikiolu Science and Industrial Organisation, 23 Mile End Road, Norwich.
* Okikiolu and his wife separated in 1974 and were formally divorced in 1980.
* Despite this work on inventions, Okikiolu continued to published many mathematical papers and books.
* His two volume work, Special integral operators, was published in 1980, 1981 by his own Okikiolu Science and Industrial Organisation.
* In 1981 Okikiolu began publishing a mathematical journal with the title Bulletin of Mathematics.
* By 1986 twenty-one parts had been published each part containing 2, 3 or 4 papers by Okikiolu.
* The journal stopped publication in 1986 and by that time Okikiolu had published around 60 papers in it.
* Only one paper by a mathematician other than Okikiolu  appears to have been published in this journal.
* but we have been unable to find any books published by Okikiolu after 1989.

Born 18 July 1941, Aba, Nigeria.
