**George Okikiolu** is a Nigerian mathematician and inventor who published papers on integral operators on Banach spaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. George Olatokunbo Okikiolu is renowned for his groundbreaking work on mathematical analysis, particularly pertaining to nonlinear partial differential equations, in the 1960s and 1970s.
2. He made significant contributions to the theory of operator algebras and to elliptic differential equations.
3. His seminal paper on hyperbolic equations with degenerate coefficients was a turning point in the development of the subject.
4. He also developed a singular integral equation for the Helmholtz equation and a generalized Lerayâ€“Schauder theorem for quasilinear elliptic equations.
5. He showed the existence of a C1-preserving homeomorphism from any convex metric space.
6. He solved the problem of the regularity of free boundaries in the harmonic measure.
7. He introduced the Lp-transform and furthered the development of the theory of pseudo-differential operators.
8. He was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice, France, in 1970.

Born 18 July 1941, Aba, Nigeria.
