**Chandrasekhar** was awarded the Physics Nobel prize for his theoretical work on the gravitational collapse of stars.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Calculated the maximum mass of a stable White Dwarf star in the 1930s—dubbed the “Chandrasekhar Limit”.
2. Developed the theory of stellar structure that revealed the physical processes of stars, such as their evolution and the origin of isotopes.
3. Developed the mathematical theory of radiative transfer.
4. Proved the stability of an ideal gas of electrons which contributed to the quantum theory of transport processes in a plasma.
5. Was the first to understand the process of gravitational contraction—the process by which stars convert gravitational energy into light.

Born 19 October 1910, Lahore, India (now Pakistan). Died 21 August 1995, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
