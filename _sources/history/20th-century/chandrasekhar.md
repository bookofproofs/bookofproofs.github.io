**Chandrasekhar** was awarded the Physics Nobel prize for his theoretical work on the gravitational collapse of stars.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father was C Subrahmanyan Ayyar and his mother was Sitalaksmi Aiyar.
* He had a role model in his paternal uncle Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman who went on to win the Nobel prize in 1930 for his 1928 discovery of Raman scattering and the Raman effect, which is a change in the wavelength of light occurring when a beam of light is deflected by molecules.
* She was an ever-present support for Chandrasekhar during their fifty-nine years together.
* Chandrasekhar published around 400 papers and many books.
* In 1930 Chandra showed that a star of a mass greater than 1.4 times that of the Sun (now known as the Chandrasekhar's limit) had to end its life by collapsing into an object of enormous density unlike any object known at that time.
* From 1952 until 1971 Chandrasekhar was editor of the Astrophysical Journal .
* Chandrasekhar received many honours for his outstanding contributions some of which, such as the Nobel prize for Physics in 1983, the Royal Society's Royal Medal of 1962 and their Copley Medal of 1984, we have mentioned above.
* Chandrasekhar remained active and published in final major book Newton's Principia for the Common Reader at 85 years of age in the final months of his life.

Born 19 October 1910, Lahore, India (now Pakistan). Died 21 August 1995, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
