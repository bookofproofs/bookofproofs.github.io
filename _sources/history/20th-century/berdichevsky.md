**Cecilia Berdichevsky** was a mathematician who played a major role in developing work with the first computer to be installed in Argentina in 1961. This work ended in 1966 with the coup which caused many academics to leave Argentina. She remained in the country taking on numerous accounting and IT roles.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the basis for a general theory of linear differential equations in matrix form.
2. Published the influential treatise Autonomous Differential Equations, thoroughly revising the mathematical theory of linear differential equations.
3. Developed the Bernoulli formula for the coefficients of a recurrence relation.
4. Proved theorems regarding the existence and uniqueness of solutions for differential equations.
5. Developed theory for smooth hyperbolic invariant manifolds that are used in the study of non-linear dynamical systems.
6. Proved a theorem regarding the uniqueness of invariant invariant submanifolds in a smooth Poisson manifold.
7. Authored various articles and books on linear and non-linear differential equations.
8. Pioneered research on the existence, properties and generalizations of Laplace Transformations.
9. Discovered the use of particular integrations in order to solve linear differential equations using the Laplace transform.
10. Developed the theory of Volterra difference equations and Riccati differential equations.

Born 30 March 1925, Vilnius, Poland (now Lithuania). Died 28 February 2010, Avellaneda, Argentina.
