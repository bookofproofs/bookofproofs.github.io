**Lothar Collatz**  was a German mathematician who worked in numerical analysis and is best known for the eponymous "3_x_ + 1 problem".

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the existence of finite 13x+1 sequence in 1937.
2. Initiated the research on the 3x+1 problem in 1937.
3. Developed the Gauss–Newton iteration method to solve non-linear equations.
4. Contributed to the foundations of modern graph theory.
5. Developed Collatz conjecture, one of the most famous unsolved mathematical problems.
6. Pioneered the numerical methods for solving systems of non-linear equations.
7. Influential figure in number theory, mathematical analysis, and probability theory.

Born 6 July 1910, Arnsberg, Westphalia, Germany. Died 26 September 1990, Varna, Bulgaria.
