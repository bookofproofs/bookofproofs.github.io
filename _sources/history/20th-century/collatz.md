### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Collatz was awarded his doctorate in 1935 for his dissertation Das Differenzenverfahren mit höherer Approximation für lineare Differentialgleichunge Ⓣ(Difference methods with higher approximation for linear differential equations).
* Many will know the name of Collatz today because of the "Collatz problem".
* The Collatz problem is simple to state.
* In 1943 Collatz was appointed to a professorship at the Technical University of Hanover.
* MathSciNet lists 238 items under Collatz' name.
* Collatz began publishing important books early in his career.
* Later texts by Collatz include Optimization problems (1975) and Differential equations (1986), the second of these being an English translation of an earlier German book.
* Collatz received many honours for his contributions including election to the German Academy of Scientists Leopoldina, the academy at Bologna and that at Modena.
