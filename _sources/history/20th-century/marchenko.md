**Vladimir Alexandrovich Marchenko** is a Ukrainian-born mathematician who specializes in mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Marchenko–Pastur Law for random matrices, which describes the eigenvalue distribution of the Wishart matrix in high-dimensional data analysis.
2. Proposed a theory of random matrices that shed light on the properties of wave transmission in random media.
3. Developed a central limit theorem in random matrix theory, including the Marchenko–Dzintari theorem, which gave a statistical description of wave transmission coherence.
4. Defined a concept of determinantal random point processes, which are recognized as the most useful approach for understanding certain types of wave propagation in disordered media.
5. Authored over 40 mathematical papers in the field of Random Matrices and Wave Transmission.
6. Received the Lenin Prize in 1990 for achievements in mathematics and wave propagation. 
7. Delivered numerous lectures on random matrices, wave propagation, and their applications. 
8. Published four books on random matrices and statistical properties of wave transmission.

Born 7 July 1922, Kharkov, Ukraine.
