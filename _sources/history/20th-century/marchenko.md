**Vladimir Alexandrovich Marchenko** is a Ukrainian-born mathematician who specializes in mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He married Olga Fedorovna who was a school teacher from St Petersburg, and they had four children: Irina, Dmitri, Sergei and Vladimir.
* By the time their youngest son Vladimir was born in 1922, Alexander Grigoryevich was a professor at the Institute in Kharkov.
* Vladimir Aleksandrovich's childhood was far from easy.
* Despite the difficulties, Vladimir Aleksandrovich had a good school education learning foreign languages and excelling at chemistry which was his favourite subject.
* After graduating from high school in 1939, Vladimir Aleksandrovich entered the Department of Physics in Leningrad University.
* Marchenko was not called up for military service since he was severely myopic.
* Little could be done to halt the German advance as their armies approached Kharkov, nor was fleeing a realistic option by this time, so Marchenko remained in Kharkov with his mother, Irina and her daughter, all other members of the family having left earlier.
* During this time of great hardship Marchenko was able to use his expertise in chemistry to good advantage since he was able to manufacture salt and matches which were is very short supply.
* After the city was finally liberated on 23 August 1943, Marchenko was able to continue his education which he did in the Mathematics Department of the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Kharkov University.
* In addition to Landkof, Marchenko was influenced by other Kharkov mathematicians, particularly Naum Il'ich Akhiezer, an expert on function theory and approximation theory, and Aleksandr Yakovlevich Povzner (1915-2008) who was the first to apply the technique of transformation operators of Volterra type to spectral theory in 1948.
* Marchenko was appointed onto the staff in 1950 and worked at Kharkov University as an assistant professor in the Department of the Theory of Functions.
* In that year Marchenko was appointed to the Physical-Technical Institute of Low Temperature of the National Academy of Sciences of the Ukraine.
* This Institute in Kharkov had been founded in 1960 largely through the efforts of Boris Ieremievich Verkin (1919-1990) who had been a friend of Marchenko's since they were children growing up in Kharkov.
* Discussions between Verkin and Marchenko led to the, perhaps surprising yet very successful, decision to create a mathematics department within the Institute and Marchenko was appointed Head of the Department of Mathematical Physics at the Institute.
* In the 1950s Marchenko was influenced by ideas of his colleagues Akhiezer and Povzner.
* With great success, Marchenko applied his methods to the Schr√∂dinger equation.
* Later Marchenko published monographs on this work: Spectral theory of Strum-Liouville operators (1972); and Sturm-Liouville operators and their applications (1977).
* The periodic case of the Korteweg-de Vries equation was solved by Marchenko in 1972.
* In addition to the important monographs mentioned above, other major texts written by Marchenko include Nonlinear equations and operator algebras (1986).
* In 1992 Marchenko's monograph Orthogonal functions of a discrete argument and their application in geophysics  was published and in 2005, in collaboration with Evgeni Yakovlevich Khruslov, he wrote Homogenization of partial differential equations.
* The characteristics of Vladimir Aleksandrovich's pedagogic activities are a high academic standard and a continuing quest for new methods of instruction.
* Marchenko has received numerous honours.
* Outside mathematics, Marchenko is married with a son and a daughter.

Born 7 July 1922, Kharkov, Ukraine.
