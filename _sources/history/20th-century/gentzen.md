**Gerhard Gentzen** invented a 'natural deduction' which provided a logic closer to mathematical reasoning than the systems proposed by Frege, Russell and Hilbert.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. First and foremost, Gerhard Gentzen is credited with introducing the sequent calculus to the field of mathematical logic.
2. He was a pioneer in the development of the proof theory of classical first-order logic and his proofs of the consistency of Peano arithmetic and predicate calculus are considered a major accomplishment.
3. He is known for his discovery of the Hauptsatz or `main theorem,’ which allowed for the construction of logical systems with a cut-elimination proof procedure.
4. In addition, Gentzen proved that if a set of logical formulas is consistent, then there exists an infinite set of derivable theorems.
5. He is best recognized for his groundbreaking work in proof theory, particularly his pioneering work with Gentzen’s Calculus, an intuitive system of logical notation, and his Hauptsatz, which connects proofs of logical statements with computational behavior.
6. He also developed the notion of "ordinal analysis", which was later used by Alan Turing to study algorithms.
7. Gentzen's research in proof theory, cut elimination and ordinal notation led to the formulation of what is now known as the Curry-Howard correspondence.

Born 24 November 1909, Greifswald, Germany. Died 4 August 1945, Prague, Czechoslovakia.
