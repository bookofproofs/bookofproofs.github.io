**Shiing-shen Chern** was a Chinese mathematician who made important contributions to geometry and algebraic topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of characteristic classes, which connected topology and differential geometry.
2. Established fundamental contributions to differential geometry and topology.
3. Made significant and influential contributions to global geometry and the geometric analysis of partial differential equations, in particular to minimal submanifolds and geometric flows.
4. Proposed the Chern–Weil homomorphism, which was the first homomorphism between the de Rham cohomology of a manifold and homomorphisms of certain Lie algebras. 
5. Received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1983, one of the highest awards in the field of mathematics.
6. Was a mathematical leader of the rise of differential geometry in China in the 20th century.
7. Was one of the leading figures in the field of geometric analysis  in the 1950s and the 1960s.
8. Received the National Medal of Science in 1975 for his outstanding contributions to mathematics.
9. Helped popularize the Gauss–Bonnet theorem. 
10. Contributed greatly to the textbook, 'The Geometry of Manifolds'.

Born 26 October 1911, Chia-hsing (or Jiaxing), Chekiang province (now Zhejiang), China. Died 3 December 2004, Tianjin, Tianjin Municipality, China.
