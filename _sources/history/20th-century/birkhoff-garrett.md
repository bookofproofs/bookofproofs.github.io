**Garrett Birkhoff** was an American mathematician best known for the algebra book he wrote with Saunders Mac Lane.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Garrett was educated at home until he was eight years old when he began to attend school.
* Again, as at his primary school, Garrett progressed very rapidly and despite going to Europe with his parents during his third year of study he was still ready to take the examinations a year early.
* His parents had encouraged him to do this because they were going on a major year long tour and so, after passing the examinations, Garrett attended a boarding school at Lake Placid for a year, spending much time on sport, before he entered Harvard University in 1928.
* With lecturers such as Morse and Whitney, Birkhoff certainly had inspiring teachers at Harvard.
* Birkhoff graduated from Harvard in 1932 and was awarded a Henry Fellowship to study at Cambridge University in England.
* Birkhoff published a joint paper will Hall, On the order of groups of automorphisms which appeared in 1936.
* From Cambridge Birkhoff went to Munich for a month in July 1933 and worked on his own on group theory, but while he was there he visited Carath√©odory who pointed him towards van der Waerden's algebra text and Speiser's group theory book.
* Returning to the United States, Birkhoff was a member of the Society of Fellows at Harvard from 1933 to 1936, and then he was appointed as an instructor at Harvard in 1936.
* Mac Lane had been at Harvard during 1934-36 and in 1937 Birkhoff taught his first undergraduate course on abstract algebra.
* When Mac Lane returned to Harvard in 1938 he took over teaching Birkhoff's undergraduate algebra course, then Mac Lane took the course back in 1939.
* The impact of Birkhoff and Mac Lane on the content and teaching of algebra in colleges and universities was immediate and long sustained.
* Perhaps this is rather misleading for Birkhoff did not consider this work closely related to the mathematical physics which he had started out on.
* Later Birkhoff was involved in war work at the Ballistic Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground investigating the effectiveness of exploding shells.
* Birkhoff's work also took him into computing and his friendship with von Neumann led to many interesting discussions on this topic.
* This led to Birkhoff's interest in numerical linear algebra.
* Another piece of consultancy work led Birkhoff into yet another area of mathematics.
* Garrett was quick to recommend the use of cubic splines (i.e. piecewise cubic polynomials with two continuous derivatives) for the representation of smooth curves.
* In 1969 Birkhoff was appointed George Putnam Professor of Pure and Applied Mathematics at Harvard.
* Birkhoff received many honours.

Born 19 January 1911, Princeton, New Jersey, USA. Died 22 November 1996, Water Mill, New York, USA.
