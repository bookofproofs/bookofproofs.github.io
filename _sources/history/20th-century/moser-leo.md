**Leo Moser** was an Austrian-born Canadian mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Leo attended primary school in Winnipeg, where his parents had set up home, and continued his secondary education there.
* Remaining in Winnipeg, Leo then entered the University of Manitoba to study mathematics.
* For his doctoral studies, Moser went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
* Alfred Brauer's interests were in number theory and so this was the area in which Moser began his research.
* Even before he had submitted his dissertation, Moser had several papers published.
* Moser was appointed at Texas Technical College, but shortly after this he was offered a position in the University of Alberta, and he moved back to Canada to take up the job in 1951.
* Although the department was small and had no separate building to itself, Leo Moser was the centre of activity discussing problems with any one who cared to listen.
* Professor Moser was very hospitable and the evening parties at his home were always a treat.
* Moser loved the problem based type of mathematical questions.
* We mention above the heart problems which afflicted Moser all his life.

Born 11 April 1921, Vienna, Austria. Died 9 February 1970, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
