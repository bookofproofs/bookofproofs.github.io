**Leo Moser** was an Austrian-born Canadian mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Making significant contributions to the development of the theory of modular forms, in particular discovering and proving the famous "Moser's formula".
2. Pioneering research on mathematical problems related to finite geometries, particularly questions in linear programming.
3. Formulating and proving the theorems established by Moser and coworkers in the field of graph theory, especially the celebrated "Four Color Theorem".
4. Developing "Moser's Parallels", a tool used to generate and analyze large classes of strongly regular graphs, as well as establishing measurements for the asymptotic behaviour of 2-dimensional lattices.
5. Providing viable solutions for the long-standing open problem in number theory known as the "Catalan Conjecture".
6. Rewriting the research of another mathematician—Alexander Stern—about doubly periodic functions of a complex variable into a unified and more comprehensive form.

Born 11 April 1921, Vienna, Austria. Died 9 February 1970, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
