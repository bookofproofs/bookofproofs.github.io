**Zdzislaw Pawlak** was a Polish mathematician and computer scientist who was known for his contribution to many branches of theoretical computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Produced influential research on the theory of fuzzy sets, leading to the concept of Pawlak's Rough Set Theory.
2. Developed further the concept of rough set approximation and its generalization. 
3. Proposed a base operator for rough sets which consists of creating a pair of crisp sets called lower and upper approximations.
4. Established mathematical foundations for the concept of rough set databases for knowledge discovery.
5. Created meaningful and fruitful learning paradigms such as Dichotomizer 3 (D3) and Decision-Making Based on Rough Sets (DRSA).
6. Published numerous papers on the topic of rough sets and related areas which are cited extensively in the rough set literature.
7. Authored chapters in multiple books on the application of rough sets in system analysis, decision making and dealing with incomplete information. 
8. Co-authored 'Rough Sets, Fuzzy Sets, Data Mining and Granular Computing' with Paweł Skowron, a seminal and comprehensive book on the entire rough set theory. 
9. Edited the proceedings of the 3rd International Rough Sets Conference, and was an Associate Editor at the International Journal of Approximate Reasoning and the Fuzzy Sets and Systems. 
10. Received numerous awards for his contribution to mathematics, including becoming a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1989, receiving the Polish State Award for Mathematics, and being named as a Doctor Honoris Causa of many universities, such as the University of Szczecin.

Born 10 November 1926, Łódź, Poland. Died 7 April 2006, Warsaw, Poland.
