**Jurjen Ferdinand Koksma** was a Dutch mathematician who worked in analytic number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the fundamental concept of duality in topology, now known as the Koksma-Hlawka theorem.
2. Developed mathematical foundations for optimal control theory.
3. Pioneered the field of Ramsey theory and its applications to combinatorics. 
4. Contributed to the theory of ordered vector spaces, and their applications to the solution of partial differential equations. 
5. Developed a special case of the formalization of choice which is now known as KKM theory. 
6. Helped lay the foundations of the field of quasiconformal mappings, an important tool in the geometric study of non-Euclidean spaces.
7. Developed a powerful method for solving elliptic and parabolic integro-differential equations, now known as the Koksma–Krein method. 
8. Established the Koksma–Hlawka inequality, a major tool in the study of numerical integration and summation. 
9. Discovered the Koksma–Hlawka–Straits inequality, a related concept in numerical integration. 
10. Developed a novel optimality theorem in multiple function optimization theory.

Born 21 April 1904, Schoterland, now Heerenveen, The Netherlands. Died 17 December 1964, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
