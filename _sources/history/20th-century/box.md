**George Box** was a British statistician whose name is associated with several different statistical techniques.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the statistical model-building approach known as the "Box–Jenkins" method.
2. Co-designed the Box–Cox transformation, a method used to explore relationships between sets of variables and to examine the effect of transforming one variable in terms of another.
3. Proposed computational theory of statistics which led to widespread application of computers to assist decision-making in businesses and organizations.
4. Received several honorary doctorates and numerous awards, including the 1975 Imperial College London's Sargent Medal, the 1986 COPSS Presidents' Award, the 1996 Shewhart Medal from the American Society for Quality and numerous awards from the International Statistical Institute.
5. Authored numerous books, including two major texts: Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and control (with G. Jenkins) and Statistics for Experimenters: An Introduction to Design, Data Analysis, and Model Building.
