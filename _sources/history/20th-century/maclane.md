**Saunders Mac Lane** was an American mathematician who worked in cohomology and category theory, but who is best known for the algebra book he wrote with Garrett Birkhoff.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of the associative, commutative and distributive properties of algebra. 
2. Proved a key result in universal algebra, now known as Mac Lane's Theorem. 
3. Authored the influential text "Categories for the Working Mathematician," which has since become a foundational text in category theory. 
4. Made numerous contributions to the development of abstract algebra and homological algebra. 
5. Introduced the concepts of projective, injective and flat modules. 
6. Co-founded the notion of natural transformations in category theory. 
7. Co-developed the concept of cartesian closed categories. 
8. Introduced the use of the tensor product to algebraic topology. 
9. Developed a technique known as the Mac Lane Spectral Sequence. 
10. Authored the influential book, "Mathematical Algebra" which is a standard reference for modern algebra.

Born 4 August 1909, Norwich, Connecticut, USA. Died 14 April 2005, San Francisco, California, USA.
