**Saunders Mac Lane** was an American mathematician who worked in cohomology and category theory, but who is best known for the algebra book he wrote with Garrett Birkhoff.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His grandfather, William Ward McLane was born in Lewisville, Pennsylvania in 1846, became a Presbyterian Minister but was forced to leave the Church after preaching the theory of evolution.
* He became a pastor in the Congregational Church and the eldest son from his second marriage, Donald Bradford McLane, was born 19 January 1882 in Steubenville.
* Donald married Winifred Saunders, the eldest daughter of George Aretas Saunders, in 1908.
* After his marriage, Donald became a Congregational Minister in Taftville, Connecticut and his eldest son Leslie Saunders MacLane, the subject of this biography, was born in Norwich, close to Taftville.
* When he was only one month old his parents decided they did not like the name Leslie and from that time on he was known as Saunders MacLane.
* The change from MacLane to Mac Lane only came about many years later after his marriage.
* Saunders had two brothers, Gerald R MacLane, who became a mathematics professor at Rice University and Purdue University, and David Tyler MacLane, born 20 January 1922, in Utica, New York, who became a school teacher and businessman.
* Mac Lane's early years were spent in several different small towns but he did live in one large city, spending a few years in Boston when aged around seven.
* Mac Lane's High School education began in Utica, New York but was interrupted in 1924 when he was 14 years old for, at that time, his father died.
* After his father's death, Mac Lane moved to Leominster, Massachusetts, to live with his grandfather who, as we noted above, was also a Congregational Minister.
* Saunders graduated in 1926 from high school and, in that year, he entered Yale University.
* It had been his half-uncle, John Fisher MacLane (born 1878), who had visited him and explained that he and several of his relations had gone to Yale University.
* He offered to provide Mac Lane with sufficient funds to cover his expenses at Yale but he expected Mac Lane to train for a career in either business or law.
* Mac Lane's grandfather, William Ward McLane, died on 14 June 1931 a year after Mac Lane graduated from Yale.
* He gave me lots of encouragement and said, "Mac Lane, why don't you take the Barge Prize examination?" They gave that examination to freshmen every year.
* Within weeks he was completely bored by accounting and, after one of his classmates said how much he was enjoying physics, Mac Lane went on to major in both mathematics and physics.
* By this time E H Moore was nearly seventy years old but his advice to Mac Lane to study for a doctorate at GÃ¶ttingen in Germany certainly persuaded Mac Lane to work at the foremost mathematical research centre in the world at that time.
* Mac Lane began to work for his doctorate under Paul Bernays' supervision but in 1933 the Nazis came to power.
* Mac Lane had seen that he had to work quickly for his doctorate and leave Germany as soon as possible before things deteriorated further.
* Mac Lane was rather disappointed to learn that Weyl had only rated his thesis "sufficient".
* On returning to the United States, Mac Lane spent the session 1933-34 at Yale while he tried to get a university position for the following year.
* The impact of Birkhoff and Mac Lane on the content and teaching of algebra in colleges and universities was immediate and long sustained.
* In 1952, five years after being appointed, Mac Lane took over the chairmanship of the department from Stone who stepped down as chairmen but remained on the staff for another sixteen years.
* Though teaching from his own book, it seemed that Mac Lane would go out of his way to present the material differently than what was in the text.
* However, the understanding of the mathematics was paramount in Mac Lane's presentations.
* Mac Lane's work covered a wide range of mathematics.
* Mac Lane was the author of seven books: (with Garrett Birkhoff) A Survey of Modern Algebra (1941); Homology (1963); (with Garrett Birkhoff) Algebra (1967); Categories for the Working Mathematician (1971); Mathematics, Form and Function (1985); (with Ieke Moerdijk) Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: A First Introduction to Topos Theory (1992); and Saunders Mac Lane: A Mathematical Autobiography (2005).
* For his contributions to the Mathematical Association of America, Mac Lane received the Association's Award for Distinguished Service for 1975.
* Saunders and Dorothy Mac Lane had two daughters, Gretchen and Cynthia.
* Dorothy died in 1985 and Mac Lane married the artist Osa Skotting Segal (who was divorced from Irving Segal in 1977) in the following year.
* Mac Lane's hobbies included skiing, hiking and writing poetry.

Born 4 August 1909, Norwich, Connecticut, USA. Died 14 April 2005, San Francisco, California, USA.
