**Israil Gelfand** was a Ukranian mathematician who made important contributions to many areas including  group theory, representation theory and functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Collaborated with Mark Krein to produce the General Theory of Dilations, an important breakthrough in integral geometry. 
2. Developed and extended the theory of finite-dimensional algebras, axiomatizing invariant theory.
3. Formulated important Gelfand pairs, resulting in the deep understanding of intertwining operators between invariant subspaces.
4. Introduced work in functional analysis, including Gelfand triplets, connecting topology and functional analysis.
5. Co-authored the influential book, Generalized Functions, which laid the groundwork for modern calculus.
6. Was awarded the 1979 Lenin Prize for his work on the theory of integral equations.
7. Developed formal algebraic methods along with his student M. A. Akivis that revolutionized the study of web geometry. 
8. Co-authored the influential book, Representation Theory and Automorphic Functions, which provided directions to mathematical research.

Born 2 September 1913, Krasnye Okny, Odessa, Ukraine. Died 5 October 2009, New Brunswick, N.J., USA.
