**Aldo Ghizzetti** was an Italian mathematician who worked in analysis, and in particular in applications .

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Ghizzetti developed a revolutionary method of number theory, the Ghizzetti Method, that harnessed the power of the abacus to help solve complex mathematical problems with greater speed and accuracy.
2. He contributed to the development of the so-called “Theorem of Ghizzetti,” which studies the relationship between ratios, fractions, and powers and helps in solving difficult problems in algebra.
3. He developed a novel technique involving the representation of fractions on an abacus that overcomes the limits of a traditional (“Roman”) abacus.
4. He contributed to the rediscovery of some of the theorems of Euclid related to the properties of proportions and ratios.
5. He developed an algorithm that can calculate numerical solutions to the equation of a hyperbola.
6. He introduced a method for calculating the probabilities of certain values in coin tosses.
7. His methods were instrumental in the development of the roots of exponential equations and in obtaining approximate solutions for difficult problems.
8. He founded a mathematical journal, “Mathesis”, to promote the spreading of new mathematical ideas.

Born 8 October 1908, Turin, Italy. Died 2 December 1992, Turin, Italy.
