**Aldo Ghizzetti** was an Italian mathematician who worked in analysis, and in particular in applications .

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Aldo attended the scientific high school in Turin where he was fortunate to be taught mathematics by Guido Ascoli.
* After graduating from the high school, Ghizzetti entered the University of Turin.
* Ghizzetti was advised by Terracini when undertaking research for his laurea and he graduated in 1930.
* After completing the work for his thesis Ghizzetti was appointed as an assistant to teach mathematical analysis at Turin Polytechnic.
* Before the publication of this monograph, Ghizzetti had left Turin and moved to Rome.
* Mauro Picone, who had founded the Institute in 1927 and was its director, appointed Ghizzetti as deputy director to replace Cesari.
* Ghizzetti took up the appointment on 1 November 1940.
* One of these appointments was Ghizzetti who took up the chair of mathematical analysis at the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa in 1948.
* When Picone retired as director of the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo in 1960, Ghizzetti was appointed to succeed him as director.
* One of the areas of research that occupied Ghizzetti was the study of approximation theory and he also lectured on this topic in Rome during the 1950s.
* In collaboration with Alessandro Ossicini, Ghizzetti wrote Quadrature formulae  Ⓣ(Quadrature formulas) which was among the most comprehensive treatments of the subject in the one-dimensional case.
* Numerical analysts, particularly those who are unfamiliar with Italian, will be glad to have this connected account of research by Ghizzetti and his school, but will often shiver at the unusual treatment of our language and will occasionally have to reinterpret phrases.
* Ghizzetti also collaborated with Alessandro Ossicini to produce a new version of his 1943 book.
* In fact Ghizzetti had begun to combine ideas on special functions with his work on approximation theory during the 1960s.
* Here is the list of his collaborators (presented roughly in the order in which they wrote their first joint work with Ghizzetti): Rinaldo Perassi, Carlo Ferrari, Camillo Possio, Renato Caccioppoli, Mauro Picone, Antonio Borsellino, Carlo Miranda, Silvio Cinquini, Luigi Amerio, A M Libori, G Cordelia, Ennio De Giorgi, Luigi Marchetti, Corrado Böhm, G Gullotta, Wolf Gross, Paolo Ercoli, Andreina Morelli, Jolanda Verna, Maria Sofia Roma, Alessandro Ossicini, Francesco Rosati, Laura Nicolò-Amati Gori, Vittorio Mongiardini, Marisa Venturini Zilli, V Ceccarini, Bruna Germano, Francesco Mazzarella, and Lia Santucci Patini.
* Ghizzetti was honoured for his contributions in several different ways.

Born 8 October 1908, Turin, Italy. Died 2 December 1992, Turin, Italy.
