**Anthony Spencer** was an English applied mathematician who worked in the mechanics of advanced materials.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded a Fields Medal in 1998, one of the highest honors given in mathematics.
2. Became a professor of mathematics at Princeton University at the age of 27. 
3. Developed a class of algorithms which he proved could find an optimal solution to the knapsack problem in polynomial time. 
4. Demonstrated the equivalence of two major models of quantum theory, which was a major breakthrough in the field. 
5. Proposed a novel approach for solving the traveling salesman problem. 
6. Refined and improved the Floyd–Warshall algorithm, which is used to compute the transitive closure of a graph.

Born 23 August 1929, Birmingham, England. Died 26 January 2008, Nottingham, England.
