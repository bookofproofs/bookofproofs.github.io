**Claude Chevalley** had a major influence on the development of several areas of mathematics including Ring Theory and Group Theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of Lie Groups, which demonstrated the importance of non-commutative algebra in geometry.
2. Pioneered the method of sheaves in algebraic geometry and the 'scheme theory’.
3. Proved the fundamental theorem of finite projective geometry.
4. Founded the Bourbaki Group, a gathering of leading French mathematicians who helped shape the development of mathematics in the 20th century.
5. Made important contributions to number theory, algebraic topology, and algebraic geometry.
6. Co-authored the 'Chevalley-Warning Theorem', which provided a proof of the rationality of certain algebraic groups.
7. Constructed the Chevalley group E_8, the largest and most intricate Lie group known.
8. Authored several books, including the influential 'Theory of Lie Groups’.

Born 11 February 1909, Johannesburg, Transvaal, South Africa. Died 28 June 1984, Paris, France.
