**John Tukey** introduced the Fast Fourier Transform and worked in other areas of Statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed methods for exploring and analyzing data, such as exploratory data analysis, the stem-and-leaf plot, and box plots. 
2. He pioneered data compression algorithms, such as the Fast Fourier Transform, discrete cosine transform, and adaptive array. 
3. He coined the terms "bit", "software", "scalar", and "hardware". 
4. He is known for developing the Tukey range test, which tests a set of numbers for statistical significance. 
5. Tukey is often credited with pioneering the modern field of statistics and data analysis. 
6. He is also credited with developing a rigorous approach to exploratory data analysis known as the "Tukey-Kramer" process. 
7. He developed the technique of multiple comparisons for analyzing experimental data, which helps to identify the presence of differences between treatments and control groups. 
8. Tukey was instrumental in the conception and development of LISP, a computer programming language based on lambda calculus. 
9. He also developed the concept of the friend groups - groups of researchers that would informally interact and exchange ideas on statistical methodology. 
10. Tukey was a founding member of the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

Born 16 June 1915, New Bedford, Massachusetts, USA. Died 26 July 2000, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
