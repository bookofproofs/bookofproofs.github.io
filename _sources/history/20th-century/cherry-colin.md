**Colin Cherry** was an English scientist who worked on electric circuits, telecommunication principles and the psychology of speech and hearing.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After the war ended, Cherry was appointed as an assistant lecturer at Manchester University, a post he held for two years before being appointed as a lecturer at the Electrical Engineering Department at Imperial College, London, in 1947.
* In 1952 Cherry took sabbatical leave, which he spent at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, working there with Norbert Wiener.
* Back in Imperial College, Cherry was awarded a D.Sc. in engineering in 1956, became a Reader in Telecommunication, then in 1958 became Henry Mark Pease Professor of Telecommunication.
* Some of Cherry's ideas were unusual.
* Cherry published over 100 papers, including numerous scientific papers on the theory of electric circuits, telecommunication principles and the psychology of speech and hearing, and he wrote several major books.
* Another major text by Cherry was World Communication: Threat or Promise  published in 1971.
* Cherry decided to use the Fellowship for two main purposes.
* One was to sponsor a conference on 'The Foundations of Broadcasting Policy.' This was held in May 1980 at Leeds Castle in south-east England, about six months after Cherry's death.
