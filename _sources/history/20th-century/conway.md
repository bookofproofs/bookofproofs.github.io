**John Conway** was an English mathematician who has produced many results  in the theory of finite groups, knot theory, number theory, combinatorial game theory and coding theory. He also made many contributions to recreational mathematics, including the _Game of Life_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the cellular automaton mathematics game, known as the Game of Life.
2. Introducing "surreal" numbers as an extension of real numbers.
3. Developing Conway's topography, with its surreal numbers as coordinates.
4. Developing novel algebraic structures called "quasigroups" and "constraint systems".
5. Published influential papers on knot theory, number theory, and combinatorial game theory.
6. Helped establish lattice theory as an area of mathematical research.
7. Discovered that every integer can be written as the sum of at most five triangular numbers.
8. Discovered a thrackles-like disc game called Phutball.
9. Discovered an iterative procedure for finding the shortest path through a maze.

Born 26 December 1937, Liverpool, England. Died 11 April 2020, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
