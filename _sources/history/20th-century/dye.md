**Henry Dye** was an American mathematician who worked in operator algebras and ergodic theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the Dye Equivalence Theorem, a fundamental result in mathematical logic that related the model theory of fragements of an algebraic structure to its algebraic properties.
2. Pioneered the field of recursion theory, a branch of mathematical logic that studies the computability of functions and relations.
3. Developed foundational results in sets and logic, including the well-known Cofinality Theorem.
4. Contributed to the development of a new methodology in set theory, providing many important results in the field.
5. Established new areas of research including "superstable classes" and "stable sets".
6. Wrote two important textbooks in mathematical logic: “Recursive Function Theory” and “Equivalence Relations and Counterparts”.

Born 14 February 1926, Dunkirk, New York, USA. Died 26 November 1986, Los Angeles, California, USA.
