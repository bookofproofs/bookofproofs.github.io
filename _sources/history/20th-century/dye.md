**Henry Dye** was an American mathematician who worked in operator algebras and ergodic theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After the award of his doctorate, Dye was appointed as a Bateman Fellow at the California Institute of Technology.
* Dye served the university in many ways, the most important being his tenure of the Chair of the Mathematics Department from 1975 to 1978.
* Dye's first paper was The Radon-Nikodym theorem for finite rings of operators which was published in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society in 1952.
* The results which Dye proved in this paper led to marked progress in the theory of von Neumann algebras.
* In 1953 Dye published The unitary structure in finite rings of operators.
* In the paper Dye promised a second paper giving a detailed discussion of certain parts of his theory, and indeed this second instalment appeared in the same journal in 1963.
* In 1981 Henry and Eugenie Dye visited the University of Warwick in England when Dye was a Senior Visiting Fellow of the U.K. Science research Council.
* Henry's research students learned a lot from him about mathematical culture.
* Dye's health deteriorated after he passed fifty years of age and for quite a few years he continued to work hard for UCLA despite being in poor health.

Born 14 February 1926, Dunkirk, New York, USA. Died 26 November 1986, Los Angeles, California, USA.
