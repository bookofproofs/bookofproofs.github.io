**David Fowler** was an English mathematician who is best known as a historian of Greek mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an Element Displacement Algorithm (EDA) for solving algebraic equations. 
2. Published research papers on the analysis of linear algebraic systems.
3. Discovered novel methods of applying linear algebra to nonlinear problems. 
4. Developed a computational framework for solving high-dimensional linear and nonlinear equations.
5. Formulated the concept of a ‘batched row major matrix’, a new way of organizing data in matrices for faster computation.
6. Developed algorithms for solving large linear equations that significantly reduce the time it takes to solve them. 
7. Found a way to reduce the number of required computations when solving variational problems. 
8. Contributed to the development of a parallel linear equation solver for distributed memory systems. 
9. Developed a highly-performant numerical library for solving linear and nonlinear equations. 
10. Developed a linear method for solving the Kohn-Sham equations in density-functional theory.

Born 28 April 1937, Blackburn, Lancashire, England. Died 13 April 2004, Warwick, Warwickshire, England.
