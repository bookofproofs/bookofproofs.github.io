**David Fowler** was an English mathematician who is best known as a historian of Greek mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* David was generous and thoughtful, enthusiastic and sensitive to the feelings of others, and seldom angry.
* In 1961 Fowler was appointed as a lecturer in Mathematics at Manchester University, a post he held until 1967.
* Zeeman persuaded the Nuffield Foundation to fund the Mathematics Research Centre at Warwick University in 1967 and he offered Fowler the role of manager of the Centre.
* My first impressions of David were to realise what thoughtful, kind person he was, and then quickly to appreciate his outstanding abilities as a lecturer.
* As a result, there were, in almost every year during Fowler's first 25 years at Warwick, more mathematicians visiting the university's Mathematics Department than there were mathematical visitors to all other English universities combined - a remarkable record for a new university.
* In that book, David Fowler anticipated many of my difficulties.
* Fowler married Denise Stroh; they had two children Stephan and Magali.
* Denise was French and David and Denise Fowler had worked together on a translation from French to English of Ren√© Thom's famous book Structural Stability and Morphogenesis.
* But Fowler's worldwide reputation is as an historian who came up with mould breaking ideas.
* quickly fascinated Fowler.
* At Warwick, Fowler was a Lecturer in Mathematics from 1967 to 1980 when he was promoted to Senior Lecturer.
* By the time Fowler was working on the second edition of his book, he knew that he was seriously ill.
* After being diagnosed with a brain tumour, Fowler continued to teach at Warwick and continued with his historical research.

Born 28 April 1937, Blackburn, Lancashire, England. Died 13 April 2004, Warwick, Warwickshire, England.
