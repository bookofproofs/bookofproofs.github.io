**Felix Browder** was a Russian-born American mathematician known for his work in nonlinear functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Browder Fixed Point Theorem, which paved the way for the modern study of nonlinear operators.
2. Established the foundations of nonlinear functional analysis and topological degree theory.
3. Authored several influential books on Functional Analysis, including 'Mathematical Analysis and Applications'.
4. Introduced the concept of exact sequences to Homological Algebra.
5. Discovered a groundbreaking proof for the Browder-Minty theorem which solved an important open problem in optimization.
6. Authored the book 'Theory of Nonlinear Operators' which resolved several outstanding problems in the study of partial differential equations.
7. Developed a deep understanding of spectral theory that allowed him to study eigenvalue distributions in a single operator.
8. Solved several previously unsolved problems in the study of stochastic processes.
9. Developed the eigenvalue lift-off principle for the study of linear differential equations.
10. Authored several papers exploring the links between functional analysis and differential equations.

Born 31 July 1927, Moscow, Russia. Died 10 December 2016, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
