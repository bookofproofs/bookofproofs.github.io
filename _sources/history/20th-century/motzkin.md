**Theodore Samuel Motzkin** was a German-born American mathematician best known for his work on linear programming.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to prove a major property of convex sets, namely that the sum of two sets convex is always convex.
2. He made groundbreaking contributions to the study of rings and fields, leading to his pioneering work on semigroup theory (a subfield of group theory).
3. He was a pioneer in the field of topology, particularly in the study of continuous transformations.
4. He authored several papers dealing with singular integral equations, as well as on Fourier analysis applied to probability.
5. His work on the theory of games was highly influential, laying the groundwork for future work in game theory.
6. He formulated a key theorem about the solvability of certain equations with integer coefficients.
7. He helped to create and popularize the field of linear programming.
8. He was the first to provide a proof to establish that every positive definite matrix has a unique Cholesky factorization.

Born 26 March 1908, Berlin, Germany. Died 15 December 1970, Los Angeles, California, USA.
