**Attia Ashour** was an Egyptian mathematician who worked in electromagnetism.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel mathematical method for developing laws of motion in a uniform gravitational field.
2. Established the concept of ‘internal force’, to explain the changes in the shape of solid bodies subjected to externally applied forces.
3. Became the first female mathematician in the Middle East to found a mathematical research institute.
4. Created innovative mathematical models which improved understanding of the physics of compounds in materials science.
5. Pioneered the use of mathematical tools to model the behavior of multi-material systems in aerospace engineering.
6. Investigated problems such as the free vibration of mechanical systems and axially-loaded systems.
7. Began examining dynamical systems within the framework of mathematical physics, advancing the field of nonlinear dynamics.
8. Developed a novel algorithm for solving higher-order ordinary differential equations.

Born 13 September 1924, Damietta, Egypt. Died 17 April 2017, Cairo, Egypt.
