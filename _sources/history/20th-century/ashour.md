**Attia Ashour** was an Egyptian mathematician who worked in electromagnetism.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Attia's father was a farmer and the family lived in a house just outside the southern side of Damietta, surrounded by fields.
* At this stage his father was keen that Attia, as the eldest boy, should finish his education at this stage and work on the farm with him.
* Ashour moved to Cairo to continue his education.
* The standard course was for four years of secondary education which Ashour completed in 1939.
* At this stage Ashour had to make a decision as to what subjects to study at university.
* Ashour studied pure mathematics and applied mathematics, chemistry and physics in his first year but quickly discovered that, although he had a talent for mathematics and theoretical subjects, he was one of the poorest of the students at practical physics experiments.
* Money, however, was not important to Ashour, and so he took the Faculty of Science scholarship.
* One of the applied mathematics lecturers knew Sydney Chapman, a professor at Imperial College, University of London, and arranged an interview for Ashour with Chapman.
* The interview went very well, and Chapman admitted Ashour as a doctoral student.
* Although Chapman would have liked to be Ashour's advisor, since he was soon to leave Imperial College to take up a position at the University of Oxford, he arranged for Albert T Price to become Ashour's advisor.
* Ashour returned to Cairo University in early 1949 where he was appointed as a lecturer.
* Professor Ashour was appointed Professor Emeritus of Applied Mathematics, Cairo University, in 1984.
* Professor Ashour was a visiting scientist at Queen Mary College, London University in 1954; at the Physics Institute, Bonn University, 1955; 1955-1956, at the Institute de Radium, University de Paris; 1962-1963, Exeter University, UK; and 1972, Physics Department, Ibadan University, Nigeria.
* Professor Ashour was past president of the Mathematical and Physical Society of Egypt and the editor of the 'Proceedings' of the Society.
* On the international scene, Professor Ashour was a Member of the Editorial Boards of the Journals: 'Africa Mathematica', 'Arab Journal of Mathematics', and the 'Journal of Geophysics'.
* For some time, Professor Ashour was a member of the Advisory Board to the Director General of UNESCO on Science and the 21st Century.
* Professor Ashour co-authored the books covering the Mathematics Syllabus of the General Certificate of Education as early as 1958.
* Professor Ashour has authored more than 50 scientific papers in as many years.
* This person can be no other than Dr Attia Ashour, a much respected and much loved member of our community.
* Dr Ashour, please accept this small gift and the gratitude of the International Union of Geodesy & Geophysics for your 22 years of service.

Born 13 September 1924, Damietta, Egypt. Died 17 April 2017, Cairo, Egypt.
