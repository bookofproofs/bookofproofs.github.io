**Leonard Roth** was an English mathematician who worked on Algebraic Geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Leonard, the eldest child of the family, was born in Edmonton in the London Borough of Enfield.
* He had two sisters, Queenie Dorothy (1906-1981) and Ruby Caroline (1912-1940).
* The Roth family has been researched by Kate Varney, a daughter of Leonard Roth's sister Queenie, and she has discovered fascinating details about Leonard Roth's ancestors and his childhood.
* Silver Street, Edmonton, where the Roth family lived was then on the edge of the country with a farm at the end of the road.
* The Roth children would go out for long country walks, with 6d to buy tea with a boiled egg from a farmer's wife.
* As a young boy, Leonard kept an arrangement of the dominoes set on a table in the parlour to represent trains and he devised a timetable for the children to push the "trains" under his instructions.
* A Hebrew tutor came to the house to teach Leonard.
* Family holidays would, of course, have been quite unknown, but Leonard and his sister Queenie were sent on more than one occasion in the summer to lodgings at Winchelsea for the sea air.
* Leonard attended Latymer Elementary School, beginning in 1914 and, three years later, was admitted to Latymer Upper School.
* Latymer School realised that Leonard needed tuition at a level they could not give in order to gain a Mathematics Scholarship to Cambridge and it was with the headmaster's agreement that he went for a term in autumn 1922, before the Cambridge scholarship examinations, to attend Dulwich College.
* The year in Italy was an extremely profitable time for Roth, for there he met many of the great Italian mathematicians and he learnt a great deal from Castelnuovo, Enriques, and Levi-Civita in addition to Severi.
* Not only did Roth benefit mathematically from his personal contact with the Italian geometers while he was in Rome, but also at that time he met Marcella Baldesi, the only daughter of the reformist socialist Member of Parliament Gino Baldesi who was Roth's Rome landlord.
* The marriage seems to have resulted in Roth's estrangement from his parents.
* He had already become estranged from his sister Queenie, despite their hitherto very close relationship, when she married a non-Jew in 1929: Leonard sided with his mother.
* After Roth returned to London from Rome in 1931, he was appointed as an Assistant Lecturer in Mathematics at Imperial College.
* Also highlighted in this review is the informality of Roth's approach, which again was typical of all his work.
* The famous book we referred to is Introduction to Algebraic Geometry which Roth wrote with Jack Semple, and it was published in 1949.
* Another text written by Roth is Algebraic threefolds, with special regard to problems of rationality (1955).
* In addition we should mention Roth's other books: Elements of probability (1936), written with Hyman Levy, and Modern elementary geometry (1948).
* Roth and his wife both died tragically in a car accident in the United States.
* This seems to confirm that Leonard had kept alive his feeling for his Jewish roots although those who knew him in the 1950s confirm that he was no longer active or observant in Judaism.
* Marcella Roth was an outstanding pianist, and Leonard too was very musical, with a vast collection of gramophone records, always being played.
* Their house was full of beautiful pictures and objects, so that the friends and Italian relatives of the Roths were greatly distressed when the solicitors acting as sole executors summarily disposed of the house and its contents.

Born 29 August 1904, Edmonton, London, England. Died 28 November 1968, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.
