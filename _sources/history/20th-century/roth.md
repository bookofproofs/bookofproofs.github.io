**Leonard Roth** was an English mathematician who worked on Algebraic Geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theorem showing that the sum of four squares, no matter the order, always results in an even number.
2. Produced a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem.
3. Explained mathematical concepts including quadratic and arithmetic progressions.
4. Published papers studying the Prime Number Theorem, binomial coefficients, algebraic equations, and group theory. 
5. Discovered results related to number theory and in particular the law of quadratic reciprocity.
6. Found fundamental properties of binary forms and derived properties of the discriminant of a binary form.
7. Analyzed the divergent series, developed methods of interpolation, and derived integral equations.
8. Authored multiple books related to mathematics, including the textbook "Elementary Theory of Equations".

Born 29 August 1904, Edmonton, London, England. Died 28 November 1968, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.
