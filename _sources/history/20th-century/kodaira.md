**Kunihiko Kodaira** was a Japanese mathematician who won a Fields Medal for his work in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He solved the Weil Conjecture and earned a Fields Medal for his work in 1954.
2. He developed the Deformation Theory of Complex Manifolds which earned him the Wolf Prize in 1988.
3. He solved the Riemann-Roch Theorem, a foundational result in algebraic geometry.
4. He proved the Finiteness Theorem and the Vanishing Theorem which demonstrated the basic idea of Kodaira's embedding theorem.
5. He developed Hodge theory with Donald Spencer and James H.C. Whitehead, which formed the basis for later work on the Hodge-Arakelov Conjecture.
6. He made fundamental contributions to the study of complex algebraic varieties and complex differential geometry.
7. He introduced the idea of a formal power series, linking algebra and analysis and forming the basis for the later development of KÃ¤hler manifolds.

Born 16 March 1915, Tokyo, Japan. Died 26 July 1997, Kofu, Japan.
