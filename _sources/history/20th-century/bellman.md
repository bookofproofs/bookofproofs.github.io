**Richard Bellman** was an American applied mathematician who made important advances in dynamic programming.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of dynamic programming in the 1950s, which has been widely used for solving complex optimization problems. 
2. Created the Bellman equation, a fundamental equation of dynamic programming. 
3. Established "curse of dimensionality" which is a measure of the complexity of solving a problem as its dimensionality increases. 
4. Developed the "Principle of Optimality" which states that any optimal control can be decomposed into a sequence of optimal decisions. 
5. Demonstrated the maximum principle, which is a fundamental tool for solving optimal control problems. 
6. Founded the field of Stochastic Control, which is concerned with optimal control problems with uncertainty. 
7. Developed the Bellman-Ford algorithm which is used in routing and network optimization. 
8. Proposed the Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm for distributed computation. 
9. Created the Bellman-Harris population model, which is used in population dynamics to study the growth of a population over time.

Born 26 August 1920, Brooklyn, New York City, USA. Died 19 March 1984, Los Angeles, California, USA.
