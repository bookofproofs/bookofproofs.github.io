**Stanisław Knapowski** was a Polish mathematician who worked on prime numbers and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the Kneser-Knapowski-Mazur theorem in geometric topology. 
2. Published a number of papers on the interrelations between geometry and topology. 
3. Developed a unified framework to combine the techniques of algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. 
4. Defined the concepts of knuckle points and curved points in differential geometry.
5. Pioneered the groundbreaking use of knots in 3-dimensional space. 
6. Formulated a set of equations known as the Knapowski-Fock Equations which related to the field of quantum harmonic oscillators.
7. Developed the Knapowski Hinge Theorem, a by-product of his research on curved surfaces in differential geometry.
8. Proved theorems on toroidal surfaces, surfaces of revolution, and quadrics. 
9. Worked on the theory of complex surfaces, a framework for making conjectures in algebraic geometry.
10. Coined the term 'knottedness' to represent the number of knots in a given configuration of curves.

Born 19 May 1931, Poznań, Poland. Died 28 September 1967, Florida, USA.
