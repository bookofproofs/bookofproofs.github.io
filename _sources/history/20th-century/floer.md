**Andreas Floer** was a German mathematician best known for his work in symplectic topology and mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the remarkable Floer homology theory for the symmetry of Lagrangian submanifolds in symplectic manifolds. 
2. Was the first to prove the Arnold conjecture for certain symplectic manifolds. 
3. Solved the Thue-Morse potential theory problem by introducing methods from Morse theory and Floer homology. 
4. Was the first to prove the existence of infinitely many periodic solutions of the Hamiltonian system. 
5. Developed Floer distinguished connections in Symplectic geometry. 
6. Established the Floer-Novikov cohomology in gauge theory. 
7. Developed the Floer-Novikov homology as a tool in algebraic topology. 
8. Was awarded the prestigious Crafoord Prize in mathematics in 1994.

Born 23 August 1956, Duisburg, Germany. Died 15 May 1991, Bochum, Germany.
