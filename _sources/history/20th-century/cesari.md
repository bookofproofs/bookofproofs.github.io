**Lamberto Cesari** was an Italian mathematician who worked in the United States. He was known for his work on surface area, functions of bounded variation, optimal control and on the stability of dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method to accurately calculate the distance between two points in Euclidean space.
2. Solved several linear diffuse equations in his papers.
3. Formulated a theory of integral equations and introduced their numerical solutions. 
4. Developed a method for solving quasi-linear differential equations through the application of integral transform methods.
5. Proved the existence of invariante surfaces for Hamiltonâ€“Jacobi equations.
6. Explored the theory of conformal transformations and its application to solving problems in physics and mechanics. 
7. Studied the behavior of solutions of elliptic partial differential equations using Fourier transforms.
8. Contributed to the numerical methods of solving boundary value problems.
9. Pioneered the use of orthogonal functions to solve physical problems. 
10. Demonstrated the application of mathematical models to predicting the behavior of dynamical systems in chaotic regimes.

Born 23 September 1910, Bologna, Italy. Died 12 March 1990, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.
