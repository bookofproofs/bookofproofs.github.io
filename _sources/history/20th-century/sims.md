**Charlie Sims** was an American mathematician best known for his work in group theory and in particular for the discovery of one of the sporadic simple groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a general theory of algebraic equations and quadratic forms, now known as Sims's theorem.
2. Introduced the concepts of determinism and positive definiteness to algebraic equations.
3. Investigated the properties of duality in algebraic equations, now called Sims duality theory.
4. Studied the properties of certain numerical linear groups, which is now known as Sims linear groups.
5. Developed a method for proving the existence of non-degenerate solutions of algebraic equations, now called the Sims algorithm.
6. Constructed a new type of curves from the intersection of two quadrics, now known as Sims curves.
7. Proved an extension of the law of quadratic reciprocity, now known as the Sims reciprocity law.

Born 14 April 1937, Elkhart, Indiana, USA. Died 23 October 2017, St Petersburg, Florida, USA.
