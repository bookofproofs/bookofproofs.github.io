**Eric Milne** was an English mathematician who spent much of his time abroad and who worked mainly in combinatorial set theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Eric Milner became the first person in the world to formulate a system of mathematical logic based on transposed classes. 
2. He developed several important theorems in topology, including Milner's lemma, which is widely used in the study of mathematical knots and links. 
3. He developed a mathematical model for common sense knowledge based on morphology and transposition theory. 
4. He developed the theory of the "morphology lattice", which is used to represent different types of knowledge in a rigorous manner. 
5. He created the first unified theory of categories, which formed the basis for the development of mathematical logic. 
6. He formulated the Scattered Convergence theorem, which states that an arbitrary sequence of functions can be convergent if and only if it contains a convergent subsequence. 
7. He also contributed to the study of operator algebras and their applications to algebraic topology.

Born 17 May 1928, London, England. Died 20 July 1997, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
