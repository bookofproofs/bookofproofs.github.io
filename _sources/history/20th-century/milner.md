**Eric Milne** was an English mathematician who spent much of his time abroad and who worked mainly in combinatorial set theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* This is exactly what happened here, for Frederick Milner was often out of work and Annie helped out with the finances as a seamstress.
* In fact at times his parents were not able to provide the necessary care due to their work and Eric was looked after by his grandmother.
* Eric Milner, like other children evacuated from London, was separated from his family.
* The authorities tried to find a more suitable place to send him but this took time and Eric wandered around the streets of London when he should have been at school.
* At King's College, mathematics was part of the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Science when Milner began his studies.
* Milner graduated with a First Class Honours degree in mathematics in 1949 having received the Drew Gold Medal as top ranked mathematics student in that year.
* At that time, National Service was compulsory in Britain, and Eric applied to join the Royal Navy, in which his academic record would normally have secured a commission and in which he might well have made his career.
* Milner sailed on the ship Glenroy from London to Singapore on his way to Malaya, leaving London on 9 October 1951.
* Soon after both Guy and Milner arrived, they met socially and Guy tried hard to persuade Milner to give up his idea of working as a commercial assistant for the Straits Trading Company and join the Mathematics Department of the University of Malaya.
* Milner took a lot of persuading but eventually decided that he would give it a try.
* While he had been a student at King's College, London, Milner had met Esther Stella Lawton (known as Estelle).
* Milner married Estelle in the second half of 1954, the marriage being registered in Willesden, Middlesex, England.
* We see that despite Milner having been doing research on quantum mechanics while in London, he had becoame interested in number theory at the University of Malaya.
* In fact Milner's first research paper was the joint publication Generalized decimals (1955) with Oppenheim.
* Milner's interest in number theory and combinatorial set theory was greatly increased by Paul Erdős who made several visits to Singapore.
* In fact it may have been Erdős's influence which finally convinced Milner that a university career in mathematics was right for him.
* Certainly it was through a suggestion by Erdős that Milner spent his sabbatical leave, 1958-59, at the University of Reading with Richard Rado.
* Milner knew Rado well from his time at King's College, London, and Rado had moved to Reading to take up the chair of mathematics there in 1954.
* Another strong influence on Milner's career was Andras Hajnal whom he met in Reading in 1958.
* The year 1958 was important to Milner in other ways too, since Eric and Estelle's first child Suzanne was born in June of that year.
* We note at this point that Eric and Estelle Milner had three sons: Mark, Paul and Simon.
* Back in Singapore, Milner and Oppenheim published another joint paper, Properties of tetrahedra (1960).
* Milner had begun a Ph.D. at the University of London before going to Singapore so, back in Britain in a university post, he immediately decided to complete his doctorate, not in quantum mechanics but in his new area of interest, combinatorial set theory.
* Two of Milner's Singapore colleagues, Richard Guy and Peter Lancaster (born 1929), had moved from Singapore to the University of Calgary in Canada.
* They tried to persuade Milner to take a position in Calgary and, in 1967, he accepted a professorship at the University of Calgary.
* Milner spent the rest of his career in Calgary, becoming a Canadian citizen in 1973.
* When we say that Milner "spent the rest of his career in Calgary" we mean that he continued to hold his permanent professorship there.
* Sadly Milner's wife Estelle died of cancer in Calgary on 20 February 1975 at the age of 45.
* Eric and Elizabeth Milner had one son, Robert born in January 1985.
* Milner was a plenary 1-hour speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Vancouver in August 1974.
* People tell with particular warmth of the welcome and hospitality extended to numerous guests in the Milner household (during both of his marriages).
* Milner's health deteriorated and he was diagnosed with cancer.

Born 17 May 1928, London, England. Died 20 July 1997, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
