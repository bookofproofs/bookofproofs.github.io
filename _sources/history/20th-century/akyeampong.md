**Daniel Akyeampong** was a Ghanaian mathematician known for applying algebraic methods to theoretical physics. He was important in the development of higher education in Ghana.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* At the age of six, Daniel entered the Senya Beraku Local Council School in 1945.
* In 1954 Akyeampong began his studied at Mfantsipim School in Cape Coast, Ghana.
* When Akyeampong entered the school it had moved to a location on Kwabotwe Hill and the headmaster was Francis Lodwic Bartels, the first black headmaster and, rather significantly, he had himself been a pupil at the school.

* Akyeampong's MOBA57 year group became a second family to him.
* In 1960 Akyeampong entered the University of Ghana and graduated with a B.Sc. (Special) in Mathematics in July.
* Although Ghana gained independence in 1957 it wasn't until 1961, in the middle of Akyeampong's studies, that the university gained full independence.
* After graduating from the University of Ghana, Akyeampong went to England with the aim of undertaking research at the University of London.
* While he was a research student, Akyeampong began publishing high quality papers.
* Akyeampong left Trieste in September 1966 and was awarded a Ph.D. in Mathematical Physics by the University of London in October 1966 with his thesis Applications of higher symmetry groups to particle physics.
* In addition to the Ph.D., Akyeampong received a DIC (Diploma of Membership of Imperial College) in Mathematical Physics in November 1966.
* They quickly became friends and they were married on 11 April 1970; they had two sons and one daughter, Angelo Ekow Oguah Akyeampong, Adrian Kofi Nuamah Akyeampong and Adeline Adwoa Akooley Akyeampong.
