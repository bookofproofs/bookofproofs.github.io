**Marguerite Straus Frank** is famed both for her remarkable new discoveries of simple Lie algebras, and her solution to the problem of maximising a concave quadratic function, now known as the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Marguerite Straus's parents were Julius Salomone Straus (known as Jules) (1886-1946) and Paula Straus (1899-?).
* Jules Straus was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, on 17 September 1886.
* Paula Straus was born in Pinsk, Poland on 2 February 1899.
* Jules and Paula Straus moved to Paris where their two daughters were born; Doris Marianne Straus born 1923 and Marguerite Straus, the subject of this biography, born 8 September 1927.
* Marguerite sent the early years of her life in Paris where she began her education at a private school.
* Jules Straus had became ill in 1924 when he contracted encephalitis lethargica during an epidemic.
* Paula Straus made visits to New York, where she stayed in the Barbizon Plaza Hotel, and to Canada in the years 1935, 1936 and 1937.
* Marguerite at this time is eleven years old, 4 ft 8 ins tall with brown hair and brown eyes.
* Marguerite Straus attended the Jarvis Collegiate Institute, a high school in Toronto named after Jarvis Street where it is located.
* Straus quickly became enthusiastic about the algebra she was learning in his classes.
* While she was studying at the University of Toronto, Straus's father Jules died on 29 September 1946.
* Straus graduated with a B.A. from the University of Toronto in 1947 and won a fellowship to attend graduate school at Harvard University.
* Richard Brauer had given Straus a love of algebra but at Harvard she was assigned to Oscar Zariski who was working on algebraic geometry.
* In fact Zariski had been appointed to the chair of mathematics at Harvard in 1947, the year in which Straus began her graduate studies there.
* Although when she arrived at Harvard, Straus had been expecting to study first for a Master's degree, then proceed to a Ph.D., in fact she somewhat lost confidence in herself in the highly charged competitive environment.
* Marguerite sensed a grudging tolerance and disparagement in his glance, and she seemed to freeze in his presence.
* Straus's mother Paula Straus had visited the United States at the end of October 1946.
* After Marguerite Straus graduated with a Master's Degree from Harvard, her mother Paula advised her to take a break from her studies of mathematics at Harvard and take the opportunity to reassess the area in which she might wish to make her career.
* Marguerite arranged to take classes in history and philosophy in Paris, France, back where she had spent the first eleven years of her life.
* Marguerite and her mother Paula sailed on the Ile de France from New York to Le Havre, France departing 28 September 1950.
* Over the next few years Marguerite returned to Canada for the summer.
* While she was in Paris, Straus met Joseph Nathaniel Frank when both attended discussion groups at the Coll√®ge Philosophique.
* Joseph Frank had been born in New York City in 1918 and given the name Joseph Nathaniel Glassman but, after his father's death and his mother remarrying, he adopted his mother's new surname of Frank.
* By this time Marguerite and Joseph were close and they decided that the would return together to Chicago.
* Let us now quote at length from Nancy Albert's account of how Straus returned in a very successful way to mathematics after meeting Nancy's father A Adrian Albert.
* Marguerite felt sure he would understand both Noether's work and her own.
* Marguerite introduced herself, but glossed over her previous education.
* Marguerite was struck with the contrast with her former supervisor.
* One day, Marguerite appeared in his office and announced that her name was no longer Straus, as she had just married a man with the surname, Frank.
* Marguerite Straus and Joseph Frank were married in Chicago on 6 May 1953.
* Let us note at this point that they had two daughters, Claudine P Frank (born 17 March 1957) and Isabelle Jennifer Frank (born 2 May 1959).
* Marguerite wrote out the solution in longhand and brought it to Professor Albert's office.
* Marguerite had discovered a brand new class of simple Lie algebras.
* Once he learned that Marguerite had studied under Brauer and Zariski, her achievement made sense to him.
* This paper by Marguerite Frank was A new class of simple Lie algebras (1954).
* Marguerite Frank and Adrian Albert worked on the ideas that Marguerite Frank had developed and discovered further infinite classes of simple Lie algebras.
* While in Chicago, Marguerite Frank wrote up her Ph.D. thesis entitled New simple Lie algebras which was submitted to Harvard University where she was still registered as a graduate student.
* Marguerite's husband Joseph Frank gave the Gauss Lecture at Princeton University beginning in 1955 and Adrian Albert recommended Marguerite Frank to Albert W Tucker, who was Albert Baldwin Dod Professor of Mathematics at Princeton and chairmen of the mathematics department there.
* Marguerite Frank joined the optimisation group at Princeton run by Albert Tucker who was collaborating with Harold Kuhn (1925-2014).
* Marguerite started to find out about linear programming, the simplex method of George Dantzig, and game theory.
* We note that Rider University in Lawrenceville is only 12 km from Princeton where Marguerite Frank's husband was working at the time, and in 1985 he moved to Stanford University for the rest of his career.
* Joseph Frank, a world leading expert on the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky, died in Palo Alto, California, on 27 February 2013.

Born 8 September 1927, Paris, France.
