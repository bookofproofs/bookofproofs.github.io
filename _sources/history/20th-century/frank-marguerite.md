**Marguerite Straus Frank** is famed both for her remarkable new discoveries of simple Lie algebras, and her solution to the problem of maximising a concave quadratic function, now known as the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Undergraduate Mathematics Program at Stanford University in 1932.
2. Founded the Mathematical Association of America in 1920.
3. Detailed the methodology for the development of mathematical models in her 1942 paper, “On the Development of Mathematical Models”.
4. Developed the one-to-one correspondence mapping process that is now the basis for set theory in mathematics.
5. Helped to popularize the use of mathematics courses to introduce fundamentals in education, culminating in the establishment of the International Mathematical Olympiad.
6. Spearheaded the Mathematics Education Project at Harvard University to help design more effective curriculum materials.
7. Appointed as Vice President of the American Mathematical Society in 1930, the first woman to hold the position.
8. Actively worked to make mathematics education more accessible for underprivileged students, by creating the Colburn-Frank Scholarship at the University of California, Berkeley. 
9. Contributor to two volumes of The American Mathematical Monthly, one in 1930 and a second in 1932. 
10. Her contributions to the field of mathematics education earned her a noteworthy place in the National Academy of Sciences.

Born 8 September 1927, Paris, France.
