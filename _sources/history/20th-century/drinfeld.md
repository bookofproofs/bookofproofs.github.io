**Vladimir Drinfeld** is a Ukranian-born American mathematician best known for his work in algebraic geometry over finite fields.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Langlands conjectures in 1986, marking the beginning of the Langlands program.
2. Awarded the Fields Medal in 1990 for his work on the proof of the Langlands conjectures.
3. Developed the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction, which led to his construction of algebraic structures now known as quantum groups. 
4. Developed the theory of quantum affine algebras, which provided a new way of looking at Lie algebras. 
5. Discovered the concept of elliptic modules, which are an important ingredient in the literature of mathematical physics and algebraic geometry. 
6. Authored several important mathematical papers, including "Quantum Groups" and "Integrable Systems of Quantum Field Theory". 
7. Instituted the Drinfeld-Kohno theorem on knot invariants, which has become an important part of modern knot theory. 
8. Co-developed the quantum Teichmueller theory, which further extends the bounds of knot theory.

Born 14 February 1954, Kharkov, Ukraine.
