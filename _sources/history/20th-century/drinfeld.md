**Vladimir Drinfeld** is a Ukranian-born American mathematician best known for his work in algebraic geometry over finite fields.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Gershon Ikhelevich Drinfeld (29 February 1908-18 August 2000) was educated at Kiev University and was head of the Mathematics Department at Kharkov University from 1944 to 1962.
* Gershon Drinfeld also played a major role in the Kharkov Mathematical Society.
* Drinfeld completed his postgraduate studies in 1977 and he defended his "candidate" thesis in 1978 at Moscow University.
* The "candidate" thesis is the Russian equivalent of the British or American Ph.D. However, despite being extraordinarily talented, it was difficult for Drinfeld to obtain a position in Moscow.
* Since the address which appeared in Drinfeld's passport was not Moscow, he could not get a job there.
* Drinfeld gave an important lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berkeley in 1986.
* Entitled Quantum groups, the talk reviewed the results obtained by Drinfeld and M Jimbo on Hopf algebras (quantum groups).
* In 1988 Drinfeld defended his "doctor" thesis at Steklov Institute, Moscow.
* Drinfeld's main achievements are his proof of the Langlands conjecture for GL(2)GL(2)GL(2) over a functional field; and his work in quantum group theory.
* Although he only proved a special case of the Langlands conjecture, Drinfeld has introduced important new ideas in his solution and made a real breakthrough.
* Drinfeld and Manin worked on the construction of instantons using ideas from algebraic geometry.
* Drinfeld's work on Langlands conjectures, quantum groups, p-adic uniformizations etc.
* In 1992 Drinfeld was elected a member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.
* Alexander A Beilinson, also a student of Manin's, was appointed to the University of Chicago in 1998, just a short time before Drinfeld.
* Beilinson and Drinfeld had known each other for many years and had already collaborated on two papers before becoming colleagues in Chicago: Affine Kac-Moody algebras and polydifferentials (1994) and Quantization of Hitchin's fibration and Langlands' program (1996).
* One of Drinfeld's most recent articles is Infinite-dimensional vector bundles in algebraic geometry: an introduction.
* Drinfeld was named Harry Pratt Judson Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago on 1 March 2001.

Born 14 February 1954, Kharkov, Ukraine.
