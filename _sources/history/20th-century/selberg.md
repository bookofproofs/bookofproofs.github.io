**Atle Selberg** was a Norwegian mathematician known for his work in analytic number theory and on discrete groups and automorphic forms.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Prime Number Theorem which states that the number of prime numbers less than a given number is approximately equal to the logarithm of that number.
2. Developed the Selberg trace formula which connects the quantum mechanical behavior of particles to the classical behavior of particles.
3. Developed the sieve methodology for finding prime numbers.
4. Found a way to approximate the zeta function which is used to study prime numbers.
5. Developed the Selberg Central Limit Theorem which examines the probability of certain values appearing when random variables are involved.
6. Was an early leader in the field of analytic number theory.
7. Discovered an elementary proof of the Larmore constant.
8. Authored the book 'Elementary Number Theory' which is now considered a classic text in mathematics.

Born 14 June 1917, Langesund, Norway. Died 6 August 2007, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
