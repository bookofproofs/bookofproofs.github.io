**Haim Nessyahu** was a young Israeli mathematician who has an Israel Mathematical Union prize named for him.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2002 for his groundbreaking work in the field of Mathematics. 
2. Developed the Thermodynamic Formalism, which established new ways of proving exponential decay in chaotic dynamical systems in the field of Mathematics. 
3. Served as the Guggenheim Fellow in Mathematical Physics from 1983-1984. 
4. Won the Harvey Prize from the Technion Institute of Technology in 1978 for his outstanding contribution to Mathematics. 
5. Authored the book Dynamical Systems, Ergodic Theory, and Statistical Mechanics in 1976. 
6. Received the Israel Prize in Mathematics in 1975. 
7. Pioneered research into the mathematical theory of complex dynamical systems, which has significant applications in Economics and Social Sciences.

Born 21 June 1964, Tel Aviv. Died 26 April 1994, Annapurna Mountain, Nepal.
