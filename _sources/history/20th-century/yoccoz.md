**Jean-Christophe Yoccoz** was a French mathematician who was awarded a Fields Medal in 1994 for his work on dynamical systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Yoccoz did his military service in Brazil in 1981-1983.
* As a student of Herman, a leading word expert on dynamical systems, it was not surprising that Yoccoz would himself work on dynamical systems.
* However, it was remarkable how quickly Yoccoz was to establish himself as the most brilliant researcher in this area.
* In his thesis, Yoccoz improved theorems of his supervisor Herman by giving simpler proofs but also obtaining the same results under weaker hypotheses.
* At the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich in 1994, Yoccoz received his greatest honour for this work on dynamical systems when he was awarded a Fields Medal.
* After Poincaré, the theory was developed by a large number of mathematicians such as Arnold, Fatou, Herman, Julia, Kolmogorov, Palis, Siegel, Smale and Yoccoz.

Born 29 May 1957, Paris, France. Died 3 September 2016, Paris, France.
