**Shreeram Shankar Abhyankar** was an Indian-born American mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Although Shreeram (known to his friends as Ram) was born in Ujjain, he only spent the first two years of his life there.
* Shreeram attended school in Gwalior and, after graduating, went to the Royal Institute of Science of Bombay University intending to major in physics.
* The only mathematician who was there that morning was Oscar Zariski, so Abhyankar had his first meeting with Zariski who immediately began asking Abhyankar what courses he would take.
* Abhyankar had already talked to Masani before leaving India and been advised by him on suitable courses but Zariski, quickly realising Abhyankar's potential, suggested the most advanced courses.
* Abhyankar was awarded a Master's Degree by Harvard in 1952 and continued to study there for his doctorate advised by Zariski.
* Zariski was very interested in the question of resolution of singularities of positive characteristic surfaces and mentioned this to Abhyankar as an important problem which was probably too difficult for a Ph.D. problem.
* Abhyankar became fascinated with this problem, and after a tremendous effort solved it as his Ph.D. thesis.
* Around the time that Abhyankar was a research student working in algebraic geometry, Alexander Grothendieck was taking a totally new approach to the topic.
* In 1963 Abhyankar was appointed to Perdue University as a full professor and he was named Marshall Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at Perdue in 1967.
* Let us quote from several of the people who knew Abhyankar and his approach to mathematics.
* Not everyone appreciated Abhyankar's style, however, particularly his love of arguing with others.
* In particular he loved to get into deep arguments with other professors when he was at the University of Pune and this annoyed the vice-chancellor so much that he banned Abhyankar from the premises.
* Abhyankar was elected a Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy (1987) and a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences (1988).
* The American Mathematical Society introduced a new honour of 'Fellow of the American Mathematical Society' in 2012 and Abhyankar was among the initial list of those receiving this honour on 1 November 2012.
* Abhyankar suffered a heart attack in his home while sitting at his desk working on mathematics on the morning of Friday 2 November 2012.

Born 22 July 1930, Ujjain, India. Died 2 November 2012, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.
