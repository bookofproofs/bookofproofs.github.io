**Eberhard Hopf** was an Austrian mathematician who made significant contributions in topology and ergodic theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Hopf's theorem which proved a connection between the existence of rotation minimizing vector fields and the topology of a Riemannian manifold.
2. Published several papers introducing the generalized Hopf manifolds and working with topics such as Schur decompositions and automatic continuity of homomorphisms. 
3. Proved the existence of a separating hyperplane theorem, now known as the Hopf-Russell theorem.
4. Developed the Hopf-Rinow theorem of complete geodesics and existence of the Riemannian metric tensor.
5. Laid the groundwork for the study of partial differential equations by establishing the Bolza surface problem.
6. Proved the ‘Hopf invariant one theorem’, partial solutions to the Smith-Volterra-Cantor problem.
7. Contributed to the development of nonlinear differential equations.
8. Developed degrees of non-orientability for smooth manifolds and applied their work to the foundations of algebraic topology.

Born 4 April 1902, Salzburg, Austria. Died 24 July 1983, Bloomington, Indiana, USA.
