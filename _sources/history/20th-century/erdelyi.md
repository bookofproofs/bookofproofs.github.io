**Arthur Erdélyi** was a Hungarian mathematician who became a lecturer at Edinburgh and after a period in the USA returned to Edinburgh as a Professor. He was an expert on Special Functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a special differential equation (Erdélyi-Kober Operator) in the theory of linear partial differential equations.
2. Authored several articles on special functions theory and other topics in mathematics.
3. Was instrumental in the development of the concept of generalized analytic functions.
4. Co-authored a series of mathematical analysis textbooks.
5. Pioneered the study of homogeneous differential equations.
6. Applied the method of Frobenius to the introduction of the concept of quasi-analytic functions.
7. Developed methods for solving multidimensional integration problems.
8. Established the Erdélyi Integral.

Born 2 October 1908, Budapest, Hungary. Died 12 December 1977, Edinburgh, Scotland.
