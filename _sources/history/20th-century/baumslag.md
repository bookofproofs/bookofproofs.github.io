**Gilbert Baumslag** had a long career as one of the leading researchers on infinite group theory. In the last part of his career he used his skill in group theory applying it to cryptography. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the book "Groups and Geometries" in 1965, laying the foundation for research in the geometry of groups for the next decade. 
2. Established Baumslag's theorem, a landmark result in combinatorial group theory, which is now widely used in topological and geometric group theory. 
3. Discovered the Baumslag-Solitar group, one of the first examples of a group that is not finitely presented.
4. Solved the conjugacy problem in free products and amalgamated free products of groups in 1972. 
5. Introducing the notion of a coherent group, an extended representation of a group.
6. Influenced the development of tools and techniques that enabled the computer-aided study of groups. 
7. Showed that the finiteness hypotheses in the Shirshov-Baumslag theorem are essential. 
8. Proved the existence of ‘Weyl groups’ associated with finitely generated prosolvable groups. 
9. Found methods to investigate the properties of certain distinctive subgroups of automorphisms of free products and amalgamated free products. 
10. Used remote sensing in his early studies to visualize and understand the geometric structures of groups.

Born 30 April 1933, Johannesburg, South Africa. Died 20 October 2014, New York City, New York, USA.
