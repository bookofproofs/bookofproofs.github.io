**Luiz Henrique Jacy Monteiro** was a Brazilian mathematician who played a major role in the development of Brazilian mathematics in the middle of the 20th century. He did much to introduce modern mathematics to Brazilian school teachers as well as to university students.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Luiz Henrique had an older brother Roberto Jacy Monteiro (born 1918) and a younger sister Maria da Gloria Jacy Monteiro (born 1923).
* Ernesto Jacy Monteiro was a mining engineer with a talent for languages which he employed as a translator.
* Some facts support the 1921 date such as having Osvaldo Sangiorgi (born 1921) as a close childhood friend, and the fact that Jacy Monteiro began his university studies in 1940.
* At Vila Galvão, Sangiorgi and Jacy Monteiro enjoyed bicycle rides and they swam in the Lago dos Patos close to the Jacy Monteiro house.
* Jacy Monteiro showed great abilities in mathematics and in languages when at school.
* Silva Dias encouraged Jacy Monteiro to leave the Escola Politécnica and study at the Department of Mathematics in the Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras.
* In 1944 Jacy Monteiro was appointed as Cândido Silva Dias's assistant in Higher Geometry.
* Jacy Monteiro's outstanding language skills were put to good use and he was able to attend Zariski's courses and Dieudonné's courses and take notes directly into Portuguese.
* Jacy Monteiro served as General Secretary during 1945-48.
* Jacy Monteiro produced many booklets and these were sold to the students.
* Omar Catunda wrote to Jacy Monteiro from Miami on 14 September 1946 thanking him for his work and asking about printing costs and money received from selling the booklets.
* Eventually Catunda worried that he was expecting so much of Jacy Monteiro in producing these booklets that he may not have time to undertake other work.
* Jacy Monteiro was employed as an assistant to Jean Dieudonné in 1947 but later that year he took up the Rockefeller scholarship he had received.
* By the time that Jacy Monteiro's Rockefeller scholarship was approved, on 9 June 1947, he had married Martha Anna Dorothea Wallbaum and they had a child, Luiz Henrique Jacy Monteiro Filho, who was one year old.
* A fellowship for Luiz Henrique Jacy Monteiro is hereby approved for a period not to exceed twelve months beginning approximately September 15, 1947, with stipend of $175 per month and provision for necessary fees and travel expenses.
* Jacy Monteiro's paper Derivations of a field (Portuguese), was published in 1947.
* Zariski's assessment of Jacy Monteiro proved very accurate.
* The Rockefeller Foundation approved a grant for providing the micro-films and Jacy Monteiro defended his thesis Sobre as potências simbólicas de um ideal primo de um anel de polinômios Ⓣ(On the symbolic powers of a prime ideal of a ring of polynomials) on 19 April 1951.
* The board was chaired by Cândido Lima da Silva Dias who was Jacy Monteiro's official thesis advisor even though in practice he had been advised by Zariski.
* Jacy Monteiro had taken examinations on the two subsidiary subjects Algebra and Projective Geometry on 12 April and he was awarded the maximum score for both these examinations, and for his defence of his thesis.
* Jacy Monteiro was also professor of Algebra and Trigonometry at the School for Officers of the Police Force of the State of São Paulo in the district of Sant' Anna, Barro Branco.
* Jacy Monteiro attended the first Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium in 1957 at Poços de Caldas, Minas Gerais and delivered one of the courses on Teoria de Galois Ⓣ(Galois theory).
* We can note that the São Paulo Mathematical Society, in which Jacy Monteiro played a highly active role, ceased to exist when it became part of the Brazilian Mathematical Society founded during the Seventh Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium.
* This book was only one of several by Jacy Monteiro.
* These works were part of a long term project by Jacy Monteiro to make Brazilian teachers at all different levels aware of modern mathematical developments.
* At both of these Jacy Monteiro delivered a course on Modern Algebra.
* Jacy Monteiro became its director of publications.
* Jacy Monteiro's 1971 book listed above is published by GEEM and is a printed version of one of the courses he gave.
* D'Ambrosio: Given by Jacy, a great teacher.
* There is no doubt that Zariski's assessment of Jacy Monteiro at an early stage in his career was very accurate.
* In 1975, when still in his 50s, Jacy Monteiro underwent a surgical operation.
* Five years after moving house, Jacy, provoked by a friendly challenge, instantly reproduced the old telephone number.

Born 6 November 1918, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Died 20 May 1975, São Paulo, Brazil.
