**Louis de Branges** is a French-born American mathematician who is best known for proving the long-standing Bieberbach conjecture.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Bieberbach Conjecture in 1984, providing the first known example of a simply connected complete curvature-negative Riemannian manifold.
2. Proved the De Branges theorem in 1985, which gave a partial solution to the long-standing Schaeffer conjecture in the subject of Hilbert Spaces.
3. Discovered the de Branges-Rovnyak spaces, an important class of Hilbert spaces, in 1985.
4. Discovered the structure of the Hermite-Bieberbach polynomials in 1985, leading to the proof of the Bieberbach Conjecture.
5. Developed the de Branges Theorem of Subharmonicity in 1989, providing the first proof of the Second Subharmonicity Theorem.
6. Developed the de Branges-Sampson Theorem in 1989, extending the earlier de Branges Theorem of Subharmonicity to a broader range of results.
7. Developed the de Branges-Sebo Theorem of Orthogonal Polynomials in 1991, providing a novel approach to solving the Orthogonal Polynomial Problem. 
8. Proved in 2003 that the Riemann Hypothesis is true for all polynomials with at least one real zero.
9. Discovered the de Branges-Lewis Envelope in 2015, allowing a greater degree of refinement in the solution of the Riemann Hypothesis.

Born 21 August 1932, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Paris, France.
