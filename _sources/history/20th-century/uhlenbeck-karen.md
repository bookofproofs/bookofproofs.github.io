**Karen Uhlenbeck**is an American mathematician who is a leading expert on partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Many mathematicians know from early age that mathematics will be their life but this was not so with Karen Uhlenbeck.
* Uhlenbeck entered the University of Michigan with the intention of studying physics but a combination of studying exciting mathematics courses and finding that physics practicals were not a strong point lead her to change to mathematics.
* After graduating from the University of Michigan, Uhlenbeck continued her studies at the Courant Institute in New York.
* In 1988 Uhlenbeck was appointed Professor in the University of Texas at Austin where she also holds the Sid W Richardson Foundation Regents Chair in Mathematics.
* Uhlenbeck's work provided analytic tools to use instantons as an effective geometric tool.
* The papers do not discuss "bubbling" explicitly - perhaps the arguments were supposed to be obvious to experts by analogy with the work of Sacks and Uhlenbeck in the harmonic maps case.
* In 1988 Uhlenbeck lectured on Instantons and Their Relatives at the Centennial Celebration of the American Mathematical Society.
* At the same International Congress of Mathematicians in Kyoto, Karen Uhlenbeck was a Plenary Speaker.
* Among the many honours that Uhlenbeck has received for her work one should mention in particular that she was elected a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Science in 1985 and a Member of the National Academy of Sciences the following year.
* In 2008 Uhlenbeck was elected an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society.
* Professor Uhlenbeck is one of the United States' most eminent mathematicians, and perhaps the most distinguished woman mathematician of our time.
* At the same time, Uhlenbeck's efforts across the educational spectrum, especially her role as a founder of the Park City-IAS Mathematical Institute, have added vitality to the mathematical scene.
* Professor Uhlenbeck's mentoring is legendary, both formal (she co-founded the annual Women in Mathematics programme at the IAS) and informal, of women mathematicians.

Born 24 August 1942, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.
