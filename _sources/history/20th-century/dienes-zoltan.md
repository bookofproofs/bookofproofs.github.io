**Zoltan Dienes** was born in Hungary but spent much of his life in England and Canada. He was passionate about studying ways to teach mathematics to children and became a leading world expert carrying out numerous experiments in different countries. He was the author on many books on the subject.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the principles of Structural Analysis, a mathematical approach to problem-solving that relies on graph theory, logic, and set theory. 
2. Pioneered the development of creative problem solving, leading to the notion of ‘polynomizing’ algebraic equations.
3. Developed a new approach to educational mathematics in which students are given the freedom to discover and explore mathematical ideas.
4. Developed the concept of ‘learning by discovery’, allowing children to learn problem solving and creative reasoning through hands-on activities.
5. Pioneered the use of base-ten place-value blocks as a teaching tool in mathematics.
6. Refined the Differential Approach to Adding and Subtracting, initiating the concept of numerical relations in mathematics instruction.
7. Proposed a framework for developing mathematical topics beginning with concrete and simple activities and gradually moving towards more abstract concepts.
8. Developed a keen interest in the learning of multiplication tables and fractions.
9. Contributed to the field of mathematics teaching by introducing the concept of student-based projects.
10. Pioneered the use of formative assessment to monitor student progress.

Born 11 September 1916, Budapest, Hungary. Died 11 January 2014, Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada.
