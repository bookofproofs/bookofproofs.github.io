**Zoltan Dienes** was born in Hungary but spent much of his life in England and Canada. He was passionate about studying ways to teach mathematics to children and became a leading world expert carrying out numerous experiments in different countries. He was the author on many books on the subject.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He was the son of the mathematician Paul Dienes, who has a biography in this archive, and his wife Valéria Anna Geiger (1879-1978).
* Paul and Valéria Dienes were married in December 1905 and had two children, Gedeon Dienes (born in Budapest on 16 December 1914) and Zoltán Pál Dienes, the subject of this biography.
* Gedeon Dienes learnt English, French, German, Swedish, Italian and Russian and became a secretary at the Foreign Office.
* Counter-revolutionaries started to hunt down supporters of Béla Kun and execute them and Paul Dienes, Zoltan's father, escaped to Vienna.
* Zoltan, his mother Valéria, his brother Gedeon and Sari Chylinska, a close friend of Zoltan's father, joined Paul Dienes in Vienna in the autumn of 1920.
* Zoltan learnt to read and write in the commune and wrote a weekly letter to his father Paul Dienes.
* One day Valéria took Zoltan and Gedeon to the train station and they travelled by train to the Bavarian town of Oberammergau where they met Paul Dienes and his new wife Sari.
* By this time Paul Dienes was employed in Aberystwyth, in Wales, so they could buy things with English pounds while Germans struggled to cope with hyperinflation.
* When Paul and Sari Dienes went back to Wales, Valéria, Zoltan and Gedeon went to live with their grandmother in Pápa in Hungary.
* In 1929 Paul Dienes had become a reader at Birkbeck College in the University of London.
* Zoltan Dienes graduated from Dartington Hall School in 1934 having taken the Oxford and Cambridge Joint Board Examinations.
* In it he thanks the referee and his father Paul Dienes for simplifying the proof of one of his theorems.
* In 1938 Dienes married Mina Joyce Timms (also known as Mina Joyce Cooke) (18 November 1920 - 17 October 2006) who was known to all as Tessa.
* Dienes had met Tessa soon after arriving in England, Tessa's family being friendly with Paul Dienes.
* Richard George Cooke (1895-1965) was a mathematician who worked with Paul Dienes, the two writing a joint paper.
* We note that Richard Cooke wrote the London Mathematical Society obituary of Paul Dienes.
* Zoltan and Tessa Dienes had five children: Corin Ruth Jasmine Dienes (1939-2010), Nigel Anthony Dienes (1942-1992), Jancis Nicola Dienes (born 1944), Sorrel (now Sarah) Dienes and Bruce Dienes.
* After graduating with his doctorate, Dienes began a career as a teacher at Highgate School in London in 1940.
* After teaching for a year at Highgate, Dienes was appointed as a mathematics teacher at Dartington Hall School where he had been a pupil.
* After the award of the Diploma in Education, Dienes continued to teach mathematics at Leicester while becoming an external student of University of London in psychology.
* On the other hand, people like Émile Borel, one of the mathematicians Dienes considered to be a role model, saw mathematics much more as a constructive and thus open discipline.
* In 1959 Dienes published the two books Concept Formation and Personality and The growth of mathematical concepts in children through experience where he presented details of his work with 10-year old children.
* Dienes spent thirteen years as a mathematics lecturer at Leicester.
* Dienes was a member of the Advisory Council from the establishment of the Study Group and led work on reviewing researches into the learning of mathematics by pupils between six and twelve years of age, and describing significant classroom and curricular projects of interest to educators, mathematicians and psychologists who are involved in mathematics-learning.
* Dienes prepared a report and presented it to the first Study Group conference held at Stanford University in December 1964.
* A modified report by Dienes was presented to the second Study Group conference held in Paris in April 1965.
* Dienes was a professor at Brandon University Manitoba, Canada from 1975 to 1978 and during these years, and also during the following two years when he was based in Italy, he visited many countries as a consultant carrying out experiments teaching mathematics.
* In 1980 Dienes and his wife bought a home in Totnes, Devon, England where they spent part of the year.
* Ramona Jennex, Nova Scotia's former education minister and an elementary-school teacher, remembers Dr Dienes visiting her class of primary and Grade 1 students.
* There are two other aspects of Dienes's life that we should mention.
* The second aspect of Dienes's life was his enthusiasm for writing poetry, a book of his poems Calls from the past being published in 2000.
* You will learn much about Dienes's life from these poems and also from his fascinating autobiography Memoirs of a Maverick Mathematician (2003).
* Dienes received many honour for his outstanding contributions to teaching mathematics to young children.

Born 11 September 1916, Budapest, Hungary. Died 11 January 2014, Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada.
