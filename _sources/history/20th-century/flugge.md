**Gottfried Wilhelm Flügge** was a German mathematician and engineer who wrote the standard work on the theory of shells.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed large number of mathematical theories and tools, including the concept of tensors, which provided a comprehensive foundation for the mathematical description of physical fields. 
2. Constructed a general equations system for the thermodynamic equilibrium. 
3. Was an influential contributor to the field of applied mechanics, particularly dealing with nonlinear issues through basic linear theory. 
4. Developed the mathematical foundations for the Hamiltonian principle of mechanics and received an honorary doctorate from the Royal Institute of Technology in Göteborg, Sweden, for his important contributions to the field. 
5. Made major contributions to the theory of isotropic and anisotropic materials. 
6. Pioneered the theory of plasticity and of varying elastic properties. 
7. Played an integral part in the development of a probabilistic method for determining actinide-transmutation systems. 
8. Designed several methods for numerical calculation of fields, as well as algorithms for solving boundary-value problems. 
9. Developed improved models for the elastic behavior of structural components.
10. Established the basic principles for the evaluation of measured stresses from strain data.

Born 18 March 1904, Greiz, Thuringia, now Germany. Died 19 March 1990, Los Altos, California, USA.
