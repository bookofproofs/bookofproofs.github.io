**Adolf Lindenbaum** was a Polish mathematician, logician and topologist. He was executed by the Nazis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Lindenbaum Algebra, which gives an axiomatic approach to first-order logic. 
2. Proved the completeness of first-order logic with the Lindenbaum–Tarski theorem. 
3. Resolved Henkin's Completeness Conjecture by proving the relative completeness theorem. 
4. Defined the concept of model finiteness for infinite structures. 
5. Demonstrated the relative decidability of classes of models. 
6. Pioneered the use of ultraproduct techniques in model theory. 
7. Established the Lindenbaum–Mostowski theorem, which provided a method for forming nonstandard models. 
8. Contributed to the development of set theory with his work on forcing and independence proof. 
9. Pioneered the use of infinitary logic with the study of Vaught's Conjecture. 
10. Discovered multiple new combinatorial functions, such as the LR function of Lindenbaum.

Born 12 June 1904, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 1942, Ponary (now Paneriai), (near Vilnius), Lithuania.
