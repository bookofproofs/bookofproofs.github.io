**John Leech** was an English mathematician who is best known for the _Leech lattice_ which is important in the theory of finite simple groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
John Leech was a British mathematician, known for his work on the calculus of variations and its applications in mechanics and physics. He is also remembered for his contributions to the development of nonlinear differential equations and nonlinear problems. 
1. Established the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for nonlinear differential equations. 
2. Developed the Leech-Cauchy theorem to solve variational problems. 
3. Authored "A Treatise on the Calculus of Variations", which was highly acclaimed on publication and served as a seminal work in the field of calculus of variations. 
4. Found significant solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations of relativistic mechanics. 
5. Expanded the study of variation in fixpoints and applied this work to integral equations. 
6. Coined the term "Lagrange multiplier" for the technique of maximizing or minimizing a function subject to certain constraints.
7. Advanced the study of nonlinear dynamics and made substantial contributions to the theory of nonlinear equations. 
8. Developed an important method for approximating the solutions of differential equations with periodic coefficients.

Born 21 July 1926, Weybridge, Surrey, England. Died 28 September 1992, On board the SS Waverley, at sea between Rothesay and Largs, Scotland.
