**Leonard Gillman** was an American mathematician who was also a classical pianist. He worked in set theory and game theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Joseph Gillman had come to the United States at the age of eighteen, having spent the years of his life up to that time in the Ukraine.
* In the autumn of 1923 Leonard, extremely talented musically, began taking piano lessons.
* After two years at the state school, Leonard entered The Walden School, a small progressive school on West 68th  Street in Manhattan.
* Gillman had always loved mathematics in addition to his passion for music.
* Gillman and Kolchin, who were close friends, approached their teacher in their final year at High School (1932-33) and told him they wanted to study more mathematics than the school was offering.
* After graduating from High School in 1933, Gillman sat the scholarship examination for the Graduate School of the Juilliard School of Music in New York.
* In the spring of 1934, in addition to his studies at the Juilliard School, Gillman began to take courses at Columbia University.
* It was not only mathematics that Gillman studied at Columbia, for he also took more French courses, as well as courses on Psychology, German, English Composition and History.
* At first they made their home with Gillman's parents but soon were able to move into an apartment of their own near Columbia University.
* The work of Gillman and Jerison relates to this trend: the single point of contact they may have with other parts of analysis is the theory of normed algebras and Gelfand transformations; but these issues are absolutely not mentioned by the authors ...
* Gillman spent a second year (1959-60) at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton supported by an NSF Senior Post-Doctoral Fellowship.
* The Mathematical Association of America published Gillman's booklet You'll Need Math (1967), aimed at high school students, and his booklet Writing mathematics well: a manual for authors (1987).
* During his career, Gillman received several honours for his contributions.

Born 8 January 1917, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Died 7 April 2009, Austin, Texas, USA.
