**Leonard Gillman** was an American mathematician who was also a classical pianist. He worked in set theory and game theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Joseph Gillman had come to the United States at the age of eighteen, having spent the years of his life up to that time in the Ukraine.
* Leonard's mother Etta was born in Cleveland to parents who were immigrants from Poland.
* Leonard had a younger brother, Robert David Gillman, known as Bobby, who was born in Cleveland in 1918.
* In 1922, when Leonard was five, the family moved to Pittsburgh where his father Joseph taught at the university while working on his Ph.D. thesis in economics "Rent Levels in Pittsburgh".
* In the autumn of 1923 Leonard, extremely talented musically, began taking piano lessons.
* In 1926, when Leonard was nine, the family moved to New York where he spent two years in a state school.
* Leonard's parents both took degrees from Columbia University, his mother Etta being awarded a Master's Degree in psychology while his father Joseph was awarded a Ph.D. in economics.
* After two years at the state school, Leonard entered The Walden School, a small progressive school on West 68th  Street in Manhattan.
* He was in the same class as Reba Marcus, whom he married nine years later, and Ellis Kolchin who, like Gillman, became a mathematics professor.
* Gillman had always loved mathematics in addition to his passion for music.
* Gillman and Kolchin, who were close friends, approached their teacher in their final year at High School (1932-33) and told him they wanted to study more mathematics than the school was offering.
* After graduating from High School in 1933, Gillman sat the scholarship examination for the Graduate School of the Juilliard School of Music in New York.
* In the spring of 1934, in addition to his studies at the Juilliard School, Gillman began to take courses at Columbia University.
* It was not only mathematics that Gillman studied at Columbia, for he also took more French courses, as well as courses on Psychology, German, English Composition and History.
* In December 1938 Gillman married Reba Marcus who had graduated from Bennington College where she had majored in music.
* At first they made their home with Gillman's parents but soon were able to move into an apartment of their own near Columbia University.
* Leonard and Reba Gillman's first child, Jonathan, was born in the autumn of 1942.
* Gillman spent a second year (1959-60) at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton supported by an NSF Senior Post-Doctoral Fellowship.
* The Mathematical Association of America published Gillman's booklet You'll Need Math (1967), aimed at high school students, and his booklet Writing mathematics well: a manual for authors (1987).
* During his career, Gillman received several honours for his contributions.

Born 8 January 1917, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Died 7 April 2009, Austin, Texas, USA.
