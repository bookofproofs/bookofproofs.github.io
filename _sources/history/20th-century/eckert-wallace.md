**Wallace J Eckert** was an American astronomer whose work was important in the development of computers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* At that time Ernest Brown was a member of the astronomy department and Brown's work on the Moon was an important ingredient of Eckert's later work.
* Eckert had joined the Faculty at Columbia University in 1926 and later he became professor there.
* Eckert was an early user of IBM punch card equipment to reduce astronomical data and solve numerically planetary orbits.
* In 1937 Columbia University and IBM established the Thomas J Watson Astronomical Computing Bureau as a result of the collaboration with Eckert.
* In fact the work which led to this development was published by Eckert in Punched card methods in scientific computation (1940).
* In 1940 Eckert became director of the US Nautical Almanac Office and produced work vital to navigation during World War II.
* In 1945 Eckert became director of the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University.
* Eckert directed the construction of a number of innovative computers.
* Eckert applied computers, in particular the SSEC and NORC, to compute precise planetary positions and contribute to the theory of the orbit of the Moon.
* In particular he used the SSEC to compute the positions of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, publishing the results in 1951 in Coordinates of the five outer planets.
* The NORC was used by Eckert to work on the problem of the position of the Moon.
* Eckert therefore decided not to recompute new tables but to compute the ephemerides directly from Brown's equations.
* The accuracy of Eckert's calculations of the Moon's orbit was so good that in 1965 he was able to correctly show that there was a concentration of mass near the lunar surface.

Born 19 June 1902, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 24 August 1971, Englewood, New Jersey, USA.
