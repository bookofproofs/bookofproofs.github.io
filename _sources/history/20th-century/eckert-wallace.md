**Wallace J Eckert** was an American astronomer whose work was important in the development of computers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Collaborating with Harvard astronomer Harlow Shapley on the calculations that determined the size and shape of the Milky Way Galaxy.
2. Pioneering the application of IBM technology to astrometry and other calculation intensive scientific problems.
3. Developing the numerical integration algorithm that allowed astronomers to greatly increase the accuracy of computation of planetary orbits.
4. Contributing to the development of Harvard's Mark I Computer, a precursor to modern digital machines.
5. Publishing The Calculation of the Solar System and the Milky Way Galaxy, the first book to explain the use of computing machines for celestial mechanics calculations.
6. Developing a coordinate system for astronomy known as the “eckert ii” projection, a telescope mount known as the "Ecko-mount" and a map projection system called Eckert IV suitable for world maps as well as star maps.
7. Developing mathematical techniques to assist in the programming of ENIAC, the first electronic computer, which allowed it to successfully predict the orbits of planets and their satellites. 
8. Developing several "rubber mathematical sheets" (also known as 'flexible computing') which used sets of punch cards to perform and store calculations at a time before transistors and integrated circuit computers.

Born 19 June 1902, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. Died 24 August 1971, Englewood, New Jersey, USA.
