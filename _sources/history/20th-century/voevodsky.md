**Vladimir Voevodsky** was a Russian-born American mathematician who was awarded a Fields Medal in 2002 for his work in developing a homotopy theory for algebraic varieties.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the univalence axiom and the axiom of homotopy, which unify and reformulate algebraic topology. 
2. Proved the Milnor Conjecture, which had been an open problem in algebraic topology for over 50 years. 
3. Led the development of and launched the Homotopy Type Theory, a new branch of mathematics. 
4. Was an important contributor to the study of motivic cohomology and the theories of motives. 
5. Proposed a "total proof" philosophy, which calls for the complete formalization of mathematical as well as proof-theoretic reasoning. 
6. Developed the conceptual framework of Synthetic Differential Geometry. 
7. Proved the Bloch-Kato conjecture, demonstrating that a certain most natural form of "algebrization" is possible for any given cohomology theory. 
8. Devised new algorithms for the automation of simple algebraic processes. 
9. Was a founding member of the Univalent Foundations program and the Institute for Advanced Study's Constructive Nature Program, two initiatives dedicated to the advancement of constructive mathematics.

Born 4 June 1966, Moscow, Russia. Died 30 September 2017, Princceton, New Jersey, USA.
