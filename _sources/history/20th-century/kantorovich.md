**Leonid Kantorovich** was a Soviet mathematician and economist who can be regarded as the founder of linear programming.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Linear Programming - Kantorovich is most well-known for developing linear programming and winning the 1975 Nobel Prize in Economics for applying it to planning and allocation of resources.
2. Introduced the Theory of Optimal Accumulation - Kantorovich introduced the concept of the theory of optimal accumulation, which describes how various resources can be optimally utilized in production processes.
3. Worked on the Maximum Principle - Kantorovich worked on the maximum principle, which states that any optimal plan must produce its maximum value at the same time that it is achieved in any part of the plan.
4. Studied Function Theory - Kantorovich studied function theory, which is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of certain functions and how they interact with other functions.
5. Provided Solutions to the Assignment Problem - Kantorovich provided analytic solutions to the assignment problem, which is a form of optimization problem that tries to minimize the cost of assigning several workers to several jobs.

Born 19 January 1912, St Petersburg, Russia. Died 7 April 1986, Moscow, USSR.
