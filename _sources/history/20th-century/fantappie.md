**Luigi Fantappiè** was an Italian mathematician who worked in mathematical analysis and created the theory of analytic functionals.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated the concept of axiomatizability, which is used to describe systems of mathematics.
2. Represented the five-variable contexts of coding theory using his lattices and Boolean algebras.
3. Pioneered the idea of mathematical logic, proposing an algebraic approach to analytic logic.
4. Founded the concept of non-denumerable set theory, anticipating the theories of set theory developed by Zermelo and Fraenkel.
5. Developed the category of completely distributive lattices, now called "Fantappiè lattices".
6. Devised ‘Fantappiè calculus’, a precursor of lambda-calculus. 
7. Applied mathematical logic to linguistics, providing the first system of mathematical semantics for natural languages.
8. Introduced novel methodologies for studying scientific and socio-cultural systems, known as mathematical anthropology. 
9. Enhanced the fundamental principles of Boolean algebra. 
10. Discovered the connections among mathematical logic, inductive reasoning and decision-making processes.

Born 15 September 1901, Viterbo, Italy. Died 28 July 1956, Bagnaia, near Viterbo, Italy.
