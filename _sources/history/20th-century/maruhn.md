**Karl Maruhn** was a German mathematician who worked in aerodynamics, hydrodynamics and potential theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* This prize-winning work was published as a joint paper by Maruhn and Garten in Mathematische Zeitschrift in 1932.
* Maruhn was awarded his doctorate from the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Leipzig in 1930 for his thesis Ein Beitrag zur mathematischen Theorie der Gestalt der Himmelsjörper Ⓣ(A contribution to the mathematical theory of the shape of heavenly bodies).
* His thesis advisor was Leon Lichtenstein (1878-1933) and in the years before obtaining his doctorate Maruhn had been Lichtenstein's assistant.
* Maruhn's doctoral thesis was published as a 20-page paper in Mathematische Zeitschrift in 1931.
* Maruhn sat the State examination to become a Gymnasium teacher in 1931 and he then taught at a number of different schools in Leipzig until 1935.
* All these papers continue work done by Maruhn's former research advisor Leon Lichtenstein.

* During most of the time Maruhn worked there the director was Günther Bock.
* In 1937 Maruhn habilitated at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin-Charlottenburg and began lecturing there in the following year.
* In this last mentioned paper, Maruhn reminds the reader that the solutions of the boundary value problems for Laplace's equation are not unique when the boundary functions are allowed to assume infinite values.
* Maruhn was arrested by the Czechs but, after being held for a while, was released.
* Maruhn published Bemerkungen über das Verhalten von Potentialfunktionen im Unendlichen Ⓣ(Comments on the behavior of potential functions at infinity) submitted from Jena on 24 January 1948.
* By the time of Maruhn's death in 1976 around 80 books had appeared in the series and it continued to produce texts until 1990.
* In 1958-59 Maruhn spent a year as a Visiting Professor at the Justus-Liebig University of Giessen.
