**Karl Maruhn** was a German mathematician who worked in aerodynamics, hydrodynamics and potential theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a foundational set of mathematical principles which became known as the Maruhn Postulates.
2. Extended the movement of the Exterior Calculus by generalizing the integral theorems of the Differential Calculus.
3. Pioneered new methods of calculating trajectories of particles in multi-dimensional space.
4. Advanced the development of complex numerical analysis techniques.
5. Developed a theoretical framework for mathematical and physical thermodynamics. 
6. Defined numerous connections between the theory of functions and algebraic analysis.
7. Developed a theory of inverse problems, allowing for the calculation of unknown parameters from a given set of data.
8. Initiated significant research in the study of dynamical systems. 
9. Applied mathematical insights to areas such as mechanics and optics.
10. Established the basis for Lie groups and Lie algebras.

Born 5 December 1904, Chemnitz, Germany. Died 8 February 1976, Giessen, Germany.
