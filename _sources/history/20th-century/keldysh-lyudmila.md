**Lyudmila Keldysh** was a Russian mathematician known for her work in set theory and geometric topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Nikolai Nikolaevich Luzin gave a lecture in Ivanovo-Voznesensk which Lyudmila Keldysh and other high school pupils attended.
* This lecture firmly established in Keldysh's mind that she wanted to study mathematics and, if possible, become a professional mathematician like Luzin.
* Keldysh enrolled in the Physics and Mathematics Department at Moscow State University and graduated in 1925.
* The strong personality of Lyudmila Keldysh influenced the people around her.
* From 1930 to 1934 Lyudmila Keldysh taught at the Moscow Aviation Institute.
* Over the next few years Keldysh and Novikov had two sons, Andrei Petrovich and Sergei Petrovich (born 1938).
* Keldysh continued to undertake research on the structure of Borel sets and in 1941 she defended her doctoral thesis Structure of B-Sets (Russian).
* Petr Sergeevich and Lyudmila Vsevolodovna were enthusiastic about literature, both Russian and foreign.
* In the late 1950s Keldysh organised her famous seminar on geometric topology, concentrating in particular on topological embeddings, at the V A Steklov Mathematical Institute.
* In 1974 one of Keldysh's students was expelled from the Institute and, as a protest, Keldysh left the Steklov Mathematical Institute.
* By this time, however, Petr Sergeevich Novikov was seriously ill and the strain of the two years leading up to his death in January 1975 undermined Keldysh's formerly robust health.
* Among the honours that Keldysh received we mention the Red Banner of Labour, the medal "Maternal Glory", and the Prize of the Presidium of the USSR in 1958.

Born 12 March 1904, Orenburg, Russia. Died 16 February 1976, Moscow, Russia.
