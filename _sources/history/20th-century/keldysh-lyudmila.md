**Lyudmila Keldysh** was a Russian mathematician known for her work in set theory and geometric topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a system of equations for the theory of elastic shells, which has become the foundation for the theory of plates.
2. Established a new branch of mathematics called the Theory of Singular Integrals.
3. Solved a number of problems related to the rotation of rigid bodies.
4. Authored a number of important works on the theory of integral equations.
5. Developed the general theory of quasi-analytic functions and their applications.
6. Advanced the theory of Toeplitz matrices and multiple integrals.
7. Provided new techniques in operator theory and partial differential equations.
8. Provided the basis for the Vlasov-Maxwell equations of plasma physics.
9. Helped develop a method to solve the three-body problem.
10. Published a number of influential works in the areas of dynamic systems, topology, and singular integral equations.

Born 12 March 1904, Orenburg, Russia. Died 16 February 1976, Moscow, Russia.
