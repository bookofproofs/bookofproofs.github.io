**Lyudmila Keldysh** was a Russian mathematician known for her work in set theory and geometric topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Her father, Vsevolod Mikhailovich Keldysh (1878-1965), was a military construction engineer who had graduated from the Polytechnic Institute in Riga.
* Lyudmila Vsevolodovna was the oldest of her parents seven children.
* Of Lyudmila Vsevolodovna's six younger brothers and sisters we mention in particular Mstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh, born in Riga in 1911, who became a famous mathematician and has a biography in this archive, and Yurii Vsevolodovich Keldysh who became a musicologist.
* Lyudmila Vsevolodovna spent time in several different cities as the family moved around.
* The Keldysh family had no relations to help them in Moscow and they suffered considerable hardship.
* Lyudmila recalled the difficult times in Losinoostrovskaya, remembering one day when her mother fed the whole family just fried onions, having no other food.
* Nikolai Nikolaevich Luzin gave a lecture in Ivanovo-Voznesensk which Lyudmila Keldysh and other high school pupils attended.
* This lecture firmly established in Keldysh's mind that she wanted to study mathematics and, if possible, become a professional mathematician like Luzin.
* Keldysh enrolled in the Physics and Mathematics Department at Moscow State University and graduated in 1925.
* The strong personality of Lyudmila Keldysh influenced the people around her.
* From 1930 to 1934 Lyudmila Keldysh taught at the Moscow Aviation Institute.
* Her first son Leonid Veniaminovich Keldysh, from a first marriage, was born in April 1931 - he became a famous physicist and member of the USSR Academy of Sciences.
* Several members of Keldysh's family became victims - an uncle on her mother's side and his son were murdered.
* Over the next few years Keldysh and Novikov had two sons, Andrei Petrovich and Sergei Petrovich (born 1938).
* Keldysh continued to undertake research on the structure of Borel sets and in 1941 she defended her doctoral thesis Structure of B-Sets (Russian).
* However, Keldysh and her children did not have the status of evacuees but only of refugees.
* Keldysh spent the next several months of the cold and hungry winter of 1941 and spring of 1942 between the room in the dormitory, where the children were awaiting her, and the hospital, where she nursed her husband.
* Petr Sergeevich and Lyudmila Vsevolodovna were enthusiastic about literature, both Russian and foreign.
* In the late 1950s Keldysh organised her famous seminar on geometric topology, concentrating in particular on topological embeddings, at the V A Steklov Mathematical Institute.
* In 1974 one of Keldysh's students was expelled from the Institute and, as a protest, Keldysh left the Steklov Mathematical Institute.
* By this time, however, Petr Sergeevich Novikov was seriously ill and the strain of the two years leading up to his death in January 1975 undermined Keldysh's formerly robust health.
* Among the honours that Keldysh received we mention the Red Banner of Labour, the medal "Maternal Glory", and the Prize of the Presidium of the USSR in 1958.

Born 12 March 1904, Orenburg, Russia. Died 16 February 1976, Moscow, Russia.
