**Luna Isaac Mishoe **was one of the first twenty African American to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics. He taught mathematics and physics at Morgan State College in Baltimore, did postdoctoral research at Oxford University in England and from 1960 served as president of Delaware State College.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theorem on continuous transformation of projections that was later adopted by renowned mathematicians. 
2. Rendered several seminal contributions to the domain of non-linear differential equations.
3. Published a number of influential mathematical tracts that were later referred to as the definitive study on the subject. 
4. Established a mathematical formula around the principles of ‘divided differences’.
5. Published a comprehensive research paper on ‘Riemann Surfaces’ that illustrated their potential applications in bending surfaces and analyzing results. 
6. Authored several standard works on linear algebra which helped expand the existing body of knowledge in the field. 
7. Worked on a theory of closed-looped hypergeometric functions that later proved to be of great help in algebra. 
8. Made significant contributions to linear programming and its applications in gaming strategy. 
9. Conducted extensive research on discrete homology theory and its usage in topological analysis.  
10. Investigated advanced theories around principles of real analysis and its implications in dynamic systems.

Born 5 January 1917, Bucksport, South Carolina, USA. Died 16 January 1989, Dover, Delaware, USA.
