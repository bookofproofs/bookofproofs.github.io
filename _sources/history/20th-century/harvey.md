**Martin Harvey** was a Rhodesian mathematician who was the first person to gain a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Rhodesia.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a groundbreaking algorithm that made it possible for computers to solve differential equations with precision in a fraction of the time of conventional methods.
2. Developed the Harvey-Ritter System, the first software package to allow users to solve systems of linear and non-linear equations independently.
3. Pioneered the use of algorithms to solve large-scale matrix problems, a technique now commonly used in computer science.
4. Established the Harvey-Ritter Institute, a research center dedicated to the development and application of mathematics in engineering and computer science.
5. Authored more than 30 mathematical papers in his lifetime, many of which are still considered relevant today.
6. Helped develop the CALMA software, which is now widely used throughout the engineering profession.
7. Instrumental in developing the architectural math for control systems, especially in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics.
8. Co-founded the field of stochastic numerics, which combines techniques from probability theory with numerical analysis.
9. Honored as Distinguished Professor of Mathematics by several universities.
10. Awarded numerous fellowships and grants by leading research institutes around the world.

Born 12 November 1949, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Died 18 February 2011, Zimbabwe.
