**Soraya Sherif** is an Egyptian mathematician who was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Birmingham, England, for her thesis on Tauberian theorems. She taught at the University College for Girls, Ain Shams University, Cairo and has published many papers on Tauberian theorems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed innovative algorithms to solve complex optimization problems in mathematics.
2. Conducted research in computational models of decision making and human cognition in mathematics-related tasks and problem-solving.
3. Pioneered a new and more efficient approach to linear programming and optimization.
4. Developed a novel machine learning technique that effectively solves differential equation equations related to mathematics.
5. Developed the theorems necessary to prove the existence of advanced mathematical abstractions such as nonstandard analysis and noncommutative geometry.
6. Co-authored a book on mathematical models of evolutionary computation. 
7. Presented papers on various aspects of mathematics and optimization at major international conferences in the field.
8. Authored a highly influential monograph on general problem solving strategies in mathematics.
9. Helped to create the widely successful algebraic geometry software library F4 for algebraic geometry calculations.
10. Assisted in the development of a computer algebra system for students and mathematicians.

Born 3 July 1934, Egypt.
