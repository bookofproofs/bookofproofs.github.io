**Jean Bartik** was an American mathematician famous as one of the original programmers for the ENIAC computer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first practical program to be executed by an electronic digital computer in 1945.
2. Co-lead the team which designed ENIAC, the world’s first general-purpose electronic digital computer.
3. Developed a comprehensive suite of mathematical subroutines for ENIAC which had applications for a variety of scientific and industrial uses.
4. Helped to develop software languages for developing computer programs, such as the Short Code language.
5. Developed the world’s first compiler, which translated codes from English-like statements into machine language.
6. Co-invented early versions of core memory and logic structures.
7. Conducted groundbreaking research on the mathematical field of Vector Analysis.
