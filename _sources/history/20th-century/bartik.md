**Jean Bartik** was an American mathematician famous as one of the original programmers for the ENIAC computer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In fact many members of the family were teachers; Jean's grandmother, uncles and aunts were all teachers.
* Jean's mother, Lula May Spainhower (1887-1988) from Alanthus, married William Jennings on 21 February 1914 in Alanthus Grove.
* Jean, who was actually known as "Betty Jean" when she was growing up, was born into a large family; she was the sixth of seven children.
* Jean's grandmother, who was a retired schoolteacher, lived about a mile and a half away and Jean rode on horseback to see her every day.
* This grandmother became one of Jean's role models and had a major influence on her life.
* Jean's family were too poor to buy a daily newspaper, but her grandmother bought one and gave it to Jean every day.
* Jean began her education in a little one-room school, the Jennings School.
* After graduating from Stanberry High School, Jean entered Northwest Missouri State Teachers College (now Northwest Missouri State University) in Maryville, Missouri.
* In other courses such as Analytic Geometry, Trigonometry and Physics, the only students besides Jean were young men undergoing naval training.
* Although Jean came from a family of teachers, the one thing that she was sure of by the time she graduated was that she did not want to teach.
* At this stage Jean knew nothing about the ENIAC computer project but, led by John Mauchly and J Presper Eckert Jr, it had started in early 1943 under the direction of Herman Goldstine with consultant John von Neumann.
* The idea was that Jean and the other four girls would operate the ENIAC but anyone wanting to use it to solve a problem would program it themselves.
* Clippinger set up a group led by Jean at the University of Pennsylvania to work on this project.
* Jean also regularly visited Aberdeen where she taught Clippinger to program the ENIAC.
* Jean had met William John Bartik, an engineer, while working at the Moore School; they married on 14 December 1946.
* Jean Bartik continued to work on computers until 1951, only then leaving and starting a family.
* The Bartiks had three children: Timothy John Bartik (born 26 March 1954), Jane Helen Bartik (born 8 August 1959), and Mary Ruth Bartik (born 2 February 1961).
* Jean and William Bartik were divorced in 1968.
* Soon after this Bartik's husband left the Moore School, taking a job in Washington, and she went with him to Washington where she worked in the Remington Rand sales office.
* Bartik's husband then took a job with Remington Rand in Philadelphia but she was not allowed to work in the same place as her husband.
* At this point, fed-up with Remington Rand, Bartik left computing and took 16 years out to have a family.
* Jean Bartik received many awards for her remarkable contributions.
* Bartik also received the Joan S Korenman Award in 2009 for her pioneering efforts as one of the first computer programmers.

Born 27 December 1924, Alanthus Grove, Gentry County, Missouri, USA. Died 23 March 2011, Poughkeepsie, New York, USA.
