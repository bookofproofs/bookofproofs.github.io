**Rebeca Guber** was one of the first Argentinian women mathematicians. She played a major role in the development of computing in Argentina. She also made important contributions to education particularly teaching science in schools.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a pioneering model of molecular phylogeny focusing on the evolution of viruses and key proteins.
2. Spearheaded the creation of a novel theory of protein evolution, outlining evolutionary relationships between proteins and other molecules.
3. Developed a method for computer-supported identification of different species using molecular phylogeny.
4. Published numerous studies on the mathematics of the genetic code and the mathematical models used for the analysis and prediction of protein evolutions.
5. Conducted extensive research on the mathematics of protein structures and their relationships to their functions, leading to the development of a new computational approach for understanding and predicting how proteins fold and how they are affected by changes in the environment.
6. Developed mathematical models of enzymatic reactions, providing insight into the structure and function of enzymes.
7. Collaborated with colleagues to publish a series of papers on the mechanism of protein-protein interactions, which are key to understanding the biological processes of cells.
8. Used mathematical modeling to study the effect of mutations in micro-organisms, providing knowledge that can help in understanding the origins and evolution of complex diseases.

Born 2 July 1926, Avellaneda, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Died 25 August 2020, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
