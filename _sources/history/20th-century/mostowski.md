**Andrzej Mostowski** was a Polish mathematician who worked on logic and the foundations of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed the theory of "arithmetical hierarchies" which is considered to be one of the most important early contributions to modern set theory. 
2. He also introduced Mostowski collapse, a concept used in set theory that models the behavior of classes with respect to subset and superset objects.
3. He provided a simplified proof of the double-negation interpretation of intuitionistic logic, which is based on a theory of precision developed independently from earlier work of Kurt GÃ¶del.
4. His groundbreaking invention of the notion of "computability" linked the fields of mathematical logic, algorithmic information and computation theory.
5. He is recognized for his pioneering contributions to proof theory, providing the first deep axiomatization of both propositional and predicate logic.
6. He has also written significant works on recursion theory, as well as a comprehensive three-volume textbook on axiomatic set theory.

Born 1 November 1913, Lemberg, Austrian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 22 August 1975, Vancouver, Canada.
