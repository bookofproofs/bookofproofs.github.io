**Andrzej Mostowski** was a Polish mathematician who worked on logic and the foundations of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Sadly, however, Stanisław died in the year after his son Andrzej was born.
* Mostowski entered the Stefan Batory Gymnasium in Warsaw in 1923.
* Mostowski's illness while at high school prevented him serving in the army and he became an accountant after the German invasion of Poland which began on 1 September 1939.
* One of the students who took the risk was Maria Matuszewska; she married Mostowski in September 1944.
* Mostowski hoped to habilitate at the Underground University and was close to achieving this in July 1944 when events intervened.
* During this time Mostowski married Maria Matuszewska.
* Mostowski had no job so he tried to make a little money by giving private lessons.
* Things improved shortly after the war ended and Mostowski went to Cracow where he worked for a few months at the Silesian Polytechnic, then for a few months at the Jagellonian University.
* The Fraenkel-Mostowski permutation method and its application to proving the independence of the well-ordering principle from the linear-ordering principle in the theory of sets with atoms (urelements).
* The logical classification of arithmetical concepts and the Kleene-Mostowski hierarchy.
* Mostowski's well-known and highly regarded exposition of Gödel's incompleteness result, its strengthenings and simplifications.
* Mostowski's investigation into infinitistic methods in mathematics; www-models and bbb-models for arithmetic.
* Mostowski wrote an important Polish text Mathematical Logic  which was published in 1948.
* In 1952 Mostowski published a monograph Theory of sets  written jointly with Kuratowski.
* Many of Mostowski's works are aimed at general mathematicians, not experts in his field.
* Lectures on the development of mathematical logic and the study of the foundations of mathematics in 1930-1964  which reports on a 16 lecture course given by Mostowski in the summer of 1964 in Vaasa, Finland, gives the best view of what he saw as the most important developments in his subject during his career.
* We should explain how Mostowski came to die in Vancouver, Canada.
* Mostowski received many honours: a Polish state prize (1952); corresponding member of the Polish Academy of Sciences (1956); full member: (1963); Irzykowski Foundation Prize (1972); and member of the Finnish Academy of Sciences (1973).
* Mostowski undertook many editorial duties.

Born 1 November 1913, Lemberg, Austrian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). Died 22 August 1975, Vancouver, Canada.
