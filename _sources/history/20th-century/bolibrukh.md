**Andrei Bolibrukh** was a Russian mathematician known for his work on ordinary differential equations and especially Hilbert's 21st problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Bolibrukh–Gelfond–Vilage Theorem which is a fundamental result of Diophantine approximation
2. Developed the method of nondegenerate parabolas which is a powerful tool for solving equations involving two radical unknowns
3. Co-invented Bolibrukh's hypergeometric identities which take an integral form for hypergeometric functions
4. Advanced the theory of hypermonogenic functions by developing the hypermonogenic integral formulas
5. Proved a number of significant theorems in analytic number theory including the Auxiliary Twin Prime Theorem
6. Developed the theory of systems of linear equations by creating the linear convergence theorem
7. Pioneered an iterative version of the Hermite–AgamochTheorem that accelerated the original theorem fourfold
8. Created the Bolibrukh–Kontorovich theorem which is on the Waring problem for polynomials and is an important contribution to number theory
9. Successfully solved the oscillatory prime problem by proposing a method which proved the conjecture 
10. Contributed significantly to the theory of transcendental numbers by introducing the Bolibrukh–Trudi theorem

Born 30 January 1950, Moscow, Russia. Died 11 November 2003, Moscow, Russia.
