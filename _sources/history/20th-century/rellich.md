**Franz Rellich** was an Austrian-German mathematician who made important contributions in mathematical physics, particular in quantum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Franz Rellich solved the problem of his namesake, the Rellich embedding theorem in functional analysis.
2. He introduced the concept of spherical harmonics – a tool used in the fields of differential equations and dynamical systems.
3. He proved the Fredholm–Riesz theorem which has important applications in operator theory and mathematical analysis. 
4. He also made major contributions to the study of partial differential equations, approximation theory, and other fields in mathematics.
5. He introduced the concept of finite elements in numerical analysis, which is a powerful tool used in engineering and applied sciences. 
6. He also worked on variational theory, stochastic equations, and positive operator theory. 
7. His book, Perturbation Theory for Linear Operators is well known for its contributions to operator theory.

Born 14 September 1906, Tramin, South Tirol, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Italy). Died 25 September 1955, Göttingen, Germany.
