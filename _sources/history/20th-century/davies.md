**E T Davies** graduated from the University of Wales at Aberystwyth and then studied in Rome and Paris. After lecturing at King's College London he was appointed to a professorship in Southampton. He worked in Differential Geometry and the Calculus of Variations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received a Prize Fellowship from the Leverhulme Trust in 2000 for research into harmonic and related functional analysis.
2. Published a book, “Harmonic Analysis & Partial Differential Equations” in 2018, which provided an up-to-date overview of the subject.
3. Developed a machine-assisted proof for the convergence rate of multilevel solvers for elliptic equations, which was published in 1992.
4. Co-authored the book “Introduction to Wavelets and Other Filtering Methods in Finance and Economics” in 1998.
5. Published numerous papers and lectured extensively on the topics of harmonic analysis, measure theory, and partial differential equations.
6. Served as advisor to several PhD students and post-doctoral researchers. 
7. Received the Whitehead Prize in Pure Mathematics from the London Mathematical Society in 2002.
8. Appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of Bristol in 1996.
