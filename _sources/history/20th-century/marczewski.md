**Edward Marczewski** was a Polish mathematician who worked in measure theory, descriptive set theory, general topology, probability theory and universal algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We will call him Marczewski for this biography.
* At the University of Warsaw he was taught by Kuratowski who was teaching the first year calculus course that Marczewski attended.
* The audience then was exceptionally large (about 300 persons), the largest in the pre-war period; Marczewski was the best.
* Kuratowski directed Marczewski's studies and gave him much personal attention.
* However it was two other mathematicians at the University of Warsaw who influenced Marczewski more than Kuratowski.
* These were Mazurkiewicz and Sierpiński who interested Marczewski in measure theory and related topics.
* He had remained interested in collaborating with Kuratowski and, in the same year as his doctorate was awarded, a joint paper by Marczewski and Kuratowski was published in Fundamenta Mathematicae.
* Marczewski was right, but sadly time were about to change.
* Marczewski was visiting Lwów when it was occupied by the German army and here, as throughout Poland, intellectuals perished.
* Then Marczewski returned to Warsaw, but in the capital things were equally difficult.
* For much of the war Marczewski survived in Warsaw suffering great hardships.
* In Wrocław, Marczewski was a prisoner of the Germans while the Russian forces besieged the city.
* On 6 May 1945 the Russian forces captured Wrocław and Marczewski was set free.
* The most important outcome which Marczewski worked for was the setting up of a Polish university in Wrocław.
* In addition to Marczewski, who was appointed as a professor, Steinhaus was appointed as Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.
* Marczewski later became rector of the University and served for four years in this role.
* The General Meeting considers it to be a matter of great importance that the Wrocław Section, under the direction of Professors B Knaster, E Marczewski, H Steinhaus and W Slebodzinski and in cooperation with the University and Technical University of Wrocław, should constitute one of the most active scientific centres radiating across the Western Territories.
* Marczewski founded the journal Colloquium Mathematicum in 1946 in Wrocław, and he was its editor-in-chief for 30 years.
* Marczewski was proposed as Deputy General Secretary of the Mathematical Institute.
* We should end by making comments on Marczewski's mathematics.

Born 15 November 1907, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 17 October 1976, Wrocław, Poland.
