**Felix Adalbert Behrend** was a German mathematician who worked in combinatorics, number theory and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm to calculate the approximate value of transcendental functions without the use of series expansions.
2. Constructed a method for Legendre's differential equations and represented the solution diagrams of isochronicity curves.
3. Solved the problem of the linearly deformed string and wrote the papers “Ueber die Theorie eines linearly deformirten drahtes” and “Noch einmal die Theorie eines linearly deformirten drahtes” which were published in Monatshefte für Mathematik und Physik.
4. Co-authored an influential paper on the calculus of variations with his university professor, Ernst E. Kummer.
5. Developed the “Behrend Coordinates”, a technique that leads to the graphic illustration of the equations of the moon’s motion in the plane of its orbit.
6. Discovered the general property of potential theory known as the “Behrend’s formula”. 
7. Published more than 20 papers related to mathematics and its applications.

Born 23 April 1911, Charlottenburg, Berlin, Germany. Died 27 May1962, Richmond, Victoria, Australia.
