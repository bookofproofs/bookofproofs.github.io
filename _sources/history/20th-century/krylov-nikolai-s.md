**Nikolay Sergeevitch Krylov** was a Russian theoretical physicist who worked in classical mechanics, statistical physics and quantum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed significant theory and methodology in the field of differential equations and approximation theory.
2. Established a key foundational framework for the establishment of the scientific field of computational mathematics.
3. Extended the Poisson bracket technique used in mathematical physics, thereby creating a pathway for the development of partial differential equations.
4. Pioneered the use of modern computing in mathematical computations, thereby contributing to the development of numerical analysis.
5. Developed the Krylov subspace technique used in linear algebra and optimization.
6. Developed novel theory of rational approximation of functions.
7. Established well-known theory of a perturbation of eigenvalues used in engineering and mathematics.
8. Authored more than 140 works related to mathematics and its applications.

Born 10 August 1917, Ustyuzhna near Vologda, Russia. Died 21 June 1947, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
