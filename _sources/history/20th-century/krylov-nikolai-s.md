**Nikolay Sergeevitch Krylov** was a Russian theoretical physicist who worked in classical mechanics, statistical physics and quantum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* This ability to concentrate on and to penetrate into the object of his studies characterised Krylov throughout his scientific career, which began when he was still a university student.
* Krylov graduated in 1939 but even before this he had written two papers which were published in 1940.
* The city came under constant artillery and air bombardment and Krylov was assigned air defence duties.
* The exceptionally bitter winter of 1941-42, when temperatures fell to -40Â° C, was one of extreme hardship for Krylov but he was evacuated and was able to recover his health in time to defend his doctoral thesis in Kazan (where Leningrad University had moved because of the war) in the summer of 1942.
* Krylov certainly could not return to Leningrad so he spent time working at the scientific centres in Elabuga, Joshkar Ola, and Moscow.
* Krylov resumed his duties at senior scientist at the Physical Institute of Leningrad University.
* In 1946 Krylov began to write a monograph explaining his revolutionary ideas.

Born 10 August 1917, Ustyuzhna near Vologda, Russia. Died 21 June 1947, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
