**Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro** was a Russian-born Israeli mathematician who worked in analytic number theory, group representations and algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Piatetski-Shapiro entered Moscow University and was awarded his first degree in 1951.
* Piatetski-Shapiro's parents advised him to do what the letter said for they feared he would be sent to a labour camp if he refused.
* After obtaining this postgraduate degree, Piatetski-Shapiro spent three years teaching in Kaluga, a town about 160 km southwest of Moscow.
* The next International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Moscow in 1966 and Piatetski-Shapiro was invited to give one of the plenary one-hour talks; he spoke on Automorphic Functions and Arithmetic Groups.
* Piatetski-Shapiro's problems became even more severe in the 1970s.
* Mathematicians in Europe and North America were certainly aware of Piatetski-Shapiro's plight and they made efforts to help him.
* Piatetski-Shapiro was given a professorship at Tel-Aviv University in Israel in 1977, but now he could travel world-wide and his outstanding reputation meant that he was also able to accept a position at Yale University in the United States in the same year.
* This was certainly not the only honour to be given to Piatetski-Shapiro for his outstanding mathematical contributions.
* A conference was held at Yale in 1999 "in honour of Dan Mostow and Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro".
* James Cogdell, who we mentioned above, was Piatetski-Shapiro's first Ph.D. student at Yale, being awarded a doctorate in 1981.
* In Israel, Piatetski-Shapiro met Edith Libgober, also a mathematician, and she became his third wife.

Born 30 March 1929, Moscow, Russia. Died 21 February 2009, Tel Aviv, Israel.
