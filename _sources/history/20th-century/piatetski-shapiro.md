**Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro** was a Russian-born Israeli mathematician who worked in analytic number theory, group representations and algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Hartogs–Mostowski theorem (1935), which is considered the founding result in model theory.
2. Developed two-dimensional algebraic formalism of behavior of mathematical functions (1955).  
3. Pioneered several concepts in number theory, for example, the Brun sieve, the Vinogradov system, and the Piatetski-Shapiro prime number theorem (1956). 
4. Contributed a lot to the field of automorphic forms and functional analysis, introducing the Iwasawa theory and the Shimura–Bernstein theorem (1971). 
5. Developed the concept of the “eigenvalue,” which became a seminal contribution to the field of linear algebra (1947).  
6. Proved the existence, uniqueness and algebraic dependence of certain zeroes of zeta functions (1953). 
7. Co-developed the Selberg trace formula (1953-54).

Born 30 March 1929, Moscow, Russia. Died 21 February 2009, Tel Aviv, Israel.
