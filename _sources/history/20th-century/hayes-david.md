**David Hayes** was an American mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Woodrow Hayes was a musician playing for the Jimmy Poyners Orchestra and as the bandleader of the Woody Hayes Trio.
* In addition to their son David, the subject of this biography, Woody and Eleanor Hayes had three daughters: Sally Hayes (now Sally Stevens), Betsy Hayes (now Betsy Hunt), and Jenny Hayes (now Jenny Lewis).
* David, like his father, attended Needham B Broughton High School in Raleigh, founded in 1929 and one of the oldest of the high schools in Wake County, graduating in the spring of 1955.
* After graduating with his Ph.D., Hayes was appointed as an assistant at the University of Tennessee in the autumn of 1963.
* In addition to his permanent position at Massachusetts, Hayes spent the academic year 1974-75 at the University of Oxford in England.
* In the summer of 1991, David, along with David Goss and myself, organized a large conference (over 100 participants from all over the world) at Ohio State University on the subject of "The Arithmetic of Function Fields".
* Let us look at some of Hayes' publications.
* Hayes was able to show that, with certain extra conditions, this result generalised to show that if the finite field is sufficiently large there are no permutation polynomials of even degree.
* In the second of the three papers he published in 1966-67, Hayes proved a polynomial version of Vinogradov's theorem that every sufficiently large odd integer is the sum of three primes.
* Hayes was an invited speaker at many conferences.
* We mentioned above that Hayes spent time at Harvard University in the autumn of 1999 and while he was there he delivered a series of lectures on the Stark conjectures.
* Hayes' marriage to his first wife ended in divorce but there were three sons from that marriage, Robert Hayes, Christopher Hayes, and Jonathan Hayes.
* In November 2004 Hayes married Irene (Truchinskas) Brown and became step-father to Carl Dickson, Mark Brown, and James Brown.
* David and Irene Hayes enjoyed travelling together but sadly they only had six years together before Hayes died on Sunday, 10 April 2011, at the Quabbin Valley Healthcare in Athol.
* Let us end this biography by quoting the personal comments by Michael Rosen who writes of Hayes' "richness of his interests and the significance of his contributions".
* David would visit us there to hike in the autumn and ski in the winter.
* Many people who knew David describe him as very intelligent, quiet, modest, and gentle.

Born 14 July 1937, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. Died 10 April 2011, Athol, Massachusetts, USA.
