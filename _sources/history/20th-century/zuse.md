**Konrad Zuse** was a German  computer pioneer who invented the world's first programmable computer: the Z3.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first programmable computer dubbed the Z3 in 1941, which utilized binary arithmetic and floating point numbers. 
2. Demonstrated the first working automatic digital computer that was capable of computing, storing and retrieving information in 1938. 
3. Invented the Plankalkül language, which was an early precursor to the modern programming language. 
4. Developed the Z4 and Z22 around the 1950s, which featured detailed engineering improvements over the original Z3 machine. 
5. Pioneered the development of algorithms for floating point arithmetic and the “Automatic Floating Point” feature in 1948. 
6. Constructed the Z11 in 1950, which was the first machine-readable stored program logic controller. 
7. Developed the first high level programming language called the Plankalkül in 1948. 
8. Developed the world’s first chess-playing computer, dubbed the “Turmproblem.”

Born 22 June 1910, Berlin-Wilmersdorf, Germany. Died 18 December 1995, Hünfeld (near Fulda), Germany.
