**Levan Magnaradze** was a Georgian mathematician who played a major role in the Georgian Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Magnaradze Asymptotic Formula for finding the critical curve of polynomial equations. 
2. Constructed a system of interpolation polynomials which was later used in fields like spline interpolation and estimation. 
3. Established what is now known as Magnaradze's Positivity Theorem, which characterizes several properties of polynomials which hold for systems of equations. 
4. Researched the existence of polynomial equations of fixed degrees over the reals which are simultaneously solvable over the complex field.
5. Provided a new proof for the existence of real solutions for Abel's equations of the first and second kind. 
6. Explored the existence of extra solutions for Diophantine equations under certain specific conditions. 
7. Researched the degree of non-singularity of the homogeneous system of polynomial equations. 
8. Explored the algebraic properties of the derivative of a polynomial equation with respect to its coefficients. 
9. Established the existence of strong intersection property for systems of polynomial equations. 
10. Explored the algebraic and topological properties of the zero set of a polynomial.

Born 22 June 1913, Akhal-Senaki, Georgia. Died 6 February 2002.
