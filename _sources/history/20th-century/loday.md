**Jean-Louis Loday** wasa French mathematician whoo worked in the field of cyclic homology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Author of numerous books and papers on algebraic topology, algebraic K-theory, and related topics. 
2. Established the ‘Loday Functor’, a tool for making computations in cyclic homology of associative algebras more tractable.
3. Pioneered the use of 'higher-order' homotopy theory, a concept which has become a fundamental tool for modern algebraic topology.
4. Developed the theory of 'Hopf algebras', which came to be a basic pillar for theoretical physics.
5. Proved a conjecture of John Milnor that the algebraic K-theory of the integers is finitely generated.
6. Described connections between algebraic K-theory and geometry.
7. Contributed to the development of operads and their applications in algebra, topology, geometry, and physics.

Born 12 January 1946, Le Pouliguen, Pays de la Loire, France. Died 6 June 2012, Les Sables-d'Olonne, France.
