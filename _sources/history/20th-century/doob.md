**Joseph Doob** was an American mathematician who worked in probability and measure theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the unified mathematics theory of measure theory, which drew on ideas from analysis, geometry, abstract algebra and the calculus.
2. Pioneered Fourier analysis, an important tool in signal processing and data analysis.
3. Showed the existence of a variety of useful measures on general spaces.
4. Demonstrated the existence of a measure that is translation invariant.
5. Founded and developed the theory of ergodic theory (the study of the dynamical behavior of deterministic systems) and its applications to statistical physics.
6. Discovered the Kolmogorovâ€“Sinai entropy of a dynamical system, a quantification of the unpredictability of a dynamical system.
7. Used stochastic analysis to create powerful tools to explore nonlinear dynamical systems.
8. Demonstrated the existence of a variety of operators that can be represented on a Hilbert space.
9. Proved the existence of a unique continuous single valued extension of a continuous real-valued function defined on a subset of the space.
10. Developed the general theory of summability, which is a branch of mathematics dealing with how to manipulate infinite series of numbers.

Born 27 February 1910, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Died 7 June 2004, Clark-Lindsey Village, Urbana, Illinois, USA.
