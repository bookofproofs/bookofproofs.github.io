**Brian Kuttner** was an English mathematician who worked on Fourier Series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His mother was Lilian Frances Kuttner (born in Stepney about 1875).
* Brian Kuttner had a younger brother Conrad Adolph  and sister Elsa Marion (twins born 1910).
* Brian Kuttner attended University College School in London and from there he won a scholarship to study at Christ's College Cambridge.
* Kuttner spent a while in GÃ¶ttingen studying with Edmund Landau and received his doctorate in 1934.
* However, before the award of his doctorate Kuttner had been appointed in 1932 as an assistant lecturer at the University of Birmingham.
* At Birmingham Kuttner joined the Mathematics Department headed by G N Watson.
* Most of Kuttner's early work is on Fourier series and summability.
* Hardy quotes some of these early results of Kuttner's in his treatise Divergent series (1949).
* at the age of only 26, Kuttner proved a basic theorem in the general theory of trigonometric series, a result delightful for both the deceptive simplicity of its statement and the elegance of its proof.
* Zygmund greatly admired this theorem of Kuttner, which now occupies an honoured place in Zygmund's monumental work on trigonometric series.
* Kuttner's interests outside mathematics included travelling and walking.

Born 11 April 1908, London, England. Died 2 January 1992, Birmingham, England.
