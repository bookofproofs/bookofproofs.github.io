**Aleksandr Kurosh** proved important results in Group Theory and is best-known as the author of one of the standard text-books in the subject.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a basic outline of the theory of linear algebra, which later became the foundation of modern algebra.
2. Established a number of important mathematical theorems, including the Kurosh-Amitsur Theorem, also known as the Fundamental Theorem of Invariant Theory.
3. Developed the theory of Rings, which serves as a foundation of modern algebraic number theory.
4. Pioneered the concept of "Waring's Problem," which addressed solutions to equations involving powers of unknowns.
5. As part of his groundbreaking research with group theory, recognized the "meta-commutative group," an important group of symmetries.
6. Formulated the Normal Subgroup Theorem, a major result of group theory.
7. Authored a book titled "The Theory of Rings," which is considered to be one of the seminal texts in algebra.

Born 19 January 1908, Yartsevo (near Smolensk), Russia. Died 18 May1971, Moscow, Russia.
