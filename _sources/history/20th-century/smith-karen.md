**Karen Smith** is an American mathematician who works on commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. She is the Keeler Professor of Mathematics at the University of Michigan. She won the Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics for her development of tight closure methods in commutative algebra and especially for her application of these methods in algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was Fefferman who first suggested to Smith that she might make mathematics her career.
* At Ann Arbor Smith undertook research advised by Mel Hochster.
* Smith was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Michigan in 1993 after submitting her thesis Tight Closure of Parameter Ideals and F-Rationality.
* In her Research Statement, Smith gives details of her research in technical terms.
* In collaboration with Lauri Kahanpää, Pekka Kekäläinen, and William Traves, Smith wrote up the lectures and published them as the book An invitation to algebraic geometry (2000).
* Karen Smith, a highly accomplished young commutative algebraist, was led by the momentum of her work and its results to apply her techniques to problems in algebraic geometry.
* The book was reprinted in 2004, the same year as a second book by Smith was published.
* Smith is (or has been) an editor for a number of journals including: the American Journal of Mathematics; Advances in Mathematics; the Journal of the American Mathematical Society; the American Mathematical Monthly; Annales de Toulouse; and the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society.
* But of course we live in America, and Karen is 100% American ...

Born 9 May 1965, Red Bank, New Jersey, USA.
