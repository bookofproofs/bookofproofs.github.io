**Bill Thurston** was an American mathematician who won a Fields Medal for his work on 2 and 3 dimensional manifolds.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Fields Medal in 1982 for his work in low-dimensional topology. 
2. Formulated a method to classify high-dimensional manifolds, referred to as Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture.
3. Proved the existence of hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds (a major breakthrough in low-dimensional topology).
4. First comprehensive description of the Seifert–Weber space filling curves.
5. Established the hyperbolization theorem.
6. Developed the theory of train tracks in surface theory. 
7. Introduced the notion of stretch maps in surface dynamics.
8. Proposed the Thurston norm on homology classes of surfaces. 
9. Made fundamental contributions to the understanding of mapping class groups and established the work of Nielsen and Nielsen–Thurston classification.

Born 30 October 1946, Washington, D.C., USA. Died 21 August 2012, Rochester, New York, USA.
