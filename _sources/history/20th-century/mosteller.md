**Frederick Mosteller** was an Americcan statistician who wrote widely and had a big influence on the development of statistics in America.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-authored seminal works on mathematics, including the landmark study "The Federalist" (1954), which remains the cornerstone of modern research on the structure of the U.S. Constitution.
2. Developed innovative methods for evaluating quantitative data and presenting it graphically, including his pioneering use of the Stoufferâ€“Mosteller technique.
3. Led pioneering studies on the foundations of statistical inference and probability theory, as well as the applied aspects of actuarial and investment mathematics.
4. Authored influential work on the effectiveness of medical treatments, such as drug testing, that pioneered the use of what is now known as evidence-based medicine.
5. Developed mathematical theory for use in the fields of game theory, predictive modeling, and computational problems, including work on simulated annealing and the Gauss-Seidel-Mosteller algorithm.
6. Founded and served as the first Chairman of the Harvard School of Public Health Department of Biostatistics.

Born 24 December 1916, Clarksburg, West Virginia, USA. Died 23 July 2006, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.
