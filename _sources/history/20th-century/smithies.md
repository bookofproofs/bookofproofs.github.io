**Frank Smithies** was a Scottish mathematician who worked on integral equations, functional analysis, and the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of transience for holomorphic functions. 
2. Found an analytic solution to the self-incipient functional equation. 
3. Conducted pioneering work on conformal transformations. 
4. Developed the theory of difference equations and their application to differential equations. 
5. Discovered new ideas for the representation of functions by integral equations.
6. Discovered conditions under which the solutions of partial differential equations are unique. 
7. Devised an approximate solution to the intractable problem of finding non-self-intersecting curves. 
8. Applied his mathematical concepts to applied problems in electricity and magnetism. 
9. Demonstrated that unexpected periodic behaviour can arise from non-linear differential equations. 
10. Contributed to the study of the distribution of prime numbers.

Born 10 March 1912, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 16 November 2002, Cambridge, England.
