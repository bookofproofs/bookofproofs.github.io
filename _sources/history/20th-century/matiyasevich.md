**Yuri Matiyasevich** is a Russian mathematician and computer scientist who is  known for his negative solution of Hilbert's tenth problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the tenth problem of David Hilbert’s famous problem list, a famous list of 23 mathematical problems set by the German mathematician in 1900. 
2. Established the Diophantine equation solvability problem through his Negative Solution of Hilberts Tenth Problem.
3. Developed the Matiyasevich-Robinson algorithm, a proof system that is used to prove the undecidability of algorithmic problems.
4. Won the 2000 King Faisal International Prize in Science.
5. Published several books and several research papers in mathematics including volumes on Diophantine numbers, number theory, and computational mathematics.
6. Received the Wolfgang von Kilow Prize in 2009, a prestigious mathematics prize awarded by the International Mathematical Union.
7. Received numerous awards and distinctions including the Osaka University Award, Order of Friendship from the Russian Federation, and the Order of the Rising Sun from Japan.

Born 2 March 1947, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
