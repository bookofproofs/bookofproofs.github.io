**Yuri Matiyasevich** is a Russian mathematician and computer scientist who is  known for his negative solution of Hilbert's tenth problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The family were from the nobility since Vladimir Mikhailovich's father, Mikhail Stepanovich Matiyasevich, was a professional soldier.
* Yuri's mother, Galina Korotchenko, had wanted to become a doctor but she had not been able to fulfil her ambitions.
* During the war she worked as an army typist but after Yuri was born she devoted herself to bringing him up.
* Yuri was a late child for his father was forty-five years old and his mother thirty-six when he was born.
* Soon, however, Matiyasevich was taking part in Mathematical Olympiad competitions and proving highly successful.
* Matiyasevich had shown his outstanding mathematical abilities while in Leningrad for he had been highly successful in the Leningrad Mathematical Olympiad Competitions between 1960 and 1963 and in the All-Union Mathematical Olympiads between 1961 and 1963.
* at the beginning of his second year, autumn 1965, Matiyasevich was introduced to Post's canonical systems and his career as a mathematician properly began.
* Maslov made a number of suggestions for research, which Matiyasevich quickly resolved.
* Matiyasevich solved this problem too.
* Before continuing to describe Matiyasevich's career, we should look briefly at "Hilbert's Tenth Problem".
* Matiyasevich became interested in Hilbert's Tenth Problem when he was an undergraduate in his second year of study.
* Matiyasevich also published Solution of the tenth problem of Hilbert in Hungarian in 1970.
* During these years Matiyasevich corresponded with Julia Robinson and the two undertook joint research projects together.
* They met for the first time at the International Congress for Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Sciences held in Bucharest, Romania in 1971 where Matiyasevich gave the lecture On recursive unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem in which he described the joint work he had been carrying out with Julia Robinson.
* In 1980 Matiyasevich was appointed head of the Laboratory of Mathematical Logic at the Leningrad Department of the Steklov Institute.
* Let us give brief details of some more recent work by Matiyasevich.
* Of the many honours given to Matiyasevich we mention that he was: awarded the A A Markov Prize of the USSR Academy of Sciences (1980); awarded an honorary doctorate by l'Université d'Auvergne (1996); elected a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1997); received the Humboldt Research Award to Outstanding Scholars (1998); elected vice-president of the St Petersburg Mathematical Society (1998); awarded an honorary doctorate by l'Université Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris (2003); elected to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (2007); and elected as a full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (2008).

Born 2 March 1947, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
