**Johannes Boersma** was a Dutch mathematician who specialised in mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the book “Differential Geometry for Engineers”, a comprehensive guide for students learning the subject.
2. Wrote the book “Linear Algebra: Introduction to Matrices”, which provided the theoretical foundation for advanced mathematics courses.
3. Developed the Boersma-Canon (BC) geometric framework, a novel approach to teaching geometry.
4. Pioneered the concept of linear algebraic methods for solving geometry-related problems.
5. Spearheaded the development and application of linear algebra techniques for engineering and design.
6. Established a framework to relate algorithmic isomorphism with linear algebraic methods.
7. Fielded successful research projects in Differential Geometry, Lie Groups and Algebraic Geometry.
8. Constructed various mathematical theorems, propositions and corollaries dealing with linear algebra and differential geometry.
9. Implemented various linear algebra models and algorithms to solve various engineering problems.
10. Made significant contributions to the field of mathematical physics and analytical geometry.

Born 5 December 1937, Marrum, The Netherlands. Died 29 November 2004, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.
