**Morris Kline** was an American mathematician best known for his books popularising mathematics and on the history of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Morris was brought up in New York City, first in Brooklyn and then in Jamaica in the borough of Queens.
* In 1939 Kline married Helen Mann; they had two daughters, Elizabeth, Judith, and a son Douglas.
* Kline's first research was in pure mathematics and following papers related to his doctoral thesis he published Representation of homeomorphisms in Hilbert space in 1939.
* In 1959 Kline published Mathematics and the Physical World, a companion volume to Mathematics in Western Culture.
* This book emphasises Kline's firm belief that mathematics underlies all of science, indeed all of natural knowledge.
* A major book devoted to the history of mathematics Mathematical Thought From Ancient to Modern Times (1972) earned Kline much praise.
* If these texts often contained ideas that were 'mildly controversial', then Kline's books attacking the teaching of mathematics at school and university level provoked a considerably stronger reaction: Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Mathematics (1973) and Why the professor can't teach: Mathematics and the dilemma of university education (1977).
* We should not give the impression that Kline only began to attack the way mathematics is taught as he approached retirement age.
* We have only mentioned a selection of Kline's books in this biography but we have chosen to comment on typical examples which have all stimulated very worthwhile debate.
* Kline retired from teaching in 1975 although, as the list of books above indicates, he continued to publish major texts.

Born 1 May 1908, Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA. Died 10 June 1992, Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA.
