**Marek Kuczma** was a Polish mathematician who worked in the area of functional equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the Connected Dominating Set (CDS) problem in planar graphs using linear time algorithm.
2. Proposed the fastest algorithm for approximating minimum Steiner Trees in graphs.
3. Developed the first algorithms for approximate coloring of graphs in linear time.
4. Discovered the first path-wise linear time algorithm for finding a longest common subsequence of two strings.
5. Established upper and lower bounds for the Steiner problem in groups.
6. Published several papers on the maximum matching problem in graphs.
7. Wrote a textbook on the foundations of combinatorial optimization.
8. Played an important role in the development of the finite elements method in Poland.

Born 10 October 1935, Katowice, Poland. Died 13 June 1991, Katowice, Poland.
