**Marek Kuczma** was a Polish mathematician who worked in the area of functional equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Kuczma was awarded his doctorate from the Jagiellonian University of Krak√≥w in 1961 and continued to work there towards his habilitation.
* This was exactly the time when the Jagiellonian University was opening a new branch in Katowice and Kuczma was sent there to coincide with the opening in October 1963.
* Although he was a newly appointed docent, Kuczma immediately assumed the role of head of the mathematical section of the Katowice branch of the Jagiellonian University.
* On 1 December 1966, in addition to these position which he continued to hold, Kuczma became head of the Department of Functional Equations at Katowice.
* From the founding of the new University, Kuczma became the head of the mathematics section and head of the department of functional equations.
* However the new university soon produced a new structure and so from 1969 Kuczma was appointed to the new position of Director of the Mathematical Institute.
* Despite heavy administrative and teaching responsibilities, Kuczma maintained a remarkable research record with numerous publications.
* Severely disabled by the stroke, nevertheless Kuczma undertook therapy and eventually was able to return to each at the university.
* Although badly disabled and confined to his flat, Kuczma was able to continue to undertake research and publish papers and books.
* We now look briefly at the three books which Kuczma published.
* Kuczma's second book was An introduction to the theory of functional equations and inequalities.
* His final book Iterative functional equations  was written jointly with Bogdan Choczewski and Roman Ger who had worked for his doctorate with Kuczma at the Silesian University of Katowice, graduating in 1971.
* the paramount achievement of Professor Marek Kuczma was the creation and development of a systematic theory of iterative functional equations and founding a mathematical school centred around the seminar conducted by him since October 1964.
* Kuczma was considered an outstanding mathematician highly esteemed by the international community of specialists; among the functional equationists he had commonly been treated as one of the informal leaders.
* His ingenuity, efficiency and his ability of getting fast to the crux of the matter, his uncompromising attitude and adherence to honest and respectable principles of life - all these made Kuczma a great Teacher.

Born 10 October 1935, Katowice, Poland. Died 13 June 1991, Katowice, Poland.
