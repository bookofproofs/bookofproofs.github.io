**Jaap Seidel** was a Dutch mathematician who who worked in geometry and graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* At an early age already, Jaap had experience in what is now called Networking.
* When it became clear that the closure was not going to be a short one, Seidel, who had continued his studies there up to that point, now transferred to the Free University of Amsterdam where he was strongly influenced by Johannes Haantjes.
* Soon Seidel found an opportunity to escape from the Germans and was able to return to the Netherlands where he remained in hiding for the rest of the war.
* From March to July 1946, Seidel taught engineering at a secondary training school in Amsterdam, then from September 1946 to September 1950 he taught at the prestigious Vossius Gymnasium in Amsterdam.
* Haantjes had moved from Amsterdam to Leiden, so it was natural for Seidel to submit his doctoral studied there.
* Haantjes and Seidel announced the results in the paper The congruence order of the elliptic plane (1947).
* Seidel published full proof in his 71 page thesis published in 1948.
* Seidel had been put in charge of the Entertainment Committee for the International Congresses of Mathematicians held in Amsterdam in September 1954.
* In the spring of 1955 Seidel was given leave to study with Van der Ven in Rome, an unusual privilege for someone in his position.
* Johannes Haantjes became ill in 1955 (he died in the following year) and Seidel was asked to give some of his courses at Leiden.
* All these conferences published proceedings and Seidel's contribution was published in each.
* We end this biography with two tributes to Seidel.
* Many mathematicians, especially young ones, were influenced by Jaap.
* Jaap's work makes connections with several branches in mathematics, and he had struck friendships with mathematicians all over the world.
* Many of us have been warmly welcomed by Jaap and Ada into their home and into their family.

Born 19 August 1919, The Hague, The Netherlands. Died 8 May 2001, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.
