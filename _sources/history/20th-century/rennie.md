2. Developed views on the foundations of mathematics, the nature of abstraction and mathematical cognition.
3. Published seminal works on intuitionistic and formalistic approaches to mathematical inquiry.
4. Pioneered research into the intersection of analogical reasoning and mathematical proofs.
5. Translated and edited works of major 19th century German mathematicians, including Frege and Cantor.
6. Established a distinct field of research focused on the self-critical study of mathematics, which he termed metamathematics.
 7. Founded the journal ‘Mathematical Explorations’ which published seminal works by leading thinkers in the fields of mathematics, logic, and philosophy.
