**Basil Rennie** was an English mathematician who moved to Australia and worked on topics in both pure and applied mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He attended University College School, an excellent school which was founded as part of University College, London about 100 years before Basil studied there.
* Rennie's lecture notes taken while attending this course still exist.
* Rennie graduated with an MA from Cambridge in 1941.
* Rennie took a job with Rolls Royce Aero Engine division, then moved to the Austin Motor Works.
* Given the engineering background from which Rennie had come it is perhaps surprising that his research topic was lattice theory.
* Soon after he arrived in Adelaide, Rennie met Barbara Andrews who was a secretary in the Department of Engineering.
* We should recount how Rennie came to use the name David Cameron for some of his papers.
* First we should note that Rennie never looked to enhance his reputation - nothing could have been further from the way he looked at life.
* Elliott made some substantial suggestions and Rennie wanted to include him as an author of the paper.
* However Elliott did not feel that he should become a joint author but, as a compromise suggested that the paper be published under the pseudonym David Cameron, thus taking one of his names and one of Rennie's names.
* This Rennie accepted and continued to publish various articles under this name.
* To understand the range of Rennie's interests, let us look at a few papers he published during the period 1959-63.
* In 1962 Rennie left the University of Adelaide and accepted a professorship in the Air Force Academy at Point Cook, Victoria.
* Rennie held the chair of mathematics at this University until he retired in 1986.
* One of Rennie's most important contributions to Australian mathematics was when he set up the James Cook Mathematical Notes.
* Easily the most famous was Paul Erd≈ës, who came to Townsville to see Basil on many occasions.
* These were all written by Basil Rennie.
* After Rennie died the Notes ceased publication.
* After he retired, Rennie continued to publish on a wide variety of topics.

Born 24 December 1920, London, England. Died 15 November 1996, Adelaide, Australia.
