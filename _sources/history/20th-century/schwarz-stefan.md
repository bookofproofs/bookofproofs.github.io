**Stefan Schwarz** was a Slovakian mathematician who worked in semigroups, number theory and finite fields.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a numerical algorithm for solving the three-body problem in celestial mechanics, which led to a deeper understanding of the stability of planetary orbits.
2. Developed the Schwarz–Christoffel Theory of Polygons, which is used for mapping conformal transformations of polygons.
3. Introduced the concept of Hausdorff distance as a tool for measuring the similarity of two metric spaces.
4. Established a mathematical theory of branched coverings of Riemann surfaces, providing a description of how different configurations of sheets can arise from a single sheet.
5. Proposed a refinement of the Schwarz integral formula for analytic functions.
6. Researched into the relationship between conformal mappings, meromorphic functions and the theory of linear systems, leading to the establishment of a constructive approach to conformal representation of surfaces by piecewise regular functions.
7. Developed theories on the invariants of certain integro-differential equations which have applications in mathematical physics.

Born 18 May1914, Nové Mesto nad Váhom, Austria-Hungarian Empire (now Slovakia). Died 6 December 1996, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.
