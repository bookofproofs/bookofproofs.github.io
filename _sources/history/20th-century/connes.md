**Alain Connes** is a French mathematician and theoretical physicist who works in operator algebras and noncommutative geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of noncommutative geometry, an approach to geometry based on the algebraic description, which was an important breakthrough in modern mathematics. 
2. Discovered a way to find the exact values of all zeros of polynomials using his ‘Connes operator’.  
3. Formulated the ‘Fundamental Lemma of Algebra’ in 1976 which utilizes the geometry of numbers to describe the solutions of algebraic equations. 
4. Proved the ‘Cohen-Lenstra Conjecture’ on algebraic prime numbers in 1985. 
5. Jointly won the Fields Medal in 1982 for his contributions in noncommutative geometry and his proof of the ‘Hardy-Littlewood K-function Conjecture’. 
6. Published his groundbreaking book ‘Noncommutative Geometry’ in 1994.

Born 1 April 1947, Draguignan, Var, France.
