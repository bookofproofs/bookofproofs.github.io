**Walter Ledermann** was a refugee from Germany who did his doctorate at St Andrews and taught here until 1946. He did important work in algebra and in particular in group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Although very little mathematics was taught in German schools in general, Walter had the advantage that the Leibniz Gymnasium taught more mathematics than other schools as a mark of respect for Leibniz after whom the school was named.
* In 1928, when he was seventeen years old, Ledermann graduated from the Leibniz Gymnasium and received the necessary certificate which allowed him to study at any German university.
* At the University of Berlin Ledermann was taught by many famous mathematicians including Schur, Schmidt, von Mises, Planck, Schr√∂dinger, Hopf, Feigl, and others.
* Ledermann spent one semester in 1931 in Marburg but other than this all his courses were taken in Berlin.
* He was not, however, allowed to lecture but he examined Ledermann before the end of 1933.
* Ledermann was nearing the end of his studies for the Staatsexamen (which would allow him to teach) when Hitler came to power and began passing the anti-Jewish legislation.
* It was quite clear to Ledermann that he had to leave Germany to escape the Nazi persecution of the Jews.
* Ledermann's doctoral studies were supervised by Turnbull and he was awarded his Ph.D. in 1936.
* Ledermann was able to use his expert knowledge of matrix theory to put the work of this group onto a sound mathematical footing.
* The quality of the work Ledermann undertook at this time is clearly shown from the fact that Edinburgh awarded him a D.Sc. for it in 1940.
* While in Edinburgh Ledermann also worked with Max Born and A C Aitken.
* In 1938 Ledermann returned to St Andrews.
* Your special knowledge of the applications of mathematics to problems involving matrices and statistics is an advantage; but you will realise, Walter, in view of the needs of this Department, that proficiency in teaching Applied Mathematics and the functions connected therewith will be important.
* Ledermann remained at St Andrews from 1938 until 1946.
* Ledermann accepted a lectureship at the University of Manchester in 1946.
* By the time he left Manchester, Ledermann had been promoted to a Senior lecturer.
* As well as work in matrix theory which we have commented on above, Ledermann was especially known for his work in homology theory, group theory, and number theory.
* Other books which Ledermann has written for undergraduates include Complex numbers (1960), Integral calculus (1964), Multiple integrals (1966), Introduction to group theory (1973), and Introduction to group characters (1977).
* Among the editorial work undertaken by Ledermann is his editorship of the Journal of the London Mathematical Society (1968-71) and of the Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society (1974-77).
* Ledermann has received honours for his work which include election to the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1944) and an honorary doctorate from the Open University (1993).

* Ledermann remained at St Andrews from 1938 until 1946.
* Ledermann's wife Ruth (known as Rushi) was a psychotherapist and the newly married couple decided to move to a bigger city so that Ruth might be able to pursue her work.
