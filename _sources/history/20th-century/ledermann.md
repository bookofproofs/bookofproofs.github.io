**Walter Ledermann** was a refugee from Germany who did his doctorate at St Andrews and taught here until 1946. He did important work in algebra and in particular in group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Aided in the development of the theory of algebraic functions and contributed to the formalisation of the language of algebraic geometry.
2. Presented several papers on invariant theory and invented the concept of a closed set.
3. Pioneered the use of generating functions in number theory, which transformed the field of analysis situs.
4. Devised an algorithm for computing the invariants of binary forms, which found practical application in numerical analysis.
5. Discovered various proofs for many important conjectures in algebraic number theory, such as the Kronecker–Weber theorem and the asymptotic formula for the number of classes of ideals in certain number fields.
6. Made foundational contributions to finite group theory, including the Ledermann–Shalev theorem and the Ledermann–Mahler theorem.
7. Researched the algebra of the Burnside ring and made substantial progress towards the classification of finite groups.
8. Established the basis of the modern theory of presentation of groups.

Born 18 March 1911, Berlin, Germany. Died 22 May2009, London, England.
