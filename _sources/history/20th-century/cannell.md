**Mary Cannell** was an English mathematician and historian who worked extensively on George Green.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Robert Cannell (born 24 November 1882) and Mary Singleton (born 1 January 1883) were married on 10 August 1911 at the Parish Church, St Johns Bootle, Lancashire.
* Mary, the mother of the subject of this biography, was the oldest child of the tram owner William Singleton and his wife Martha.
* Robert and Mary Cannell lived at 35 Merton Road, Bootle, Liverpool and they had two children, Mary Cannell, the subject of this biography, and Robert Leslie Cannell, born 6 October 1920, who became an engineer.
* After completing her first degree, Cannell studied for a postgraduate diploma in education so that she might enter the teaching profession.
* There is no hint in the biographical details which we have just given as to why Mary Cannell might figure in an archive of mathematicians.
* widespread knowledge of Green himself dates only from the 1970s when Cannell and other Nottingham colleagues worked to restore his windmill and his memory.
* The single author work by Cannell, George Green: an enigmatic mathematician, appeared in the American Mathematical Monthly in 1999.
* Mary's pre-war studies into French culture lent insight into the mathematical sources used by Green, and her interest in English social history enabled her to appreciate the unrewarding and frustrating position in which he lived - that of a working miller and mathematical genius, struggling to find a voice in a period of social privilege and rigid class structure.
* Mary Cannell was working on projects of one sort or another - the Green website, the revised edition of the biography, research papers, the catalogue in the university of Nottingham library - right to the end, in days filled with her characteristic energy and enthusiasm.
* For many years Cannell was Secretary of the George Green Memorial Fund.
* Mary Cannell received a number of honours including being made a Fellow of the University of Nottingham (1995), an honorary graduate of the Open University (1996) and an honorary graduate of Nottingham Trent University (posthumously) (2000).

Born 19 July 1913, Liverpool, England. Died 18 April 2000, Nottingham, England.
