**Enrico Magenes** was an Italian mathematician who worked on partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a bivariate polynomial system, which is now known as the Magenes System.
2. Proved that the solutions of a bivariate polynomial system are finite and can be effectively calculated.
3. Developed a non-homogeneous linear differential system based on oscillatory solutions, which is now referred to as the Magenes-Lizorkin System.
4. Developed a theory of resolutions of finite dimensional systems, which is known as the Magenes-Cauchy problem.
5. Established the existence of fundamental solutions for elliptical systems.
6. Proved the Picard-Vessiot theorem for linear differential systems with arbitrary coefficients.
7. Discovered a new type of fundamental solutions for hyperbolic systems.
8. Applied a numerical analysis algorithm to solve differential equations with infinite-accuracy precision.

Born 15 April 1923, Milan, Italy. Died 2 November 2010, Pavia, Italy.
