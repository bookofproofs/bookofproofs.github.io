**Gregory Maxwell Kelly** was an Australian mathematician who worked in category theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Kelly then went to the University of Cambridge in England where first he studied for a B.A. which was awarded in 1953, then remained at Cambridge to undertake research in mathematics.
* Kelly's first paper Single-space axioms for homology theory  was based on the work of his doctoral thesis and published in 1959.
* In it the authors give an excellent summary of Kelly's mathematics contributions.
* This all culminated in the meticulous Eilenberg-Kelly contribution to the 1965 LaJolla Conference whose Proceedings many of us see as representative of category theory reaching maturity as a subject in its own right.
* We should also single out for mention the important book Basic concepts of enriched category theory  which Kelly published in 1982.

Born 5 June 1930, Bondi, New South Wales, Australia. Died 26 January 2007, Sydney, Australia.
