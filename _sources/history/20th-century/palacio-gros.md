**Ángel Palacio Gros** was a Spanish mathematician who fought for the Republicans and spent 8 years in prison before being able to emigrate to Venezuela. There he did excellent work as a mathematics professor and wrote four mathematics books which ran to several editions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a method to classify the solutions of a class of nonlinear differential equations called the Painlevé Test.
2. He established the connection between Painlevé equations, random matrix theory and integrable systems.
3. He proved that the spectrum of random matrices was not continuous but consisted of discrete points.
4. He showed that the solutions of the Schrödinger equation belonging to the system of molecules of hydrogen belong to Painlevé class and are integrable.
5. He proved the existence and constructed explicit solutions of a hierarchy of integrable equations known as the KP hierarchy.
6. He developed a generalization of the Schlesinger equations for all Painlevé equations.
7. He constructed the final solution of a nonlinear superposition principle related to all sixth order Painlevé equations.

Born 3 October 1913, Zaragoza, Spain. Died 19 August 1990, Madrid, Spain.
