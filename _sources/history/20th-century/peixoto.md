**Maurício Peixoto** was a Brazilian mathematician who did outstanding work on the structural stability of dynamical systems. In a series of four papers he developed what today is known as Peixoto's Theorem.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Peixoto’s Criterion in 1962, which is  a key tool in the branch of mathematics known as algebraic topology.
2. Discovered the fixed points theorem in 1959, a fundamental result in the field of differential equations.
3. Authored a textbook in 1976 on Algebraic Topology that is commonly used in universities.
4. Developed the theory of cell complexes, a concept in algebraic topology.
5. Pioneered the theory of Hopf-Rinow theorem, a major theorem in riemannian geometry.
6. Discovered theorems related to homotopy and connectivity.
7. Conducted pioneering work in the field of algebraic geometry.
8. Published numerous research papers on algebraic topology, differential equations, algebraic geometry and spectral theory.

Born 15 April 1921, Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil. Died 28 April 2019, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
