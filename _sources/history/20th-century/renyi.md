**Alfréd Rényi** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in probability theory, combinatorics, graph theory and number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Establishing a Theory of Random Graphs- Alfred Rényi developed the foundations of a theory of random graphs. He first proposed the now famous Erdős–Rényi model of a random graph, which has since become the basis of modern graph theory.
2. Introducing Renyi Divergences- Alfred Renyi introduced the concept of Renyi Divergences as a better way of measuring the distance between two probability distributions. The Renyi Divergence metric is still widely used today, especially in variational inference and Bayesian optimization.
3. Foundations of Information Theory- Rényi was one of the key figures in the foundation of information theory. He proposed the Rényi entropy, which is an important concept for measuring the self-organization of a system.
4. Contributions to Probability- Renyi's work in probability was instrumental. He developed important concepts such as the Rényi representation of random variables, the Rényi divergence, and more, which are now integral to probability theory. 
5. Developing CAPM- Rényi was a key figure in the development of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). He is credited with developing the concept of beta coefficient in the CAPM, which allows investors to measure the expected risk of a security.

Born 30 March 1921, Budapest, Hungary. Died 1 February 1970, Budapest, Hungary.
