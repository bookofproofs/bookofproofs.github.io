**Yewande Olubummo** is a Nigerian mathematician who works in the United States. In 2006-2010 she was chair of the mathematics department at Spelman College. She publishes papers on functional analysis and dynamical systems. With National Science Foundation support she led a programme to encourage minority undergraduates in mathematics to go on to graduate study.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The school was designed to provide a good education for pupils to go on to the University of Ibadan and, after graduating from the high school, this is precisely the course that Olubummo followed.
* Olubummo graduated with a B.Sc. from the University of Ibadan in 1980 and then had to spend a year as a Youth Corper.
* Olubummo was sent to Keffi, Plateau State, where she taught mathematics at a high school.
* He realised that Olubummo was having problems at Yale so he encouraged her to take an M.S. at Yale and apply to the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, for her Ph.D. She followed his advice.
* Olubummo began her research at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1983 and she was awarded a Ph.D. in 1991 for her thesis Measures on empirical logics and the properties of their associated dual Banach spaces.
* He was an associate professor of mathematics from 1975 and became a full professor from 1988 in the middle of the period when Olubummo was undertaking research.
* Bozeman encouraged Olubummo to apply for a position at Spelman College in Atlanta, which she did and was offered a post.
* Even before the award of her doctorate, Olubummo had published her first paper, a joint work with her thesis advisor Thurlow Adrean Cook.
* Another paper with Olubummo as the sole author is On duality for a generalized Monge-Kantorovich problem (2004).
* Dr Olubummo serves as a faculty mentor for the National Alliance for Doctoral Studies in the Mathematical Sciences, a program focused on fostering a sense of community for underrepresented undergraduate and graduate mathematics students.

Born 8 February 1960, Ibadan, Nigeria.
