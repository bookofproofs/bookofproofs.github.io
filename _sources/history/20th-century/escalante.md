**Jaime Escalante** was a high school mathematics teacher in both his native Bolivia and in the United States. He became famous when his students became so successful they were accused of cheating, leading to the 1988 film 'Stand and Deliver'.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He was the son of Zenobio Escalante Rodríguez and Sara Gutiérrez Valle, both of whom were teachers at elementary schools in the town of Achacachi.
* They had five children, with Jaime the second eldest of them.
* When Jaime was very young, his grandfather, José Gutiérrez, taught him to read and write when he was five or six years old.
* His mother had moved from rural Achacachi to teach in La Paz so Jaime had the benefit of better education in the city.
* Bilbao spoke to Escalante's mother and advised that he should be moved to a school which would bring out his potential.
* At this school Escalante developed a keen interest in mathematics and engineering.
* The family moved to a new house and Escalante became fascinated by physics continually doing experiments, sometimes working with his sister Bertha.
* His father had died and Escalante had to get some jobs to earn money.
* One of the teachers, however, was Humberto Bilbao who had taught Escalante at primary school.
* He involved Escalante in experiments which he loved.
* This disrupted Escalante's teacher training course and Bilbao found him a position as a mathematics teacher at the Bolívar National School and he also taught at the newly opened Gualberto Villarroel school.
* They were married on 25 November 1954 at the Calama Street Baptist Church in Cochabamba and their first child, Jaime Jr, was born in 1955.
* Escalante hesitated but in 1961 he took part in President Kennedy's 'Alliance for Progress' which was a ten year plan aimed at improving relations between the USA and Latin America.
* Escalante travelled without his family to the United States, arriving in Los Angeles on 24 December 1963.
* Fabiola and Jaime Jr joined him in Pasadena where they lived in a guest house owned by Sam Tapia, Fabiola's brother.
* Escalante was promoted to cook at the coffee shop and was able to enrol in evening classes for an Associate Degree in mathematics and physics at the Pasadena City College.
* In 1969 Jaime and Fabiola's second son Fernando was born.
* It was a tempting offer, but Escalante wanted to teach even though he understood that he would earn less than he would if he accepted Burroughs' offer.
* Escalante was interested in teaching in a Latino school.
* Escalante had three institutions to choose from: Belvedere School and two high schools, Roosevelt and Garfield in East Los Angeles, overwhelmingly populated by Hispanics.
* In May 1974, Jaime Escalante visited Garfield for the first time.
* When he looked at the pages of Escalante's curriculum, he realised that the professor had extensive knowledge of computers and was perfect for his project of implementing these courses.
* When Avilez asked Escalante if he would be a computer teacher for a new program developed here, and Escalante said, "Wonderful.
* Escalante began teaching at Garfield High School in the autumn term of 1974.
* As Escalante explained in this quote he began teaching Advanced Placement calculus in 1978 knowing that if just one student sat Advanced Placement calculus it would be an improvement on the previous year.
* Escalante's success as a teacher and the popularity of the film 'Stand and Deliver' led to jealousy among his colleagues, and Escalante received threats by letter.
* Escalante moved to become a teacher at Hiram W Johnson High School in Sacramento, California.
* By the mid-1990s, Escalante had a new campaign, namely to stop bilingual teaching in schools in California and have all lessons in English.
* Although the campaign to stop bilingual education in Californian schools was successful, Escalante made many enemies in the teaching association.
* It was a long illness and, when it was clear that he was close to the end, he was driven by Edward James Olmos, the actor who played him in 'Stand and Deliver', to the home of his son Jaime Jr in Roseville, California where he died the next day.

Born 31 December 1930, La Paz, Bolivia. Died 30 March 2010, Roseville, California, USA.
