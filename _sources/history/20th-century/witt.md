**Ernst Witt** was a German mathematician and a leading algebraist. He proved important results on Lie algebras.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Witt decomposition theorem, which provides an algebraic way to analyze and process operations in groups.
2. Pioneered in research on topological groups and linear groups.
3. Proposed and proved the Witt-Berman theorem, which states that certain quaternion algebras of arbitrary characteristic can be classified by their topological Abelian groups.
4. Authored the book ``Algebraic Number Theory and Fermat's Last Theorem'' which provides a comprehensive and up-to-date investigation of algebraic number theory, its connections with classical algebraic geometry, and its links to Fermat's Last Theorem.
5. Developed the "Duality Theorem", a foundational result in the representation theory of finite groups.
6. Discovered Witt cancellation theorem in algebraic geometry, which states that any reversible extension of an integral domain is still an integral domain.
7. Wrote ``Ernst Witt's Theory of Order'' which not only established Witt as one of the leading mathematicians of his time, but also provided a significant development of the theory of order and fields.

Born 26 June 1911, Alsen (German Baltic island) (now Als, Denmark). Died 3 July 1991, Hamburg, Germany.
