**Sergei Fomin** was a Russian mathematician who worked in topology and also in dynamical systems and mathematical biology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the Moscow State University in 1950.
2. Was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1968 for his work on the theory of singularities and the theory of real and complex functions.
3. Developed the contemporary theory of elementary functions and proposed an algorithm to build geometric objects with required properties.
4. Founded the theory of qualitative systems of differential equations with application to goal-seeking systems.
5. Established the analytical theory of linear systems of differential equations and successfully applied it to the theory of optimal processes and control systems.
6. Co-authored the famous textbook "Elements of the Theory of Functions and Functional Analysis".
7. Created the theory of the set of limit cycles which is utilized in the theory of dynamical systems in the problems of chaos.
8. Received the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1980.

Born 9 December 1917, Moscow, Russia. Died 17 August 1975, Vladivostok, Russia.
