**Volodymyr Petryshyn** is a Ukranian mathematician who worked in functional analysis. He killed his wife while suffering from a mental breakdown.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His parents were Vasyl and Maria Petryshyn.
* In 1956, while at Columbia University, Petryshyn married Arcadia Olenska (1934-1996).
* After completing his doctorate, Petryshyn was appointed as a postdoctoral fellow at New York University.
* Petryshyn's main work has been in iterative and projective methods, fixed point theorems, nonlinear Friedrichs extension, approximation-proper mapping theorem, and topological degree and index theories for multi-valued condensing maps.
* Petryshyn received several significant honours for his excellent mathematical contributions.
* Finally we should mention the Vasyl and Maria Petryshyn Memorial Lectures in Ukrainian Studies established at the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute in 1991 through a major gift donated by the estate of the late Vasyl and Maria Petryshyn, with additional funds provided by their son Volodymyr Petryshyn, and other family members.
