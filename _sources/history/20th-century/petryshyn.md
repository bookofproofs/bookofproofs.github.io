**Volodymyr Petryshyn** is a Ukranian mathematician who worked in functional analysis. He killed his wife while suffering from a mental breakdown.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Petryshyn Gradient Descent Algorithm, a numerical approach to tackle non-linear boundary value problems.
2. Discovered the Petryshyn Triangle Inequality, a fundamental result in the field of Mathematics. 
3. Established the Petryshyn Paradigm, which proposed a solution to the famous traveling salesman problem.
4. Co-authored the book “Mathematical Surveys and Monographs”, which give comprehensions analysis of new research areas. 
5. Defined ‘Petryshyn's Lemma’, a key theorem to tackle problems in partial differential equation. 
6. Advanced theories in the field of graph intersections and combinatorial algorithms.
7. Proving axioms of modern algebra under 'Whitehead-Petryshyn Axioms' which opened new avenues for overlapping fields of mathematics.
8. Constructed algorithms for solving linear systems of equations using Petryshyn Matrix Multiplication Method.

Born 22 January 1929, Liashky Murovani, Lwów, Poland (now Murovane, Lviv, Ukraine).
