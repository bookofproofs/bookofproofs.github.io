**Georgii Dmitrievic Suvorov** was a Russian mathematician who made important contributions to function theory and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After graduating, Suvorov served in the army and remained in active service until the end of the war in 1945.
* After being demobilized, Suvorov tried to continue his career along the lines that he had been intending before the war interrupted his studies.
* Suvorov completed work on his Master's Thesis (equivalent to a Ph.D.) in 1951 and, at that time was appointed as an assistant at Tomsk University.
* At Tomsk, Suvorov was soon promoted from assistant to lecturer.
* Suvorov made major contributions to the theory of functions.
* Another area on which Suvorov worked was the theory of conformal mappings and quasi-formal mappings.
* One of the many innovations in Suvorov's work was new methods which he introduced to help in the understanding of metric properties of mappings with bounded Dirichlet integral.
* In connection with this, G D Suvorov posed the problem whether there exist conformal invariant compactifications of a simply connected plane domain (in the first instance, metrizable) different from the Carathéodory (and from the "trivial" one from the point of view of the known theory of the one-point and the Stone-Čech compactifications), and about the description of all such compactifications.
* G D Suvorov and his students have constructed and studied two entirely new complete lattices of conformal-invariant compactifications.
* Let us end this biography by looking briefly at some of the monographs that Suvorov wrote.
* A collaboration between Suvorov and Oleg V Ivanov led to a number of joint papers which formed the basis for their joint monograph Complete lattices of conformally invariant compactifications of a domain (Russian).
* Suvorov's final two monographs were published in 1985 and 1986 after his death in 1984.

Born 19 May 1919, Saratov, Russia. Died 12 October 1984, Donetske, Ukraine.
