**Georgii Dmitrievic Suvorov** was a Russian mathematician who made important contributions to function theory and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Suvorov Circle, a mathematical tool to solve plane geometry problems.
2. Made contributions to the theory of n-dimensional rotational figures with regards to their moments and found several numerical identities in plane geometry.
3. Theorized the geometric construction of partial differential equations, allowing for the construction of classes of problems with exact solutions.
4. Proposed an analytic method for order and degree recognition of equation sets.
5. Demonstrated that stability of motion of the three-body problem is impossible.
6. Proposed concepts of integrability of linear differential equations.
7. Discovered the method of separating multiple integrals and solving them by iterative technique.
8. Conducted extensive research on wavelet theory and its applications to mathematical physics.
9. Advanced the theory of wavelets, introducing new notions of adaptation and sparseness, as well as developing a new algorithm for wavelet decomposition.
10. Developed the theory of difference equations, providing solutions for the problem of summation of logarithmic series.

Born 19 May 1919, Saratov, Russia. Died 12 October 1984, Donetske, Ukraine.
