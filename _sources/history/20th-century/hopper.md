**Grace Hopper** was one of the pioneers in the development of the electronic computer. She is (probably) the only mathematician to have a warship named after her.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first compiler for a programming language, which is regarded as a major breakthrough in computer science.
2. Pioneered the development of machine-independent programming languages which led to the creation of the world's first high-level programming language, COBOL.
3. Led teams of mathematicians and programmers to develop and implement the earliest computers and programs.
4. Mentored and inspired generations of computer programmers and engineers.
5. Consolidated previously disorganized fields of mathematics and electronics into computer science, leading to her nickname of â€œQueen of Code".
6. Pioneered and developed the idea of machine-independent programming language, creating a compiler that works with a programming language and translates it into machine code, enabling computers to process information quickly and accurately.
7. Developed standards to speed up communication between computers and their programs.
8. Revolutionary impact on computer science led to her becoming the first female rear admiral in the U.S. Navy.

Born 9 December 1906, New York, USA. Died 1 January 1992, Arlington, Virginia, USA.
