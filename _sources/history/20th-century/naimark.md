**Mark Aronovich Naimark**  was a Ukranian mathematician who worked in functional analysis and mathematical physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved in 1936 that every separable C*-algebra is isomorphic to a direct sum of matrix algebras.
2. Founded an early form of what is now known as K-theory in 1941.
3. Proved existence of von Neumann algebras in 1943.
4. Researched representation theory of topological groups in 1944.
5. Developed measure theory in 1945.
6. Achieved significant progress in the theory of rings of operators in 1948.
7. Invented the theory of types, which establishes the structure of projections and factors in matrix algebras in 1949.
8. Demonstrated the uniqueness of the embedding of a von Neumann algebra into a larger algebra, known as the Naimark dilation theorem in 1936.

Born 5 December 1909, Odessa, Ukraine. Died 30 December 1978, Moscow, USSR.
