**Marshall Hall, Jr** was an American mathematician who made important contributions to group theory and combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Marshall Hall Sr. was educated in private schools in Kentucky and was first employed by the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad Company.
* Marshall Hall Sr. worked his way up to become president of the W L Green Commission Company in 1903.
* In 1915 the company was renamed the Marshall Hall Grain Company, with Marshall Hall Sr. as its president.
* Marshall Hall Jr showed talent for mathematics at a young age for, at age eleven, he constructed a seven-place table of logarithms for the positive integers up to 1000.
* Marshall was taught mathematics by a good teacher although he was not a mathematician, being employed as a German teacher.
* At Cambridge he was taught by several mathematicians who were to have an important influence on him such as Philip Hall, Harold Davenport and G H Hardy.
* After the award of his Ph.D., Hall spent the year 1936-37 at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
* We shared space in Fine Hall with the Mathematics Department.
* While at the Institute for Advanced Study, Hall received offers of an Instructorship in Mathematics from Columbia University and a similar offer from Yale University.
* With the United States now at war, Hall joined Naval Intelligence and was involved, as were many other mathematicians, deciphering Japanese coded messages and deciphering German Enigma codes.
* Hall spent six months at Bletchley Park, the centre for British Intelligence, during 1944.
* Hall's 48-page paper Projective planes was published in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society in 1943.
* Hall, therefore, accepted an appointment as an associate professor at Ohio State University and began teaching there in the autumn of 1946.
* Saunders Mac Lane had recommended Hall to Tibor Rad√≥, the chairmen of the Ohio State Mathematics Department, who treated him very well.
* Hall is best known as a group theorist, perhaps because of his famous book Theory of Groups (1959) from which several generations of group theorists have learnt the subject.
* He was writing this book during his year in Cambridge and Philip Hall read his manuscript and made many helpful suggestions.
* Hall spent time at the University of Warwick Group Theory year in August 1967 and, while in England, visited Philip Hall in Cambridge.
* This group is now known as the Hall-Janko group.
* The uniqueness of the simple group of this order was proved in Hall's paper, written jointly with David Wales, The simple group of order 604,800 (1968).
* We should go back a little at this point and look at some of Hall's other contributions to group theory.
* When P Hall found himself unable to return to the plan, M Hall, Jr used his wide experience in group theory to fill his place and to explain the theoretical background of the construction.
* In 1973 Hall was named IBM Professor at CalTech but, in 1977, he arranged for his appointment at CalTech to be half-time so that he could spend time in other institutions.
* Among the honours Hall received were two Guggenheim Fellowships and membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
* The Marshall Hall Conference was held at the University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, September 13-18, 1990.
* The original impetus for the conference was to celebrate the 80th  birthday of Marshall Hall.

Born 17 September 1910, St Louis, Missouri, USA. Died 4 July 1990, London, England.
