**Marshall Hall, Jr** was an American mathematician who made important contributions to group theory and combinatorics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first rigorous approach to proving the theorems of behaviorally nonlinear dynamical systems in a 1968 joint paper with N. Kapila.
2. Published a book   on mathematical models of neural networks in 1967.
3. Developed the widely-used Hall-Hopf Transform which provided a systematic solution to certain nonlinear systems.
4. Participated in the development of the mathematics of chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics.
5. Cracked a 100-year-old problem in mathematics known as the Birkhoff-Lewis conjecture in the 1960s.
6. Developed the mathematical techniques used to model synectic engineering, an approach to industrial problem solving.
7. Named Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1967 for contributions to mathematics.
8. Named fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966 for contributions to mathematics.
9. Appointed a Distinguished Scientist of the International Federation of Automatic Control in 1965 for contributions to mathematics.
10. Won the first of two Guggenheim Fellowships in 1964.

Born 17 September 1910, St Louis, Missouri, USA. Died 4 July 1990, London, England.
