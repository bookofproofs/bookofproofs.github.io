**Dmitrii Faddeev** was a Russian mathematician who worked mainly in algebra, and who made significant contributions to other areas such as number theory, function theory, geometry and probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Faddeev-LeVerrier theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a dynamical system of ordinary differential equations to possess a constant of motion in addition to the Hamiltonian.
2. Developed the Faddeev–Fokas integrable hierarchy, a set of nonlinear partial differential equations which describe the evolution of physical and geometrical objects.
3. Discovered the formula for the Euler–Faddeev hypergeometric polynomials, polynomials which have important applications in numerical analysis and theoretical physics.
4. Developed the Faddeev–Konopleva algorithm, allowing for numerical solutions to non-linear self-adjoint elliptic equations.
5. Derived the basis of the Faddeev–Popov matrix method, which simplifies the evaluation of Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory.

Born 30 June 1907, Yukhnov, Smolensk, now Kaluga, Russia. Died 30 October 1989, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
