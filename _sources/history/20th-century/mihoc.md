**Gheorghe Mihoc** was a Romanian mathematician and statistician.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After attending elementary school in Bucharest, Mihoc's secondary education was at the Gheorghe Sincai Gymnasium.
* Mihoc graduated from the Gheorghe Sincai Gymnasium in 1925 and, in the same year, entered the Faculty of Science of the University of Bucharest.
* At Bucharest University, he was taught geometry by Gheorghe Țițeica, the professor of Analytical Geometry.
* Țițeica had just published the monograph Géométrie différentielle projective des réseaux Ⓣ(Projective differential geometry of networks) (1923) and, when he taught Mihoc, was writing another important monograph The projective differential geometry of lattices.
* Țițeica's geometry lectures gave the spirit of current research and inspired Mihoc.
* Graduating in 1928, Mihoc was unable to find employment as a teacher.
* However, his career was saved by Onicescu who was promoted to professor the year that Mihoc graduated.
* Onicescu not only found Mihoc a job in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Studies of the Social Insurance Service, but even persuaded the Service that they should fund him to spend a year in Rome undertaking specialist actuarial training.
* Mihoc was also taught by the economist Rodolfo Benini who had held the chair of statistics in Rome until 1928 when he was appointed to the chair of economics.
* Mihoc studied for the degree of Doctor of Statistical and Actuarial Sciences advised by Castelnuovo and defended his thesis on Markov chains in Rome in July 1930.
* After returning to Bucharest, Mihoc continued with his actuarial work and was appointed as an assistant at the School of Statistics, Actuarial Studies, and Calculation which had been founded in that year.
* At this School, which was later named an Institute, Mihoc taught actuarial mathematics from 1930 to 1948.
* By this time Mihoc was collaborating with his former professor, Octav Onicescu, and they published Sur les chaines de variables statistiques Ⓣ(On chains of statistical variables) in 1935.
* In 1937 Mihoc was appointed as an assistant at the University of Bucharest and was promoted first to lecturer, then to professor.
* We give a few more details of his career at the University of Bucharest after first looking at other aspects of Mihoc's contributions.
* The last book in the list was published in 1981, the year in which Mihoc died at the age of  75.
* We note that, several years before this collaboration, Mihoc supervised Craiu's doctoral studies; he was awarded his doctorate in 1968.
* Despite this outstanding publication record consisting of the impressive list of books already mentioned together with 70 research papers, Mihoc also spent much of his career in administration.
* We have already given a few details of Mihoc's career, but we now give a few more.

Born 7 July 1906, Brăila, Romania. Died 25 December 1981, Bucharest, Romania.
