**Maryna Viazovska** is a Ukrainian mathematician who is professor at the Chair of Number Theory at the Institute of Mathematics of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland. She solved the sphere-packing problem in dimension 8 and, in collaboration with others, the sphere-packing problem in dimension 24.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* At this school Viazovska was influenced, in particular, by Andrii Knyazyuk (1960-2013).
* In 2001 Viazovska graduated from the Kiev Natural Science Lyceum no.
* While studying at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kiev, Viazovska competed in the Mathematical Olympiad Competition in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 and won the top award in 2002 and 2005.
* While at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kiev, Viazovska began working with Andriy Bondarenko and they published the paper Bernstein type inequality in monotone rational approximation.
* After the award of her first degree from the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kiev, Viazovska went to Germany to study for a Master's Degree at the Kaiserslautern University of Technology.
* In 2007 Viazovska graduated with a Master's Degree from Kaiserslautern and in May 2010, she defended her Candidate's thesis at the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine on the topic "Inequalities for polynomials and rational functions and quadrature formulas in the sphere".
* Viazovska was awarded her Dr. rer.
* He along, with Radchenko and Viazovska, solved the spherical t-design conjecture by Korevaar and Meyers concerning optimal approximation of integrals over the sphere by arithmetic means of values of the integrand.
* After a time as a postdoctoral researcher at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques in France, Viazovska moved to Berlin in 2014 where she was a postdoctoral researcher at the Berlin Mathematical School and the Humboldt University of Berlin.
* Viazovska's solution to the 8-dimensional case was published in the paper The sphere packing problem in dimension 8 (2017).
* The 24 dimension case was also published in 2017 in the paper The sphere packing problem in dimension 24 written by Henry Cohn, Abhinav Kumar, Stephen D Miller, Danylo Radchenko and Maryna Viazovska.
* After the recent spectacular solution of the sphere packing problem in dimension 8 by M S Viazovska, the paper under review solves the problem in dimension 24.
* The proof follows the eight-dimensional approach of Viazovska.
* Maryna Viazovska (EPFL) for her deep contributions to spherical designs and particularly for the solution of the sphere packing problem in dimensions 8 and 24.
* Viazovska was an invited speaker in the Combinatorics and Number Theory Section of the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio de Janeiro.
* Maryna Viazovska's work has been described as "simply magical," "very beautiful" and "extremely unexpected." Her solution to the sphere-packing problem in dimension eight, while conceptually simple, has a deep structure based on certain functions that she explicitly constructs in terms of modular forms.
* Viazovska has continued to make further breakthroughs.
* Solving a mathematical problem that has been around for centuries is no small feat, but Viazovska has bigger ambitions.

Born 2 November 1984, Kiev, Ukranian SSR (now Kyiv, Ukraine).
