**Sun-Yung Alice Chang** is a Chinese born American mathematician  whose research interests include the study of certain geometric types of nonlinear partial differential equations and the related extremal inequalities and problems in isospectral geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In her thesis, Chang worked on problems in classical analysis, in particular the study of boundary behaviour of bounded analytic functions on the unit disc.
* After receiving her doctorate, Chang was appointed as an assistant professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo for the academic year 1974-1975.
* In 1980 Chang returned to the University of California at Los Angeles as an associate professor, being later promoted to full professor.
* Chang's research interests include the study of certain geometric types of nonlinear partial differential equations.
* Perhaps Chang's greatest honour was the award of the 1995 Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics.
* Chang received the prize at the American Mathematical Society meeting in San Francisco in January 1995.
* In 1998, in addition to her Professorship at the University of California, Los Angeles, Chang was appointed Professor at Princeton University.
* Chang has received many honours in addition to the Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics which we described above.
* On 28 April 2009 the National Academy of Sciences announced that Chang had been elected a member.
* In June 2009 Chang was one of the organisers of '2009 the Program for Women and Mathematics' held at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
* As to her hobbies, Chang lists reading novels, taking walks and listening to music.
