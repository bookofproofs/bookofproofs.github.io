**Yurii Alekseevich Mitropolskiy** was a Ukrainian mathematician known for his contributions to dynamical systems and nonlinear oscillations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Mitropolskii Transform of fractional-order differential equations. 
2. Developed the Samarsky-Mitropolsky Theory of Linearized Open Systems. 
3. Developed the Mitropolsky-Vujanovic method of summation of divergent series. 
4. Published Fundamental Asymptotics Theory of at least 5 books. 
5. Discovered the Mitropolskii Inequality for Bessel functions of the first kind. 
6. Conducted many research studies on the asymptotic behavior of Partial Differential Equations. 
7. Rated as ‘Nauka high Mathematician’ by the highest Academy of Science in Russia. 
8. Hyers–Ulam–Rassias Stability of Functional Equations was derived from the Mitropolsky Inequality.
9. Developed the Mitropolskii Theorem for fractional integration of second order equations.
10. Proposed an initialization condition for dynamical systems which works as an efficient numerical method of approximating solutions.

Born 3 January 1917, Charnyshivka, Shyshats'kyi, Poltava gubernia, Ukraine. Died 14 June 2008, Kyiv, Ukraine.
