**José Luis Massera** was an outstanding Uruguayan mathematician who had problems with his career due to his left-wing political views. He was imprisoned for nine years by the right-wing Uruguayan military dictatorship.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made several important contributions to the development of nonlinear dynamical systems theory. 
2. Established the foundations of today’s non-integer order differential equations theory. 
3. Developed the concept of Fourier Integral Operator in degree theory. 
4. Defined a general framework for the qualitative study of nonlinear dynamical systems. 
5. Developed the theory of the Coexistence of Stable Periodic Solutions in the presence of chaos. 
6. Developed the fundamental theoretical ideas and results leading to the successful development of the Massera Centre Interval Method (MCIM). 
7. Established numerous theorems in the area of the qualitative theory of differential equations, on differentiable dynamical systems and mathematical analysis. 
8. Pioneered the fields of ergodic theory, chaos theory, and random dynamical systems. 
9. Developed the Interval Massera Inequality and the Massera Fixed Point Theorem. 
10. Published numerous papers on the theory of diffeomorphisms, linear and nonlinear differential equations and algebraic dynamical systems.

Born 8 June 1915, Genoa, Italy. Died 9 September 2002, Montevideo, Uruguay.
