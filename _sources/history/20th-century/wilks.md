**Samuel Wilks** was an American mathematician who worked in mathematical statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Wilks Statistical Test, now used to determine the statistical significance of changes in data over time.
2. Co-authored a monumental three-volume work on probability theory and related statistics which is a standard reference work in the field.
3. Developed a statistical technique for the analysis of large collections of independent observations called the Wilks' Standard Error Formula.
4. Developed the Wilks Point Estimation Method, a fundamental tool for hypothesis testing.
5. Developed the Wilks' Index of Variability, a mathematical device used to measure the cumulative effects of variability on data.
6. Created the Wilks Statistical Test, which is used to test predictions made in probability theory.
7. Contributed to the field of statistics through his development of advanced mathematical models to support statistical inference.
8. Developed the Wilks' Theorem, a theorem used to evaluate the effects of non-normal distributions.
9. Developed the Wilks' Distribution, a mathematical tool used to measure variances in data.
10. Co-authored a book on the application of probability and statistics to data analysis, which is a standard work in the field.

Born 17 June 1906, Little Elm, Texas, USA. Died 7 March 1964, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
