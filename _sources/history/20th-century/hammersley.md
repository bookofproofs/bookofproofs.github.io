**John Hammersley** was a Scottish mathematician who worked in statistics and probability and in particular in Monte Carlo methods.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Monte Carlo Method for integration and optimization.
2. Showed the importance of statistical distributions in computational methods.
3. Advanced the numerical method for conformal mapping.
4. Pioneered a new algorithm for faster computation of random numbers.
5. Developed the theory of random walks and its applications to optimization problems.
6. Created mathematical models of fluid flows and studied the properties of surface growth in physical experiments.
7. Conducted numerical methods which enabled better understanding of surface tension and other molecular phenomena.
8. Explored the potential of Boolean networks and their ability to represent and simulate physical processes.

Born 21 March 1920, Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, Scotland. Died 2 May2004, Oxford, England.
