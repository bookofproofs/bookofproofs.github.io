**John Hammersley** was a Scottish mathematician who worked in statistics and probability and in particular in Monte Carlo methods.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Guy Hammersley worked for the United States Steel Corporation and at the time of John's birth he was in charge of their Glasgow office.
* The Hammersley family moved to England when John was very young then, when he was five years old, his father was made redundant but found employment as the London manager for the Youngstown Steel and Tube Company.
* John's primary education began in 1925 when he entered the Waterside School in Bishops Stortford.
* Hammersley published a variety of papers in 1951 including A theorem on multiple integrals, On a certain type of integral associated with circular cylinders, The sums of products of the natural numbers, and The total length of the edges of the polyhedron.
* One of the areas which typified Hammersley's mathematical contributions was in Monte Carlo methods, a technique to estimate a quantity through computations involving random numbers.
* In 1965, after contributing many papers on the topic, Hammersley published the book Monte Carlo Methods, jointly authored with D C Handscomb.
* With the publication of the book Hammersley seemed to feel that he should move on to other topics, which indeed he did.
* In addition to his research, Hammersley was also passionately interested in mathematical education and wrote many articles on the topic.
* In 1987 he retired from his positions in Oxford and David Kendall gave a Speech proposing the toast to John Hammersley - 1 October 1987  which was subsequently published under this title.
* Hammersley was also honoured with a conference at the Mathematical Institute in Oxford in 1990 to celebrate his 70th  birthday.
* The proceedings of the conference were published under the title Disorder in physical systems edited by G R Grimmett and D J A Welsh (who were both Hammersley's doctoral students).
* Hammersley received many honours for his outstanding contributions.

Born 21 March 1920, Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, Scotland. Died 2 May 2004, Oxford, England.
