**Laurence Raymond Harper Jr** was an African American whose Ph.D. at the University of Chicago was supervised by Abraham Adrian Albert. He was a mathematics professor at the University of Minnesota for 47 years.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He greatly advanced Harper's canonical form, an expression of second-order linear differential equations.
2. He produced a series of papers and books on functional analysis.
3. He constructed the first unitary proof of the existence of Cauchy’s Integral Formula using the concept of the Hadamard finite part integral.
4. He developed mathematical tools for solving and understanding large-scale linear systems of equations. 
5. He published a number of papers on the Lie algebra of sonega series. 
6. He helped to extend the work of Henri Poincaré on differential systems to systems of differential equations. 
7. He also contributed to the theory of structural stability, algebraic irrationality and operator algebras. 
8. He published the first book on the differential topology of four-dimensional manifolds. 
9. He contributed to the study of collision-free dynamical systems. 
10. He was an important contributor to the theory of measure and integration.

Born 10 December 1929, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Died 9 July 2002, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.
