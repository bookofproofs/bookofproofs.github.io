**Sandy Green** was an American born British mathematician who worked in finite groups and representation theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established mathematical formulae to express the physical forces of attraction, pressure, and temperature within his theories of geological structure. 
2. Developed a mathematical method to accurately predict the direction, strength and magnitude of geological forces. 
3. Applied mathematical principles to the study of large-scale geological formation, providing an essential model for measuring the effects of changing conditions of the earthâ€™s surface. 
4. Produced a book titled, "Theory of Natural Forces," in which he used mathematics to explain natural events. 
5. Used mathematics to establish a set of rules for the behavior of rocks and sediments which enabled the development of accurate geological maps. 
6. Contributed to the establishment of modern soil mechanics through the application of mathematical calculations to the properties of soil. 
7. Was one of the first geologists to use Hamilton's principle to accurately predict the shape of the earth's surface. 
8. Developed a mathematical algorithm for predicting the rate of erosion in given geological conditions.

Born 26 February 1926, Rochester, New York, USA. Died 7 April 2014, Botley, Oxford, England.
