**Shanti Gupta** was an Indian mathematician who worked in America. He worked in statistics and decision theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* For example in the year which Gupta was awarded his doctorate, three scientists at the Bell Laboratories were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing the transistor.
* Gupta's first publications include the following with Milton Sobel: On a statistic which arises in selection and ranking problems (1957); On selecting a subset which contains all populations better than a standard (1958); On the distribution of a statistic based on ordered uniform chance variables (1958); and Selecting a subset containing the best of several binomial populations (1960).
* Gupta publication record is exceptional containing over 200 items.
* Gupta held academic posts at universities such as the University of Alberta and New York University where he worked at the Courant Institute.
* For his many contributions to statistics, Gupta was honoured by election as a fellow of several societies such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Statistical Association, and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (for which he served a term as president).
* Gupta married Marianne Heinicke; they had one daughter Maya.
