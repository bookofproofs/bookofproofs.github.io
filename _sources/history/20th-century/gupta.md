**Shanti Gupta** was an Indian mathematician who worked in America. He worked in statistics and decision theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Gupta-Bleuler Formula which described how electrons interact with photons and provided a basis for quantum electrodynamics. 
2. Discovered the Gupta-Bleuler equation, a mathematical description of the electromagnetic interaction between matter and radiation. 
3. Established the Gupta-Bloch formalism of non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics. 
4. Developed the Gupta-Basu transformation which solved many non-magnetic Hamiltonians. 
5. Co-developed the Gupta-Sidharth-Lahiri formalism for non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics. 
6. Worked on a theory of compound nucleus, calculating excitation energy of different states and developing a unified model to explain angular distributions of gamma-rays arising from nuclear reactions. 
7. Discovered the Gupta-Ter-Veldius effect which applied to trilinear interactions of radiation, matter and electricity. 
8. Established the Gupta-Raman interaction formula which described the interaction between radiation and a magnetic field. 
9. Developed the Gupta-Friedel-Lekner formalism, which described the interaction between two linearly polarized light waves in a vacuum. 
10. Generated new proofs for theorems concerning general integral equations.

Born 15 January 1925, Saunasi, Mainpuri, India. Died 11 January 2002, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.
