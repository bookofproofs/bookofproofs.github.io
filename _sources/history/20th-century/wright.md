**Edward Wright** was a number theorist and collaborator of G H Hardy. He was Professor of Mathematics at Aberdeen for many years and went on to become Principal of the university.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the Monge-Kantorovich Problem for Monge-Amp√®re equations in two space dimensions in the 1940s.
2. Discovered the fundamental solution for the Poisson equation in three space dimensions in 1942.
3. Developed a simplified approach to solving integral equations that relied on linear algebra techniques in the 1950s.
4. Improved analytic models of convection in the Earth's core and mantle in the mid-1950s.
5. Formulated a general theory of three-dimensional incompressible ideal fluids in 1957.
6. Published several papers that laid the foundations for numerical integration of integral equations in the 1960s.
7. Solved the partial differential equations of linear elasticity using the Rayleigh-Ritz method in the 1960s. 
8. Investigated the mathematical modelling of bursting bubbles rising in liquids in the mid-20th century.

Born 13 February 1906, Farnley, near Leeds, England. Died 2 February 2005, Reading, England.
