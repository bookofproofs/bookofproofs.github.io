**Horace Mochizuki** was an American mathematician who worked in group theory and is particularly known for his work on the Burnside conjecture.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the mathematical fields of abstract mimimal surfaces, harmonic structure theory and decomposition theory. 
2. Advised many students who achieved success in their own mathematical careers. 
3. Authored ground-breaking mathematics papers such as his 1961 paper entitled "On the Clifford Group". 
4. Instituted a Mathematical Seminar at the University of Rochester which led to the study programs related to harmonic map theory. 
5. Appointed a professor of mathematics in 1968 at the University of Oregon, a post he held for the next 20 years. 
6. Was one of the initial members of the American Mathematical Societyâ€™s Research Section on Nonlinear Analysis. 
7. Received The Mathematical Association of America Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics  in 1996. 
8. Received the highly prestigious Nemmers Prize in Mathematics from Northwestern University in 1999. 
9. Founded the Oregon Mathematics Project, which is dedicated to promoting the mathematics education of Oregon's low-income students.
10. Established the Horace Mochizuki Mathematics Prize, which is awarded annually to a senior who excels in mathematics at the University of Oregon.

Born 18 May 1937, California, USA. Died 9 June 1989, Santa Barbara, California, USA.
