**Horace Mochizuki** was an American mathematician who worked in group theory and is particularly known for his work on the Burnside conjecture.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Horace was brought up on a farm in the Great Central Valley, in California, U.S.A. Horace was only four years old when over 180 Japanese aircraft attacked Pearl Harbour on 7 December 1941.
* Mochizuki was very musical and while at high school he also attended the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara where he played the violin.
* Mochizuki's first three papers were on ring theory.
* When Mochizuki arrived in Santa Barbara he soon met another young mathematician Seymour Bachmuth and in December 1965 they began a collaboration.
* From this time on Mochizuki contributed to the theory of groups.
* We should make special mention of Mochizuki's paper Unipotent matrix groups over division rings (1978) where he presented a non-commutative version of "Kolchin's Theorem" which solved a famous problem of Kaplansky.
* Four years later Mochizuki did not attend the Groups St Andrews conference but contributed an important survey paper Automorphisms of solvable groups II.
* The junior faculty especially appreciated Horace's advice and encouragement.
* Horace loved teaching and doing mathematical research and felt fortunate to be able to do these things.

Born 18 May 1937, California, USA. Died 9 June 1989, Santa Barbara, California, USA.
