**Wilhelm Specht** was a German mathematician who in worked group theory and representation theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He published numerous articles and monographs on the mathematics of probability, number theory, and algebra. 
2. He contributed to the mathematical theory of probability by generalizing the expression of a Bernoulli trial, which improved the validity of the binomial theorem. 
3. He founded a subcommittee of the Berlin Academy to focus on developing mathematics curriculums and wrote several textbooks on mathematics. 
4. He made contributions to a general theory on number theory, devising an iterative solution procedure for solving diophantine equations. 
5. He researched primitive roots and proved an important theorem concerning the existence of a prime number between two consecutive that had long been known without proof. 
6. He was honoured with an inaugural fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for his contributions to mathematics. 
7. He was a member of the Berlin Academy, the British Academy, and the Royal Society. 
8. He was awarded a doctorate from the University of Berlin for his seminal thesis on algebraic equations.

Born 22 September 1907, Rastatt, Baden, Germany. Died 19 February 1985, Herrsching, Bavaria, Germany.
