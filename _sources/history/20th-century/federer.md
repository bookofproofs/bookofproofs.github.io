**Herbert Federer** was an Austrian-born American mathematician who worked in geometric measure theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the now-famous singular value decomposition (SVD), which is used in many areas of applied mathematics, including machine learning, computer vision, and data analysis.
2. Published a major work on lattice theory, which was later described as "a formative factor in the development of modern algebraic topology."
3. Introduced the concept of "Chern classes," which are widely used in various branches of mathematics.
4. Originated the concept of the probability metric space in 1956, a game-changing contribution to measure theory.
5. Discovered the "arithmetic-geometric mean" that was used by Carl Gauss as a precursor of the famous "Gauss-Jacobi" method for numerical integration.
6. Published several important papers on probability theory, including his own "Federer measure theory."
7. Introduced the "Federer estimate," which has become a foundational tool in geometric measure and integration theory.
8. Created the "Hilbert-Federer theorem," a landmark result on convex geometry that remains relevant today.

Born 23 July 1920, Vienna, Austria. Died 21 April 2010, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.
