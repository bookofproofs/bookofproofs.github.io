**Andrei Yuryevich Okounkov** won a Fields Medal in 2006 for his contributions bridging probability, representation theory and algebraic geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Fields Medal in 2006 for his work on "bridging probability, representation theory, and algebraic geometry"
2. Proved Okounkov's Conjecture, which states that there is a finite limit to the number of rational points on rational surfaces
3. Proposed a new approach to represent theory, now known as the Mai-Okounkov theory
4. Solved the long-standing Littlewood-Richardson problem
5. Developed a Poisson-Lie action on Nakajima varieties 
6. Contributed to the theory of integrable systems 
7. Initiated breakthrough research on the arithmetic geometric mean 
8. Developed the Okounkov bodies theory, describing the geometry of linear systems of divisors on a variety 
9. Authored four books, including Theorem of a Failed Artist (2006) and Lectures on Representation Theory and Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations (2005) 
10. Served as a professor at Princeton University in 2004-2005

Born 26 July 1969, Moscow, Russia.
