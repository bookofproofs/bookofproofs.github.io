**Georgievich Vitushkin** was a Russian mathematician who worked on analytic capacity and other parts of mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the radial symmetry of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation in three-dimensional Euclidean space.
2. Developed the concept of Sobolev Spaces to describe the behavior of weak solutions to certain partial differential equations.
3. Established the existence of removable singularities for the classical solution of the biharmonic equation.
4. Discovered necessary and sufficient conditions for the solution of the Dirichlet problem in two-dimensional manifolds, a result which is known as the Vitushkin Regularity Theorem.
5. Developed singular integral equations as a useful tool to study regularity of solutions to partial differential equations in two-dimensional domains.
6. Founded the Vitushkin theorem, which provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundary values of a function to be determined by its null set.
7. Used the Variational Iteration Method to solve some nonlinear integral and integro-differential equations, as well as certain functional equations.
8. Proved existence and uniqueness theorems for solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.
9. Developed the C-theory, an important tool for the study of nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations.

Born 25 June 1931, Moscow, Russia. Died 9 May 2004, Moscow, Russia.
