**Curtis McMullen** is an American mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1998 for his work in complex dynamics, hyperbolic geometry and Teichmüller theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Awarded the Fields Medal in 1998 for his work in the field of dynamical systems, specifically for developing a proof of the Sullivan Conjecture.
2. Received the Bocher Memorial Prize in 2000 for his groundbreaking contribution to the understanding of dynamical systems.
3. His research greatly expanded the theory of Teichmuller Spaces - this theory allows us to examine complex surfaces and their shapes.
4. Solved several difficult problems related to three-dimensional manifolds.
5. Made major progress in the study of the space of rational maps.
6. Explored the number theory in relation to Markoff numbers.
7. Won the prestigious Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry in 2004.
8. Appointed Professor at Harvard University in 2005.

Born 21 May1958, Berkeley, California, USA.
