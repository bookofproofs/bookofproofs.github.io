**Klaus Roth** won a Fields Medal in 1958 for his work on approximating algebraic numbers by rationals.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved Weyl’s theorem on the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues (1958).
2. First to prove a result concerning the difference between consecutive prime numbers (1955).
3. Developed the tabulation of regular and subregular lattices and the Klaus-Roth theorem (1956).
4. Constructed the Siegel sets and established their properties (1960).
5. Discovered the interior regularity of solutions to linear elliptic systems (1965).
6. Established a representation theorem for the space of polynomials of several variables (1971).
7. Identified the structure of the arithmetic sets associated with linear forms in many variables (1977).
8. Characterized the properties of subsets of the integers which have no three-term arithmetic progressions (1997).

Born 29 October 1925, Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 10 November 2015, Inverness, Scotland.
