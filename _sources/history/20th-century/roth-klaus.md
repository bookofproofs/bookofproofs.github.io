**Klaus Roth** won a Fields Medal in 1958 for his work on approximating algebraic numbers by rationals.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After graduating, Roth was appointed as an assistant master at the internationally famous Gordonstoun School, which lies 10 km north of Elgin in Scotland.
* Roth returned to London in 1946 to undertake research at University College.
* In fact Roth made a remarkable mathematical breakthrough while still a lecturer at University College.
* It was for this work that Roth was awarded a Fields Medal in 1958.
* Davenport presented Roth with the Fields Medal at the International Congress in Edinburgh in 1958.
* Roth's theorem settles a question which is both of a fundamental nature and of extreme difficulty.
* Davenport, in his Fields Medal presentation, mentions another problem solved by Roth.
* This was Roth's proof in 1952 of a conjecture made in 1935 by Erdős and Turán.
* It is not difficult to find the moral in Dr Roth's work.
* Roth moved to the chair of Pure Mathematics in Imperial College, London in 1966 and held this chair until 1988.
* The Fields Medal was not the only honour to be bestowed on Roth.

Born 29 October 1925, Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland). Died 10 November 2015, Inverness, Scotland.
