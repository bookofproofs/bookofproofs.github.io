**Karol Borsuk** was a Polish mathematician who made important contributions to topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a homology theory for cell complexes, providing a basis for algebraic topology.
2. Introduced the notion of dimension in topology, leading to the Borsuk–Ulam theorem.
3. Pioneered the use of algebraic topology to study projects in geometry and logic.
4. Introduced homotopic delta-sets, which is the basis of homotopy theory.
5. Contributed to the development of axiomatization of algebraic topology.
6. Proposed the dimension equivalent of the Heawood conjecture, now known as the Borsuk–Ulam theorem.
7. Developed a method for constructing limits of topological spaces, now referred to as the Borsuk–Hahn–Banach theorem. 
8. Defined the notion of group-homotopy equivalence. 
9. Developed the first obstruction theory for extending vector fields on a sphere.
10. Made important contributions to mathematical foundations, such as the theory of continuity, measurement theory, and abstract computability theory.

Born 8 May 1905, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 24 January 1982, Warsaw, Poland.
