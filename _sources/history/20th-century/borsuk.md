**Karol Borsuk** was a Polish mathematician who made important contributions to topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* When Borsuk entered the University of Warsaw to study mathematics it was an exciting centre for research in topology; Saks and Mazurkiewicz were both teaching at the University and making major advances in the topic.
* Borsuk obtained his master's degree from the University of Warsaw in 1927 and then, from 1929, he taught at the University.
* On 26 April 1936 Borsuk married Zofia Paczkowska.
* Borsuk visited there and during one such visit began a collaboration with Ulam.
* It was a joint paper with Borsuk, published in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society.
* In Lwów Borsuk joined the mathematicians in the Scottish Café and contributed to the open problems which they wrote down in the famous book.
* Borsuk's career was of course about to be interrupted by the start of World War II.
* During the Nazi occupation Borsuk tried to keep the University of Warsaw functioning in the way that Kuratowski describes in the quote above.
* Borsuk, however, escaped and was able to survive by remaining in hiding throughout the rest of the war.
* Borsuk and Kuratowski both played important roles in this reconstruction.
* Borsuk continued in his post in the University of Warsaw, a post he held throughout his career, being promoted to professor in 1946.
* In Warsaw, Borsuk led a seminar in which he developed a unique atmosphere of successful international cooperation.
* The notion had immediate impact on other topologists, and in particular on Borsuk's own students.
* Many honours were given to Borsuk for his remarkable contributions.

Born 8 May 1905, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 24 January 1982, Warsaw, Poland.
