**Ludvig Faddeev** was a  Russian mathematical physicist who worked in quantum field theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received the Lenin Prize in 1965 and the Euler Prize (jointly with Yakov Frenkel) in 1971.
2. Established new methods of solving nonlinear partial differential equations in 1962. 
3. Proposed the idea of nonlinear hyperbolic equations with solitons that ultimately led to the theory of inverse scattering problem in 1965.
4. Developed the theory of the hydrogen atom in strong magnetic fields in 1967.
5. Co-authored the widely influential book, ‘Quantum Scattering Theory’ with Viktor Fainaovich Faddeev in 1978. 
6. Won the Dirac Medal and Prize from the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in 1987.
7. Contributing member to numerous mathematical works such as the "Faddeev-Popov ghosts" in quantum field theory and the "Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian" for gauge theories in physics. 
8. Developed the Faddeev equations for any system with three or more particles in 1965.
9. Established the Faddeev-Jackiw method for solving constrained systems in 1966.

Born 23 March 1934, Leningrad (now St Petersburg), Russia. Died 26 February 2017, St Petersburg, Russia.
