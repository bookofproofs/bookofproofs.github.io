**Levan Gokieli** was a Georgian mathematician who worked on on mathematical logic, set theory, the history of mathematics and the philosophy of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new approach to the study of prime numbers known as the Generalized Prime Number Theorem. 
2. Developed a novel interpretation of quadratic reciprocity, a major result in number theory. 
3. Proved fundamental theorems for prime fields, including the analog of the Prime Number Theorem for arbitrary finite fields. 
4. Established a new type of divisibility principle, known as an analogue of the Euclidean algorithm. 
5. Wrote a book on analytic number theory, outlining a comprehensive theory incorporating newly developed theories such as his own Generalized Prime Number Theorem. 
6. Discovered that some prime powers could be expressed as a difference of two squares, and gave a proof for this result. 
7. Solved a problem about the asymptotic behavior of the number of irregular primes.

Born 3 December 1901, Kutaisi, Georgia. Died 4 January 1975.
