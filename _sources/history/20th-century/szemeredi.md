**Endre Szemerédi** is a Hungarian-born American mathematician and computer scientist, working in the field of combinatorics and theoretical computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He received the Abel Prize in Mathematics in 2012 for his contribution to combinatorial theory, which solved a central problem of mathematics that had stood for over 35 years.
2. Published several influential papers on graph theory, Fibonacci numbers, extremal graph theory, and Ramanujan graphs.
3. Was a co-recipient of the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1997.
4. Developed the Szemerédi Regularity Lemma, which is a powerful tool in graph theory and combinatorics.
5. Proved Poisson Summation Formula, which is a central example of the theory of Fourier analysis.
6. Discovered the Szemerédi–Trotter Theory, which led to the proof of the most general case of the Szemerédi's Theorem.
7. Founded the field of algorithmic graph theory.
8. Published extensive research in the topics of number theory, combinatorics, and graph theory.

Born 21 August 1940, Budapest, Hungary.
