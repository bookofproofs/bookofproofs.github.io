**Hans-Joachim Bremermann** was a German-born American mathematician and biophysicist who worked on computer science and the mathematical theory of evolution.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated a unified theory of random matrices which was adopted as the new foundation of quantum mechanics. 
2. First to calculate a nonperturbative expression for the equations of quantum electrodynamics. 
3. Developed a technique to solve a variety of scalar fields. 
4. Synthesized the rigorous formulation of quantum field theory. 
5. Created an algorithm to solve the problem of graph isomorphism. 
6. Developed a new method for numerical analysis of scattering data. 
7. Established a fundamental basis for using computers to calculate complicated mathematical concepts. 
8. Published a series of influential paper proposing the introduction of hyperfunctions. 
9. Constructed an innovative solution to the differential equations of mathematical physics. 
10. Introduced the integral equation method for mathematical physics and applied it to problems such as particle motion in an electric field.

Born 14 September 1926, Bremen, Germany. Died 21 February 1996, Berkeley, California, USA.
