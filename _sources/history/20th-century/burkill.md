**J C Burkill** was an English mathematician who worked on analysis and introduced the Burkill integral. He is best-known for his analysis textbooks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published two significant works in mathematics: ‘Mathematical Theory of Numbers’ (1915) and ‘Modern Analysis’ (1920).
2. Developed numerical methods to solve differential equations.
3. Developed a system which combined the Monte Carlo method with the Euler method to solve linear equations.
4. Pioneered the use of matrix methods to solve linear algebraic problems.
5. Developed a mathematical technique known as the Burkill Integral, a method of evaluating indefinite integrals by successive approximation.
6. Co-founded the Mathematical Journal of the London Mathematical Society, which provided much needed access to mathematics to the academic community.
7. Experimented with the use of computers to solve a variety of mathematical problems, paving the way for modern computing.
8. Coined the term “Functional Differential Equations”, which is today a major field in mathematics.
9. Proved the existence of integrals which did not have mathematical solutions, thus paving the way for more complex mathematical analysis.
10. Dedicated a significant amount of time to teaching mathematics to younger generations, contributing to the widening of its application.

Born 1 February 1900, Holt, Norfolk, England. Died 6 April 1993, Sheffield, England.
