**Leslie Woods** was a New Zealand mathematician who worked in fluid mechanics, particularly in the area of plasmas.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His name was not Woods at this stage, that was a name he chose later in life, but rather he was Leslie Woodhead.
* It was not until he was fourteen years old when he began attending Brixton Road Primary School that Leslie wore shoes for the first time.
* Leslie then began the engineering course at Auckland University College.
* Woods then did something that few others have ever done - after the award of his doctorate he studied for an Oxford B.A. which he was awarded in 1951.
* By this time Woods had joined the New Zealand Defence Corps and they sent him to the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington in 1951.
* In February 1954 Woods was appointed to a Senior Lectureship in Applied Mathematics at Sydney University.
* Woods was Chairman of the Mathematical Institute at Oxford University from 1984 to 1989.
* We should mention another important contribution by Woods.
* The book received a better review in "The Aeroplane" than in the physics literature, and it seems to have been ignored by the axiomatic applied mathematics community, with whom Woods had also become embattled; he did not like "rigor mortis".

Born 6 December 1922, Reporoa, New Zealand. Died 15 April 2007, Oxford, England.
