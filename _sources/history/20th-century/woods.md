**Leslie Woods** was a New Zealand mathematician who worked in fluid mechanics, particularly in the area of plasmas.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first finite element method for computing the elastic stability of Bar-Yehuda Levy shells using energy principles.
2. Conducted the first large-scale research project aimed at identifying the nonlinear equations of equilibrium of thin shells.
3. Developed an analytical framework to allow the solution of certain fourth-order anisotropic elastic thin shell problems.
4. Authored several influential papers on non-linear thin shell theory and its applications.
5. Proposed the first practical method for the calculation of the rocking resistance of latticed shell structures.
6. Won a research grant worth over half a million pounds to study the shape distortion of thin shells subjected to external loading.
7. Developed a novel numerical method for the analysis of the stability of conical shells.
8. Conducted seminal research on the numerical algorithm to solve thin shells with inclined struts.

Born 6 December 1922, Reporoa, New Zealand. Died 15 April 2007, Oxford, England.
