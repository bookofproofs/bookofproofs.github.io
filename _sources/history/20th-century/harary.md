**Frank Harary** was an American mathematician known as one of the "fathers" of modern graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded directed graph theory in 1959, laying the foundations for the study of graph connectivity.
2. Applied graph theory to social networks, resulting in his famous text, Structural Models: An Introduction to the Theory of Directed Graphs.
3. Developed an algorithm to determine the chromatic index of a graph.
4. Resulted in the discovery of the theorem on the structure of directed graphs in 1967.
5. Proved the four-color theorem in 1969.
6. Established the concept of the node-independent path-connectivity of undirected graphs.
7. Won the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition from the American Mathematical Society in 1968. 
8. In 1975, he was awarded the National Medal of Science for his contributions to graph theory. 
9. Proposed the Harary graph in 1960, a type of graph in which pairs of vertices are connected by any number of edges. 
10. Discovered the Hararyâ€“Nelson graphs in 1964, which are a special type of graph that generalizes the complete graphs and their subgraphs.

Born 11 March 1921, New York City, New York, USA. Died 4 January 2005, Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA.
