**Cora Sadosky** was born in Argentina and became Professor of Mathematics at Howard University in the United States. She wrote over fifty papers in harmonic analysis and operator theory. She promoted women in mathematics as well encouraging greater participation of African-Americans in mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We have listed her as Cora Susana Sadosky but, after her marriage to Daniel Goldstein her name became Cora Susana Sadosky de Goldstein.
* In fact, although she was known as Cora, the name on her birth certificate is "Corina".
* Before giving details of Cora Sadosky's education and career, we look briefly at her parents, who were both mathematicians, and also see some of the problems that were encountered by academics in Argentina.
* Although Manuel Sadosky was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, his parents, Natalio Sadosky and Maria Steingart, were Jewish Russian immigrants who had fled Russia because of continued violence against Jews.
* Corina Eloisa Ratto, the daughter of Lino Ratto and Francisca Butta, was sometimes known as Cora, but she used the name "Corina" more that her daughter.
* From a family of Italian immigrants to Argentina, she studied mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires then married Manuel Sadosky in 1937.
* Cora Sadosky, the subject of this biography, spent the first five years of her life in Argentina before the family went to France.
* Cora attended elementary school in Paris until January 1948 when the family moved to Rome in Italy.
* Cora attended school for a year in Rome before the family returned to Argentina in 1949.
* In 1955, at the age of fifteen, Cora Sadosky entered the School of Science of the University of Buenos Aires with the intention of taking physics as her major subject.
* She had been taught at high school by Mario Bunge (born 1919), at that time a physicist who was a close friend of the Sadosky family who later became a famous philosopher.
* His excellent teaching had inspired Sadosky to study physics at university but she soon found that mathematics, especially algebra, was so fascinating that after one semester she changed to take mathematics as her major subject.
* Cora Sadosky was awarded the degree of Licenciatura en Matemáticas (equivalent to a Master's Degree) in 1960.
* Both Sadosky and her mother resigned their positions at the university in protest.
* Sadosky, like many other academics, went to Uruguay and she taught there for one semester.
* Her husband, however, had gone to Johns Hopkins University to take up a postdoctoral position and Sadosky joined him there.
* In 1968 Sadosky returned to Buenos Aires but with the military still ruling the country, she was unable to make progress in her career.
* On 12 November 1971 her daughter Cora Sol Goldstein was born.
* Sadosky's mother was keen that her daughter should keep in touch with her academic work and to help out she paid for childcare for Cora Sol to allow Sadosky to go to public libraries and study.
* In 1973 Mischa Cotlar returned to Buenos Aires and began a mathematical collaboration with Sadosky.
* He invited Sadosky to join him and they resumed their mathematical collaboration.
* in 1974, when Corita, her husband Daniel, young daughter Cora Sol and her parents came as political refugees to Venezuela, we all lived in the same building (San Bartolomé, in Caracas every building has a name instead of a number).
* We were in the 12th floor of one tower, Cora Ratto and Manuel on the first floor of the same tower, Corita, Daniel and Cora Sol in the 11th floor of the other tower, with magnificent views to El Avila the mountains that separates Caracas from the Caribbean Sea.
* After a gap in her publication record for the reasons we have explained, Sadosky began publishing again with three papers written jointly with Mischa Cotlar, namely A moment theory approach to the Riesz theorem on the conjugate function with general measures (1975) and Transformée de Hilbert, théorème de Bochner et le problème des moments Ⓣ(Hilbert Transform, Bochner's Theorem and the Problem of Moments) (1977).
* Sadosky spent the academic year 1978-79 as a member-in-residence at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
* Throughout her career, Sadosky played an important role in promoting the role of women in mathematics.
* Sadosky was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (elected 1997) and was twice elected to the Council of the American Mathematical Society (1987-88, 1995-98).
* After she retired from Howard University, Sadosky and her husband went to live in California to be close to their daughter Cora Sol, son-in-law Tom, and granddaughter Sasha.
* The Association for Women in Mathematics established the Sadosky Prize in Analysis in 2012.
* The award is named for Cora Sadosky, a former president of Association for Women in Mathematics and made possible by generous contributions from Cora's husband Daniel J Goldstein, daughter Cora Sol Goldstein, friends Judy and Paul S Green and Concepción Ballester.

Born 23 May 1940, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Died 3 December 2010, Long Beach, California, USA.
