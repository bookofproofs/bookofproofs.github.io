**Cora Sadosky** was born in Argentina and became Professor of Mathematics at Howard University in the United States. She wrote over fifty papers in harmonic analysis and operator theory. She promoted women in mathematics as well encouraging greater participation of African-Americans in mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We have listed her as Cora Susana Sadosky but, after her marriage to Daniel Goldstein her name became Cora Susana Sadosky de Goldstein.
* In fact, although she was known as Cora, the name on her birth certificate is "Corina".
* Before giving details of Cora Sadosky's education and career, we look briefly at her parents, who were both mathematicians, and also see some of the problems that were encountered by academics in Argentina.
* Although Manuel Sadosky was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, his parents, Natalio Sadosky and Maria Steingart, were Jewish Russian immigrants who had fled Russia because of continued violence against Jews.
* In 1955, at the age of fifteen, Cora Sadosky entered the School of Science of the University of Buenos Aires with the intention of taking physics as her major subject.
* His excellent teaching had inspired Sadosky to study physics at university but she soon found that mathematics, especially algebra, was so fascinating that after one semester she changed to take mathematics as her major subject.
* Cora Sadosky was awarded the degree of Licenciatura en Matemáticas (equivalent to a Master's Degree) in 1960.
* Sadosky, like many other academics, went to Uruguay and she taught there for one semester.
* In 1968 Sadosky returned to Buenos Aires but with the military still ruling the country, she was unable to make progress in her career.
* In 1973 Mischa Cotlar returned to Buenos Aires and began a mathematical collaboration with Sadosky.
* He invited Sadosky to join him and they resumed their mathematical collaboration.
* We were in the 12th floor of one tower, Cora Ratto and Manuel on the first floor of the same tower, Corita, Daniel and Cora Sol in the 11th floor of the other tower, with magnificent views to El Avila the mountains that separates Caracas from the Caribbean Sea.
* After a gap in her publication record for the reasons we have explained, Sadosky began publishing again with three papers written jointly with Mischa Cotlar, namely A moment theory approach to the Riesz theorem on the conjugate function with general measures (1975) and Transformée de Hilbert, théorème de Bochner et le problème des moments Ⓣ(Hilbert Transform, Bochner's Theorem and the Problem of Moments) (1977).
* Sadosky spent the academic year 1978-79 as a member-in-residence at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
* Throughout her career, Sadosky played an important role in promoting the role of women in mathematics.
* Sadosky was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (elected 1997) and was twice elected to the Council of the American Mathematical Society (1987-88, 1995-98).
* The Association for Women in Mathematics established the Sadosky Prize in Analysis in 2012.

Born 23 May 1940, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Died 3 December 2010, Long Beach, California, USA.
