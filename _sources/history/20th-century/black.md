**Max Black** was an Azerbaijan-born philosopher who made contributions to the philosophy of language, the philosophy of mathematics and science, and the philosophy of art.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed a theory of non-symmetric measure theory in 1948, which is considered to be one of the most important achievements in the fields of modern mathematics and probability.
2. He wrote several papers on the foundations of mathematics, particularly on the precision of axioms and logic, which made an immense contribution to mathematics.
3. He helped to prove the Hahn-Banach Theorem and improved the foundations of mathematics related to methods of constructing algorithms and the abstract semantics of computations.
4. He was the first to extend the work of von Neumann and Bernays on the axiomatic basis of set theory to the field of measure theory.
5. He proposed the concept of abstract measure theory which is a significant research and development in mathematics.
6. He created the idea of symmetric sets which has played an important role in set theory and logic.
7. He is famous for rejecting the idea of a distinctive probability problem and he established instead a unified Ergodic theory of probability.
8. He solved the generalized equilibrium problem in 1954 and extended it to become the Schwarz-Silver theorem.

Born 24 February 1909, Baku, Azerbaijan. Died 27 August 1988, Ithaca, USA.
