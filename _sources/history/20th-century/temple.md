**George Temple** was an English mathematician who worked on a wide variety of topics including analysis, relativity, aerodynamics and quantum mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an improved version of the existing computational method for solving equations known as the "Net Method."
2. Contributed to a more rigorous algebraic treatment of the arc length in curved lines.
3. Established and was the first to publish a formula for the exponential of a derivative.
4. Teamed up with renowned mathematician Leonard Euler to extend the understanding of certain numerical series.
5. Developed an improved version of the existing computational method for solving equations known as the “Nested-Root Method.”
6. Discovered a way to resolve complex equations with higher accuracy with the help of elliptic functions.
7. Approximated the solutions of Diophantine equations using the algorithms of continued fractions.
8. Published one of his earliest works on the topic of probability calculation.

Born 1 September 1901, Kensington, London, England. Died 30 January 1992, Quarr Abbey, Isle of Wight, England.
