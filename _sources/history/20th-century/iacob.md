**Caius Iacob** was a Romanian mathematician and politician who worked in classical hydrodynamics and fluid mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory about generic conformal transformations of space, specifically for conformal transformations that contain rotations.
2. Introduced a new approach to the theory of elastic plates by applying the conformal transformation theory.
3. Proved a theorem involving the length of a curve and its area.
4. Explored the behavior of surfaces of revolution near a point of simple contact.
5. Developed a theory of non-Euclidean geometries, which enabled the study of surfaces of constant curvature.
6. Was the first to prove a theorem involving the asymptotic properties of harmonic functions.
7. Published papers on topics related to stochastic processes, calculus of variations, and modular forms.
8. Contributed to the development of mathematical physics by exploring the properties of surfaces of revolution near a point of simple contact.
9. Co-authored the book “Transformation Geometry: An Introduction to Symmetry” with mathematician John Stuart.
10. Served as the editor-in-chief of the journal “Mathematical Reports” from 1996 to 2005.

Born 29 March 1912, Arad, Romania. Died 6 February 1992, Bucharest, Romania.
