**John Williamson** graduated from Edinburgh University and then had an appointment at St Andrews. He spent some time in Chicago and eventually moved to the USA to a post at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. His most important work was in Algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After having passed the Preliminary Examination, Williamson first matriculated at the University of Edinburgh in October 1919.
* As an undergraduate at Edinburgh, Williamson studied Ordinary Mathematics, Natural Philosophy and Greek in session 1919-20.
* Williamson was probably the first to lecture in Scotland (1927) upon algebras and their arithmetics: his interest in this led to original contributions in the region of division algebras.
* Williamson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 5 March 1928 having been proposed by Herbert Westren Turnbull, Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker, Ralph Allan Sampson, and Charles Glover Barkla.
* Williamson left St Andrews when he accepted a Associate Professorship in Mathematics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, USA.
* On 1 February 1924, when he was a Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of St Andrews, Williamson joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.
* Williamson read the paper The irreducible covariants belonging to the concomitant system of three quadrics  to the meeting of the Society in St Andrews on Saturday 14 June 1924.
* At the meeting on Friday 16 January 1925 a joint paper by Williamson and Turnbull On the general invariant theory of two quadratics in n variables  was read.

Born 23 May 1901, Kinross, Scotland. Died 1949, Baltimore, USA.
