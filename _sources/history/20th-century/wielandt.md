**Helmut Wielandt** worked on finite groups and on finite and infinite permutation groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received the Heinz Hopf Prize in 1967 for his contributions to functional analysis. 
2. Established the closed range principle for continuous operators. 
3. Contributed to the theory of operator ideals.
4. Established ‘Schauder’s alternative’ in Functional Analysis. 
5. Made significant contributions to the theory of linear operators on infinite-dimensional spaces.
6. Developed spectral theory for normal operators. 
7. Introduced L1-Space as a linear space between Lp-spaces and developed its basic properties. 
8. Wrote numerous monographs on infinite-dimensional linear algebra. 
9. His research provided a bridge between the functional analytic methods of the 1930s and theory of non-commutative algebras of the 1970s.

Born 19 December 1910, Niedereggenen, Lörrach, Germany. Died 14 February 2001, Schliersee, Bavaria, Germany.
