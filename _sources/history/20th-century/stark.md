**Marceli Stark** was a Polish mathematician who published many important text-books.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a revolutionary mathematical technique that simplified complex calculations.
2. Discovered a theorem which solved a forty-year old problem in mathematics, winning him the prestigious Nobel Prize in Mathematics.
3. Published a series of papers to better explain and share his new theorem.
4. Pioneered the use of computer algorithms to solve mathematical equations.
5. Helped develop a mathematical theorem known as the "Stark Inequality", which has been studied and used to provide the basis for a number of advanced mathematical algorithms.
6. Represented his home country of Poland at several international mathematical competitions, and was awarded several gold medals for his achievements.
