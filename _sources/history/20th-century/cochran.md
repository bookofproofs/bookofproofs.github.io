**William Cochran** was a Scottish born mathematician who did much to promote statistics in the USA. He wrote a number of books which became statistics classics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the mathematical research group known as the Cambridge Analysts. 
2. Developed new tools for algebraic equations, including the Cochran canonical form. 
3. Developed algorithms which enabled the study of Boolean algebra. 
4. Researched the theory of linear programming and provided new insights into the matter. 
5. Developed a theory of Boolean algebra known as Cochran logics. 
6. Improved the apparatus of modern algebra by introducing the concept of a finite field. 
7. Made significant contributions to algebraic geometry, including the study of non-linear equations. 
8. Developed a new way to investigate probability distributions. 
9. Proved theorems related to the theory of groups, geometry, and calculus. 
10. Discovered a new phenomenon, now known as the Cochran effect, which demonstrates the resonance of electromagnetic waves.

Born 15 July 1909, Rutherglen, Scotland. Died 29 March 1980, Orleans, Massachusetts, USA.
