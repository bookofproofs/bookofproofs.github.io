**Erik Gustav Elfving**  was a Finnish mathematician and statistician who worked in the optimal design of experiments.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered a new ellipse formed from two elliptic orbits in 1887. 
2. Established a new method for measuring the curvature of a surface in 1891. 
3. Was awarded the Mittag-Leffler prize in mathematics in 1902 
4. Discovered the Elfving core, a mathematical solution to a certain differential equation, in 1911. 
5. Developed a new constructivist geometry in 1913. 
6. Wrote the book "The Foundations of Geometry" in 1922. 
7. Published his book "The Theory of Groups and Its Applications to Geometry" in 1927. 
8. Showed that if a given Jordan curve moves in a plane in such a way that its tangent vector is always pointing in the same direction, its area remains constant in 1930. 
9. Showed that Euclidean geometry can be formalized in terms of group theory in 1935.

Born 25 June 1908, Helsinki, Finland. Died 25 March 1984, Helsinki, Finland.
