**Rózsa Péter** was a Hungarian mathematician and logician. She became a founder of recursive function theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved the Problem of Best Approximation for matrices of higher order in 1935, showing that a best approximation of a matrix can be decomposed in a particular way.
2. Developed the "Péter-Kovács-Tunel theorem" which defined the size of the approximation error of linear systems in the framework of numerical calculations an important tool in linear algebra. 
3. Worked on the theory of Banach algebras, producing seven papers dealing with various aspects of the theory.
4. Discovered the Banach Indeterminacy Principle, which states that the set of solutions to a system of equations, provided it exists Maybe spread out all over the relevant space.
5. Established the Banach-Mazur compactness theorem, which states that certain kinds of algebraic structures have extreme behavior when compared to other kinds of structures, in terms of their topological structure. 
6. Published the paper "Galois Theory for Linear Algebraic Groups", which provided details on how the theory works for linear combinations of linear operators.
7. Proved the famous Riesz-Kolmogorov theorem, which states that a continuous linear functional on a normed space is of the form cauchy-type.

Born 17 February 1905, Budapest, Hungary. Died 16 February 1977, Budapest, Hungary.
