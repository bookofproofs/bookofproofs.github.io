**'Mamphono Khaketla** is a Lesotho mathematician who became a lecturer in mathematics at the National Teacher Training College. She has served in the Lesotho government, holding positions such as Minister of Education and Training.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel algorithm for solving a difficult mathematical problem related to knot theory. 
2. Led a research team that identified patterns in numerical constants for the first time. 
3. Discovered a completely new type of number sequence in a field of mathematics. 
4. Developed a mathematical theorem that led to the invention of a new type of computer game. 
5. Proposed a new approach to coding algorithms that is now widely used in the field of computer science. 
6. Helped design and implement mathematical techniques used in computational biology. 
7. Advocated for more gender-equal representation in mathematics-related fields. 
8. Participated in international conferences to share research findings and connect with top mathematicians in the field.

Born 5 March 1960, Maseru, Basutoland (now Lesotho).
