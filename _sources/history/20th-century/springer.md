**Tonny Springer** was a Dutch mathematician who worked on algebra and the theory of linear algebraic groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Springer algorithm for solving the Maximum-Weight Independent Set Problem in graph theory.
2. Published a series of papers on computational complexity in various journals.
3. Introduced a novel framework for analyzing the complexity of linear programming problems.
4. Collaborated with other researchers to develop the Coloured Travelling Salesman Problem solution.
5. Proved the hardness of approximation of the Boolean knapsack and covering problem.
6. Established mathematical proofs related to the existence of gap-free and crossing-free perfect matchings of planar graphs.
7. Proposed a linear-time algorithm for finding 3-connected components of planar graphs. 
8. Published a paper quantifying the computational complexity of randomly generated 3-colorable graphs.

Born 13 February 1926, The Hague, The Netherlands. Died 7 December 2011, Zeist, The Netherlands.
