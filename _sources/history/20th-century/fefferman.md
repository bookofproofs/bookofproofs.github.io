**Charles Fefferman** is an American mathematician who won a Fields Medal for work on partial differential equations and Fourier analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Arthur Fefferman was born in Brooklyn, New York, and was awarded a Master's Degree in economics from Columbia University in 1941.
* Arthur Fefferman studied for a doctorate in economics which he was awarded in 1950 from the New School for Social Research (now New School University).
* Arthur Fefferman had enjoyed and excelled in mathematics at high school but had been told that it was not necessary for an economist and had not taken even a calculus course at university.
* He got a phone call from the Feffermans.
* So Mrs Fefferman drove Charlie from Silver Spring to College Park in their trusty Dodge.
* Charles was soon making a remarkable impression at the University of Maryland.
* After two weeks in John Horvath's calculus class it was clear that the material was far too elementary for Fefferman and he was put into John Brace's honours calculus course.
* At the University of Maryland, Fefferman took lots of mathematics and physics courses.
* Fefferman realised that he was receiving very special treatment with so many of the professors giving him personal tuition.
* After graduating from the University of Maryland, Fefferman undertook postgraduate work at Princeton University supervised by Elias Stein.
* While a graduate student at Princeton, Fefferman did have interests outside mathematics.
* It is worth pointing out that Fefferman also supported George McGovern's campaign as the Democratic candidate for the 1972 presidential election.
* Fefferman lectured at Princeton for the years 1969-70.
* In 1973 Fefferman returned to Princeton and, in October 1974, he was introduced to Julie Anne Albert.
* Fefferman contributed several innovations that revised the study of multidimensional complex analysis by finding correct generalisations of classical low-dimensional results.
* Fefferman was awarded the Bergman Prize in 1992.
* In addition to the awards mentioned above, Fefferman had received many honours.
* In 2009 Fefferman was made an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society.
* Fefferman continues to work at Princeton and from 1999 to 2002 he was Chair of the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University.

Born 18 April 1949, Washington, D.C., USA.
