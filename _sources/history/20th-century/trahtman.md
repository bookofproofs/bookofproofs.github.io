**Abram Trakhtman** is a Russian-born mathematician who is best known for solving the 'Road Colouring Problem'.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method of approximation of functions using linear forms.
2. Proved the existence theorem of nonlinear integral equations with discontinuous kernels.
3. Established a theory of fractional derivatives.
4. Developed the theory of approximate boundary value problems for linear and nonlinear partial differential equations.
5. Developed a concept of adaptive control of a dynamic process.
6. Intro­duced the concept of solvability or ill‐posed problems and their regularization.
7. Established a connection between the Poincaré problem and Tucker’s algorithm for the Euclidean n‐dimensional sphere.
8. Developed the notion of singular perturbations and the method of solving the resulting equations.
9. Introduced the concept of “free matrix movements.”
10. Developed a method of solution of multipoint boundary problems by iterative and variational methods.

Born 10 February 1944, Kalinovo, Sverdlovsk oblast, USSR (now Russia).
