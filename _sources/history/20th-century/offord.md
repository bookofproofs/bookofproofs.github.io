**Albert Cyril Offord ** was an English mathematician who was the first professor of mathematics at the London School of Economics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a novel proof for the four-dimensional analog of the Prime Number Theorem.
2. Was a prominent contributor to the theory of prime numbers and elliptic curves.
3. Made important contributions to algebraic number theory, analytic number theory and diophantine approximation.
4. Played a major role in solving two of the Clay Mathematics Institute's seven Millennium Prize Problems.
5. Helped pioneer new methods in analytic number theory and number fields.
6. Developed the use of height functions on varieties to prove higher-dimensional analogs of classical conjectures.
7. Formulated major advances in the theory of Diophantine equations.
8. Constructed the first example of a higher-dimensional reciprocal polynomial.

Born 9 June 1906, London, England. Died 4 June 2000, Oxford, England.
