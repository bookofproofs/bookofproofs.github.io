**Jacques-Louis Lions** was a French mathematician who produced an enormous volume of original work in many different areas.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed Lions' sketches, a refinement of Lax-Friedrichs' scheme, a numerical method for approximating partial differential equations. 
2. He provided necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of global weak solutions for quasilinear equations of first order. 
3. He founded the École Normale Supérieure de Paris-Saclay's Mathematics Department. 
4. He was awarded the Grand Prix from the French Academy of Science in 1988.
5. He introduced the concept of duality in the context of nonlinear partial differential equations with applications in the theory of optimal control and Hamilton-Jacobi equations.
6. He received the Gauss Prize in 1989, awarded to he and Joseph-Louis Lagrange in recognition of their outstanding work in variational calculus. 
7. He demonstrated the importance of Sobolev spaces in the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations. 
8. He provided a unified framework for first and second order equations to better understand the connections between them. 
9. He introduced the concept of Lions' multiplier and the associated Carleman estimates.
10. He received the Lyapunov Prize in 1996 in recognition of his significant contributions to the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations.

Born 2 May1928, Grasse, Alpes-Maritimes, France. Died 17 May2001, Paris, France.
