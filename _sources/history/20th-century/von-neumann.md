**John Von Neumann** built a solid framework for quantum mechanics. He also worked in game theory, studied what are now called _von Neumann Algebras_, and was one of the pioneers of computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the foundations of the modern theory of ordinal and cardinal numbers, and introduced the concept of cardinality.
2. Proved the existence of multiple solutions to certain types of equations, a major breakthrough in mathematical logic.
3. Established the concept of the 'Hilbert space' and the spectral theory of operators in operator theory.
4. Outlined new approaches to probability theory and topology, and analysed nonlinear systems in detail.
5. Described cellular automata and explained how machines can learn by trial and error.
6. Proposed the 'Von Neumann Architecture' for computing machines, the basis of most modern computers today.
7. With Alan Turing, developed the first complete formalization of the notion of computability - the Turing-von Neumann machine.
8. Carried out substantial research in numerical analysis, the analytic theory of functions, theory of hydrodynamic turbulence, theory of rings, and the development of differential geometry.

Born 28 December 1903, Budapest, Hungary. Died 8 February 1957, Washington D.C., USA.
