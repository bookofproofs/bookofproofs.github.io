**Richard Feynman** was a Nobel prize winner famous for his unusual life style and for his popular books and lectures on mathematics and physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It meant that a sadness fell over the household which must have greatly affected the young Richard.
* Richard, or Ritty as his friends called him, learnt a great deal of science from Encyclopaedia Britannica and taught himself elementary mathematics before he encountered it at school.
* At school Feynman approached mathematics in a highly unconventional way.
* His mathematics lecturers presented him with the view that one did mathematics for its own sake so Feynman changed courses, taking electrical engineering.
* It is interesting to think that had Feynman taken the mathematics course at Cambridge which Hoyle took around the same time, he would have found it exactly what he wanted.
* The physics course that Feynman took at MIT was not the standard one.
* There was no course on quantum mechanics, a topic that Feynman was very keen to study, so together with a fellow undergraduate, T A Welton, he began to read the available texts in the spring of 1936.
* By 1937 Feynman was reading Dirac's The principles of quantum mechanics and seeing how his highly original ideas fitted into Dirac's approach.
* Dirac became the scientist who Feynman most respected throughout his life.
* We mentioned above that Feynman went home for his vacations.
* Despite the personal recommendation that Harry Smyth at Princeton received from Slater, it was not obvious that Feynman would be accepted.
* After further letters from Slater, Feynman was accepted by Princeton.
* In retrospect, Feynman thought that Pauli must have seen difficulties at once, for after Feynman had spent a long time working on it, he too thought that it was not satisfactory.
* that the mathematical machinery emerging from the Wheeler-Feynman collaboration was beyond Wheeler's own ability).
* Feynman seemed to possess a frightening ease with the substance behind the equations, like Einstein at the same age, like the Soviet physicist Lev Landau - but few others.
* Feynman worked on the atomic bomb project at Princeton University (1941-42) and then at Los Alamos (1943-45).
* Feynman began work on the Manhattan project at Princeton developing a theory of how to separate Uranium 235 from Uranium 238, while his thesis supervisor Wheeler went to Chicago to work with Fermi on the first nuclear reactor.
* Wigner, in Wheeler's absence, advised Feynman to write up his thesis and after Wheeler and Wigner examined the work he received his doctorate in June 1942.
* Feynman had a difficult personal problem at this time.
* Shortly after his marriage Feynman went to the newly constructed Los Alamos site to work on the atomic bomb project.
* In 1950 Feynman accepted a position as professor of theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.
* He remained at Cal tech for the rest of his career, being appointed Richard Chace Tolman Professor of Theoretical Physics there in 1959.
* Feynman's main contribution was to quantum mechanics, following on from the work of his doctoral thesis.
* He introduced diagrams (now called Feynman diagrams) that are graphic analogues of the mathematical expressions needed to describe the behaviour of systems of interacting particles.
* Feynman's books include many outstanding ones which evolved out of lecture courses.
* For example Quantum Electrodynamics (1961) and The Theory of Fundamental Processes (1961), The Feynman Lectures on Physics (1963-65) (3 volumes), The Character of Physical Law (1965) and QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter (1985).
* For Feynman the essence of scientific imagination was a powerful and almost painful rule.
* Feynman received many honours for his work.

Born 11 May 1918, New York City, USA. Died 15 February 1988, Los Angeles, California, USA.
