**Richard Feynman** was a Nobel prize winner famous for his unusual life style and for his popular books and lectures on mathematics and physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics.
2. Demonstrated that in some cases, the irregularities of surface tension could explain why some observations in nature donâ€™t appear to follow classical laws.
3. Co-authored a paper on the theory of quantum electrodynamics, which is sometimes referred to as the "most successful theory of nature".
4. Developed the method of Fundamental Linkage, a technique used to solve problems in topology.
5. Developed the Feynman Diagrams, a visual tool to help understand the behavior of particles in quantum systems.
6. Proposed the Feynman Integral, which provides a mathematical description of how particles move in space and time. 
7. Developed a theory of weak interactions, which describes the behavior of particles that interact through the weak nuclear force.
8. Received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for his work on quantum electrodynamics.

Born 11 May1918, New York City, USA. Died 15 February 1988, Los Angeles, California, USA.
