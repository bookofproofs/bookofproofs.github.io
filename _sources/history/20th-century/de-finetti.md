**Bruno de Finetti** was an Italian probabilist, statistician and actuary, noted for his approach to probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of Invariance Principle, the basis for predicting probabilities in a unique model. 
2. Described and popularized the concept of subjective probability, which changed the way probabilities were seen in decision-making.
3. Created the concept of exchangeable events in probability theory.
4. Developed an example of exchangeable sequence of Bernoulli trials as a contribution to Bayesian statistics.
5. Pioneered the axiomatic approach to probability, a framework that remains today as a basis to analyze real-life situations.
6. Founded the modern Bayesian statistics movement through his work on the theory of Bayesian inference.
7. Helped develop techniques to measure uncertainty, including the expected utility function and Savage's theorem. 
8. Introduced the concept of “coherent risk measures” in economics.

Born 13 June 1906, Innsbruck, Austria. Died 20 July 1985, Rome, Italy.
