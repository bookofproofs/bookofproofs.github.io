**Samuel Eilenberg** was a Polish-born American mathematician who worked on algebraic topology and homological algebra. He was one of the founders of category theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Exhibited deep understanding of category theory, and developed the concept of adjoint functors.
2. Initiated the field of homological algebra, by providing a design that defines the foundations of this subject.
3. Established the axiomatic definition of homology, which is fundamental in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.
4. Developed the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms, which are the base of algebraic topology.
5. Jointly developed the Eilenberg–MacLane spaces with Saunders MacLane, which are used in homotopy theory. 
6. Defined the concept of Topological Spaces and provided its description in terms of homology theory.
7. Contributed to the existing knowledge of algebraic K-theory with his research into permutation modules. 
8. Pioneered the concept of Equivariant Cohomology and the Cartan-Leray Spectral Sequence.

Born 30 September 1913, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 30 January 1998, New York, USA.
