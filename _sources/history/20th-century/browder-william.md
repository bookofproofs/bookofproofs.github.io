**William Browder** is an American mathematician, specialising in algebraic topology, differential topology and differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* William was the youngest of his parents' three children; the two older are Felix Browder (who has a biography in this archive) and Andrew Browder.
* All three boys have become leading mathematicians and so we should begin by giving some details of their parents Earl and Raissa Browder.
* Earl Browder (1891-1973), the eighth of ten children, was educated at home in Wichita by his unemployed schoolteacher father William Browder and from him received his first Socialist teachings.
* Earl Browder had married in 1911 but was separated from his wife.
* Earl Browder returned to the United States in 1929 but Raissa remained in Moscow until 1933.
* For the next sixteen years the Browders waged a legal battle to prevent her deportation.
* In 1934 their third son, William Browder (the subject of this biography), was born in New York City.
* This convinced Browder that his talents were in mathematics rather than physics so, after graduating with a B.S. from MIT in 1954, he began graduate studies in mathematics at Princeton University.
* Browder was appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics at the University of Rochester in 1957.
* Browder received a Ph.D. from Princeton in 1958 for his thesis Homology of Loop Spaces.
* Frank Adams calls this last mentioned paper "a remarkable study in the homology of H-spaces." Browder was promoted from Assistant Professor to Associate Professor at Cornell University in 1961.
* Browder was one of the inventors of surgery theory, which unifies methods and techniques from several branches of topology and applies them to the classification of high-dimensional manifolds.
* Browder published the book Surgery on simply-connected manifolds in 1972.
* Browder has given remarkable service to the American Mathematical Society over many years.
* Beginning with the historical roots of these questions, Browder concentrated on familiar examples such as the sphere, the nnn-sphere, or a product of spheres of different dimensions.
* In addition to his work for the American Mathematical Society, Browder has contributed to the mathematical scene in many other ways.
* Browder has received (and continues to receive) honours for his outstanding contributions.
* The American Mathematical Society held a Special Session on Homotopy Theory at their Spring Meeting in Lawrenceville in April 2004 in honour of Browder's 70th  birthday.
* Let us end this biography by quoting Browder's Statement when standing for the Nominating Committee of the American Mathematical Society in 1998.

Born 6 January 1934, New York City, New York, USA.
