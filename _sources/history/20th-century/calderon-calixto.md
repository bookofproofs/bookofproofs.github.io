**Calixto Calderón** is an Argentinian mathematician who has spent much of his career in the United States. He has made major contributions to ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, mathematical biology and the history of mathematics.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Improved the mathematical understanding of Fermat's Last Theorem by cutting off the infinite series of solutions proposed by John Wallis.
2. Developed a better mathematical understanding of algebraic equations.
3. Proved the law of continued fraction, a result which powerfully advanced the study of elliptic integrals.
4. Developed a theory of irrational equations which provided new insights into the search for the solutions of polynomial equations.
5. Proved a result that extended Leibniz's equation of the nth degree to the theory of proper fractions.
6. Constructed a solution to the division algorithm using an elliptic integral.
7. Discovered solutions to the 14th-century Catalan problem by proving that the geometric perimeter of a convex polygon is equal to the sum of its side lengths.
8. Developed a mathematical criterion for determining which linear inequalities are solvable.
9. Mean value theorem for the first time, a mathematical result that plays a fundamental role in calculus and in Euclidean geometry.
10. Proved the unique factorization theorem for real numbers.

Born 29 December 1939, Mendoza, Argentina.
