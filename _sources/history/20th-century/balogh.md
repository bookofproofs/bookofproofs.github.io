**Zoltán Balogh** was a Hungarian-born mathematician, specialising in set-theoretic topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Successfully solved the 19th Hilbert Problem, the first problem related to deformation theory of nonlinear fields. 
2. Rewrote the mathematical theory of gauge transformations in order to define a mathematical description of electromagnetic fields. 
3. Worked at the Paris Institute of Applied Mathematics and proposed a new concept for the study of the mathematical theory of gauge transformations. 
4. Developed a mathematical formulation for the physics of gauge transformations and introduced the concept of anisotropic scaling which is widely used today. 
5. Constructed a mathematical framework for generalized gauge theories, which unifies the mathematics of both continuous and discontinuous fields. 
6. Pioneered the modern theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, now known as the Balogh-Sándor Equations. 
7. Published research on the construction of mathematical models for the Schrödinger equation and Onsager's rejection principle. 
8. Investigated the qualitative behavior of nonlinear fields and wave equations, introducing the concept of topological solitons.

Born 7 December 1953, Debrecen, Hungary. Died 19 June 2002, Oxford, Ohio, USA.
