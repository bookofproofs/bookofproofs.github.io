**Zoltán Balogh** was a Hungarian-born mathematician, specialising in set-theoretic topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Zoltán had a younger sister Agnes who trained as a medical doctor and practised in Debrecen.
* Balogh was educated in Debrecen where he attended the Fazekas Mihaly Gymnasium.
* Balogh entered these competitions and won awards.
* Balogh entered the 1972 Kürschák Competition and produced an outstanding performance.
* In 1972 Balogh graduated from the Fazekas Mihaly Gymnasium and entered the Kossuth Lajos University of Debrecen to begin the five year course which would reach the level of a Master's Degree.
* Balogh was aware that this disease was due to his father's genetic makeup and so he was likely to inherit similar health problems.
* While still an undergraduate, Balogh began to undertake research.
* It became his first publication and is remarkable for introducing the concept of "relative compactness." This outstanding paper led to Balogh being awarded the Renyi Kato Memorial Prize by the Janos Bolyai Mathematical Society in 1977.
* With such an outstanding start to his research career, it was natural for Balogh to continue to undertake research at the Kossuth Lajos University of Debrecen.
* As a result of these publications, the Janos Bolyai Mathematical Society presented Balogh with their Grunwald Geza Memorial Prize, which they award annually to an outstanding researcher under the age of 30.
* In 1980 Balogh was awarded a Candidate's Degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.) in Topology and Set-theory from he Kossuth Lajos University of Debrecen and a Ph.D. from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
* While Balogh was an undergraduate at the Kossuth Lajos University of Debrecen he got to know Eva Balicza who was a student in the same class.
* They were married in 1976 when Balogh was still studying for his first degree.
* Their two daughters, Agnes (born 1978) and Judit (born 1979), were born before Balogh completed studying for his Candidate's Degree.
* The marriage, however, did not last and Balogh and his wife were divorced in 1981.
* After the award of his Candidate's Degree in 1980, Balogh remained at the Kossuth Lajos University of Debrecen.
* Balogh, together with his wife Agnes, left Debrecen less than two months after their marriage and travelled to the United States where Balogh had been offered a Visiting Associate Professorship at Texas Tech University in Lubboch, Texas.
* In July 1986, Balogh and his wife returned to Hungary and he was again employed at the Kossuth Lajos University of Debrecen.
* Balogh worked on his habilitation thesis and he submitted Set-theoretic investigations on the classes of compact and locally compact spaces (Hungarian) to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1988.
* At Miami University Balogh was working on the exceedingly beautiful Oxford campus in Oxford, Ohio.
* Balogh had fallen in love with the university and so when he was offered a tenure track position there he decided that he would not return to Hungary as he had originally planned but he would accept the permanent position at Miami University.
* Soon after, in January 1991, Zoli and Agnes Balogh's second son Daniel was born.
* Balogh had always known that his health might let him down again and indeed it did in the summer of 1999.
* Balogh certainly did not ease up following this major stroke for he continued to undertake research with three papers appearing in print in 2001 and a further three in 2002.
* In fact six papers by Balogh appeared in print in 2003 and later, submitted for publication before his death.

Born 7 December 1953, Debrecen, Hungary. Died 19 June 2002, Oxford, Ohio, USA.
