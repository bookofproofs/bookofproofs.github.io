**Andy Guinand** was an Australian mathematician who worked in number theory (particularly prime numbers and the Riemann hypothesis), as well as generalizations of the Fourier transform.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1934 Guinand won a Rhodes Scholarship to attend the University of Oxford in England.
* This was the typical route for the top Australian academics at that time, and Guinand studied at Oxford for his doctorate under Titchmarsh's supervision.
* In session 1937/38 Guinand studied at GÃ¶ttingen, then in 1939/40 at Princeton in the United States.
* Guinand worked on summation formulae and prime numbers, the Riemann zeta function, general Fourier type transformations, geometry and some papers on a variety of topics such as computing, air navigation, calculus of variations, the binomial theorem, determinants and special functions.
* Guinand was convinced that these results could lead to more information about the Riemann zeta function, and he was disappointed that he was not able to advance further in this area and that others did not take up the possibility themselves.

Born 3 March 1912, Renmark, South Australia, Australia. Died 22 March 1987, Peterborough, Ontario, Canada.
