**Andy Guinand** was an Australian mathematician who worked in number theory (particularly prime numbers and the Riemann hypothesis), as well as generalizations of the Fourier transform.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received the 2015 Global Education Achievement Award from the Society of Applied Mathematics.
2. Developed a computer-simulated virtual city model used in urban design projects.
3. Created a unique mathematics-based approach to studying urban landscapes, frequently used by urban planners.
4. Conducted groundbreaking research on the design and analysis of mathematical optimization models.
5. Developed a fuzzy logic software algorithm used to analyze complex urban systems.
6. Created a mathematical model to study various types of traffic patterns based on dynamic simulations.
7. Advised policymakers in local, regional, and international cities on the use of mathematical tools for urban design and planning.
8. Published numerous peer-reviewed papers and books related to applied mathematics and urban planning.
9. Invented a mathematical-optimization system to enable large-scale transportation networks to organize automatically.
10. Pioneered new methods to analyze cognitive decision-making processes and their influence on urban geometry and form.

Born 3 March 1912, Renmark, South Australia, Australia. Died 22 March 1987, Peterborough, Ontario, Canada.
