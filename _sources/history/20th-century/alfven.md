**Hannes Olof Gösta Alfvén** was a Swedish electrical engineer, plasma physicist and winner of a Nobel Prize in Physics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which formed the basis of modern plasma physics.
2. Received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1970 for his fundamental work and discoveries in the field of plasma physics.
3. Proved regular and stochastic solutions to a variety of magnetohydrodynamic equations.
4. Developed the general theory of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and its application to astrophysics.
5. Established how energy is ejected from the sun in the form of the solar wind.
6. Discovered spiral galaxies and explained the spiral structure of astronomical objects.
7. Discovered Alfven waves, which are fundamental to the study of the Sun and other astrophysical objects.
8. Developed a mathematical model of turbulence.
9. Developed the mathematical theory of geomagnetic field generation.
10. Developed a mathematical theory of turbulent diffusion of cosmic rays.

Born 20 May1908, Norrköping, Sweden. Died 2 April 1995, Djursholm, Sweden.
