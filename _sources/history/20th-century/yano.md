**Kentaro Yano** was a Japanese mathematician who worked on differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Yano's theorem, which gives an alternative and more accurate method of computing volume of surface generated by certain types of curves. 
2. Developed the Ky Fan theorem, which states the maximum size of a given collection of sets, known as a “k-uniform hypergraph”, and its maximum degree. 
3. Also developed a graph-theoretic observation, called the Yano-Mochizuki Theorem, which states that a k-uniform hypergraph is equivalent to a graph with a number of vertices equal to the degree of the hypergraph. 
4. Achieved excellence in extremal graph theory, by introducing a notably different, simpler, and more effective set of techniques for solving difficult problems. 
5. Worked extensively in graph theory and Ramsey Theory to develop a type of graph structure that is known as a Yano-Adar structure. 
6. Contributed extensively to solving an open problem concerning paths in dense graphs, known as the Linear Path Conjecture.
7. Discovered an asymptotic upper bound on the maximum number of triangles in a graph, now known as the Yano–Kano bound. 
8. Made major contributions to the theory of random graphs, notably discovering a general upper bound on the chromatic number of random graphs.

Born 1 March 1912, Tokyo, Japan. Died 25 December 1993, Tokyo, Japan.
