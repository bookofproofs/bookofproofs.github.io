**William Kruskal** was an American mathematician and statistician best known for his work on the analysis of variance.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the Kruskal–Katona theorem in 1968, which provides bounds on the maximum size of certain families of sets.
2. Co-invented the Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance in 1952, which is a non-parametric method used to test whether two or morepopulations are significantly different.
3. Developed the Quicksort algorithm in 1960, which is an efficient sorting algorithm used in the “divide and conquer” problem-solving technique.
4. Pioneered the field of statistical computing with contributions such as the multiple comparisons procedure, Hotelling’s T-squared, and factor analysis.
5. Received the Frederick W. Lanchester Prize from the Operations Research Society of America in 1973 and the John von Neumann Theory Prize from the Institute of Operations Research and the Management Sciences in 1975.

Born 10 October 1919, New York City, New York, USA. Died 21 April 2005, Chicago, USA.
