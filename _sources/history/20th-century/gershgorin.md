**Semyon Gershgorin** was a Belarussian mathematician who produced important results in numerical approximation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The main features of Gershgorin's individuality are the innovative way he approached a problem, combined with power and clarity of analysis.
* In Gershgorin's 1926 paper 'On mechanisms for the construction of functions of a complex variable', he described linkage mechanisms implementing the complex arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
* Gershgorin proposed that linkage mechanisms be constructed for various standard functions, which could then be assembled into larger mechanisms for more complicated functions.
* In 1929 Gershgorin published On electrical nets for approximate solution of the differential equation of Laplace (Russian) in which he gave a method for finding approximate solutions to partial differential equations by constructing a model based on networks of electrical components.
* The beauty and simplicity of Gershgorin's Theorem has undoubtedly inspired further research in this area, resulting in hundreds of papers in which the name "Gershgorin" appears.
* Semyon Aranovich Gershgorin's death is a great and irreplaceable loss to Soviet Science.
* Gershgorin's final paper On the conformal map of a simply connected domain onto a circle (Russian) was published in 1933 after his death.
* Independently of Lichtenstein, Gershgorin utilised Nystrom's method and reduced that conformal transformation problem to the same Fredholm integral equation.
* Later, A M Banin solved the Lichtenstein-Gershgorin integral equation approximately, by reducing it to a finite system of linear differential equations.

Born 24 August 1901, Pruzhany, Russian Empire (now Belarus). Died 30 May 1933, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
