**Semyon Gershgorin** was a Belarussian mathematician who produced important results in numerical approximation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Gershgorin Circle Theorem as a tool to help identify the locations of the eigenvalues of a matrix.
2. Developed the Gershgorin Disk Theorem, an extension of the Circle Theorem, which provides an upper bound on the number of eigenvalues that can lie outside a union of disks.
3. Initiated the algebraic theory of pencils of matrices, which are combinations of matrices of different shapes and sizes.
4. Extended the Perron–Frobenius theorem for non-symmetric matrices, greatly expanding its applicability.
5. Contributed to the study of elimination theory for a system of linear equations. 
6. Developed the Gersgorin–Newton--Raphson method for solving systems of equations in linear algebra.
7. Investigated the stability of linear systems and introduced the concept of a Lyapunov function.
8. Investigated the conditions sufficient for uniqueness of the solution of a system of linear equations.

Born 24 August 1901, Pruzhany, Russian Empire (now Belarus). Died 30 May1933, Leningrad, USSR (now St Petersburg, Russia).
