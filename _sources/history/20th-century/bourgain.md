**Jean Bourgain** was a Belgian mathematician who worked on mathematical analysis and its application to partial differential equations, mathematical physics, combinatorics, number theory, ergodic theory and theoretical computer science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He won the Fields Medal in 1994, one of the most prestigious awards in mathematics, for his work on the theory of high-dimensional phenomena in linear spaces.
2. He solved two major open problems in fundamental mathematics: the Kakeya problem and the Szemeredi–Furstenberg problem.
3. He also developed the field of polynomial partitioning, which forms an important foundation of theoretical computer science.
4. He introduced powerful operator techniques relevant to nonlinear partial differential equations.
5. He developed a new method of approaching the discretization of differential equations.
6. His work on harmonic analysis combined the theories of Fourier analysis and wavelets.
7. He demonstrated the connections between the methods of harmonic analysis and chaos theory.
8. He famously proved the Ulam game conjecture.
9. He solved the cap set problem and the Erdős discrepancy problem.
10. He also introduced new methods for analyzing and bounding exponential sums.

Born 28 February 1954, Ostend, Belgium. Died 22 December 2018, Bonheiden, Belgium.
