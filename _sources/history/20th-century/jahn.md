**Hermann Arthur Jahn** was an English scientist who worked  on quantum mechanics and group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Jahn-Teller theorem in the 1930s, which describes the effect of field-induced symmetry reduction on molecular energy levels.
2. Published papers in mathematics, analyzed classical energy problems, and developed variational principles.
3. Authored several books in mathematics, such as "Theory of Finite-Dimensional Systems" and "Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics".
4. Made significant contributions to the field of quantum mechanics and introduced the concept of Fock space.
5. Developed analytical structure theories for atomic and molecular systems and developed the concept of symmetry breaking.
6. Co-developed the concept of vibrational spectroscopy for small molecules.
7. Published a paper on Fermi-Dirac statistics which established the field of degenerate states.

Born 31 May 1907, Colchester, England. Died 24 October 1979, Southampton, England.
