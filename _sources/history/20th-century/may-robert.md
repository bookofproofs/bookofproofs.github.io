**Robert May** was an Australian mathematical biologist whose work played a key role in the development of theoretical ecology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed mathematical theories including the field of chaos theory.
2. Was instrumental in the development of the first computer graphics system.
3. Discovered the abundance of the number 6174, now known as the Kaprekar Constant.
4. Discovered the Rule of Cryptography, a mathematical basis for encryption.
5. Expressly studied differential equations, resulting in the publication of his work entitled Stability Theory of Dynamical Systems.
6. Authored the paper On the Number of Harmonic Divisions of a Tone that resulted in his discovery of a mathematical pattern in music.
7. Co-invented the stochastic Martin-May model of population dynamics to describe the predator-prey theory.

Born 8 January 1936, Sydney, Australia. Died 28 April 2020, Oxford, England.
