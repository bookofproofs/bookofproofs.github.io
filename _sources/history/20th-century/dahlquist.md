**Germund Dahlquist** was a Swedish mathematician who worked in the theory of numerical analysis as applied to differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Dahlquist barrier, the first rigorous definition of the stability of numerical methods. 
2. Developed a theory of perturbation of linear equations, which is the foundation of modern numerical methods for solving differential equations.  
3. Authored influential texts on numerical analysis, such as The Numerical Treatment of Differential Equations and Numerical Methods. 
4. Championed the use of finite precision arithmetic to analyze computer arithmetic. 
5. Pioneered the concept of ‘time steps’ in numerical integration, later revisited in the form of adaptive step size adjustment. 
6. Contributed to the advancement of uncertainty analysis in numerical linear algebra. 
7. Developed the theories of backward error analysis, the mathematics of accuracy and round off errors, and the connection between interval arithmetic and variational methods.

Born 16 January 1925, Uppsala, Sweden. Died 8 February 2005, Stockholm, Sweden.
