**John Pople** was an English theoretical chemist who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998 for his development of computational methods in quantum chemistry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Keith Pople's grandfather James had come to Burnham-on-Sea in the 1850s and set up a number of businesses in the town which eventually were taken over by his children.
* Keith and Mary Pople were ambitious for their two sons, John and his younger brother Donald, and after their education in a primary school in Burnham-on-Sea would have wanted to send them to a good preparatory school in the town.
* However, the school's admission policy did not allow the children of shopkeepers to be educated there, and no other school was considered satisfactory by John's parents.
* Therefore, in the spring of 1936, when he was ten years old, John was sent to Bristol Grammar School.
* The first arrangement was for John to be a boarder at Bristol Grammar School during the week but return home by train each weekend.
* From about the age of twelve, Pople became fascinated by mathematics.
* When a new mathematics teacher came to Bristol Grammar School and started to stretch the pupils, Pople gave up his habit of making deliberate errors and showed his exceptional abilities.
* As a consequence Pople had to leave Cambridge in 1945 and take up employment.
* During 1947-48 Pople took courses on quantum mechanics, taught by Paul Dirac, fluid dynamics, cosmology and statistical mechanics, taught by Fred Hoyle.
* This did not work out so he next asked John Lennard-Jones who was giving a course on molecular orbital theory.
* In late 1947, Pople began to learn to play the piano.
* By the time of his marriage, Pople had won a Smith Prize, completed his doctoral thesis Lone Pair Electrons (1951) and become a fellow of Trinity (1951).
* Pople was appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics at Cambridge in 1954, a position he held until 1958.
* During the years 1954 to 1958, Pople was teaching mathematics at Cambridge but undertaking research in mathematical applications to chemistry.
* Pople made his computational technics easily accessible to researchers by designing the GAUSSIAN computer program.
* We should fill in the remaining details of Pople's career.
* At Carnegie Mellon University he was named John Christian Warner University Professor of Natural Sciences and continued to hold this chair 1993.
* Pople received many honours for his remarkable achievements in addition to the Nobel Prize mentioned above.

Born 31 October 1925, Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, England. Died 15 March 2004, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
