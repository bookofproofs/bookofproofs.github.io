**John Pople** was an English theoretical chemist who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998 for his development of computational methods in quantum chemistry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed new, powerful computational methods and algorithms for the study of molecules, often referred to as "ab initio quantum chemistry" and "density functional theory". 
2. Won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998 for his work on the computational modelling of chemical structures. 
3. His theoretical techniques and algorithms underpinned the development of the field of computational chemistry, which has allowed chemists to accurately predict the behavior and properties of molecules. 
4. Helped create computer programs to calculate properties of molecules and chemical reactions, making significant improvements on existing computational tools. 
5. Pioneered the development of modern computational chemistry and paved the way for the application of computers to solve chemical problems. 
6. Developed new methods in orbitals and energy levels to accurately predict the behavior of an atom and its electrons. 
7. Developed the idea of describing molecules using mathematical equations, rather than relying on experimental observations. 
8. Developed a mathematical-based approach to accurately calculate values of chemical processes. 
9. Was a leader in the development of electronic structure theory, which forms the basis of the field of theoretical chemistry. 
10. Developed fast, easy techniques for the analysis of chemical systems, majorly impacting how chemists go about their work.

Born 31 October 1925, Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, England. Died 15 March 2004, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
