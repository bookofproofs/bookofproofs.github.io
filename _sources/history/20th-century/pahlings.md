**Herbert Pahlings** was a German mathematician who worked in group theory and the representation theory of finite groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In his thesis Pahlings gave a number of interesting results on faithful irreducible projective representations of groups.
* Herbert Pahling's papers from his time at Giessen deal with a variety of (often concrete) problems from the representation theory of finite groups.
* The highlight of the paper were some worked-out examples provided by Herbert Pahlings.
* In the preface of the Atlas, John Conway recognized the help obtained from Herbert Pahlings and the CAS group both in providing additional tables and correcting errors that are unavoidable in working 'by hand' with such a huge amount of data.
* Herbert Pahlings patiently and constructively took part in the long discussions on the design of GAP and together with his students became a main developer and frequent and successful user of GAP.
* Herbert Pahlings has spread the knowledge on computational representation theory by lectures and complete courses given at many places in countries such as Brazil, South Africa, Ireland, Hungary and Italy (there are published lecture notes of some of these courses) and was a splendid host for many visitors who came to Aachen to learn about this topic.
* Herbert Pahlings' former students and colleagues have taken part in the publication of several collections of data connected with group representations: Gerhard Hiss and Klaus Lux published 'Brauer Trees of Sporadic Groups' in 1989, Christoph Jansen and Klaus Lux together with Richard Parker and Robert Wilson 'An Atlas of Brauer Characters' in 1995 (which also contains corrections and addenda to the 'Atlas'), and Thomas Breuer 'Characters and Automorphism Groups of Compact Riemann Surfaces' in 2000.
* In 2010 Herbert Pahlings, together with his former student Klaus Lux, published 'Representations of Groups, A Computational Approach', a book of 460 pages which in more than one way breaks new ground.
* Pahlings is survived by his wife, whom he met when he was a student, his three sons and six grandchildren.

Born 12 May 1939, Krefeld, Germany. Died 9 January 2012, Aachen, Germany.
