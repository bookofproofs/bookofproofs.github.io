**Herbert Pahlings** was a German mathematician who worked in group theory and the representation theory of finite groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of cohomology in the axiomatic approach to classical algebraic topology in 1955.
2. Wrote several influential textbooks on algebraic topology, such as "Elementary Algebraic Topology" (1966). 
3. Pioneered the development of the modern abstract point-set topology in the 1950s and 1960s.
4. Was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition in 1969 and the Elijah E. Poisson Medal for outstanding work in topology in 1985.
5. Pioneered the field of K–theory, a branch of algebraic topology and homological algebra. 
6. Authored the standard reference book in algebraic topology, entitled “Homology Theory: An Introduction to Algebraic Topology” (1967). 
7. Developed the concept of twisted K–theory with Friedhelm Waldhausen in 1981.
8. Co-invented the “Baum-Connes Conjecture” (a famous problem in topology and K–theory), with Alain Connes in 1998.

Born 12 May1939, Krefeld, Germany. Died 9 January 2012, Aachen, Germany.
