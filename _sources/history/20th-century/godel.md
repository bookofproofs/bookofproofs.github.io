**Gödel** proved fundamental results about axiomatic systems showing in any axiomatic mathematical system there are propositions that cannot be proved or disproved within the axioms of the system.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the completeness of the first-order predicate calculus, thus establishing the modern mathematical basis of logic.
2. Developed an improvement in mathematical logic known as the Incompleteness Theorem, demonstrating the limits of mechanical computability.
3. Discovered the Gödel numbering, a system used to encode formal expressions such that they can be manipulated and studied by a machine.
4. Introduced the concept of constructibility, which was later used by Paul Cohen to resolve the Continuum Hypothesis.
5. Pioneered modern mathematical proof theory, demonstrating the relative consistency of mathematical systems.
6. Developed the influential dialetheic theories which allow for the truth of some self-contradictory statements.
7. Helped to explain the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem, a major issue in the foundations of mathematics.

Born 28 April 1906, Brünn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic). Died 14 January 1978, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
