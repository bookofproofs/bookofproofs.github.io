**Leon Simon** is an Australian mathematician who made contributions to geometric measure theory, harmonic maps and partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Following the award of his Ph.D., Simon was appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics at Flinders University of South Australia for the academic year 1972-73.
* Simon's co-author Richard M Schoen was his first doctoral student and was working on his Ph.D. under Simon's supervision at the time the above paper was written.
* In 1976 Simon returned to Australia being a Visiting Professor at the University of Adelaide during the academic year 1976-77, then was appointed Associate Professor at the University of Minnesota where he worked for the year 1977-78 before again returning to Australia when appointed as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Melbourne.
* Simon published Lectures on geometric measure theory  in 1983.
* In 1986 Simon was appointed Professor in the Mathematics Department at Stanford University.
* In a series of papers over the past ten years, Simon has developed methods for analysing this structure.
* In 1996 Simon published Theorems on regularity and singularity of energy minimizing maps  which was based on lectures which he gave while holding a visiting position at Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich.
* We have mentioned above some of the honours which Simon has received.

Born 6 July 1945, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.
