**Leon Simon** is an Australian mathematician who made contributions to geometric measure theory, harmonic maps and partial differential equations.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the field of geometric measure theory and was the first person to prove the existence of a rectifiable path in a given set of points.
2. Wrote the groundbreaking paper on nonexistence of smooth solutions for certain problems.
3. Developed the method of rectifiability which is a fundamental tool of geometric measure theory.
4. Came up with the concept of singular integrals and (with collaborators, including Stanislaw Lojasiewicz) published a series of papers that developed the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations
5. Research in his later years was devoted to analyzing of the calculus of variations and problems of nonlinear elasticity. 
6. Founded the Courant-Simon Research Institute in 1981, which provides education and research in a broad range of areas in applied mathematics.
7. Helped develop the theory of regularity and stability of solutions to nonlinear equations.

Born 6 July 1945, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.
