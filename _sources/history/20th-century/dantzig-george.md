**George  Dantzig** was an American mathematical scientist who worked in operations research, computer science, economics and statistics. He is best known for inventing the simplex algorithm for linear programming.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was into this very poor family that George was born.
* George was named "George Bernard" after George Bernard Shaw since his parents hoped their first child would become a writer.
* Similarly George's younger brother was named Henry after Henri Poincar√©, and he did indeed become a mathematician.
* Tobias was working on his most famous work Number: the language of science in the late 1920s and George helped him.
* After graduating from High School, Dantzig decided to study mathematics at the University of Maryland, where by this time his father was on the Mathematics Faculty.
* Despite the improved status of his family, Dantzig's parents were still quite poor and not in a position to finance their son through a more prestigious university.
* The newly married couple moved to Ann Arbour where Dantzig began graduate studies at the University of Michigan as a Horace Rackham Scholar.
* In 1937 Dantzig was awarded an M.A. in mathematics, having studied under T H Hildebrandt, R L Wilder and G Y Rainer.
* Unhappy with abstract mathematics, the only courses he enjoyed being on statistics, Dantzig decided to give up his graduate studies.
* Having read statistics papers by Neyman, Dantzig wrote to him in 1939 asking if there was any possibility he could obtain a teaching assistantship at Berkeley so that he could complete his doctoral studies under Neyman's supervision.
* It took Neyman a little while to arrange the teaching assistantship but he managed to do so and Dantzig began for a second time to undertake graduate studies.
* In 1946, after a break of five years, Dantzig returned to Berkeley for one semester, receiving his doctorate in mathematics from the University of California.
* In 1947 Dantzig made the contribution to mathematics for which he is most famous, the simplex method of optimisation.
* Dantzig mechanised the planning process by introducing "programming in a linear structure", where "programming" has the military meaning explained above.
* The term "linear programming" was proposed by T J Koopmans during a visit Dantzig made to the RAND corporation in 1948 to discuss his ideas.
* Having discovered his algorithm, Dantzig made an early application to the problem of eating adequately at minimum cost.
* The particular problem solved was one which had been studied earlier by George Stigler (who later became a Nobel Laureate) who proposed a solution based on the substitution of certain foods by others which gave more nutrition per dollar.
* He then goes on to say that Kantorovich received the Nobel Prize for his contribution and expresses "outrage" that Dantzig did not.
* Dantzig became a research mathematician with the RAND Corporation in 1952 and during this period led the work on implementing linear programming on computers.
* Dantzig has received many honours including the Von Neumann Theory Prize in Operational Research in 1975; The National Medal of Science presented by the president of the United States in 1976; the National Academy of Sciences Award in Applied Mathematics and Numerical Analysis in 1977; the Harvey Prize in Science and Technology from Technion, Israel, in 1985; the Silver Medal from the Operational Research Society of Britain in 1986; the Adolph Coors American Ingenuity Award Certificate of Recognition from the State of Virginia in 1989; and the Special Recognition Award from the Mathematical Programming Society in 1994.

Born 8 November 1914, Portland, Oregon, USA. Died 13 May 2005, Palo Alto, California, USA.
