**George  Dantzig** was an American mathematical scientist who worked in operations research, computer science, economics and statistics. He is best known for inventing the simplex algorithm for linear programming.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Simplex Algorithm in 1947, a method for solving linear optimization problems.
2. Pioneered the development of linear programming, which revolutionized the field of optimization theory.
3. Established the optimality conditions for linear programming problems in 1950.
4. Co-developed the theory of duality in linear programming with Leonid Kantorovich in 1954.
5. Proposed the “Hungarian Method” for solving a certain class of linear programming problems in 1955.
6. Authored the books Linear Programming and Extensions and Number, the Language of Science in 1960 and 1961 respectively.
7. Founded the field of computational geometry in 1965, marking him as one of the first two mathematicians to pursue the field.
8. Co-authored the book Mathematical Programming for Industrial and Management Problems in 1968.
9. Received the National Medal of Science from President Gerald Ford in 1975.

Born 8 November 1914, Portland, Oregon, USA. Died 13 May2005, Palo Alto, California, USA.
