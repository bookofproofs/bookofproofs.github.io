**Enrico Fermi** was an Italian physicist who created the world's first nuclear reactor. He made important contributions to the development of quantum theory, nuclear and particle physics and to statistical mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed what is now known as Fermi's Golden Rule, a general principle used to solve quantum mechanial problems.
2. Authored the first textbook on nuclear physics and wrote numerous articles on specialized areas such as beta decay, nuclear reactions, and particle accelerators.
3. Conducted groundbreaking experiments such as the first artificial nuclear reaction and the first controlled nuclear fission chain reaction.
4. Discovered the radioactive element Technetium, making him the first person to artificially produce an element on Earth.
5. Developed the Fermi-Dirac statistics, which govern the behavior of an ideal gas of fermions, identical particles with half-integer spin.
6. Discovered an empirical law describing the behavior of hot and dense materials such as stars and planets, now known as the Fermi-Thomas model.
7. Arguably one of the first proponents of applied Chaos Theory, known as Fermi Analysis or Fermi's Method.

Born 29 September 1901, Rome, Italy. Died 28 November 1954, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
