**Karl Sigmund**  is an Austrian mathematician who is one of the pioneers of evolutionary game theory. He is also interested in the history of science.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of recurrent functions to provide mathematical foundations for evolutionary theories.
2. Wrote a widely-referenced book on game theory called Game Theory and Evolution.
3. Developed a mathematical formula to provide a solution to the Prisoner's Dilemma.
4. Enabled advances in the mathematical theory of randomness by exploring randomness and random search algorithms.
5. Published a comprehensive book -- The Calculus of Variations -- on the subject of calculus of variations. 
6. Established a firm base for the mathematical theory of population dynamics by developing the theory of replicator dynamics.
7. Authored two books on probability theory -- Probability Theory in Logic and Probabilistic Techniques in Discrete Mathematics.
8. Discovered the concept of symmetry-breaking in mathematics that enables the study of collective behavior in different settings.

Born 26 July 1945, Gars am Kamp, Lower Austria, Austria.
