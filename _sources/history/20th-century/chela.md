**Raimundo Chela**, Venezuelan mathematician, made significant contributions to mathematics at all levels, including a novel approach to equation singularities, classification of rational equations, resolution of certain equations, perturbation problems and a new equation family.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed and published a novel, algebraic-geometric approach to the study of equation singularities in 1978. 
2. Spearheaded the classification of roots and singularities of rational equations with their associated multiplicities and indices. 
3. Proposed a new algorithm for the resolution of certain types of equations. 
4. Made significant contributions to the research area of singular perturbation problems in differential equations.
5. Discovered a new family of equations known as Chela equations. 
6. Established parameterizable versions of many famous equations. 
7. Developed a general, unified theory for the study of symmetry-breaking problems in algebraic geometry.

Born 17 November 1919, Car√∫pano, Sucre state, Venezuela. Died 3 July 1984, Caracas, Venezuela.
