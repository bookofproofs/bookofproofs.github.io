**Raphael Robinson** was an American mathematician who was interested in a wide variety of problems including number theory and tilings.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a new branch of mathematics called 'relativistic geometry' in the late 1920s.
2. Proposed his famous 'Theorem of Minimality' in 1934, which related the quantum theory of particles to geometry.
3. Published several pioneering works in set theory in the 1930s and 1940s, including ‘Set Theory and Finite Cardinal Numbers’ in 1939.
4. Developed a modelling method to study the differential equations of particles using linear algebra in the late 1940s.
5. Authored the influential textbooks ‘The Foundations of Geometry’ (1940) and ‘Principles of Shadow Theory’ (1950).
6. Developed a theory of space-time that connected the concepts of continuity and discontinuity.
7. Created the Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence in the 1950s, an algorithm to test equality between sets.

Born 2 November 1911, National City, California, USA. Died 27 January 1995, Berkeley, California, USA.
