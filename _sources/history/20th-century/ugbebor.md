### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* For the sake of simplicity we will refer to her as Ugbebor throughout this biography.
* Ugbebor had top marks in French and her French teacher wanted her to take A level French but, since Ugbebor was equally good at science, the government policy determined that she take A levels in science subjects.
* In the above quote Ugbebor is describing the time she attended the University of London Institute of Education Course for Lecturers, held from 15-19 September 1975 and was awarded the Certificate of the University Teaching Methods Unit in 1976.
* Ugbebor has published papers and books on a wide variety of topics.

Born 29 January 1951, Lagos, Nigeria.
