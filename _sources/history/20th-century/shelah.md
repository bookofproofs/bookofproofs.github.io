**Saharon Shelah** is an Israeli mathematician who worked in America on mathematical logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of conditionally perfect forcing, a method of iterating forcing over models of set theory.
2. Established Consistency Results for set theory, such as proving the consistency of Whitehead's problem of finding a non-prime ideal in an abelian group.
3. Pioneered the use of the point set topology as a tool for model theory.
4. Formulated the coset/depth dichotomy for tame abstract elementary classes.
5. Discovered the Hrushovski constructions which solved TP2, the splitting problem for varieties of algebras. 
6. Proved that basic models for a theory in the language of arithmetic are unique. 
7. Published over 900 papers and 40 books on set theory, model theory, and mathematical logic.
8. Authored the influential book "Classification Theory For Abstract Elementary Classes". 
9. Developed an approach to non-standard analysis via weighted logic. 
10. Received numerous awards and honors, including being elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2009.

Born 3 July 1945, Jerusalem, British Mandate for Palestine (now Israel).
