**Werner Romberg** was a German mathematician and physicist. He worked in numerical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Foundations of Number Theory, developing the so-called 'Romberg Numbers'.
2. Developed the First Method of Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
3. Formulated the Romberg Theorem of Calculus, which is a generalization of the Riemann Sum.
4. Devised the Theory of Diophantine Numbers, which deals with the study of non-arithmetic truths.
5. Invented the Method of Mittenende, an Algebraic Tool used to solve Polynomials.
6. Established the Principle of Substitution, a technique to treat equations with arbitrary functions.
7. Proposed an axiom system for the definition of arithmetic operations.
8. Pioneer of Analytic Function Theory, which studies the behavior of functions through complex analysis.
9. Discovered the Romberg Inequality, which relates the Riemann sum to a corresponding integral.
10. Demonstrated the Capacity to Use Mathematics as a Tool for Investigating Physical Phenomena.

Born 16 May1909, Berlin, Germany. Died 5 February 2003, Heidelberg, Germany.
