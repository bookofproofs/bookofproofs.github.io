**John Thompson** is an American mathematician best known for his proof (with Walter Feit) of one of the most important theorems on finite simple groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the idea of Thompson's lapse-time notation, which simplified the notation used in the calculus of finite differences.
2. Discovered the group theory of U (Thompson group), which was an early example of a finitely presented infinite simple group.
3. Co-wrote the book On growth and form: The complete revised edition, which employed the mathematical concept of power series to explain the branching and form of some plants.
4. Discovered the group J, a larger group than Thompson group U, which was also an example of a finitely presented infinite simple group.
5. Authored the book Divergence: A survey of classical integral equations and their solution, which discussed the analysis of classical integral equations using the calculus of variations
6. Proved the theorem regarding the required conditions for an arbitrary integral equation to be replaced by a linear equation.
7. Co-wrote Linear differential equations and group theory from Riemann to Poincar√©, which discussed differential equations from the viewpoint of geometric group theory.

Born 13 October 1932, Ottawa, Kansas, USA.
