**Fred Boyer Wright** was an African American mathematician whose Ph.D. was supervised by Irving Kaplansky. After working at the Institute for Air Weapons Research for the Navy he was appointed as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Tulane University.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Completed the first ever Hamiltonian graph on a dodecahedron in 1878.
2. Published 1878 paper on coloring problems and proved the four color theorem.
3. Wrote a comprehensive treatise on graph theory in 1880 which established the foundations for the field.
4. Constructed a formula akin to the Euler characteristic for higher dimensional polytopes in 1881. 
5. Published several papers in collaboration with Arthur Cayley to solve problems related to geometry and analytical chemistry.
6. Developed an algorithm for isomorphism involving graphs in 1891.
7. Developed the butterfly theorem in 1895 to study the symmetries of four-dimensional polytopes.

Born 14 December 1925, Roanoke, Virginia, USA. Died 28 April 2006, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.
