**Pedro Puig Adam** was a Spanish mathematician and engineer who worked in relativistic mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published several mathematical works, including a monograph on Fourier series.
2. Developed a method of using arithmetic to solve differential equations.
3. Explored the relationship between sequential numbers and their sums.
4. Established a decimation-in-time algorithm for the fast Fourier transform.
5. Developed an algorithm to calculate the zeros of a polynomial (Cauchy's Method).
6. Solved the three-body problem in the complex plane.
7. Determined the exact solution for certain classes of minimization problems.
8. Discovered the relationship between the maximum and minimum of a function and its derivatives (Hessian Transformation).
9. Developed a new Fourier transform using Legendre polynomials.
10. Provided a proof of the meromorphicity of Euler's zeta function.

Born 12 May 1900, Barcelona, Spain. Died 12 January 1960, Madrid, Spain.
