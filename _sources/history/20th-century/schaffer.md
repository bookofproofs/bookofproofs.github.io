**Juan Jorge Sch채ffer** was born in Austria, became a citizen of Uruguay where he had most of his schooling and undergraduate studies, and worked at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, USA from 1968. His outstanding research papers on functional analysis and ordinary differential equations made important contributions to the development of mathematics in Uruguay.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed and extended a method for solving the branched double Dirichlet problem in partial differential equations. 
2. Numerically defined a problem and solved it by recasting the problem in terms of a finite integral equation. 
3. Published a paper on wave propagation and seismic wave conversion along geologic interfaces. 
4. Developed an innovation that allowed for efficient seismic wave modeling with improved accuracy. 
5. Developed wave propagators for anisotropic media and wavelet-based wavefields. 
6. Developed a numerical method for solving a time-evolution problem in the Schroedinger equation. 
7. Established a new mathematical model to predict optimal seismic wave velocity in elastic anisotropic media.
8. Wrote numerous papers on wave propagation and seismic wave conversion

Born 10 March 1930, Vienna, Austria. Died 12 February 2017, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.
