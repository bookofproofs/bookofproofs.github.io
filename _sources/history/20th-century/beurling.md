**Arne Beurling**  was a Swedish mathematician who worked in harmonic analysis, complex analysis and potential theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a statistical method to identify errors in coded signals.
2. Developed a new method of cryptanalysis to break the German systematic code which enabled the allies to decode German radio communication during the World War II.
3. Won the Noether prize for his service to mathematics in 1942.
4. Established a theory of how wavelets are generated and describe the behavior of random numbers.
5. Solved problems in number theory that had eluded mathematicians for centuries.
6. Published a paper on Fourier analysis that opened up new areas of research. 
7. Established a correction procedure for existing methods of probability theory which were wrong.
8. Discovered an extension to the central limit theorem.
9. Developed a statistical test to analyze errors from coded signals. 
10. Solved Magnusâ€™ problem on linear integral equations.

Born 3 February 1905, Gothenburg, Sweden. Died 20 November 1986, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
