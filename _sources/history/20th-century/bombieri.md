**Enrico Bombieri** is an Italian Fields medal winner, known for his work in analytic number theory, algebraic geometry, theory of several complex variables,  minimal surfaces and the theory of finite groups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Won the Fields Medal in 1974 for his work in analytic number theory.
2. Established the circle method, an original method of attack in analytic number theory, with which he solved various outstanding problems in the field.
3. Helped prove the Riemann Hypothesis in the 1970s.
4. Founded the field of arithmetic geometric complexity theory.
5. Constructed a bridge between number theory and algebraic geometry.
6. Resolved the dual form of a conjectured trace formula.
7. Received the Wolf Prize in 1995 for his contributions to Number Theory.
8. Established the mathematical foundation for the fundamental lemma of the Langlands program.

Born 26 November 1940, Milan, Italy.
