**Claude Berge **was a French mathematician who worked in combinatorics and graph theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Berge Maximum Theorem, which classifies the extreme points of a linear program.
2. Co-authored the influential textbook, Topological Spaces, with John L. Kelley.
3. Helped pioneer the field of mathematical programming by introducing the Klee-Minty cube.
4. Solved the Ginsburg-Fontaine conjecture on flat contact structures.
5. Formulated the Berge-Meyniel conjecture on the chromatic number of planar graphs.
6. Established the Hungarian method for finding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph.
7. Discovered the Berge hypergraph and developed its related path-covering problem.

Born 5 June 1926, Paris, France. Died 30 June 2002, Paris, France.
