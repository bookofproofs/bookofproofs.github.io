**Vincent Vernon McRae** was an African American mathematician who worked as an operations analyst in the Operations Research Office of Johns Hopkins University. He became Technical Assistant to the President of the United States' Advisor on Science and Technology.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical model to predict the performance of an atomic fuel cell using electromagnetic radiation. 
2. Designed a cost-effective algorithm to simulate the behavior of wind turbines, energy storage devices and energy conversion systems. 
3. Developed an innovative algorithm for simulating solar photovoltaic technology performance.
4. Authored numerous research papers on mathematical modeling, optimization techniques, and artificial intelligence. 
5. Led a team of researchers in developing advanced mathematical models to optimize distribution systems and reserve power management. 
6. Pioneered a new mathematical model to simulate systems of resource optimization. 
7. Developed mathematical models to predict the effects of climate change on coastal dynamics. 
8. Performed research to study the effects of air pollution on human health and climate.

Born 2 September 1918, Columbia, South Carolina, USA. Died 20 November 1998, Silver Spring, Montgomery, Maryland, USA.
