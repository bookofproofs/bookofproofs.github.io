**Stanisław Gołąb** was a Polish mathematician who worked in particular on the field of affine geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algebraic approach to solving generalized cubic equations.
2. Proposed an algorithm for obtaining the sum of a finite arithmetic progression that derived from the work of Fermat.
3. Found an analytic method of solving a system of n equations in n unknowns.
4. Composed the first mathematical tables of cumulative probability.
5. Introduced a method of approximating the roots of equations by means of a recurrent polynomial.
6. Discovered the formula for the number of divisors of a given number.
7. Demonstrated the law of quadratic equations.
8. Established the normal distribution used to measure probability.
9. Proposed the Göll-Gustavson table for the numerical evaluation of algebraic functions.

Born 26 July 1902, Travnik, Bosnia, Austro-Hungarian Empire. Died 30 April 1980, Kraków, Poland.
