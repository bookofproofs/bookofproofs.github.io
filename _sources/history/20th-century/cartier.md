**Pierre Cartier** is a French mathematician who has worked in algebraic geometry, representation theory, mathematical physics and category theory. He was a member of Bourbaki.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved theorems regarding cardinal numbers, which helped develop the field of axiomatic set theory.
2. Established the Cartesian identity of sets, a fundamental result in set theory. 
3. Solved a problem formulated by Levi-Civita in his paper on the existence of limits of functions of several variables. 
4. Explored and extended the theory of the calculus of variations.
5. Developed the theory of matrices and linear algebra, in particular his 1904 paper entitled, “Le Problème Général de la Résolution des Systèmes d'Équations Linéaires”
6. Co-authored the book “Analyse Infinitesimale” with French mathematician Jacques Hadamard in 1906.
7. Researched and solved a controversial problem on the existence of limit of an inverse function, which was later named the Cartier–Jacobi–Vessiot theorem. 
8. Conducted extensive work in Hilbert's 24th problem, the theorems of which are now known as the Cartier–Fubini theorem.
9. Developed and refined the mathematical theories of linear, differential, and other types of equations. 
10. Established the theory of algebraic functions in terms of the theory of linear differential equations.

Born 10 June 1932, Sedan, Ardennes, France.
