**Friedrich Horn** was an Austrian mathematician who applied mathematics to chemical engineering.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After graduating, Horn went to work for Farbwerke Hoechst AG, a German chemicals company based in Frankfurt, Germany.
* Horn was employed as a physicist with Farbwerke Hoechst where he was assigned to work in a chemical process engineering department headed by Leopold Küchler.
* At Farbwerke Hoechst, in addition to supervising his work for the company, Küchler was essentially Horn's thesis advisor.
* Horn's first publication Zur Berechnung der Zusammensetzung und Thermodynamischen Funktionen Dissoziierender Verbrennungsgase Ⓣ(Calculating the composition and thermodynamic functions dissociating combustion gases) (written jointly was A Schüller) appeared in print in 1957.
* A significant event had occurred in the previous year when Horn attended the First European Symposium on Chemical Reaction Engineering which was held in Amsterdam in May 1957.
* Horn remained in contact with Denbigh who moved to Imperial College, London, in 1960 where he became the Courtaulds Professor of Chemical Engineering.
* Denbigh persuaded Horn to join him at Imperial College so, in 1962, he left Farbwerke Hoechst and moved to London where he took up his first academic post.
* While at Imperial College, Horn received an invitation to spend several weeks at the University of Minnesota working with Rutherford "Gus" Aris (1929-2005) and Neal R Amundson (1916-2011).
* Horn was one of the founders of the Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications in 1967 and he became an associate editor.
* By the time these last two papers were published, Horn had left Rice.

Born 9 October 1927, Vienna, Austria. Died 17 December 1978, Vienna, Austria.
