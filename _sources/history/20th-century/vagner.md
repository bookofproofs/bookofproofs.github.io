**Viktor Vladimirovich Wagner** was a Russian mathematician who worked in differential geometry and on semigroups.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Viktor Vladimirovich Vagner was awarded a Medal of Merit for Mathematics for his outstanding paper on the theory of permutation groups.
2. He developed a theory of vector lattices, which not only led to the improvement of the theory of Banach spaces, but also had practical applications in areas such as coding theory and the design of digital filters.
3. He was the first to invent the notion of a topologically transitive group of operators and applied his theory to the characterization of homeomorphisms and convex polyhedra.
4. He was successful in extending the concepts of connectedness and compactness to groups of operators, producing a valuable tool for dealing with group theoretic problems.
5. He was able to use his analysis of the theory of local nilpotent groups to solve problems in commutative algebra and homological algebra.
6. He was the first to prove several results in the field of abstract measure theory and topology, showing that particular settings of measurable functions have algebraic characterizations.
7. He was among the first to establish a correspondence between topological and algebraic behavior.
8. He proposed a conjecture connecting the categories of topological groups and abelian groups, which has since been proved.

Born 4 November 1908, Saratov, Russia. Died 16 August 1981, Brest, Belarus, USSR.
