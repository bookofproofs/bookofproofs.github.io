**Henri Cartan** was a French mathematiician who was one of the original Bourbakistes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Spectacular development of the classical geometrical techniques of differential forms, which helped to unify the study of geometry and topology.
2. Discovery of the Frobenius theorem.
3. Introduction of sheaf theory and the use of sheaves for the study of cohomology.
4. Development of spectral sequences and the introduction of algebraic topology.
5. Invention of the homology and cohomology of a Lie group.
6. Development of a theory of integration of differential forms on algebraic manifolds.
7. Establishment of basic results in topological vector spaces and differential equations.
8. Determination of a semi-simplicial differential as a basic tool for analyzing algebraic and topological structures.
9. Invention of the Cartan-Eilenberg homological algebra.
10. Comprehensive study of Lie groups and Lie algebras.

Born 8 July 1904, Nancy, France. Died 13 August 2008, Paris, France.
