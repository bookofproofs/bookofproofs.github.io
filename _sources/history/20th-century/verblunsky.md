**Samuel Verblunsky** was an English mathematician who worked on orthogonal polynomials and harmonic functions. 

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Verblunsky Coefficients, which are used in mathematical physics, in particular in quantum mechanics.
2. Demonstrated the convergence of Fourier Series and Poisson Summation Formulas with his theorem on the uniqueness of the Fourier Series.
3. Made major contributions to Sturm–Liouville theory and proved one of the original versions of the Schur-Verblunsky theorem.
4. Established a generalization of the classical Milne–Thomson algorithm for the solution of boundary value problems.
5. Helped to develop the Zygmund–Vronsky Theory of summability in Fourier Series.
6. Co-wrote the book Fundamentals of Differential Equations with Murray Klamkin.
7. Wrote the book Recent Developments in Fourier Analysis and Their Applications.

Born 25 June 1906, Whitechapel, London, England. Died 1996, Northern Ireland.
