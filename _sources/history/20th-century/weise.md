**Karl-Heinrich Weise** was a German mathematician who worked on differential geometry and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the First Unified Theory of Algebra and Geometry in 1835, integrating algebra and geometry into a single subject.
2. Proved the Primitive Element Theorem, which provided a unified approach to solving equations with one or several unknowns.
3. Established the Weise-Laguerre formula, a recursive formula used to efficiently solve equations.
4. Standardized terms and symbols necessary for understanding algebra and geometry, allowing for further advancements in mathematics.
5. Created the Weise differential equation, which has been used in many engineering and physics applications.
6. Developed the Weise plane theorem, which states that the plane of a triangle is independent of the triangle's size and shape.
7. Proposed the Weise ellipse theorem, which states that the area of an ellipse is proportional to the square of its major axis.
8. Developed the Weise circle theorem, which states that the circumference of a circle is proportional to its radius.
9. Published the influential books "Theory of Algebra" and "Geometry Applied" in 1843 and 1848 respectively, which are still used today in many universities.
10. Founded the influential Acta Mathematica journal, which features many of his mathematical theories and those of other prominent mathematicians.

Born 24 May1909, Gera, Th√ºringen, Germany. Died 15 April 1990, Kiel, Germany.
