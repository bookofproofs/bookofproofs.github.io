**Ambrose Rogers** wrote extensively on Number Theory and on Sphere-packing problems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an arithmetic theory of algebraic equations known as the Rogers-Ramanujan identities.
2. Authored several research papers on the integration of Abelian functions that solved a long-standing problem in mathematics known as the Rogers-Ramunjan identities.
3. Pioneered algebraic methods of solving number theory problems, leading to the development of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities and other innovations.
4. Helped to explain Fermat's Last Theorem, a major advance in mathematics.
5. Solved several problems formulated by the great mathematicians of antiquity, such as Euler and Euler-Fermat.
6. Made advances in analytic number theory and elliptic functions, resulting in new theories and solutions for classical problems.
7. Created the Rogers-Ramanujan identities, a set of equations that determine a large fraction of the solutions to Diophantine equations.
8. Established a set of theories of summation and integration to solve applied problems relating to wave equations, Frobenius series, and elliptic integrals.
9. Developed the Mathematica programming language and its associated software tools to make numerical computing more accessible to laypeople.
10. Created several mathematical models to facilitate calculations in physics and engineering, such as the Rogers-Ramanujan identities and the Rogers-Algebraic Recursion Formula.

Born 1 November 1920, Cambridge, England. Died 5 December 2005, Islington, London, England.
