**Donald Davies** was a British physicist and mathematician who worked on the early development of computers and networks. His idea of 'packet switching' made the Internet, and ultimately the world wide web, possible.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of packet switching, an essential component of modern internet communication.
2. Co-invented the public data network, which enabled long distance data communication.
3. Pioneered the use of time-sharing and interactive computing, allowing multiple users to access the same computer.
4. Introduced the concept of bandwidth, a measure of how much digital information can be transferred over a network.
5. Authored a number of scientific and engineering papers which helped to shape and advance the fields of network engineering, computer science and telecommunications.

Born 7 June 1924, Treorchy, Rhondda Valley, Wales. Died 28 May2000, Esher, Surrey, England.
