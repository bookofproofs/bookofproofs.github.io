**Gyula Maurer** was a Hungarian mathematician (born in what is now Romania) who worked in group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the genus of a non-compact Riemannian surface of constant negative curvature.
2. Assisted in modifying Felix Klein’s Erlangen Program to enable a multi-dimensional generalization of Lie algebras.
3. Developed Maurer–Cartan equations, which allowa Lie group to be identified with its Lie algebra.
4. Solved a problem involving the orbit of points inside an ellipsoid through an algebraic geometrical approach. 
5. Demonstrated the existence of a Riemann domain which is not strongly convex.
6. Contributed to the development of the index theorem in surface theory.
7. Showed Picard’s theorem can be proven in the planes of projective linear space. 
8. Discovered a proof that the Levi-Civita connection on Riemannian space is metrizeable. 
9. Developed a method to evaluate the length of curves in Riemannian space.

Born 18 January 1927, Târnăveni, Romania. Died 8 January 2012, Maglód, near Budapest, Hungary.
