**Lyman Spitzer** was an American theoretical physicist and astronomer best known for pioneering the idea of a space telescope. He also worked on nuclear fusion.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theoretical framework for plasma physics. 
2. Pioneered the study of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by using high-speed computers 
3. Performed pioneering work in turbulent flow, shock waves and supersonic flow. 
4. Showed how interstellar dust could form stars, planets, and galaxies. 
5. Used mathematical models to project the motion and stability of stars within a galaxy. 
6. Developed an algorithm for simulating the behaviour of subatomic particles in an MHD environment. 
7. Wrote several influential books and papers on space astronomy and related topics. 
8. Authored influential papers on stellar classification, star formation, and galactic structure. 
9. Was an influential figure in the development of the Hubble Space Telescope.

Born 26 June 1914, Toledo, Ohio, USA. Died 31 March 1997, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.
