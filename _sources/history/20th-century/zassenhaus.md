**Zassenhaus** did important work on Group Theory and Lie algebras.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of a quasi-uniform field in ring theory.
2. Introduced the Magnus-Tietze-Zassenhaus strategy for group extensions.
3. Worked on algebraic methods for the quadratic reciprocity law.
4. Established the Zassenhaus Conjecture, a statement about the structure of prime ideals in envelopes.
5. Founded the field of modular group representation theory.
6. Gave a proof of Kaplansky's Zero Divisor Conjecture.
7. Made fundamental contributions to the study of hyperbolic manifolds.
8. Contributed to the early development of homological algebra.
9. Discovered a closed formula for the volume of an n-dimensional unit sphere.
10. Devised an algorithm to compute the class number of a binary quadratic form.

Born 28 May1912, Koblenz-Moselweiss, Germany. Died 21 November 1991, Columbus, Ohio, USA.
