**William Hodge** was Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at Cambridge. His main interests were in Algebraic Geometry and Differential Geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the William Hodge Theory, a research program in geometry that focused on algebraic theories with applications to differential geometry and topology. 
2. Received the Royal Medal of the Royal Society of London in 1958. 
3. Developed techniques in spectral theory and Hermitian differential geometry.
4. Won the Adams Prize of the University of Edinburgh in 1937. 
5. Pioneered innovative work in algebraic topology, algebraic cycles, the study of general relativity and boundary value problems in partial differential equations.
6. Authored several books related to mathematics such as ‘The Theory of Matrices’,’Algebraic Topology’, and ‘Theory of Numbers and Their Functions’. 
7. Won the Sylvester Medal of the Royal Society in 1961 for spreading knowledge of mathematics. 
8. Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1953. 
9. Won the De Morgan Medal of the London Mathematical Society in 1951.
