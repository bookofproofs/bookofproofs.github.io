**Roger Penrose** is a British mathematician who published both on pure mathematics and cosmology. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2020.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Penrose tilings, a set of rules for nonperiodic tiling of a surface.
2. Made major contributions to the mathematical fields of general relativity, cosmology and topology.
3. Founded twistor theory, an approach to unification of quantum theory and general relativity.
4. Conjectured the cosmic censorship hypothesis, which suggests that the singularities of general relativity must be hidden behind an event horizon.
5. Discovered the match between quantum mechanics and the geometrization of microtubules in the brain, known as Penroseâ€“Hameroff Orch-OR theory.
6. Developed the Penrose triangle, a three-dimensional optical illusion.

Born 8 August 1931, Colchester, Essex, England.
