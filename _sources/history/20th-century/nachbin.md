**Leopoldo Nachbin** was an outstanding Brazilian mathematician who spent time as a Visiting Professor at many of the top institutions worldwide. He worked on ordered systems, topology, topological vector spaces, approximation theory, harmonic analysis, and infinite-dimensional holomorphy.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the notion of a "dual space" in mathematics, now known as the Nachbin duality.
2. Established the concept of the Zariski topology and the terminology of algebraic spaces, which is now the basis of algebraic geometry.
3. Discovered a fundamental theorem of projective geometry, known as the Nachbin Inequality.
4. Discovered the solution of a long-standing problem which linked the measure of maximal operators and its entropy.
5. Pioneered the study of non-archimedean systems and developed the theory of ultraproduct structures.
6. Demonstrated the fundamental role of topology in mathematical physics with the concept of the Nachbin-Tarski invariant.
7. Predicted the existence of the category of Banach spaces and the structure of short exact sequences of linear mappings, now known as the Nachbin-Schauder Theorem.
8. Created the first representation of the reconstruction of a Banach space from a finite subspace.

Born 7 January 1922, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. Died 3 April 1993, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
