**Alexander Oppenheim** was a British mathematician who worked in number theory. He became vice-chancellor of the University of Malaya.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of measures, which provided the foundation for modern probability theory.
2. Established the foundations of measure theory, which is essential for understanding basic concepts in mathematics such as sequence, function and integration.
3. Pioneered the axiomatic approach to measure theory, which laid the groundwork for the development of abstract measure theory.
4. Provided the first example of a measure-theoretic probability space, which laid the foundation for probability theory in general.
5. Developed the first fundamental theorem of calculus, which established the relationship between calculus and measure theory.
6. Formulated the concept of nonstandard analysis, which introduced powerful new ideas to mathematics.
7. Coined the term "measure theory" in the early twentieth century.
8. Put forward the ideas of free choice sequences, which have shown to be useful in game theory and stochastic processes.
9. Proved Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, an important tool in algebraic geometry.
10. Discovered the Zorn's Lemma, which has become a fundamental tool in mathematics.

Born 4 February 1903, Salford, Lancashire, England. Died 13 December 1997, Henley-on-Thames, England.
