**Stephen Bosanquet** was an English mathematician who worked in analysis, especially Fourier series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed ideas for quaternions, a four-dimensional algebraic system, in 1844.
2. Came up with a generalization of complex numbers in 1845, the so-called “biquaternions”. 
3. Wrote several texts on mathematics and natural philosophy during the late nineteenth century.
4. Authored the early mathematical work, An Elementary Treatise on Differential Equations with Applications (1860).
5. Proposed a new system of co-ordinates in 1837, where a point was located by a System of Polar Co-ordinates.
6. Wrote a paper in 1845 disregarding geometrical principles, proposing to use the abstract principles of quaternion algebra.
7. Formulated the principles of the calculus of quaternions, a mathematical system which involved mapping three-dimensional space onto the complex plane.
8. Attempted to formulate a cosmological theory in 1895, proposing that the matter composing the universe was, in essence, mathematical.

Born 26 December 1903, St. Stephen's-by-Saltash, Cornwall, England. Died 10 January 1984, Cambridge, England.
