**Joan Clarke** was one of the English mathematicians recruited to work on wartime German codes with Alan Turing at Bletchley Park.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. As a member of Alan Turing's team during World War II, Joan Clarke developed cutting edge codebreaking techniques that helped the team break the Naziâ€™s cipher.
2. She was the only female member of the Bletchley Park codebreaking group and one of the first women to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society for her contributions in math.
3. She invented sophisticated mathematical techniques to help the team break Enigma, a communications encryption system used by the Germans.
4. She was the first person to develop the probability theory of words, which allowed them to discover the average length of words a code was using.
5. Clarke was a mathematical prodigy, learning advanced calculus and differential equations at the age of sixteen, a feat that earned her a place at the University of Cambridge. 
6. She also developed a statistical technique known as the Universal Distance Machine, which improved upon a similar tool developed by Turing. 
7. She was part of the work which eventually led to the building of the Colossus computer, the world's first programmable electronic digital computer, which revolutionized modern computing.

Born 24 June 1917, London, England. Died 4 September 1996, Headington, Oxfordshire, England.
