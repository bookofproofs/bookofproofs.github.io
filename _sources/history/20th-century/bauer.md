**Heinz Bauer** was a German mahematician who worked in measure theory and potential theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Dieudonné and Schwartz were at this time two of the leading members of Bourbaki, and the style of mathematics which they were promoting had a lasting influence on Bauer.
* Bauer spent 1956-57 as a Research Fellow at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, working with Gustave Choquet and Marcel Brelot.
* In 1961 Bauer was appointed to the University of Hamburg where he was appointed director of the Institute of Actuarial Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics and together with Emil Artin, Lothar Collatz, Helmut Hasse, Emanuel Sperner and Ernst Witt became one of the directors of the Mathematics seminar at the University of Hamburg.
* In Hamburg, Bauer replaced Leopold Schmetterer, who had moved to Vienna to succeed Johann Radon who had died in 1956.
* Bauer made a research visit to Paris in the spring of 1964.
* On 1 September 1965, Bauer became a full professor at the University of Erlangen.
* Lectures Bauer gave in the summer semester of 1965 at Hamburg were published as Harmonische Räume und ihre Potentialtheorie Ⓣ(Harmonic spaces and their potential theory) (1966) and further lectures, inspired by Dieudonné's book Foundations of modern analysis  appeared as two separate texts Differential- und Integralrechnung.
* Another book by Bauer also became a classic.
* Bauer has served as Editor of Inventiones mathematicae (1966-79), Mathematische Annalen , Expositiones Mathematicae, and Aequationes Mathematicae.
* In April 1979 Bauer was a plenary speaker at the British Mathematical Colloquium which was held at University College, London.
* In 1980 Bauer received the Chauvenet Prize from the Mathematical Association of America.
* A certificate and monetary award in the amount of five hundred dollars were presented to Professor Bauer at the Business Meeting of the Association on January 6, 1980.
* Professor Bauer is involved in research in integration theory, functional analysis (convexity and approximation theory), potential theory, and Markov processes.
* The paper for which Professor Bauer received the Chauvenet Prize discusses three famous theorems of P P Korovkin that concern uniform approximation of functions.
* Bauer retired from his chair in Erlangen in the spring of 1996.
* In addition to his outstanding professional qualities, Bauer was known for his exceptionally broad general education, his knowledge of literature and history, his love of music and his high appreciation of cultural values.

Born 31 January 1928, Nuremberg, Germany. Died 15 August 2002, Nuremberg, Germany.
