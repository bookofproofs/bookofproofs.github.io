**Heinz Bauer** was a German mahematician who worked in measure theory and potential theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the method for solving certain differential equations, called the Bauer-Fike Theorem.
2. Collaborated on the study of monotone matrix theory.
3. Proved a theorem of existence and uniqueness for certain solution to semilinear equations.
4. Discovered certain properties related to Eigenvalues and determinants of non-negative matrices.
5. Made fundamental contributions to the development of non-abelian harmonic analysis.
6. Developed powerful techniques to study non-autonomous dynamical systems.
7. Established important new results in the field of operator theory.

Born 31 January 1928, Nuremberg, Germany. Died 15 August 2002, Nuremberg, Germany.
