**Stefan E Warschawski** was a Belarussian-born American mathematician who was known for his research on complex analysis and in particular on conformal maps.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Instrumental in advancing a new approach to algebraic topology, known as homotopy theory.
2. Developed a new branch of mathematics called ‘free radicals,’ which is now widely used.
3. Wrote several manuscripts in mathematics and published them in international mathematics journals.
4. Collaborated with other mathematicians in the development of mathematical theories.
5. Established the International Mathematical Union (IMU) in order to campaign for the advancement of mathematical research around the world.
6. Received multiple awards for his contributions to mathematics, including the Fields Medal, the highest honor in mathematics.

Born 18 April 1904, Lida, Russia (now Belarus). Died 5 May1989, San Diego, California, USA.
