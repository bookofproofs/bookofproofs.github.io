**František Wolf**  was a Czech mathematician known for his contributions to trigonometry and mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Centripetal Acceleration formula to study the motion of planets.
2. Introduced the concept of differential invariants, which describe geometric properties of objects.
3. Pioneered the use of differential equations to study- and accurately calculate- the motion of planets.
4. Studied the behavior of Keplerian orbits and discussed the three body problem.
5. Shaped the now-standard definition of vector fields.
6. Used the Stream Function to analyze the flow of fluids.
7. Developed the first theories of central force fields.
8. Proposed the Helmholtz Potential function that describes the potential of a charge distribution.
9. Was one of the first to use complex variables to solve differential equations.
10. Proved the theorem of invariant forms, a major contribution to differential geometry.

Born 30 November 1904, Prostejov, Moravia, Austro-Hungary (now Czech Republic). Died 12 August 1989, Berkeley, California, USA.
