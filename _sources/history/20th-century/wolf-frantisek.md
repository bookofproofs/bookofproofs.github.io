**František Wolf**  was a Czech mathematician known for his contributions to trigonometry and mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Czechoslovakia did not exist at the time that František was born, for the declaration of the political union of the Czechs and Slovaks was not made until the Pittsburgh Convention in the United States on 31 May 1918.
* At this time František was fourteen years old and he had already become fascinated by science and mathematics.
* At the Charles University, Wolf excelled in his studies and he was awarded a gold medal and watch by Tomas Masaryk, the President of the new republic of Czechoslovakia.
* Tomas Masaryk's son, Jan Masaryk, was a personal friend of Wolf who was a strong supporter of the idea behind the new country.
* After obtaining his first degree in physics Wolf went to Masaryk University, Brno, to undertake research in mathematics.
* Wolf then became a secondary school teacher and taught mathematics in schools until 1937 when he was appointed as a Privatdozent at the Charles University in Prague.
* Shortly after his appointment, Wolf travelled to England to study at Cambridge University with Hardy and Littlewood.
* As a result Wolf published two papers in 1939, one in the Journal of the London Mathematical Society and the other in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society.
* After this visit to England Wolf returned to Prague in March 1938 as Germany was annexing Austria.
* The serious political situation saw Czechoslovakia, whose leaders did not favour a German takeover, begin drafting men into the army and Wolf was among them.
* Wolf's views made it impossible for him to remain under German occupation and he was fortunate to have an invitation from the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Stockholm.
* In 1941 Wolf received an invitation to lecture at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in the United States.
* Evans offered Wolf a position at Berkeley, but he felt he had to honour his commitment to Macalester College and duly went there for the one year post before returning to Berkeley as an Instructor in Mathematics in 1942.
* However, Wolf's first 1941 visit to Berkeley was significant in another way for there he met a young botanist Myrtle Richey; they married in 1945 and their son Thomas Wolf was born two years later.
* Wolf's paper The Poisson integral.
* In 1951 Wolf and Beckenbach founded the Pacific Journal of Mathematics, a major international mathematical research journal sponsored by a dozen or more West Coast universities.
* Wolf retired in 1972, and following that he went to the University of Valle in Guatemala where he helped set up a graduate programme.

Born 30 November 1904, Prostejov, Moravia, Austro-Hungary (now Czech Republic). Died 12 August 1989, Berkeley, California, USA.
