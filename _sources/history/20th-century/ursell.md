**Fritz Ursell** was a German-born mathematician who moved to England and became a leading expert in the mathematical modelling of waves.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Riemann hypothesis, an open problem in mathematics concerning the relationship between the prime numbers and the distribution of their prime divisors.
2. Discovered a method of combining arithmetic functions to obtain closed-form approximations to certain integrals.
3. Introduced the idea of associating an integral equation of the first kind with a set of numbers.
4. Published a paper on the modeling of hierarchical polymer networks. 
5. Proved an important result in the field of ergodic theory.
6. Established the Ursell number, which is a parameter used to measure wave-induced transient current in shallow water problems.
7. Devised a technique for calculating the entropy of ideal gases using statistical mechanics.

Born 28 April 1923, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. Died 11 May 2012, Manchester, England.
