**Joram Lindenstrauss** was an Israeli mathematician working in functional analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Winning the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1978. 
2. Proving Furstenbergâ€™s ergodic theorem. 
3. Developing the pointwise ergodic theorem and bringing it to mathematical maturity. 
4. Proving and deepening the structure theory of sets of invariant measures. 
5. Coining the terms moderately-null and null-sequence, important in measure theory. 
6. Applying methods from probability to measure theory. 
7. Resolving two long-open problems, Kesten's theorem on stationary random walks, and Kakutani's problem in infinite ergodic theory. 
8. His work on multiple ergodic theorems, which is connected to density of subsequences.

Born 28 October 1936, Tel Aviv, British Mandate for Palestine (now Israel). Died 29 April 2012, Jerusalem, Israel.
