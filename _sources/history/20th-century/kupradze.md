### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new approach to analytical geometry that unified all existing methods of studying the geometric structures of curved lines.
2. Revolutionized the study of the theory of differential equations, which led to greater understanding of the structure of equations.
3. Solved important problems in mathematical analysis, such as the problem of representing an arbitrary function as a sum of harmonic components.
4. Found the conditions for a uniform distribution of a function on a closed surface.
5. Developed a method for solving functional equations, which yielded important results for integrals with definite boundaries.
6. Discovered the criteria for the solvability of equations of the theory of numbers.
7. Discovered the methods for solving equations of mixed lower orders.
8. Developed criteria for stability in differential equations.
9. Applied harmonic analysis to the study of linear systems.
10. Developed a unique method for unifying the geometric structure of curved surfaces and linear operators.
