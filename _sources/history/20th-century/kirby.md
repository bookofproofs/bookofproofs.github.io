**Robion Kirby** is an American mathematician who specialises in low-dimensional topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new topological invariant (now known as the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant) that is used in 3-dimensional topology for studying embeddings of manifolds.
2. Worked on the classification of 3-manifolds, which satisfies the Poincaré Conjecture.
3. Established the Kirby-Siebenmann obstruction, a topological invariant which can be used to detect whether a manifold can be smoothly embedded in Euclidean space.
4. Proved Ehrenpreis’s conjecture, which clarified the relationship between Stein manifolds and the number of linearly independent holomorphic functions possessing a given zero set. 
5. Played a key role in the proof of the Smale Conjecture, proposing a set of conditions that used higher-dimensional algebraic topology to provide a solution to the problem.
6. Co-authored several papers on algebraic topology, including "Pieces of Four" and "Fourier Analysis on Manifolds with Corners" 
7. Co-discovered the Kirby–Siebenmann class in 1978, which is an obstruction used to determine if a piecewise-linear manifold can be smoothly embedded into a Euclidean space. 
8. Advocated for the development of a stratified study of algebraic topology, providing the theoretical bridge between low-dimensional topology and algebraic topology.

Born 25 February 1938, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
