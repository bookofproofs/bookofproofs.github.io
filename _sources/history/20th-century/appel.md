**Kenneth Appel** was an American mathematician best-known for his part in proving the four-colour theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Appel and Wolfgang Haken proved that the four color theorem is true in 1976 - the first major theorem to be proved using a computer-assisted proof.
2. Appel co-invented the Appel-Haken algorithm, one of the first efficient algorithms for graph coloring, in 1977.
3. Appel further helped develop the theory of NP-completeness, which examines the impact of computer-assisted proofs on the practice of mathematics.
4. Appel and Haken developed the Appel-Haken-Koch algorithm (1983) which could identify whether a map could be colored with four colors without going through every possible combination.
5. Appel earned the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition (1986), in recognition of his 1969 paper "Every Planar Map is Four Colorable".

Born 8 October 1932, Brooklyn, New York, USA. Died 19 April 2013, Dover, New Hampshire, USA.
