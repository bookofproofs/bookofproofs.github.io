**Zygmund**'s work in harmonic analysis has application in the theory of waves and vibrations. He also did major work in Fourier analysis and its application to partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Antoni was the eldest of his parents' four children with three younger sisters Jadwiga, Felicja and Maria.
* Antoni continued his education in Poltava then, in 1918, he returned to Poland which had become an independent country for the first time in well over 100 years.
* At the University of Warsaw Zygmund was taught by, and very much influenced by, Janiszewski, Mazurkiewicz and Sierpiński.
* Zygmund, however, was most influenced by Aleksander Rajchman and by Stanisław Saks who had been his school friend, although three years older than he was.
* This gave Zygmund a life-long interest in the trigonometric series.
* There was a forced break in Zygmund's studies in 1920 when he was called up for the army.
* Zygmund obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Warsaw in 1923 for a dissertation on the Riemannian theory of trigonometric series written under Aleksander Rajchman's supervision.
* On 12 February 1925 Zygmund married Irena Parnowska.
* In 1926 Zygmund submitted his habilitation dissertation to the University of Warsaw and began teaching there.
* Irena Zygmund worked in Vilnius as a school teacher until the birth of their first son Jerzy in 1935.
* In going to Vilnius, Zygmund was going into a disputed city.
* This was the situation when Zygmund was appointed to the chair of mathematics there.
* In 1939 Zygmund was drafted into the Polish army as a reserve officer at the start of the Second World War.
* Zygmund returned to Vilnius but then, on 10 October 1939, Vilnius was returned to Lithuania.
* In 1940 Zygmund escaped with his wife and son from German controlled territory to the United States.
* Zygmund brought Calderón back to Chicago, where he obtained his doctorate under Zygmund's supervision not too long after his arrival.
* Not only did Zygmund have the role of Calderón's teacher and advisor, but was also his mentor and became his main collaborator.
* Zygmund worked in analysis, in particular in harmonic analysis.
* Zygmund's early work, as one might expect, continued to develop ideas from his doctoral studies with Aleksander Rajchman.
* After meeting Paley at Cambridge in 1930-31, Zygmund wrote five joint papers with him, and both of them together with Norbert Wiener wrote Notes on random functions (1933).
* The joint Zygmund-Paley work played an important role in Zygmund's book Trigonometric Series (1935).
* In 1950, not long after beginning his long association with the University of Chicago, Zygmund published Trigonometric Interpolation.
* We mentioned earlier in this article Zygmund's collaboration with Calderón.
* Their joint work began with Calderón's doctoral thesis which answered some questions related to boundary behaviour of harmonic functions which had been posed by Zygmund earlier.
* Together with Richard L Wheeden, Zygmund wrote Measure and integral (1977).
* Zygmund received many honours for his outstanding achievements.
* Zygmund suffered many sad losses during his life.
* Rajchman, Zygmund's doctoral supervisor, was executed by the Nazis.

Born 25 December 1900, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 30 May 1992, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
