**Zygmund**'s work in harmonic analysis has application in the theory of waves and vibrations. He also did major work in Fourier analysis and its application to partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Zygmund–Calderón theorem on singular integral operators
2. Established the foundation of modern Fourier series theory
3. Transformed probability theory with the three-volume work, "Mathematical Foundations of Probability Theory"
4. Initiated and pioneered research on spaces of homogeneous type
5. Developed the Calderón–Zygmund theory of singular integrals, which became a fundamental tool in Harmonic Analysis
6. Developed a systematic theory of differentiation related to singular integrals
7. Pioneered a modern resolution for Hilbert's fifth problem
8. Established connections between the characters of finite groups and probability theory
9. Earned the highest distinction of the International Mathematical Union, an honorary affiliation of the Fields Medal

Born 25 December 1900, Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland). Died 30 May 1992, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
