**George McVittie** studied at Edinburgh and Cambridge. He then held posts at Leeds, Edinburgh and London and became Professor of Astronomy at the University of Illinois. His main work was in Relativity and Cosmology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. George McVittie made pioneering contributions to numerical analysis and computational physics, including the development of a new type of numerical algorithm (called McVittie's algorithm) and the development of the first practical numerical simulation method for calculating the motion of dense stellar systems.
2. He published several papers on the theory of relativity—including a mathematical analysis of the rotation curve of a galaxy—which contributed significantly to the development of modern astrophysics.
3. He developed an analytical solution for the potential of a two-dimensional disk of matter, an advance that helped form the basis for models of galactic halos and dark matter distribution.
4. He developed an analytical solution to the problem of gaseous equilibrium in stars, which was a key advance in obtaining an understanding of stellar structure
5. He developed the first mathematical explanation of why stellar disks tend to rotate rapidly.
6. He developed a widely-used system for measuring distances in astronomical space. 
7. He proposed the concept of a galactic midplane, which provided an accurate way to measure distances in galaxies.
8. He developed an analytical solution for the Jeans equation that improved the model of “turbullence” in interstellar space.

Born 5 June 1904, Smyrna, Turkey (now Izmir). Died 8 March 1988, Canterbury, Kent, England.
