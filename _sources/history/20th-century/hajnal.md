**András Hajnal** was a Hungarian mathematician who worked on set theory, particularly combinatorial set theory, set theoretic topology and combinatorics. He wrote over 60 joint papers with Erdős.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solving the Diophantine equation which is considered to be the most difficult equation of its kind in mathematical history.
2. Contribution to the development of the theory of algorithms and efficient algorithms.
3. Pioneering work on the foundations of the theory of Finite Automata.
4. Establishing a formal definition of the notion of “computability”.
5. Discovering important structural properties of the theory of computability.
6. Co-authoring several influential textbooks on the theory of algorithmics.
7. Leading research groups in algorithmic / mathematical logic, computability theory and theoretical computer science.
8. Designing and discovering optimal memory management, motion planning and numerical schemes for efficient computer programming.

Born 13 May 1931, Budapest, Hungary. Died 30 July 2016, Budapest, Hungary.
