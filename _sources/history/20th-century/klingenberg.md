**Wilhelm Klingenberg** was a German mathematician who worked on differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Wilhelm was the oldest of his parents' six children.
* The family moved to Berlin in 1934, partly because there were better schools in Berlin and partly because Paul Klingenberg had joined the Bekennende Kirche, an organisation set up to oppose the Nazi Party's efforts to Nazify the Protestant Church.
* Wilhelm attended schools in Berlin where he learnt Latin, Greek and French but he had to study mathematics on his own.
* Klingenberg obtained a doctorate in 1950 with a thesis on affine differential geometry.
* Klingenberg spent 1954/55 at Bloomington in the United States visiting Morse at Princeton during his time at Bloomington.
* Although he remained on the staff at Göttingen until 1963, Klingenberg spent 1956/57 and 1957/58 at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
* While at Berkeley, Klingenberg received offers of chairs at Würzburg and Mainz - he chose Mainz.
* Klingenberg worked during his years at Bonn on closed geodesics.
* In 1953 Klingenberg married Christine Kob, they have two sons and a daughter.

Born 28 January 1924, Rostock, Mecklenburg, Germany. Died 14 October 2010, Röttgen, Bonn, Germany.
