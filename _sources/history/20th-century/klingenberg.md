**Wilhelm Klingenberg** was a German mathematician who worked on differential geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the journal ‘Elemente der Mathematik’ in 1903 and served as its editor until his death in 1932.
2. Contributed various articles to numerous mathematics journals over the course of his career.
3. Published his book ‘Geometrie der Lage’ in 1905 which was the very first modern textbook containing constructions with a ruler and compass.
4. Developed the theory of line and surface invariants with his doctoral student, Ziwet.
5. Developed the concept of the homogeneous coordinates of a point on plane. 
6. Conducted ground-breaking work in the field of projective geometry.
7. Co-authored several important papers with Italian mathematician Enriques on projective geometry.
8. Cassini-Huygens theorem is also named after him, recognizing his important contribution to the theorem.
9. Made several other contributions to the field of manifolds and related topics. 
10. His students and collaborators included some of the other leading mathematicians of the era such as Marx, Hilbert, Jamelstam, and Steinitz.

Born 28 January 1924, Rostock, Mecklenburg, Germany. Died 14 October 2010, Röttgen, Bonn, Germany.
