**Irmgard Fl端gge-Lotz** worked on numerical methods for solving differential equations especially in fluid dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of nuclear reactors in collaboration with other physicists, laying the groundwork for today's nuclear power.
2. Helped develop the Los Alamos nuclear bomb project.
3. Pioneered numerical calculation of nuclear reactions and the ability to calculate cross-sections of the bombardment of the nucleus.
4. Calculated and tabulated energy states of different elements, before computers had been invented.
5. Created a mathematical system for the description and solution of complex problems.
6. Used algebraic methods to solve differential equations in areas such as nuclear physics, hydrodynamics and crystal physics.
7. Developed new mathematics methods that allow for the handling of resulting equations from physical models.
8. Put forth the hypothesis that nuclei were ellipsoids in nature and helped measure their shape with experiments.
9. Published numerous papers on the numerical solutions of differential equations.
10. Won numerous awards and honors in recognition of her achievements in mathematics.

Born 16 July 1903, Hameln, Germany. Died 22 May 1974, Stanford, USA.
