**Irmgard Flügge-Lotz** worked on numerical methods for solving differential equations especially in fluid dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Flügge-Lotz, as she was known after her marriage, became a consultant on aerodynamics and flight dynamics at the Deutschland Versuchsanstalt Luftfahrt.
* In 1947 Wilhelm Flügge and Irmgard Flügge-Lotz moved with many of their co-workers to Paris, to become part of the Office National d'Études et de Recherches Aéronautiques.
* At Stanford, Flügge-Lotz undertook research in numerical methods to solve boundary layer problems in fluid dynamics.
* Working on automatic control devices brought Flügge-Lotz into contact with the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford since the devices were almost always of an electrical nature.
* Flügge-Lotz became Stanford's first woman Professor of Engineering in 1961.
* Despite what she had to bear, Flügge-Lotz remained cheerful and kept in touch with friends and colleagues.
* The spirit of Irmgard was always present.
