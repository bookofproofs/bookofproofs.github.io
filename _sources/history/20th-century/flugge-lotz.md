**Irmgard Flügge-Lotz** worked on numerical methods for solving differential equations especially in fluid dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However, there were other significant influences on the young Irmgard who visited building sites as a child with different members of her mother's family who were construction engineers.
* By this time Irmgard was studying at a Girls' Gymnasium in Hanover but in order to help out with money to support herself, her mother and younger sister, she began to tutor mathematics and Latin to bring in some much needed cash.
* Several years later, when Osark returned to Hanover he was in poor health and so Irmgard continued to work to bring in extra money for the family.
* In 1938 Irmgard Lotz and Wilhelm Flügge were married, and in the following year they moved to Berlin where Flügge was appointed to the Deutschland Versuchsanstalt Luftfahrt.
* Flügge-Lotz, as she was known after her marriage, became a consultant on aerodynamics and flight dynamics at the Deutschland Versuchsanstalt Luftfahrt.
* In 1947 Wilhelm Flügge and Irmgard Flügge-Lotz moved with many of their co-workers to Paris, to become part of the Office National d'Études et de Recherches Aéronautiques.
* Although Flügge-Lotz and her husband were happy living in Paris, the positions they held there gave them little hope of progressing in their careers.
* At Stanford, Flügge-Lotz undertook research in numerical methods to solve boundary layer problems in fluid dynamics.
* Working on automatic control devices brought Flügge-Lotz into contact with the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford since the devices were almost always of an electrical nature.
* Flügge-Lotz became Stanford's first woman Professor of Engineering in 1961.
* Despite what she had to bear, Flügge-Lotz remained cheerful and kept in touch with friends and colleagues.
* The spirit of Irmgard was always present.

Born 16 July 1903, Hameln, Germany. Died 22 May 1974, Stanford, USA.
