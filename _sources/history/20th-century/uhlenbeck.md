**George Uhlenbeck** was an Indonesian born American theoretical physicist who worked in quantum mechanics and introduced the idea of electron spin.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of spin in quantum mechanics, which has become known as the Uhlenbeck Spin.
2. Made foundational contributions to quantum statistics, specifically in the field of correlation functions.
3. Founded an important school of physics, the Groningen school of theoretical physics.
4. Developed the mathematical theory of recursive Wick theorem, fundamental to understanding many-body quantum systems.
5. Established the generalized exclusion principle, which is related to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
6. Used the term “renormalization” in order to discuss the behavior of physical systems that behave differently at different scales.

Born 6 December 1900, Batavia, Java (now Jakarta, Indonesia). Died 31 October 1988, Boulder, Colorado, USA.
