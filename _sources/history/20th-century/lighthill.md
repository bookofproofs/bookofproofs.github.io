**James Lighthill** was one of the foremost English applied mathematicians of his day. He worked on aerodynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Was the first to develop and apply compressible fluid flow mathematics to the investigation of aircraft aerodynamics. 
2. Pioneered the modern mathematical analysis of nonlinear acoustics, particularly applied to jets and circulating systems. 
3. Was the first to systematically analyze nonlinear stability in hydrodynamic systems. 
4. Published seminal works on mathematical analysis of non-uniform flow through porous media.
5. Founded the Journal of Fluid Mechanics, which expanded significantly the traditional fields of fluid mechanics. 
6. Was an important contributor to the fields of solar energy, combustion and propulsion design. 
7. Developed early numerical methods for solving partial differential equations. 
8. Published mathematical treatments of the structure of vortex rings and systems of vortex rings. 
9. Established rigorous theories of turbulent friction providing important practical data for the design of machinery. 
10. Received multiple international awards and honorary doctorates related to his achievements in mathematics, including the Aerospace Science and Engineering Award of the Royal Aeronautical Society, the C. W. Vincent Award of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the Richard von Mises Prize of the American Academy of Mechanics.

Born 23 January 1924, Paris, France. Died 17 July 1998, Sark, Channel Islands.
