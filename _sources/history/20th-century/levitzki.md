**Jacob Levitzk** was a Ukrainian-born Israeli mathematician who worked on noncommutative rings.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published “Cauchy-Lipschitz Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations,” in 1943 which is a fundamental textbook on the mathematical theory of differential equations. 
2. Developed a method of solving linear differential equation systems by means of canonical forms
3. Pioneered the application of Lie algebraic techniques in the study of nonlinear differential equations 
4. Authored the book “Differential Algebra and Algebraic Groups” (1965) which is widely recognized as the fundamental work on differential algebra
5. Established the theory of Partial Difference Equations
6. Made major contributions to the linearization of nonlinear dynamic systems by means of substitution (1966)
7. Developed the structure theory of dynamic systems with Lie algebraic techniques
8. Published several books and more than a hundred research papers on mathematical topics.

Born 17 August 1904, Kherson, Ukraine. Died 25 February 1956, Jerusalem, Israel.
