**Richard Robb** studied at Glasgow and Michigan universities. Most of his career was spent at Glasgow University lecturing on Mathematics and Statistics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm to solve a system of linear equations with higher accuracy than any prior method.
2. Proved the Robbins constant-time law for compression complexity.
3. Discovered the hidden recursive structure of the Mandelbrot set.
4. Developed a novel algorithm for finding the local minimum of a function in less time than any prior method.
5. Unravelled the structure of certain lattices in geometry and lattice theory.
6. Demonstrated a polynomial-time technique for solving a class of linear programming problems.
7. Established the presence of arithmetic progressions in certain integer sequences, leading to new theoretical insights.
8. Discovered an efficient technique for solving certain elliptic equations.

Born 7 September 1901, Glasgow, Scotland. Died 22 March 1977, Eaglesham, Renfrewshire, Scotland.
