**Oded Schramm** was an Israeli-American mathematician known for his work in conformal field theory and probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Received the Rollo Davidson Prize in 1995 for his work on harmonic measure and random walks
2. Developed the invariance principle for random walks in random environment
3. Proposed new measurement techniques of SLE growth processes
4. Established the relationship between geodesic distance and SLE (Stochastic Loewner Evolution)
5. Found ways to reconcile both planar and non-planar (generalized) random walks
6. Contributed to the study of almost sure delocalization for random walks
7. Developed the Theory of Renormalization and Noise Sensitivity for Random Walks
8. Proposed the variant of the 4-arm exponent for percolation theory
9. Used the theory of braid groups to explain and better understand the discrete models in two dimensions
10. Invented the Speed Measure, which describes velocity of random walkers in random environments

Born 10 December 1961, Jerusalem, Israel. Died 1 September 2008, Guye Peak, Washington State, USA.
