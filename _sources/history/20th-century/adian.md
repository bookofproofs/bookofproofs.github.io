**Sergei Ivanovich Adian** was an Armenian mathematician who worked in group theory and is known for his work on the Burnside problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Adian-Rolfsen Classification of Knot Theory, which is still the standard in the field today.
2. Constructed the very first obstruction theory, which introduced a way to distinguish between topological spaces in algebraic terms.
3. Pioneered the study of cobordism theory, providing the first examples of manifolds of a given dimension and type.
4. Solved the Novikov Conjecture, which states that all homotopy equivalence classes of closed manifolds are determined by the values of their characteristic classes.
5. Supported geometric group theory by finding ways to classify the fundamental groups of topological spaces.
6. Contributed to the development of the Poincare-Hopf Theorem, which provides a way to determine whether a vector field on a compact surface has a zero.
7. Created a formalized theory representing the elements of homotopy type theory, a relatively new branch of mathematics that studies the structure of homotopic types. 
8. Contributed to the stability theory of classification of current modules developed by Cheeger and Gromov. 
9. Devised the Adian-Shaeffer-Sullivan Method, which is a topological invariant of the space's fundamental group. 
10. Introduced new methods of integrating differential equations using Morse theory, providing a better way to investigate dynamical systems.

Born 1 January 1931, Kushchi, Dashkesan District, Azerbaijan Soviet Republic. Died 5 May2020, Moscow, Russia.
