**Lev Semenovich Pontryagin** was a blind Russian mathematician who produced important work in algebra and topology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Lev Pontryagin developed the Theory of Optimal Control in the 1950s, making a significant contribution to the field of mathematics.
2. He introduced the Maximum Principle, a foundational result in control theory, which has had a significant impact on the development of the field.
3. He also developed Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, another important result in optimal control, which has been used to study and solve some of the most difficult problems in area of optimization.
4. He was a major contributor to the theory of differential equations and the theory of ordinary differential equations.
5. He made substantial contributions to the theory of differential equations and the theory of partial differential equations.
6. He founded the Russian School of Mathematics and was the creator of the Courants-Pontryagin Maximum Principle, a major breakthrough in the field of calculus of variations.
7. His theoretical research and mathematical innovations inspired the development of several branches of mathematics, including game theory, topology and nonlinear optimization.
8. He was also a major contributor to the development of the theory of continuous groups and their application to the theory of ordinary differential equations.

Born 3 September 1908, Moscow, Russia. Died 3 May 1988, Moscow, Russia.
