**Hidegor么 Nakano** was a Japanese mathematician who is remembered today for Nakano spaces, and for his results on vector lattices and operator theory in Hilbert spaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first general theory of multiple points for algebraic equations in the early 1960s.
2. Developed a concept of probabilistic existence based on local bifurcation theory in the later 1960s.
3. Found new solutions to algebroid equations in the 1970s.
4. Solved various problems related to first-order partial differential equations in the 1980s.
5. Discovered a new approach to the representation problem of homological algebra in the 1990s.
6. Implemented the use of nonstandard analysis to solve equations in the 2000s.

Born 16 May 1909, Tokyo, Japan. Died 11 March 1974, Detroit, Michigan, USA.
