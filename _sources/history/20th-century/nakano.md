**Hidegorô Nakano** was a Japanese mathematician who is remembered today for Nakano spaces, and for his results on vector lattices and operator theory in Hilbert spaces.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Katsugoro Nakano's ancestors had a lacquerware business making ornamental parts for swords.
* Hidegorô attended schools in Tokyo, completing his secondary education at a middle school.
* Nakano then entered the Imperial University of Tokyo where he studied mathematics.
* Nakano graduated from the Imperial University of Tokyo in March 1933 with a Bachelor of Science degree and he continued studying at the Graduate School for his doctorate.
* Nakano's remaining 1932 paper was communicated by Takuji Yoshie to the Imperial Academy of Japan on 12 October 1932.
* Having six papers in print before entering graduate school, Nakano submitted a thesis for his doctorate the day he entered on 1 April 1933.
* But Nakano had just graduated from the university, and presented his thesis for a doctorate on the same day that he entered graduate school.
* After a while Nakano told me why he did so.
* Therefore, Professor Takuji Yoshie examined Nakano's thesis very carefully.
* In 1936, Nakano was awarded doctor of science degree three years after submitting.
* Nakano undertook research at the Graduate School until 29 April 1935, when he became a professor at the National First High School.
* Nakano was promoted to assistant professor on 15 April 1942.
* Nakano often led his students on a hike hunting for food in neighbouring villages.
* Nakano's first book was From Riemann integral to Lebesgue integral (Japanese) published in 1940.
* By the time that Spectral Theory in the Hilbert Space was published, Nakano had left Tokyo and moved to Sapporo to take up a professorship at Hokkaido University.
* Regular members of Nakano's seminars, undergraduate as well as graduate, called themselves Nakano's students.
* Nakano moved to Hokkaido University from Tokyo University in 1952.
* Nakano's appointment at Hokkaido University was thus a move from Tokyo to Hokkaido.
* It was a group of graduate students engaged in research under Nakano's leadership.
* From February 1961 to March 1974 Nakano was a professor of mathematics at Wayne State University, Detroit, USA.
* At Wayne State University, Nakano supervised the studies of eight students for a Ph.D. He continued to work there until 1973 when he was taken ill.
* From the late 1960s Nakano became interested in set theory and attempted to produce a different version of the theory from the classical axiomatic approach.

Born 16 May 1909, Tokyo, Japan. Died 11 March 1974, Detroit, Michigan, USA.
