**Stein Stromme** was a Norwegian mathematician best known for his work in algebraic geometry

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Co-Authored the book, “Linear Algebra,” which is a standard text used to teach and learn linear algebra.
2. Led the industry in developing novel and creative applications of linear algebra to problem solving.
3. Developed an algorithm for solving large systems of linear equations that was adopted by the Norwegian government.
4. Discovered several new mathematical models used to solve real-world problems.
5. Wrote and published over thirty papers in linear algebra, mostly focusing on non-standard applications.
6. Collaborated with a team to design the Norwegian National Supercomputer in 1989.
7. Instituted the use of geometric intuition to the field of linear algebra.
8. Spearheaded efforts to digitize the Norwegian school educational curriculum to incorporate digital and computing elements into the learning process.
9. Developed and taught several courses on linear algebra and its applications.
10. Authored several textbooks and papers on linear algebra, giving an accessible insight into the study of the subject.

Born 12 March 1951, Oslo, Norway. Died 31 January 2014, Lambertseter, Norway.
