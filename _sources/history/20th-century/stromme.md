**Stein Stromme** was a Norwegian mathematician best known for his work in algebraic geometry

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Sigmund Elling Stromme was a publisher spending most of his career with J W Cappelen Publishing, one of the oldest publishing houses of Norway founded in 1829.
* Stein's mother, Inger Johanne Stromme, was a school teacher.
* Stein Arild Stromme studied at the Oslo katedralskole (the Oslo Cathedral School).
* At this school, Stromme studied Norwegian, mathematics, physics, history, English, and physical education.
* degree, Stromme was appointed as a Research associate at the University of Oslo and there he worked towards his Dr. philos.
* In fact, more than half of Stromme's research papers were written jointly with Geir Ellingsrud (born 29 November 1948) who, as we just mentioned, was his brother-in-law.
* Stromme's next four papers were all single authored: Deforming vector bundles on the projective plane (1983), A note on tau-constant families of plane curves (1984), Ample divisors on fine moduli spaces on the projective plane (1984), and Families of rational plane curves (1984).
* degree, Stromme was appointed as a Senior lecturer at the University of Bergen in 1983.
* Stein Arild created the balanced and strong research institute that we have today.
* Stein Arild managed the feat of renewing the department while still remaining friends with his colleagues.
* Stein Arild was a man of quiet manner.
* Stromme was an organiser of many conferences held at the Sophus Lie Centre.
* Stromme was an organiser of many of the Summer Schools: Deformation theory (1996); Representation theory for Lie-algebras (1997); Reflection groups (1998); Initial ideals (1999); Elliptic curves, finite fields and cryptography (2000); Motivic Homotopy theory (2002); Algebraic Combinatorics (2003); Modular forms (2004); Representation theory for finite groups (2005); and Algebraic statistics, tropical geometry and computational biology (2006).
* In 1988 Stromme received an award for excellence in research from the Norges almenvitenskapelige forskningsrad (NAVF), the Norwegian research council that funds the natural sciences.
* This award gave Stromme funds which he administered jointly with Geir Ellingsrud and Christian Peskine.
* In the same year as he received the award, Stromme's second son was born.
* His second wife was Leikny and their son Torstein Jarl was born in 1988.

Born 12 March 1951, Oslo, Norway. Died 31 January 2014, Lambertseter, Norway.
