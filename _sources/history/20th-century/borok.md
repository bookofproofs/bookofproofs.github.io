**Valentina Borok** was a Ukranian mathematician who worked in partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* From that time on, Valentina fully shared the hardships of the majority of the population of Ukraine, including the very difficult years of evacuation during World War II.
* In 1949, on the advice of her high school teachers, Valentina decided to study mathematics and was admitted as a mathematics student to Kiev State University.
* In her second year of undergraduate studies, Valentina (along with Yakov) started research under the supervision of Georgii Shilov, and quickly established herself as a serious scientist.
* In 1954, Valentina graduated from Kiev University and moved (following G E Shilov) to the graduate school at Moscow State University, where she received a PhD in 1957 for a thesis On Systems of Linear Partial Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients.
* From 1960 to 1994 Valentina Borok worked at Kharkov State University.
* In the early 1960s Valentina worked on fundamental solutions and stability for partial differential equations well-posed in the sense of Petrovskii.
* Valentina's work during that time was mostly joint with Yakov Zhitomirskii.
* Starting in the late 1960s, Valentina began a series of papers that lay the foundations for the theory of local and non-local boundary value problems in infinite layers for systems of partial differential equations.
* In the early 1970s Valentina Borok founded a school on the general theory of partial differential equations in Kharkov.
* The work of Valentina Borok and her school on boundary value problems in layers forms an important chapter in the general theory of partial differential equations.
* During her lifetime, Valentina published some 80 papers in top Russian and Ukrainian journals.
* Valentina continued working with them informally and encouraging them to pursue their research.
* Valentina Mikhailovna was considered THE teacher of rigorous analysis in Kharkov State University.
* Valentina Borok was a brilliant lecturer and an extremely dedicated teacher to her undergraduates.
* In 1994, a grave illness forced Valentina to urgently retire and emigrate to Israel, as the necessary medical treatment was unavailable in Ukraine.

Born 9 July 1931, Kharkov, Ukraine. Died 4 February 2004, Haifa, Israel.
