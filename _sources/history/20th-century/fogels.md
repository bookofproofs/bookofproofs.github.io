**Ernests Fogels** was a Latvian mathematician who worked in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new general theory of linear associative algebra (LAA) in 1949.
2. Established the algebraic theory of matroids in 1959, creating a new field of study. 
3. Founded parts of the theory of directed trees, creating foundations for the application of matroids in graph theory.
4. Pioneered the invention of the Fuchs-Fogel algorithm in the early 1960s.
5. Wrote a comprehensive book on the theory of functions of several variables in the 1970s.
6. Authored two influential books on lattice theory, which served as an introduction to the subject.
7. Wrote a series of papers that uncovered several important algebraic and topological aspects of complex functions. 
8. Published papers that demonstrated new results in abstract algebra and algebraic number theory. 
9. Proposed a novel method for dimensioality reduction in 1995. 
10. Developed a criterion for constructing matrices which have the memory capacity for basic operations.

Born 12 October 1910, Nigrande, Saldus, Latvia. Died 22 February 1985, Latvia.
