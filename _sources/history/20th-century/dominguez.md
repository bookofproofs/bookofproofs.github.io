**Alberto González Domínguez** was a major figure in the development of mathematical sciences in Argentina. He worked on analytic functions, the theory of distributions and their application to quantum theory, the representation of functions by Fourier integrals, Laplace integrals and orthogonal series, and on probability theory.
