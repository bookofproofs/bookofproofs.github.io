**Alberto González Domínguez** was a major figure in the development of mathematical sciences in Argentina. He worked on analytic functions, the theory of distributions and their application to quantum theory, the representation of functions by Fourier integrals, Laplace integrals and orthogonal series, and on probability theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* González Domínguez attended both primary and secondary schools in Buenos Aires.
* During his studies at the University of Buenos Aires, González Domínguez had come into contact with the professor of mathematics Julio Rey Pastor who had come to Argentina from Spain in 1921 to build up mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires.
* He saw that González Domínguez, despite studying languages, had an interest and a talent for mathematics.
* With Rey Pastor's encouragement, González Domínguez began to study mathematics in the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires.
* From 1933 onwards, González Domínguez worked in the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires.
* González Domínguez and Rey Pastor were two of the twelve; González Domínguez was elected secretary of the Argentina Mathematical Union and Rey Pastor was elected Vice-President for 1936-38.
* González Domínguez continued to serve on the Board of the Union from 1938 to 1945.
* In June 1939 González Domínguez submitted his doctoral thesis Un nuevo teorema límite del cálculo de probabilidades Ⓣ(A new limit theorem for the calculus of probabilities) to the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires and was awarded the degree on 7 August.
* While he was studying at the University of Buenos Aires, González Domínguez married Matilde V de Gonzalez who had been born in Buenos Aires on 8 December 1906.
* González Domínguez had been awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship to study with Jacob Tamarkin at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, USA.
* The passenger list gives the following details for González Domínguez: age, 35, height 5 ft 7 in, complexion dark, hair colour brown, eye colour brown.
* Alberto and Matilde González Domínguez had a son Alvaro V González Domínguez born in 1943.
* At Brown University, González Domínguez worked on the Fourier integral, Hille functions and, more generally, on integral equations.
* González Domínguez made two research trips to Paris in the 1950s.
* In addition to his work at the University of Buenos Aires, González Domínguez had other appointments which increased his influence on the development of mathematics in Argentina.
* González Domínguez was a researcher at CONICET from 1961 onwards.
* Let us look at reminiscences about González Domínguez from a colleague and from a student.
* Upon my arrival to Buenos Aires, Dr Alberto González Donnínguez (1904-1982) helped and oriented me with the change.
* Dr González Domínguez would become my thesis adviser later.
* Let us look briefly at some of González Domínguez's publications.
* Many of González Domínguez's papers arose from lectures he gave at conferences.
* González Domínguez also lectured at the 'Second Symposium on some mathematical problems that are being studied in Latin America' which was held at the UNESCO Scientific Cooperation Centre for Latin America in July 1954.
* In 1964, in collaboration with Carlos Bollini and Juan Jose Giambiagi, González Domínguez wrote the paper Analytic regularization and the divergences of quantum field theories.
* González Domínguez retired in 1971 and the Revista de la Unión Matemática Argentina Ⓣ(Journal of the Argentine Mathematical Union) published the 448-page volume 25 containing papers to honour his 65th birthday.
* The creation and subsistence of the Argentine Mathematical Union and its Journal, although it has always had the encouragement of many, has been the tenacious and persevering work of a few, among whom Professor González Domínguez occupies an exceptional place.
* From any angle you look at it, Argentine Mathematics has revolved in the last fifty years around the work of Rey Pastor and his main collaborator and continuator González Domínguez.
* Nothing is born spontaneously and behind the realities achieved and the promising perspectives that are glimpsed for mathematics in the country, the solicitous and careful hand is perceived, the protective shadow of Professor González Domínguez, always present to iron out rough edges, proclaiming compromise in the relational life, firmly maintaining the seriousness and level of scientific work, putting order in value judgments and putting people and things in their place, subtle and delicate work that can only be done when you have sufficient scientific authority and an inexhaustible effective capacity to give love by the hand full and to absorb ingratitude without fainting, although not without pain.
* We have mentioned above some honours given to González Domínguez for his outstanding contributions.
* After he retired from the University of Buenos Aires, González Domínguez took on other roles.
* In short, González Domínguez was a wise man and a good man who dedicated his life to doing science and promoting the development of mathematics in Argentina.

Born 11 April 1904, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Died 14 September 1982, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
