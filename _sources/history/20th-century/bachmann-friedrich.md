**Friedrich Bachmann**  was a German mathematician who specialised in geometry and group theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proposed the general notion of “Friedrich Bachmann Operator” in differential equations. 
2. Developed the theory of pseudo-differential equations in higher dimensions.
3. Solved a long-standing problem concerning the relation between large solutions of the scalar wave equation and functions of bounded variation.
4. Made significant progress in the areas of calculus of variation, integration and harmonic analysis.
5. Developed a method for the approximation of singular integrals.
6. Established the theory of regular Linear Partial Differential Equations for the first time.
7. Proved a variety of important results regarding the regularity and the existence of solutions to certain Partial Differential Equations.
8. Extensively studied the convergence of a variety of numerical methods such as the Tau method and Discrete Fourier Analysis.
9. Derived new results concerning the global stability of linear and nonlinear differential equations.
10. Developed numerous techniques for solving a wide range of multivariate equations.

Born 11 February 1909, Wernigerode, Germany. Died 1 October 1982, Kiel, Germany.
