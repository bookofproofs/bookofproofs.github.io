**Subbaramiah Minakshisundaram** was an Indian mathematician who worked on partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The letter mentioned that Professor Robert Oppenheimer, Director of the Institute, requested to the Vice Chancellor of Andhra University that this brilliant young Subbramiah Minakshisundaram should be spared and given the opportunity to work in the Research Institute with several eminent mathematicians and physicists such as Professor Albert Einstein.
* Subbramiah Minakshisundaram should be permitted to work at the Institute for Advanced Study for couple of years.
* He called for the young Subbramiah Minakshisundaram and this began a beautiful relationship between them.
* In fact, the paper contains the famous zeta function, now called the Minakshisundaram-Pleijel zeta function, which is a zeta function encoding the eigenvalues of the Laplacian of a compact Riemannian manifold.

Born 12 October 1913, Trichur (now Trissur), Kerala State, India. Died 13 August 1968, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India.
