**Subbaramiah Minakshisundaram** was an Indian mathematician who worked on partial differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Subbaramiah Minakshisundaram developed an integral form to solve the Riemann-Stieltjes problem for multiple integrals.
2. He also established bounds in the theory of differential forms and improved upon Veblen’s existence theorem.
3. He introduced the Minakshisundaram-Van der Waerden zeta-function, which is used to study properties of an extremal Riemann surface.
4. He also proved a theorem on the behavior of harmonic functions, now known as the Minakshisundaram-Pleijel theorem.
5. He also worked on the theory of gamma functions, determining exact values for certain integrals involving the sine and cosine functions.
6. He also calculated several volumetric integrals, including the volume of a unit sphere.
7. He also published a paper on the use of probability distributions in mathematical statistics.

Born 12 October 1913, Trichur (now Trissur), Kerala State, India. Died 13 August 1968, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India.
