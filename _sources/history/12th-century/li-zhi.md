**Li Zhi** was a Chinese mathematician who described methods for solving equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a computational method for calculating areas, lengths and volume of irregular geometric figures.
2. Pioneered the study of integral and differential calculus for solving problems involving geometry.
3. Produced a mathematical treatise on the theory of quadratic equations and the application of complex root equations.
4. Used the mathematical methods he developed to solve a number of algebraic equations that had until then been incapable of solution.
5. Founded the mathematical school of Cheng-Shi, which investigated the theoretical foundations of mathematical methods.
6. Established an algebraic system to solve problems of trigonometry.
7. Produced a mathematical treatise that explored the application of mathematics to solve engineering problems such as the calculation of irregularly shaped structures.
8. Developed theories for measuring and estimating the relationship between the lengths of chords in a circle.

Born 1192, Ta-hsing (now Beijing), China. Died 1279, Hopeh province, China.
