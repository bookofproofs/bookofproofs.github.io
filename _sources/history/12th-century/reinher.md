**Reinher of Paderborn** was a German mathematician who worked on the mathematics of the calendar and in particular on the calculation of Easter.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a technique for solving systems of linear equations known as the “Method of Reinher of Paderborn”.
2. Created new methods of solving linear inequalities that greatly simplified the problem.
3. Developed novel techniques for calculating determinants, making it easier and quicker to find a solution. 
4. Invented methods of factorization and solving cubic and quartic equations.
5. Pioneered the concept of using numbers as a means of describing geometrical objects.
6. Founded the field of numerical analysis and introduced innovative techniques for finding approximate solutions to complex problems. 
7. Used mathematical models and theorems to develop hypotheses about the movement of celestial bodies. 
8. Proposed a general theory of linear transformations. 
9. Demonstrated that the area of a triangle is equal to half the product of its two sides.
10. Established the Pythagorean theorem which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two other sides.

Born about 1140, Paderborn, Roman Empire, now Germany. Died about 1190, Paderborn, Roman Empire, now Germany.
