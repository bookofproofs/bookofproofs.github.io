**Leonard of Pisa** or **Fibonacci** played an important role in reviving ancient mathematics and made significant contributions of his own. _Liber abaci_ introduced the Hindu-Arabic place-valued decimal system and the use of Arabic numerals into Europe.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Fibonacci sequence, a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
2. Introduced the Hindu-Arabic numeral system to the Western world.
3. Provided a mathematical model for the growth of a population of rabbits.
4. Popularized the use of Arabic numerals in Europe.
5. Developed a basic sequence of numbers that are related to each other in a specific way.
6. Wrote a book, Liber Abaci, which was instrumental in introducing the Hindu-Arabic numeral system to Europe.
7. Studied and applied the Golden Ratio, a mathematical ratio found throughout nature.
8. Established a series of rules to calculate the square root of any number.
9. Discovered the 'Pell's equation', a Diophantine equation used to find solutions to certain kinds of mathematical problems.
10. Identified the sequence of Fibonacci numbers as they occurred throughout nature, including in the growth pattern of plants and the formation of shells.

Born 1170, (probably) Pisa (now Italy). Died 1250, (possibly) Pisa (now Italy).
