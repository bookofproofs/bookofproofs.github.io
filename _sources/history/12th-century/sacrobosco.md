**John of Holywood** or **Johannes de Sacrobosco** was an English scholar who wrote an important text on astronomy and promoted Arabic methods of arithmetic and algebra.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote "De Arte Numerandi," which is regarded as the first comprehensive European text used to explain Hindu-Arabic numerals and their operations in the 13th century.
2. Developed the concept of zero, introducing the continuation of counting by adding a placeholder in calculations.
3. Published "Tractatus de Sphaera," a work about astronomy and the mechanics of the universe which was a significant contribution to the 14th century literacy of the subject.
4. Authored "De Algorismo," a treatise on arithmetic, dealing mainly with fractions and ratio theory.
5. Advanced the concept of mean proportion in mathematics, introducing the "arithmetic mean."
6. Helped create a system of positional notation, a numbering system based on place values for the representation of numbers.
7. Wrote "Algoritmi de Numero Indorum," a work which taught how to use positional notation, introducing Arabic numerals and basic arithmetic computation to Europe.

Born about 1195, (possibly) Halifax, Yorkshire, England. Died 1256, Paris, France.
