**Jabir ibn Aflah** or **Geber** was an Spanish Islamic mathematician whose works were translated into Latin and so became available to European mathematicians.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theorem relating the lengths of the sides of a cyclic quadrilateral to its opposite angles.
2. Developed the concept of a mean speed theorem.
3. Developed the decimal system of numbers and the operation of division.
4. Was the first to use algebraic operations on both positive and negative numbers.
5. Developed the concept of mu`adad into the Hindu-Arabic numerals.
6. Developed a method for solving second-order algebraic equations.
7. Developed theorems on determining the centers of gravity of various plane and solid figures.
8. Developed the notion of a geometric progression.
9. Was the first to use 'proofs by contradiction' in geometry.
10. Developed methods for finding the area of a triangle and a trapezoid by computing the parameters of their bases.

Born about 1100, possibly Seville (now Spain). Died about 1160.
