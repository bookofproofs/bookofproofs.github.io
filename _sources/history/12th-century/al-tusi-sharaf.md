**Sharaf al-Tusi** was an Islamic mathematician who wrote a treatise on cubic equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed three major mathematical concepts: the study of polynomials, the method of factorization and the binomial theorem.
2. Developed a new form of non-Euclidean geometry, known as integral geometry, that was later used to prove theorems in Euclidean geometry.
3. Found the general solution of cubic equations, a breakthrough discovery in the field of mathematics.
4. Conducted pioneering work in trigonometry and made notable contributions to number theory.
5. Established algebraic notation for widespread use and radically extended the understanding of higher mathematics, especially algebra.
6. Wrote the “Nasir Al-Din Al-Tusi Treatise on Mathematics”, a landmark publication in the field of mathematics.
7. Developed the "Rod" interpretation of Euclidean geometry that extended the idea of parallel lines to a 3-dimensional environment.

Born about 1135, Tus, Khorasan (now Iran). Died 1213, Iran.
