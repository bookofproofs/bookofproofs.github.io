**Al-Samawal** was an Islamic mathematician who was able to extend the arithmetic operations to handle polynomials. He used an early form of induction.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote a treatise on the theory of equations, known as “Al-Fakhri”. 
2. Developed a new way of solving quadratic equations by completing the squares.
3. Developed rules to determine when a quartic equation is solvable by radicals.
4. Developed the basic properties of ratios and proportions, which was later used by philosophers like Euclid and others.
5. Provided geometric means between two given numbers.
6. Introduced the concepts of the negation of a number and the sum of infinitely many numbers.
7. Gave an improved version of Euclid’s proof of the Pythagorean theorem.
8. Developed an important method for determining the area of a triangle.
9. Provided the first known approximate value for pi.

Born about 1130, Baghdad, Iraq. Died about 1180, Maragha, Iran.
