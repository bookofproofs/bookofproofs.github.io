**Gherard of Cremona** was an Italian mathematician who worked in Spain and translated mathematical works from Arabic into Latin.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* For this reason Gherard went to Toledo in Spain where his intention was to learn Arabic so he could read Ptolemy's Almagest Ⓣ(The major thesis: from the Arabic 'al-majisti' -- the Arabic translation of the Greek 'Mathematike Syntaxis' later translated into Latin as 'Magna Syntaxis') since no Latin translations existed at that time.
* Although we do not have detailed information of the date when Gherard went to Spain, he was certainly there by 1144.
* In all over a period of forty years, Gherard translated around eighty works from Arabic to Latin.
* In addition, of course, Gherard translated the Almagest but there is a slight puzzle over this.
* We know that Gherard went to Toledo with the intention of translating the Almagest Ⓣ(The major thesis: from the Arabic 'al-majisti' -- the Arabic translation of the Greek 'Mathematike Syntaxis' later translated into Latin as 'Magna Syntaxis'), and it seems beyond belief that such a prolific translator would have waited until he was sixty-one years old before completing what he considered his most important task.
* It seems hard to believe that, given the size of the task that he undertook, Gherard would have had much time for anything other than translating.
* One of the decisions made by Gherard in his translating was to render the Arabic word for sine into the Latin sinus, from where our sine function comes.
* It is interesting to realise that had Gherard made a different decision in his translation, this function, which is well-known to all who have made even a brief study of mathematics, would be known by a different name today.

Born 1114, Cremona (now Italy). Died 1187, Toledo, Castile (now Spain).
