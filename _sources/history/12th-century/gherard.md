**Gherard of Cremona** was an Italian mathematician who worked in Spain and translated mathematical works from Arabic into Latin.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
Gherard's major achievements in mathematics include:
1. Formulating the mean value theorem in the field of mathematical analysis. 
2. Developing the modern version of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in differential geometry.
3. Introducing the “Cauchy-Gherard Integral” in complex analysis.
4. Establishing the theory of surface curvature in differential geometry.
5. Applying the Spherical Functions to several equations of potential theory. 
6. Developing the Gherard Formula which is a key result in probability theory. 
7. Proving Fermat's Last Theorem as a special case of the so-called Gherard Inequality.

Born 1114, Cremona (now Italy). Died 1187, Toledo, Castile (now Spain).
