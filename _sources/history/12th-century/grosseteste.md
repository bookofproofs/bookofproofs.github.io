2. Developed the 'grand synthesis' of learning, integrating knowledge from many different disciplines. 
3. Applied mathematics, such as Euclidean geometry and numerology, to the study of theology and philosophy. 
4. Developed theories of the laws of nature, including optics, mechanics, and planetary motion. 
5. Credited with first providing a scientific explanation for the rainbow illusion.
6. Discovered ancient and new mathematical studies and significantly expanded knowledge of mathematics in Europe. 
7. Proposed the use of mathematics to understand the physical universe, an area known today as natural philosophy or physics.
