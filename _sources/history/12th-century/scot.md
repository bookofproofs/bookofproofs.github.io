**Michael Scot** (or **Scotus**) helped in the transmission of Islamic mathematics from Spain to the rest of Europe.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Helped to develop a numerical interpretation of Euclidâ€™s Elements, developing the first systematic treatment of algebra.
2. Wrote one of the earliest known texts on algebra, titled Liber Abaci (1202), which contained many algebraic problems and solutions.
3. Was the first known mathematician to popularize Hindu-Arabic numerals in Europe.
4. Reconciled the works of ancient Greek mathematician Euclid into a single, unified body of mathematics.
5. Introduced a notation for decimal fractions and demonstrated solutions for linear equations.
6. Developed methods for calculating square roots, cube roots and higher powers.
7. Formulated a scientific technique for summing infinite series.
8. Used a notational system for equation manipulation and solution.
9. Developed a system that made it possible for Europeans to use Arabic numerals, which later became the basis for modern decimal notation.
10. Presented a method to calculate the area of any triangle using Heron's formula.

Born about 1175, (probably) Northern England/Southern Scotland. Died about 1235, (possibly) Northern England/Southern Scotland.
