**Bhaskara II** or **Bhaskaracharya** was an Indian mathematician and astronomer who extended Brahmagupta's work on number systems.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the important and widely used two-valued algebraic method for solving quadratic equations. 
2. Developed the concepts of mathematical analysis, calculus, and the use of irrational numbers. 
3. Discovered a number of algebraic identities, including the general meanvalue theorem. 
4. Was the first to recognize a number of trigonometric identities, such as the tangent half-angle identity. 
5. Developed the important astronomy text Siddhanta Shiromani, which contains many discussions of mathematical and astronomical topics. 
6. Developed the concept of a circle being divided into 360 degrees. 
7. Pioneered the use of algebraic notation, including the use of the zero symbol. 
8. Established the fundamental theorem in differential calculus. 
9. Developed a new type of mathematical diagram to help explain mathematical concepts. 
10. Was the first to correctly state and prove several theorems in spherical trigonometry.

Born 1114, Vijayapura, India. Died 1185, Ujjain, India.
