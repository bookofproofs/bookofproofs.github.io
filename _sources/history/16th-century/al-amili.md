**Al Amili** was a Lebanese-born mathematician who wrote influential works on arithmetic, astronomy and grammar.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote numerous treatises on mathematics and astronomy, including Al-Muntakhab, considered to be the most important work in the Islamic tradition on trigonometry and astronomy.
2. Established many important geometrical theorems and developed a new method for the extraction of roots.
3. Made significant contributions to the development of spherical trigonometry, the sine theorem and the law of sines.
4. Developed a new system of astrolabe construction that set the standard in astrolabe design for generations to come.
5. Developed a useful tabular method for computing sines with trigonometric tables, which was adopted by succeeding generations of astronomers.
6. Pioneered the development of a form of algebraic equation known as "the Baha'al-Din equation."
7. Developed methods of determining longitudes that were adopted and developed by succeeding generations of mathematicians.
8. Established seven geometrical theorems about circles, that set the basis for modern cartography and underpinned the development of European navigational mathematics.

Born 27 February 1547, Baalbek, now in Lebanon. Died 30 August 1621, Isfahan, Iran.
