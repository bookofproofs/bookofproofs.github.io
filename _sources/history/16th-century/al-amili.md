**Al Amili** was a Lebanese-born mathematician who wrote influential works on arithmetic, astronomy and grammar.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* the Shiite scholar Husayn ibn 'Abd al-Samad al-Amili wrote an eloquent letter-cum-travel account describing his experiences to his teacher Zayn al-Din al-Amili who had remained in Jabal 'Amil.
* As well as living in Herat, al-Amili also spent much time in Isfahan, now in Iran.
* At this time al-Amili was in Qazvin, the Safavid capital, both studying and teaching there.
* Al-Amili was still Shaykh al-Islam in Isfahan which then became the capital.
* When al-Amili was Shaykh al-Islam in Isfahan he travelled regularly with the royal court which was based in Qazvin.
* Let us return to the period when al-Amili was in Qazvin.
* In playing such an important role in ending what was a civil war, al-Amili was in high favour with Shah Abbas.
* Shah Abbas asked Sayyid Husayn al-Karaki and al-Amili to help him with this problem and they were able to show that Khan Ahmad Gilani's oath was not valid under Shi'ite law so the marriage could go ahead.
* Al-Amili was an expert on a wide range of subjects such as theology, philosophy, law, and mathematics.
* Among al-Amili's works on grammar we mention: The Secrets of Eloquence; All Eternal Directives respecting the Science of Arabic Grammar; and The Elevated Words, also an Arabic grammar.
* Al-Amili had several students, the most famous being Molla Sadra who became the pre-eminent philosopher of Shi'ite Islam.
* An interesting discovery was made comparatively recently in Isfahan when the house in which al-Amili lived was identified.

Born 27 February 1547, Baalbek, now in Lebanon. Died 30 August 1621, Isfahan, Iran.
