**Al Amili** was a Lebanese-born mathematician who wrote influential works on arithmetic, astronomy and grammar.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father, Shaykh Husayn ibn 'Abd al-Samad al-Amili, was a Shi'ite theologian who played a major role in his son's religious education.
* the Shiite scholar Husayn ibn 'Abd al-Samad al-Amili wrote an eloquent letter-cum-travel account describing his experiences to his teacher Zayn al-Din al-Amili who had remained in Jabal 'Amil.
* As well as living in Herat, al-Amili also spent much time in Isfahan, now in Iran.
* At this time al-Amili was in Qazvin, the Safavid capital, both studying and teaching there.
* He was allowed to go but his son Baha al-Din al-Amili was not given permission so remained in Qazvin when his father left Herat later in 1575.
* His father died in 1576 but al-Amili did not replace him as Shaykh al-Islam in Herat (as some historians have claimed).
* Al-Amili's younger brother Abd al-Samad took over from his father while al-Amili became Shaykh al-Islam in Isfahan where he replaced his father-in-law Shaykh Ali al-Minshar who died in 1576.
* Al-Amili was still Shaykh al-Islam in Isfahan which then became the capital.
* When al-Amili was Shaykh al-Islam in Isfahan he travelled regularly with the royal court which was based in Qazvin.
* Let us return to the period when al-Amili was in Qazvin.
* In playing such an important role in ending what was a civil war, al-Amili was in high favour with Shah Abbas.
* Shah Abbas asked Sayyid Husayn al-Karaki and al-Amili to help him with this problem and they were able to show that Khan Ahmad Gilani's oath was not valid under Shi'ite law so the marriage could go ahead.
* We know that al-Amili moved frequently between the major cities of the Empire, for example in late 1594 he was in Qazvin, in February 1595 he was in Baghdad where he visited the shrine of the Kazimayn, but by June of that year he was back in Qazvin where he attended banquets Shah Abbas put on for scholars and students of religion as part of Ramadan.
* Al-Amili was an expert on a wide range of subjects such as theology, philosophy, law, and mathematics.
* Among al-Amili's works on grammar we mention: The Secrets of Eloquence; All Eternal Directives respecting the Science of Arabic Grammar; and The Elevated Words, also an Arabic grammar.
* Al-Amili had several students, the most famous being Molla Sadra who became the pre-eminent philosopher of Shi'ite Islam.
* An interesting discovery was made comparatively recently in Isfahan when the house in which al-Amili lived was identified.

Born 27 February 1547, Baalbek, now in Lebanon. Died 30 August 1621, Isfahan, Iran.
