2. He developed China’s first Euclidean style map of the world.
3. He additionally studied and mapped the stars and constellations, introducing knowledge of the solar system to China.
4. He devised symbolization methods to help Chinese people better understand European mathematics.
5. He constructed several mathematical methods to determine longitude.
6. He established an international law of trade, proclaiming any country that had not established a system of trade with China had to pay double the amount of goods they purchased.
7. He developed a system of weights and measures, the Chinese “Ricci Scale."
