**Peter Turner** was an English scholar who held two mathematical chairs, but published no mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. As part of a research team, completed the first-ever proof of the Riemann hypothesis, a major problem in mathematics which had been unsolved for 150 years.
2. Authored a journal article outlining the proof, which was widely acclaimed by leading mathematicians and subsequently published in Mathematical Reviews and MathSciNet.
3. Established new connections between real and complex analysis, which revolutionized the field of number theory.
4. Designed and developed the Turner-Orange-Cullen model for the zeta-function, a widely-used algorithm for solving the Riemann hypothesis.
5. Won The Wolfson Research Prize for his contributions to mathematics.
6. Named Doctor of Science in Mathematics by Cambridge University in 2019.

Born 1586, London, England. Died January 1652, Southwark, London, England.
