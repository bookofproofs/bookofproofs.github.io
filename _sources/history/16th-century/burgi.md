**Jost B端rgi** was a Swiss mathematician who discovered logarithms independently of the Scottish mathematician Napier.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Invented a trigonometrical device called Proportional Compass to aid navigation.
2. Discovered the addition and multiplication rules for logarithms and discovered how to use a logarithmic table for calculations.
3. Developed a method for constructing sundials.
4. Developed techniques for solving cubic equations using logarithms.
5. Published Joyful Proportion, which was a comprehensive treatise on mathematical discoveries made in the 16th century including trigonometry and logarithms.
6. Wrote a comprehensive book on calculations that contained numerous tables to assist with calculations.
7. Developed the logarithmic scale to measure angles.
8. Discovered an improved method for calculating sines and tangents.
9. Generated a logarithmic table for a base of 2, which was used for over a century.
10. Published the first multiplication table with ten digits, which was the predecessor of the modern decimal system.

Born 28 February 1552, Lichtensteig, St Gallen, Switzerland. Died 31 January 1632, Kassel, Hesse-Kassel (now Germany).
