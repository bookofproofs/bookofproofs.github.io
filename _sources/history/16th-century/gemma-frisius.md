**Regnier Gemma Frisius** was a Dutch mathematician who applied his mathematical expertise to geography, astronomy and map making. He became the leading theoretical mathematician in the Low Countries.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He invented the triangulation method of surveying land.
2. He was the first to expound the use of triangulation to measure the distance between two points.
3. He developed the use of cross-staff, astrolabe and pendulum to measure distance and altitude.
4. He also used the triangulation to map out the northern part of Europe.
5. He calculated the size of the Earth and developed a method for determining longitude.
6. He proposed and illustrated the principle of hydrostatic balance.
7. He also invented the universal and substantially adjusted the magnetic needle compass.

Born 8 December 1508, Dokkum, Friesland, The Netherlands. Died 25 May1555, Louvain, Brabant (now Belgium).
