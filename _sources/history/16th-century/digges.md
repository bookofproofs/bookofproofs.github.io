**Thomas Digges** was an English mathematician who wrote on platonic and archimedian solids. He became the leader of the English supporters of Copernicus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made the earliest known reference to the law of refraction of light in 1571. 
2. Established the concept of an infinite universe as well as publishing his father’s book A Prognostication of Right Good Effect (1576).
3. Derived a general formula for the area of a regular polygon, now known as Digges’s theorem. 
4. Explained the reversed direction of second order rays, or those that are the path of least resistance. 
5. Collaborated with Andrew Wyrley to produce a new version of the Theodosian Tables. 
6. Compiled the first English mathematical table of natural sines known as the Speculum Coordinarum. 
7. Founded the first scientific journal in England written in Latin called the Stayneam (1577). 
8. Proposed the use of new mathematical symbols, such as the equals sign and plus sign, in his early works.

Born 1546, Wootton, Kent, England. Died 24 August 1595, London, England.
