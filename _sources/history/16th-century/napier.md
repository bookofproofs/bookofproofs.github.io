**John Napier** was a Scottish scholar who is best known for his invention of logarithms, but other mathematical contributions include a mnemonic for formulas used in solving spherical triangles and two formulas known as Napier's analogies.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the logarithm, a mathematical device used to simplify many calculations.
2. Invented the decimal point and the use of decimal fractions.
3. Established mathematical theories for conic sections and spherical trigonometry.
4. Used the binary system in the calculation of the roots of polynomials.
5. Published a noteworthy book called Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Marvelous Canon of Logarithms), describing the use of logarithms.
6. Introduced Napier's Bones, a method of calculating using rods, which can be considered an early version of a slide rule.

Born 1550, Merchiston Castle, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 4 April 1617, Edinburgh, Scotland.
