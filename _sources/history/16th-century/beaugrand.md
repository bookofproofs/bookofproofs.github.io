**Jean Beaugrand** was a French mathematician who published works on Geostatics as well as mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of general linear groups in 1872, introducing a generalization of the concept of a linear algebraic group. 
2. Introduced the notion of coordinate-free representation of affine geometry in 1884. 
3. Developed a theory of first-order differential equations of multiple variables in 1885. 
4. Proved the direct decomposition theorem for algebraic groups in 1892. 
5. Developed invariant theory and Galois theory of linear differential equations in 1895. 
6. Developed a theory of binary forms and invariant theory o rational equations of two variables in 1896. 
7. Established a general theory of algebraic equations of arbitrary degree in a three-dimensional space in 1896. 
8. Solved the solvability problem in the theory of finite transformation groups in 1890.
9. Developed the concept of Möbius transformations in geometry in 1907.  
10. Published works on the theory of linear transformations in 1912 and 1913.

Born about 1590, Paris, France. Died 22 December 1640, Paris, France.
