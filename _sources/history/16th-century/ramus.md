**Peter Ramus** was a French mathematician who wrote a whole series of textbooks on logic and rhetoric, grammar, mathematics, astronomy and optics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a logical system of instruction and pedagogy based on the progressive ordering of subject matter and mastery of content. 
2. Developed a method of analyzing argument and rhetoric by breaking down arguments into specific categories and analyzing them as individual components. 
3. Developed a scientific method for organizing information and knowledge which was based on the categorization of knowledge into trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). 
4. Proposed a new organization of logical categories by adapting Aristotle's categories of logic into a tree-structured hierarchy. 
5. Published a book, "Dialogues of Pierre de la Ram√©e", which was the first time European university students were presented with logical questions and their answers so they could test their deductive reasoning skills. 
6. Developed the concept of syllogism, a three-proposition argument in which the proposition in the middle (the major premise) is supported by the two outside propositions (the minor premises).

Born 1515, Cuts (near Noyon), Vermandois, France. Died 26 August 1572, Paris, France.
