**Peter Ramus** was a French mathematician who wrote a whole series of textbooks on logic and rhetoric, grammar, mathematics, astronomy and optics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Peter Ramus's father Jacques de la Ramée was a labourer and his mother was Jeanne Charpentier.
* Ramus was educated at home until, in 1527 at the age of twelve years, he entered the Collège de Navarre in Paris.
* After this Ramus taught, first at the Collège de Mans, then at the Collège de l'Ave Maria.
* It was mathematics and the plague which came to Ramus's rescue.
* Mathematics since when he was forbidden to teach and publish philosophy he turned to mathematics, and the plague for it created staff shortages which resulted in Ramus being reinstated as a teacher.
* Not only was Ramus back as a teacher, but he also returned to publishing texts.
* In 1562 Ramus, whose teaching were becoming more involved with political and religious issues, abandoned the Catholic Church and became a convert to Calvinism.
* Other changes which Ramus proposed was the abolition of student fees (which 450 years later is again a topic of vigorous debate in Britain!).
* Near the end of 1562, Ramus was forced to flee Paris for fear of his life as the Calvinists were ordered out of the city.
* It granted certain rights of conscience to the Huguenots and Ramus saw it as sufficient to allow him to return to Paris.
* For a while he tried to keep a low profile but when one of his opponents was appointed to the Regius Chair of Mathematics, Ramus opposed the appointment, but lost.
* With tensions rising again in the religious wars, Ramus fled Paris for a second time in 1567.
* Ramus returned briefly to Paris, found his library destroyed, and requested permission from the King to visit Germany.
* This Ramus did from 1568 to 1570, but in that year another treaty, the Peace of Saint-Germain, was signed in August.
* Feeling that it was again safe to return to Paris, Ramus gained the promise of protection from the King although he was again banned from teaching.
* They were massacred on the eve of the feast St Bartholomew and, despite his royal protection, Ramus was murdered by hired assassins.
* The changes which Ramus proposed to the Arts courses taught at universities at that time was a return to the seven classical liberal arts, but with the syllabus more based on applied topics.
* Using this approach Ramus worked on many topics and wrote a whole series of textbooks on logic and rhetoric, grammar, mathematics, astronomy, and optics.
* It is reasonable to ask how important Ramus is for mathematics.
* Ramus believed that learning in mathematics had declined, and this was due in large part to Plato because of his refusal to consider applications of mathematics.
* Having identified the problems, Ramus aimed to improve mathematical instruction.
* Rigorous proof was of little importance to Ramus who preferred a "natural method".
* One of the topics which Ramus believed that mathematics should be applied to was astronomy.

Born 1515, Cuts (near Noyon), Vermandois, France. Died 26 August 1572, Paris, France.
