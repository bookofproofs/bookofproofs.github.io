**Henry Briggs** was was an English mathematician who published tables of Napier's logarithm and was the man most responsible for scientists' acceptance of logarithms.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the world's first known conversion table from decimal to exponential notation, thus allowing for easier calculation and manipulation of logarithms.
2. Published the influential and widely-used mathematical work ‘Arithmetica Logarithmica’ in 1624.
3. His mathematical interests were varied and diverse, covering topics such as astronomy, navigation, geometry and the teaching of mathematics.
4. Developed the concept of common logarithms, becoming the basis for modern mathematics and scientific calculation.
5. Instrumental in the development of the first complete and accurate logarithm tables in the early 1600s.
6. Developed techniques for calculating and using logarithms to great effect, enabling easier and faster mathematical calculations.
7. Structured arithmetic and algebra around the use of logarithms, making mathematics more accessible and understandable to students.
8. Collaborated with and influenced the works of fellow mathematicians John Napier, Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton.

Born February 1561, Warleywood, Yorkshire, England. Died 26 January 1630, Oxford, England.
