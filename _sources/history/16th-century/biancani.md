**Giuseppe Biancani** was an Italian Jesuit astronomer and mathematician who made observations of the moon and planets with the newly invented telescope.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new method of gearing and compiled mathematics texts in 1619, which led to a better understanding of planetary motion.
2. Published an work on planetary motion in 1621 and another work on mechanics in 1623.
3. Proved that the path of a comet is an ellipse and continued working on accelerated motion.
4. Established the link between algebra and geometry, which is known as the Biancani theorem in his honour.
5. Was referred to Galileo Galilei as the "Father of all Mechanics" thanks to his achievements.
6. Made important contributions to the field of mathematics, particularly in geometry, astronomy and trigonometry.

Born 8 March 1566, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy). Died 7 June 1624, Parma, Duchy of Parma and Piacenza (now Italy).
