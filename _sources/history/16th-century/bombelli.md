**Rafael Bombelli** was an Italian mathematician who wrote an influential algebra text and made free use of both negative numbers and complex numbers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Bombelli is credited with introducing ‘imaginary and complex numbers’ into mathematics.
2. He was the first person to manipulate algebraic equations with complex numbers, which enabled him to solve cubic equations.
3. He wrote the book L'Algebra, published in 1572, which treated the resolution of polynomial equations with complex numbers.
4. He was the first to state the binomial theorem for complex exponents and its direct generalization, the multinomial theorem.
5. He also used hyperbolas and logarithms to solve equations.
6. He proved the impossibility of solving some cubic equations.
7. He contributed to the development of mathematical notation.

Born January 1526, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy). Died 1572, (probably) Rome, Papal States (now Italy).
