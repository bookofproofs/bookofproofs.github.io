**Michael Mästlin** was a German astronomer who was Kepler's teacher and who publicised the Copernican system.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. First to calculate a good approximation for the orbit of the planet Jupiter.
2. Developed an efficient method for calculating the precession of the Earth’s axis.
3. Calculated and tabulated the positions of the planets for future years to a great degree of accuracy.
4. Explained the three-body problem of planetary motion, which had been first posed by Isaac Newton.
5. Developed a new way of calculating logarithms and published the first table of logarithms.
6. Served as a mentor to Johannes Kepler, as well as encouraged his astronomical research.
7. Pioneered the understanding and use of polar coordinates.
8. Investigated the light paths of mirrors.
9. Discovered that the Moon's orbit and the fixed stars are all subject to precession. 
10. Authored the first comprehensive treatise on astrology.

Born 30 September 1550, Göppingen, Baden-Würtemberg, Germany. Died 30 October 1631, Tübingen, Baden-Würtemberg, Germany.
