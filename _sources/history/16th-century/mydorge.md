**Claude Mydorge** was a French geometer who published books on optics and conic sections.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Mydorge studied geometry and physics.
* Mydorge's work simplifies many of Apollonius's proofs.
* Mydorge's book Examen du livre des récréations mathématiques Ⓣ(Examining the mathematical recreation book) was published in 1630 and many later books, such as one by Denis Henrion Les Récréations mathématiques avec l'examen de ses problèmes en arithmétique, géométrie, mécanique, cosmographie, optique, catoptrique ...
* Mydorge left an unpublished manuscript Traité de géométrie Ⓣ(Treatise on geometry) of over 1000 geometric problems and their solutions.
* However Mydorge does not state that the construction is only an approximation.
* It was not only mathematical problems which interested Mydorge.
* One of Mydorge's most famous results was an extremely accurate measurement of the latitude of Paris.

Born 1585, Paris, France. Died July 1647, Paris, France.
