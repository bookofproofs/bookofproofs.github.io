**Claude Mydorge** was a French geometer who published books on optics and conic sections.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. One of his most notable achievements was the development of a method of finding solutions to cubic equations.
2. He further extended this technique to quartic equations by introducing a mysterious numerical factor called the “regula falsi”.
3. He also published a ground-breaking paper on trigonometry, which included the approximation of the sine function and the introduction of the concept of the logarithmic spiral.
4. Mydorge developed a novel approach to the theory of numbers, and he was the first to introduce the idea of prime numbers in higher degree forms. 
5. Mydorge is also widely recognized for his knowledge of probability theory, involving the Binomial Theorem, and for the discovery of several theorems.
6. He was the first to provide solutions to certain quartic equations, and his theories laid the groundwork for the later discovery of the Descartes' theorem of algebraic equations.

Born 1585, Paris, France. Died July 1647, Paris, France.
