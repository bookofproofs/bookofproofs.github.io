**Claude Mydorge** was a French geometer who published books on optics and conic sections.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His father Jean Mydorge was a councillor in the Parlement in Paris and a judge in the Grande Chambre.
* This position was an ideal one for Mydorge for it was a high ranking important position, and therefore a worthy one for a member of a leading French family, yet it had light duties which meant that Mydorge could devote a large amount of his time to the subject he loved, namely mathematics.
* Mydorge studied geometry and physics.
* It seems that two English friends of the Mydorge family, William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle, and Thomas Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, took it to England, where apparently it disappeared.
* Mydorge's work simplifies many of Apollonius's proofs.
* Mydorge left an unpublished manuscript Traité de géométrie Ⓣ(Treatise on geometry) of over 1000 geometric problems and their solutions.
* However Mydorge does not state that the construction is only an approximation.
* It was not only mathematical problems which interested Mydorge.
* One of Mydorge's most famous results was an extremely accurate measurement of the latitude of Paris.

Born 1585, Paris, France. Died July 1647, Paris, France.
