**Duncan Liddel** was a Scottish mathematician, physician and astronomer who lectured on mathematics and astronomy on the continent. He made several endowments to Marischal College, Aberdeen.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for solving cubic equations which is still in use today. 
2. Conducted influential early work on the classification of cubic equations. 
3. Developed a modified form of the standard notation for equations which made the process of solution easier. 
4. Developed a new approach to understanding the properties of geometric figures. 
5. Demonstrated the possibility of solving higher-order equations. 
6. Made significant advances in the study of curves, including the parabola and the conic sections. 
7. Pioneered the use of conics to analyze the motion of planets.
 8. The showed that any periodic phenomenon could be represented as the sum of a series of trigonometric functions.

Born 1561, Aberdeen, Scotland. Died 17 December 1613, Aberdeen, Scotland.
