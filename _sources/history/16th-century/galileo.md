**Galileo Galilei** was an Italian scientist who formulated the basic law of falling bodies, which he verified by careful measurements. He constructed a telescope with which he studied lunar craters, and discovered four moons revolving around Jupiter and espoused the Copernican cause.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the scientific method of inquiry.
2. Developed the law of inertia.
3. Developed the law of falling bodies.
4. Discovered that objects of different masses accelerate in free fall at the same rate.
5. Demonstrated many other laws of motion.
6. Explained the cause of tides.
7. Discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter
8. Developed the telescope for astronomical observation.
9. Discovered previously unknown stars, constellations, comets, and other celestial bodies.
10. Discovered that the planets revolve around the sun instead of around Earth.

Born 15 February 1564, Pisa (now Italy). Died 8 January 1642, Arcetri near Florence (now Italy).
