**Jyesthadeva** was a mathematician from South India who wrote an important work on mathematics and astronomy which summarises the work of the Kerala school.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Gregory-Leibniz series for pi and created a number of innovative techniques allowing him to compute its decimal expansion up to 15 decimal places.
2. Developed the Leibniz integral rule for differentiation and integration.
3. Developed fast methods for the summation of series.
4. Developed an algorithm for factoring polynomials.
5. Composed a range of influential treatises including the Yuktibhâsâ, his most important work which included many mathematical concepts and results.
6. Was an early proponent of the use of √2 as an irrational number.
7. Developed the power series expansion for trigonometric functions and provided solid proofs of their accuracy. 
8. Was the first Indian mathematician to use the series expansions for sine and cosine functions that are currently taught in schools today.
9. Developed one of the earliest converging power series approximation for π, measuring it to more than 12 decimal places.

Born about 1500, Kerala, India. Died about 1575, Kerala, India.
