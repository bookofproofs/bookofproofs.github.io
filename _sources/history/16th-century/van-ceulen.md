**Ludolph Van Ceulen** was a German mathematician who is famed for his calculation of `$\pi$` to 35 places. In Germany, `$\pi$` used to be called the _Ludolphine number_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Calculated Pi to a highly accurate 30 decimal places in 1596.
2. Created a 40-page book in 1610 which provided the first comprehensive account of what is now known as the polynomial long division algorithm.
3. Developed a system of calculating logarithms without the aid of tables.
4. Worked with infinite series expansion, leading to a succinct formula for the area of a circle.
5. Discovered the root-approximation method for solving non-linear equations.
6. Developed trigonometric interpolation techniques to interpolate actuarial tables necessary for life annuity calculations.

Born 28 January 1540, Hildesheim, Germany. Died 31 December 1610, Leiden, Netherlands.
