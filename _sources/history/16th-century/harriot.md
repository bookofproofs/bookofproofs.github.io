**Thomas Harriot** was an English mathematician who did outstanding work on the solution of equations, recognising negative roots and complex roots in a way that makes his solutions look almost like a present day solution.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a set of rules for solving equations using algebraic principles in 1585.
2. Explored triangular equations and equations with one unknown, which developed the theories of logarithms and trigonometry. 
3. Invented symbols to represent unknowns in equations.
4. Developed a book focusing on trigonometric functions entitled Artis Analyticae Praxis.
5. Determined that the Earth has no appreciable magnetic influence during the 1590s.
6. Wrote the first book on analytic geometry entitled De triangulis in 1594. 
7. Explored the theory of interpolation, which is the process of estimating an unknown value between two known values, shortly before his death in 1621. 
8. Made significant contributions to the development of calculus, although he did not discover it.

Born 1560, Oxford, England. Died 2 July 1621, London, England.
