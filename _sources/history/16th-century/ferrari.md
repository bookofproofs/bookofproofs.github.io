**Ferrari** was an Italian scholar who started as Cardan's secretary and went on to devise the solution of the quartic equation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered that solutions of the quartic equation could be expressed algebraically.
2. Solved Archimedes's "Cattle Problem", an intractable math problem that had stumped mathematicians for two thousand years.
3. Proposed the use of modular arithmetic and congruence as a basis for solving equations.
4. Published a paper on advanced geometry which demonstrated the importance of understanding Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries.
5. Developed methods to solve the Problem of Apollonius, a difficult problem in the study of conic sections.
6. Initiated the study of probability theory, producing the first modern definition of probability.
7. Established that in some cases, the quintic equation had solutions expressible by radicals.
8. Used mathematical notation to represent complex events in his book on probability theory.
9. Revised the first textbook on analytic geometry with Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry.
10. Developed methods of measuring the degree of convergence of irrational numbers.

Born 2 February 1522, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy). Died 5 October 1565, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy).
