2. Developed a method for solving linear equations.
3. Developed a method for finding the volume of various objects.
4. Developed a concept of machineries to replace physical labor.
5. Established the concept of the law of the lever.
6. Developed and introduced the concept of the slide rule.
7. Published several mathematical treatises, including the 1585 work De thiende.
8. Introducing a mathematical treatment of projectile motion.
