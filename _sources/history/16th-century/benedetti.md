**Giovanni Benedetti** was an Italian mathematician who anticipated some of Galileo's work on free fall.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the method of sequences and series for calculating sums, known as the “Benedetti Series.”
2. Was the first mathematician to use decimal notation in his work.
3. Published papers on geometry of curves and solid figures, as well as quadrature problems.
4. Provided sophisticated solutions to algebraic problems, adding to the work of Piero della Francesca.
5. Constructed the first azimuthal projection of the Earth with continuous distances.
6. Pioneered the idea of using integral calculus for finding solutions to geometrical problems.
7. Proved theorems for the triangle in a circle connecting angles and distances.
8. Researched the geometry of conics and developed the focus-directrix property of conics.
9. Conducted important work in trigonometry, focusing on properties and equations of the circle. 
10. Limited the solutions to equations of the fourth degree and described the resultant of three equations of the third degree.

Born 14 August 1530, Venice, Venetian States (now Italy). Died 20 January 1590, Turin, Duchy of Savoy (now Italy).
