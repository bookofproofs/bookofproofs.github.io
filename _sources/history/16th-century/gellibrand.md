**Henry Gellibrand** was an English clergyman who worked on magnetic declination and who made mathematical contributions to navigation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Gellibrand succeeded Gunter to the chair of astronomy in Gresham College, London in 1627.
* Gellibrand's most famous scientific discovery was the change over the years in magnetic declination.
* Gellibrand published his findings in A discourse mathematical of the variation of the magneticall needle together with its admirable diminution lately discovered (1635).
* Gellibrand, on the other hand, was observing in Gresham College.
* The time difference allowed Gellibrand to compute the difference in longitude between the two points of observation and he published the results in Appendix concerning Longitude (1633).
* Gellibrand also published logarithm and trigonometrical tables.
* Although only 39 years of age, Gellibrand retired in 1836 to Mayfield in Sussex.
