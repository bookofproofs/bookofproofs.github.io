**Gerardus Mercator** was a Flemish map-maker and geographer who is best known for the map projection which bears his name.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new method for representing the globe on a flat surface, known as the Mercator projection, which enabled navigators to easily calculate sailing courses.
2. Published a series of world maps, in 1569, which were the first maps to systematically depict the world with the Mercator projection.
3. Formulated the Mercator's longitude and latitude system, where one degree of the grid spanned an equal distance around the globe.
4. Described the concept of the rhumb line, which is a navigation line that runs through each point of the same bearing, and had huge implications for navigators all over the world.
5. Advanced trigonometry by introducing the sine and inverse sine functions, as well as the spherical law of cosines to aid navigators in predicting positions and distances over the sea.
6. Developed a set of general laws of proportion in 1584 which utilized quadratic equations, and is now considered an early development of the modern calculus. 
7. Devised a new geometrical approach, called Analytic Series, for computing with tangents and secants, and is now considered the first one-parameter iterative process.

Born 5 March 1512, Rupelmonde, Burgundian Netherlands (now Belgium). Died 2 December 1594, Duisburg, Duchy of Cleves (now Germany).
