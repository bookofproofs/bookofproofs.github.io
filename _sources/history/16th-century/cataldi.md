**Pietro Cataldi** was an Italian mathematician who wrote around 30 books on mathematics, and some on other topics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm for identifying prime numbers, now known as the Cataldi Number.
2. Was one of the earliest mathematicians to apply algebra to the solution of equations and proposed theorems regarding whole numbers.
3. Developed a method for calculating square roots, similar to the later use of the long division algorithm for calculating rational numbers
4. Pioneered the use of logarithms to calculate the changing ratios of curved lines.
5. Developed methods for calculating the area and volume of various shapes and solids.
6. Discovered the theorem of the sum of the squares of the four interior angles of a cyclic quadrilateral.
7. Published his works in treatises titled "Arithmeticorum Libri Duo" and "On the Number of Primes".

Born 15 April 1548, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy). Died 11 February 1626, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy).
