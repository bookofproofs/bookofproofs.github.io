**Albert Girard** was a French mathematician and musician. His work on trigonometry is the first to use the abbreviations sin, cos, tan.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He introduced the concept of logarithms in 1625.
2. He developed mathematics related to equations and probability theory. 
3. He wrote 'Logarithmorum Chilias Prima', a book in which he expanded on his work on logarithms.
4. He was the first person to use a decimal fraction in his work.
5. He developed a table of logarithms, which was a major advance in mathematical calculation and made calculation much faster and easier.
6. He was the first mathematician to use the symbols in equations instead of words.
7. He made significant contributions to the development of analytic geometry and the integration of fractions.
8. He also worked on the Triple Bar Theorem, and wrote a treatise on it, which was integral to developing calculus.

Born 1595, St Mihiel, France. Died 8 December 1632, Leiden, Netherlands.
