**Claude Bachet** was a French mathematician who wrote books on mathematical puzzles which formed the basis for almost all later books on mathematical recreations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to solve a case of the classic Diophantine equations, known as the Problem of Bachet.
2. He wrote a major work entitled “La Diophantine Grecque” from which he derived a large number of properties regarding congruence equations and equations in Diophantine Analysis.
3. He was the first to prove that the cubic equation was solvable by radicals, a major advance in mathematics at the time.
4. He presented and demonstrated the theory of Numbers of Perfection, now widely known as the Perfect Numbers in which he demonstrated and established the first four perfect numbers.
5. He invented a variation of the Euclidean Algorithm for solving Diophantine equations.
6. He added several contributions to number theory, including the 12-sign problem, which was later to be known as Bachet's Problem.
7. He discovered a theorem regarding the primitive roots of a number and applied it to the solution of several Diophantine equations.
8. He was one of the first to propose the use of continued fractions in mathematical analysis.

Born 9 October 1581, Bourg-en-Bresse, France. Died 26 February 1638, Bourg-en-Bresse, France.
