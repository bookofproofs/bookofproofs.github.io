**Christoph Scheiner** was a German Jesuit priest, physicist and astronomer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to invent a device to accurately measure the angle of a solar eclipse.
2. He was the first to correctly describe the pattern of photospheric sunspots as rotation of the Sun.
3. He showed that the path of each sunspot was at its center a great circle and described the variation of the sunspot's apparent size with distance from the Sun.
4. He was one of the first to construct a device for the observation of the positions of planets, which led to the discovery of the rotation of Saturn's rings.
5. He published the first accurate astronomical tables of Jupiter, demonstrating the Jovian axial rotation period.
6. He wrote the first book on sunspots, "Rosa Ursina sive Sol".
7. He was the first to correctly explain the atmospheric refraction of solar light as the cause of twilight.
8. He formulated a law from Kepler's laws of planetary motion that could explain the orbits of comets.

Born 25 July 1573, Markt Wald, near Mindelheim in Swabia (now in Germany). Died 18 July 1650, Neisse, Silesia.
