**Giordano Bruno** was an Italian philosopher of science who was eventually burnt in Rome as a heretic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the 'third class of infinites' which extended the traditional notions of infinity and marked the first use of a multi-valued space.
2. Developed innovative mathematical methods for dealing with infinite series and for evaluating geometrical figuresâ€™ areas.
3. Setting the foundation for the introduction of imaginary numbers and the concept of dimension.
4. Developed a new way of looking at astronomical phenomena which laid the foundation for absolute space.
5. Expanded notions of heliocentricity and spherical shapes of the Earth and its orbits.
6. Identified and discussed the importance of four-dimensional spacial systems. 
7. Wrote extensive works on Euclidean geometry, trigonometry and the analysis of infinites. 
8. Advanced a model of universe in which there is no single center and developed ground breaking theories on natural laws.

Born 1548, Nola near Naples, Kingdom of Naples (now Italy). Died 17 February 1600, Rome, Papal States (now Italy).
