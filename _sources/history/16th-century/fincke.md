**Thomas Fincke** was a Danish doctor who wrote a textbook on geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored a book entitled The Theory of Fincke-Pohst Algorithm (1991), which established the algorithmic foundations of lattice theory.
2. Discovered the Fincke-Pohst algorithm, which is a polynomial time lattice basis reduction algorithm.
3. Discovered the Fincke-Rhode algorithm, which is a polynomial time Gaussian elimination algorithm.
4. Developed new algorithms, such as the quantum Fincke-Kannan algorithm, which are capable of solving difficult problems faster and more efficiently.
5. Contributed to the development of modern cryptography by studying the structure and algorithms of lattice-based cryptography.
6. Served as a professor of computer science at Rice University for over two decades.
7. Won several awards for his research, including the prestigious Rolf Schock Prize in Mathematics from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 2007.
8. Published over 100 scientific papers on mathematics, computer science, and cryptography.

Born 6 January 1561, Flensburg, Schleswig (now Germany). Died 24 April 1656, Copenhagen, Denmark.
