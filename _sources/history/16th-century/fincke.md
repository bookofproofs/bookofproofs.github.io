**Thomas Fincke** was a Danish doctor who wrote a textbook on geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His parents, Raadmand Jacob Fincke and Anna thor Smede (or Thorsmede), came from the most respected families in Flensburg.
* Thomas attended a newly founded Lutheran Latin school in Flensburg from 1570 to 1577 when he was 16 years old.
* As a consequence, mathematics was one of the major subjects that Fincke studied.
* After leaving the Academy, Fincke enrolled at the University of Heidelberg in February 1582 and then, after a semester there, he enrolled for a semester at the University of Leipzig in the summer of 1582.
* Having published such an important mathematical work, one might assume that Fincke would go on to still greater mathematical achievements.
* Fincke made a big impression in Padua and, although he was only twenty-six years old when he left, his achievements in founding a medical library were so highly appreciated that a marble pillar with inscribed commemorative plaque was put in the local church 'Santa Sofia' in his honour.
* Certainly Fincke did not return directly to Flensburg from Basel but rather made further study trips through Austria, Hungary and Bohemia before settling into a medical practise in his home town of Flensburg.
* Around the time of his marriage, Fincke received an offer of the Chair of Mathematics at the University of Copenhagen from Chancellor Niels Kaas, one of Fincke's patrons.
* On the 28 July 1602, Peder SÃ¸rensen, the professor of medicine at Copenhagen died and in April of the following year Fincke was appointed to fill this chair.
* The book introduces the terms 'tangents' and 'secants' and Fincke devised new formulae such as the law of tangents.
* The abbreviations Fincke used for the standard trigonometric functions mark the beginning of the notation which is current today.
* Fincke's book was recommended by Clavius, Napier and Pitiscus all of whom adopted much from it.
* Their eldest son, Jacob Fincke (1592-1663), went on to become Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Copenhagen.

Born 6 January 1561, Flensburg, Schleswig (now Germany). Died 24 April 1656, Copenhagen, Denmark.
