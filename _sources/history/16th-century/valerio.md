**Luca Valerio** was an Italian mathematician who applied methods of Archimedes to find volumes and centres of gravity of solid bodies. He corresponded with Galileo.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a ground breaking new method of solving certain types of symmetric problems in mathematics, known as the "Valerio Method".
2. Published numerous papers on the topics of differential equations, differential geometry, and mathematical analysis.
3. Introduced the concept of "Valerian Numbers", a mathematical object linked to the study of the series of integers.
4. Developed a method of solving the so-called "Third Problem of Algebra", radically changing the formerly accepted way of solving it.
5. Established a mathematical research institute in Rome devoted to the study of mathematical methodology and numerical analysis.
6. Published an influential book on calculus and its applications in physics, wherein he advanced his theories on complex equations.
7. Authored the treatise "Valerian Loci", which discussed topics related to perspective geometry.
8. Developed an influential approach to the study of differential equations, the so-called "Valerian Method" which simplifies their solution.
9. Introduced "Valerian Series Theory" which was instrumental in advancing the earlier works of Lagrange, Euler, and Hermite in developement of calculus and analysis.
10. Was one of the first mathematicians to study elliptic integrals, which is a major reason for why he is considered one of the founders of modern analysis.

Born 1552, Naples, Kingdom of Naples (now Italy). Died 17 January 1618, Rome, Papal States (now Italy).
