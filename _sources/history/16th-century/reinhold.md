**Erasmus Reinhold** was a German astronomer and mathematician who catalogued a large number of stars and published important astronomical tables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He produced the most accurate calculation of the lunar orbit thus far.
2. He corrected and improved the existing planetary tables of Copernicus.
3. He calculated the orbits of Mercury, Venus and Mars and published them in the Prutenic Tables of 1551.
4. He also produced tables for predicting solar and lunar eclipses.
5. He introduced a new method of using predictive equations for equators and meridian circles of the celestial sphere.
6. He used trigonometric functions with angles measured in degrees to relate the positions of celestial bodies used in the prediction of eclipses and planetary motions.
7. He proposed a new way to determine longitude.
8. He contributed to the development of basic mathematical techniques such as the use of sines and tangents.
9. He worked on the project of calendar reform during his lifetime.
10. He made important contributions to the knowledge of early modern astronomical instruments, such as astrolabes, armillary spheres, and globes.

Born 22 October 1511, Saalfeld, Thuringia (now Germany). Died 19 February 1553, Saalfeld, Thuringia, Germany.
