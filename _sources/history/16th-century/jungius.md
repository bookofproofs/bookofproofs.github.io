**Joachim Jungius** was a German mathematician who was one of the first to use exponents to represent powers and who used mathematics as a model for the natural sciences.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed important contributions to the fields of logic, algebra, number theory, and the methodology of mathematics, including the introduction of the notion of a mathematical function.
2. Thoroughly studied Viète's algebra and was the first to construct the general three-dimensional hyperbola.
3. Developed an early version of integral calculus, contributing to the development of Leibniz's differential calculus.
4. Published an important paper on the subjects of factoring equations, as well as a treatise on algebra.
5. Showed that the correct solution of a polynomial equation of degree three is always attainable, with his work serving as the basis for Lagrange's work on the general theory of equations.
6. Played an early role in the development of the Law of Continuity, which links mathematics, physics and philosophical principles.
7. Was one of the first mathematicians to apply the newly-discovered logarithms to mathematics.

Born 22 October 1587, Lübeck, Holstein (now Germany). Died 23 September 1657, Hamburg, Germany.
