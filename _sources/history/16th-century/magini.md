**Giovanni Magini** was an Italian scientist who worked in astronomy and had a version of an earth-centred Solar system.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first modern, complex star catalog of the entire celestial sphere in 1593, detailing over 7000 stars.
2. Wrote the book Geographia, which revived and modified the existing Ptolemaic system of geography and contributed significantly to the development of modern cartography.
3. Compiled a "Homocentric System of Worlds" which formed the basis for modern celestial mechanics and provided a new way of looking at the motion of the planets and stars.
4. Made important discoveries and contributions to the fields of astrophysics, optics, and astrometry.
5. Proposed new methods of measuring latitude and longitude and proposed a trigonometric method to calculate distances between stars.
6. Recorded detailed observations of the Moon’s phases and Libra’s “scales”: The first graphic representation of the Milky Way. 
7. Developed a system of trigonometric ratios for application to celestial navigation.

Born 13 June 1555, Padua, Venetian States (now Italy). Died 11 February 1617, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy).
