**Pierre Gassendi** was a French astronomer who was the first to observe a transit of Venus. He wrote on astronomy, his own astronomical observations and on falling bodies.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proposed a method of quantifying the size of molecules using his “Gassendi Radius.” 
2. Discovered two of the main properties of logarithms of numbers.
3. Established a set of rules for resolving problems in mathematical curves and conic sections. 
4. Developed a set of geometrical principles and geometric analysis. 
5. Conducted extensive research into the ancient Greek mathematician and scientist Pappus of Alexandria. 
6. Published a mathematical treatise called “Syntagma idearum philosophicarum” which contains many of his mathematical discoveries. 
7. Incorporated laws of projectile motion into his mathematical solutions. 
8. Provided pioneering solutions to problems defined by the equations of motion of Galileo Galilei. 
9. Proposed a suggestion involving the reflection of light that was published in Marin Mersenne's L'Harmonie Universelle. 
10. He became known for bringing a more mathematical approach to philosophy and natural science.

Born 22 January 1592, Champtercier, Provence, France. Died 24 October 1655, Paris, France.
