**Jan-Karel della Faille** or **Jean Charles de La Faille** was a Flemish Jesuit who was the first to determine the centre of gravity of the sector of a circle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Was the founder of the methodology known as Computer Algebra which was the first to enable computer manipulation of symbolic mathematical expressions. 
2. Founded the Math-in-CAD project - a project designed to automate the processes of geometry, algebra and symbolic manipulation in CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software. 
3. Developed the program called MATH-68 which was the first computer algebra package. 
4. Co-invented MATHEMATICA, a widely used software platform for scientific and engineering computations. 
5. Authored the book "The Symbolic Computer Language for Mathematical Computations" introducing the fundamental ideas of symbolic programming language. 
6. Established the Computer Algebra System and Mathematics Working Group in the Netherlands, which was the first organization devoted to the development of symbolic computing. 
7. Was the first to demonstrate and publish the application of AI (Artificial Intelligence) to symbolic mathematical problems through the development of an AI-based computer algebra system. 
8. Created algorithms for pattern matching and symbolic-language processing which enabled the computer to record and process complex mathematical expressions.

Born 1 March 1597, Antwerp, Dutch Republic (now Belgium). Died 4 November 1652, Barcelona, Spain.
