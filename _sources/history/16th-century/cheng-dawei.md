**Cheng Dawei** was a Chinese mathematician who published the _Suanfa tong zong_ (General source of computational methods).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Firstly we know Cheng Da Wei lived in the latter half of the Ming dynasty which was a period of prosperity with increasing trade and commerce.
* Cheng Da Wei was probably directly involved in such efforts but, if not, he was certainly indirectly involved.
* The need for arithmetical skills led to the invention of the abacus and Cheng Da Wei's book General source of computational methods was an arithmetic book for the abacus.
* That Cheng Da Wei was not a professional mathematician is typical of what one would expect from this period in China.
* Cheng Da Wei wrote the General source of computational methods in 1592.
* unlike the authors of the venerable classic, Cheng Dawei was not afraid of superfluity or verbosity.
* How does Cheng Da Wei solve the problem?
* In Chapter 2 of Cheng Da Wei's text there is the following problem.
* Cheng Da Wei goes on to explain what one expects the altitude of grain for a given base circumference to be.
* Of course in practice it will depend on how coarse the grain is, but Cheng Da Wei's values are quite close to what experimental evidence suggests.
* As we see by looking at the problem, these are precisely the values that Cheng Da Wei uses in it.

Born 1533, China. Died 1606, China.
