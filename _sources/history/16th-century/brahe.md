**Tycho Brahe** was a Danish astronomer who is best known for the astronomical observations which led Kepler to his theories of the Solar system.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Measured the position of the planets and stars with incredible precision, providing a strong foundation for Kepler and Newton's future research.
2. Discovered Supernova SN 1572, which enhanced our understanding of the universe.
3. Made many important contributions to the study of planetary motion – primarily, he argued for a geocentric universe with precisely orbiting planets rather than an Earth-centered system with nested spheres.
4. Compiled data from his master catalog, known as the Rudolphine Tables, which allowed for the calculation of planetary positions.
5. Developed an influential calendar system, Uraniborg Calendar, with both solar and lunar elements.
6. Collected detailed astronomical observations of Mars, which was later used to demonstrate the heliocentric model of the solar system.

Born 14 December 1546, Knutstorp, Skane, Denmark (now Svalöv, Sweden. Died 24 October 1601, Prague, Bohemia (now Czech Republic).
