**Joao Baptista Lavanha** was a Portuguese engineer who wrote on mathematics and navigation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In an attempt to correct this, Philip founded an Academy of Mathematics in Madrid with Lavanha as its first professor.
* Lavanha was appointed cosmographer to the king in 1591 (although he did not assume the full duties of that position for a few years) and about the same time he moved from Madrid to Lisbon where he taught mathematics to sailors and navigators.
* Lavanha is best known for his contributions to navigation.
* a work printed by Lavanha shortly after being appointed chief cosmographer of Portugal.
* Lavanha gives rules for determining latitude and tables of declination of the Sun.
* Another work by Lavanha in this area is his Compendio de Geografia.
* Lavanha also studied instruments used in navigation, constructing astrolabes, quadrants and compasses.
* Lavanha taught mathematics to many leading people including Prince Emmanuel Filiberto of Sabóia (1528-1580) (who was Duke of Savoy from 1553 to 1580), the famous novelist, poet and playwright Miguel de Cervantes (1547-1616), the dramatist and poet Félix Arturo Lope de Vega (1562-1635), and Philip IV (1605-1665) of Spain before he ascended to the throne of Spain in 1621.
* Among Lavanha's publications was a translation of Euclid (1584), the tables of the sun Taboas do lugar do So (1600), and a work containing all the mathematical facts a learned man needed to know, Descripción del Universo (1613).
* In 1609, Lavanha joined the Order of Christ which, given his Jewish origins, caused some criticism.

Born 1555, Lisbon, Portugal. Died 31 March 1624, Madrid, Spain.
