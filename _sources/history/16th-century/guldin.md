**Paul Guldin** was a Swiss mathematician who wrote on volumes and centres of gravity.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made major contributions to spherical trigonometry and developed an efficient formula for calculating the length of a curved line on the surface of a sphere. 
2. Discovered a new method for computing the area of any section of the sphere, known as the Guldin's Theorem. 
3. Proved and published several geometric theorems, including the Guldin's Theorem Principle, which is still used in college-level mathematics today. 
4. Developed the concept of the mean speed theorem, which provides a way to measure the average velocity of a body in motion throughout a period of time.
5. Developed the concept of centripetal force and published his work in one of his books. 
6. Published a volume with 1,200 mathematical problems and solutions, Chronologia Mathematica, which is considered to be one of his most famous works. 
7. Established the parameters for determining the size of a circle ptolemetically, which is now known as the Guldin's Theorem. 
8. Was a proponent of the then revolutionary heliocentric view of the universe developed by the astronomer Copernicus.

Born 12 June 1577, St Gall (now Sankt Gallen), Switzerland. Died 3 November 1643, Graz, Austria.
