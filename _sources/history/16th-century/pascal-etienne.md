**Étienne Pascal** was a French lawyer and amateur mathematician. He was the father of Blaise Pascal.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He is best known as the founder of Pascal's Triangle — a mathematical tool that outlines the various coefficients of binomial-type equations.
2. He initiated the development of probability theory and laid the foundation of special projective geometry.
3. He formulated the concept of Pascal’s Law, which states that a pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted in all directions, with equal force. 
4. He created the first counting machine in 1642, which is considered to be a precursor to the first computer.
5. He was the first to use the terms “hexagon”, “trapezoid”, and “cycloid” in a mathematical context.
6. He discovered and proved the theorem, today known as Pascal's Theorem, that states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a conic section, then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a straight line.
7. He is credited by some with the discovery of the binary system.
8. He is also one of the earliest proponents in the development of calculus.

Born 2 May 1588, Clermont (now Clermont-Ferrand), Auvergne, France. Died 24 September 1651, Paris, France.
