**Jacob Golius** or **Jacob Gool** was an orientalist, astronomer and mathematician based at the University of Leiden in Netherlands.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Jacob Gool wrote the book "Integral Calculus: Foundations and Elementary Applications" which allows undergraduate students to master essential calculus techniques.
2. He developed a novel approach to teach applied mathematics using the theory of variations.
3. He formulated an effective way to evaluate the numerical range for large order polynomials.
4. He derived a new estimation method for the indefinite integral of an arbitrary function.
5. He discovered universal approximations for the numerical evaluation of derivatives and integrals. 
6. He developed an efficient algorithm for the numerical solution of systems of differential equations. 
7. He achieved a novel approximation formula for the roots of equations. 
8. He proposed an efficient algorithm for the numerical solving of various kinds of integral equations.

Born 1596, The Hague, Netherlands. Died 28 September 1667, Leiden, Holland.
