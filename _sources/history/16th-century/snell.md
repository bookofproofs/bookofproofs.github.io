**Willebrord Snell** was a Dutch mathematician who is best known for the law of refraction, a basis of modern geometric optics; but this only become known after his death when Huygens published it.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the law of refraction, or Snell's law, which describes how light changes direction when travelling from one medium to another.
2. Developed two of the most important theorems in trigonometry, the law of sines and the law of cosines.
3. Calculated the values of trigonometric functions for several angles using a triangle inscribed in a half-circle.
4. Made improvements to the designing and construction of optical instruments, such as telescopes and microscopes.
5. Developed a mathematical relationship between a light ray and the plane that is perpendicular to it.
6. Established an accurate method of measuring distances and heights through the triangulation technique.
7. Built mathematical models which have been used to calculate the distance between two points on the earth's surface.

Born 13 June 1580, Leiden, Netherlands. Died 30 October 1626, Leiden, Netherlands.
