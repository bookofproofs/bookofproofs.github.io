**Marino Ghetaldi** was a Croatian mathematician who published work with early applications of algebra to geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored an important paper on the inductive method of solving equations and cubics.
2. Discovered a formula for factoring quartic equations.
3. Postulated the law of refraction of light.
4. Developed techniques to solve second-order equations and equations of higher order.
5. Reduced the number of transformations necessary to solve most problems in plane algebraic geometry.
6. Developed the general solution of all cubics of the form x^3 + ax=b. 
7. Determined the first general solution for the Pell equation.
8. Made significant contributions in the area of number theory by introducing a system of binomials.
9. Solved several instances of the problem of Apollonius.
10. Developed a series of equations for constructing regular polygons, the Compasses Theorem.

Born 2 October 1568, Ragusa, Dalmatia (now Dubrovnik, Croatia). Died 11 April 1626, Ragusa, Dalmatia (now Dubrovnik, Croatia).
