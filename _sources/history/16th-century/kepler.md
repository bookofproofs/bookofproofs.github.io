He is known for his [first][bookofproofs$6304], [second][bookofproofs$6305], and [third][bookofproofs$6306] planetary law of motion. The possibility of being able to describe the laws of heavenly motions by earthly mathematics positively influenced the boldness of contemporary mathematicians and finally led to the invention of [Newton's][ne] theory of gravitation.

Born 27 December 1571 Weil der Stadt, WÃ¼rttemberg, Holy Roman Empire (now Germany). Died 15 November 1630 Regensburg (now in Germany).
