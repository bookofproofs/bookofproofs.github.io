**Johannes Kepler** was a German mathematician and astronomer who discovered that 
the Earth and planets travel about the sun in elliptical orbits. 
He is known for his [first][bookofproofs$6304], [second][bookofproofs$6305], and [third][bookofproofs$6306] planetary law of motion. 
The possibility of being able to describe the laws of heavenly motions by earthly mathematics positively influenced the boldness of contemporary mathematicians and finally led to the invention of [Newton][bookofproofs$Newton]'s theory of gravitation.
He also did important work in optics and geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the three laws of planetary motion, which provided essential evidence in support of Copernicus's theory of heliocentrism.
2. Introduced the concept of a geometrically based system for describing orbits of planets.
3. Maintained existing mathematical values for the size and distance of the sun, earth and moon.
4. Created an equation to explain the elliptical patterns of planetary orbits. 
5. Discovered the harmonic law of planetary motion.
6. Proposed a mathematical law to explain the speed of planets.
7. Established the foundations for the field of calculus.
8. Demonstrated that the orbital paths of planets can be predicted precisely.
9. Created a lasting model for the planetary system.
10. Constructed the first telescope with two convex lenses.

Born 27 December 1571, Weil der Stadt, WÃ¼rttemberg, Holy Roman Empire (now Germany). Died 15 November 1630, Regensburg (now in Germany).
