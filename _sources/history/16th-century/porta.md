**Giambattista della Porta** was an Italian scholar who worked on cryptography and also on optics. He claimed to be the inventor of the telescope although he does not appear to have constructed one before Galileo.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1) Developed the concept of the potential infinite - a mathematical concept important in calculus and gravity theory.
2) Discovering the law of refraction, also known as Snell's law. 
3) Constructing the first practical reflecting telescope
4) Creating a method to determine the longitude of a place by comparing the eclipse of the moon in two different places
5) Developing the concept of magnifying glasses
6) Establishing mathematical relationships between solid geometric figures and their shadow projections
7) Developing the first scientific formula to calibrate the strength of lenses 
8) Developing the theory of optical illusions and debating their effects on vision

Born 1 November 1535, Vico Equense near Naples, Kingdom of Naples (now Italy). Died 4 February 1615, Naples, Kingdom of Naples (now Italy).
