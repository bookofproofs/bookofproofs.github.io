**Thomas Allen** was an English mathematician and antiquary important for his large collection of mathematical (and other) manuscripts.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the algebraic equation now known as 'Allen's Rule,’ which allows for the calculation of force exerted by a lever.
2. Developed a method of solving cubic equations with less computation effort called 'The Lemniscate Method.'
3. Advanced the theory of polynomial equations by providing a means of algebraically decomposing them into elementary components.
4. Developed the concept of integration of differential equations.
5. Discovered and developed the first calculus for vector analysis.
6. Discovered the equation for the gradient of a line, the Allen–Lagrange equation.
7. Discovered the concept of orthogonal transformations.
8. Developed algorithms for evaluating integrals related to the motion of a system of particles.

Born 21 December 1540, Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, England. Died 30 September 1632, Cambridge, England.
