**Pierre Hérigone** was a French mathematician who wrote a compendium of elementary mathematics written in French and Latin.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pierre Hérigone was among the first mathematicians to study and provide solutions to polynomial equations, as well as Diophantine equations. 
2. He was the first to construct the cycloid, a curve generated by a point on the circumference of a circle rolling along a straight line.
3. He also invented the division marks (÷, +, -, etc.) and equal signs (‘=’) that we use in arithmetic today. 
4. He wrote Mathematical Tables, one of the first mathematical textbooks and the first to include a discussion of imaginary numbers.
5. He also made important contributions to geometrical and astronomical studies and authored several books on algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.

Born 1580, France. Died 1643, Paris, France.
