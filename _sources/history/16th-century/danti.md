**Egnatio Danti** was an Italian Dominican who made contributions to architecture, geography and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a set of geometric theorems in his treatise De Lineis in Plano Figuris (1573) which included the first published proof involving the direct application of algebra to trigonometry.
2. Proposed methods for solving cubic equations in his Aerometricorum liber (1574) and explained the solutions for special cases related to the Greek Problem of Tangencies.
3. Published two important works on the cycloid, Algebraicae Logisticae (1586) and Il Geometra della Caffagiola (1591), which included solutions to problems that had been open for centuries and reflections on tangent points and rolling bodies.
4. Discovered the Greek Problem of Apollonius, a problem on the construction and properties of circles that had remained unsolved for centuries, in his book De Pura Cosmographia (1577).
5. Explained the properties and rules governing the quadratures of curves with respect to the geometric principles of Euclid, in his book Geometria Speculativa (1585).
6. Formulated new types of curves, employing his knowledge of analytic geometry and astronomy, in his Trattato de Leo (1588).

Born April 1536, Perugia (now Italy). Died 19 October 1586, Alatri (now Italy).
