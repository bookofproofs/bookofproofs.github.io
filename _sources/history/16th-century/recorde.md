**Recorde** was a Welsh doctor and mathematician who invented the "equals" symbol '=' which appears in his book _The Whetstone of Witte _ (1557).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He introduced the equal sign ‘=’ into mathematical notation in 1557 in his book The Whetstone of Witte.
2. He developed decimal fractions in 1553, a concept greatly underrated in the English-speaking world until the 18th century.
3. He wrote the earliest known English books devoted to algebra.
4. He wrote a book explaining the use of the recently coined terms, ‘square’ and ‘cube’.
5. He advocated the use of letters to represent algebraic variables in 1557.
6. He famously said, ‘To avoide the tediouste of repecition of these wordes: is equalle to: I wil sett as I doe often in woorke use, a paire of paralleles, or Gemowe lines of one lengthe, thus: =, bicause noe .2. thynges can be moare equalle.’
7. He wrote the oft-referenced 16th century book, The Grounde of Artes.
8. He wrote an influential book on astronomy in 1551 called The Castle of Knowledge.
9. He was the first to identify and name the powres of 10 in his book Whetstone of Witte and listed the first table of logarithms up to 1000.
10. In 1554, he wrote The Pathway to Knowledge, which is considered one of the earliest English expositions of the principles of mathematics.

Born 1510, Tenby, Wales. Died 1558, London, England.
