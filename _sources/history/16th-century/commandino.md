**Frederico Commandino** was an Italian mathematician who published important translations of works of the Ancient Greek mathematicians.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He taught at the University of Bologna, giving lectures on [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621], and wrote the first printed edition of Euclid's work in 1572.
2. Commandino created a new Latin translation and published his book on Euclid in 1572, making it available to the public.
3. Commandino wrote his own commentary on [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621], including his own knowledge of geometry and astronomy,
4. He was the first to understand Persian astronomer Nasir al-Din al-Tusi's theory of parallax, which he implemented in a number of works
5. He published the first treatise on the trigonometric properties of the sine and versed sine in 1565.
6. He was the first to define the shape of an ellipse geometrically, and used the concepts of continuity and limits as manipulable math objects.
7. He was the first to describe the path of projectile motion with a parabolic arc.
8. He was the first to calculate the area of a segment of a circle.

Born 1506, Urbino (now Italy). Died 5 September 1575, Urbino (now Italy).
