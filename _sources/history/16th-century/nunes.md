**Pedro Nunes** or **Nunez** was a Portuguese scholar who worked in geometry, spherical trigonometry, algebra as well as geography, physics, and cosmology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to use trigonometric functions to measure distances and create detailed maps.
2. He invented a new way of solving spherical trigonometry, known as the "problema dos cossenos" (cosine problem).
3. He was the first to calculate and use the exact value of pi to five decimal places.
4. He developed a navigational technique called the Lambert Quadrant, which allowed ships to calculate the height of the sun and position ships accurately.
5. He invented the Universal Latitude ring, an instrument used for navigational measurements.
6. He proposed a theory on the measurement and movement of ocean currents, which he observed to have remarkably accurate complex pattern predictions.
7. He proposed a method for solving polynomial equations and introduced the use of symbols for representing unknown quantities.
8. He was the first person to introduce the concept of logarithms to explain the mathematical rule linking geometric values to their derivatives.

Born 1502, Alc√°cer do Sal, Portugal. Died 11 August 1578, Coimbra, Portugal.
