**Guidobaldo del Monte** was an Italian mathematician who wrote on statics and also on perspective and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed advanced algebraic solutions to several geometric problems.
2. Discovered a theorem in the relationship between the areas and volumes of geometrical solids.
3. Proposed a new form of writing equations to represent certain mathematical relationships.
4. Advocated for the importance of experimental geometry in mathematics.
5. Authored a book on mathematics which became one of the most influential and important works of the Renaissance.
6. Conducted pioneering research in thefield of mechanics by using mathematical models of natural phenomena.
7. Published several algorithms for solving practical problems, such as the determination of two simultaneous line equations by intersecting circles.
8. Applied Euclidean geometry to problems related to the construction of fortresses and fortifications.
9. Investigated the composition of forces and the motion of bodies under their influence.
10. Computed accurate values of pi to 27 decimal places.

Born 11 January 1545, Pesaro (now Italy). Died 6 January 1607, Montebaroccio (now Italy).
