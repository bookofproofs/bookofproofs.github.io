**Tartaglia** was an Italian mathematician who was famed for his algebraic solution of cubic equations which was eventually published in Cardan's _Ars Magna_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the general form of a cubic equation (1535). 
2. Developed the formula for solving a system of two cubic equations—now known as “Tartaglia’s formula” (1540).
3. Published the world's first work on Euclidean geometry without words, a work called `General Trattato di Numeri e Misure` (1556).
4. Demonstrated, using a cubic equation, that certain square roots that Euclid had not thought of are irrational (1565).
5. Gave the first known solution to the general problem of Apollonius' s Construction, shortly before his death (1570).

Born 1500, Brescia, Republic of Venice (now Italy). Died 13 December 1557, Venice, Republic of Venice (now Italy).
