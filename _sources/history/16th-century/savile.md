**Henry Savile** was an English mathematician who founded professorships of geometry and astronomy at Oxford.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. The first Englishman to produce an original work in mathematics, the Arithmetica Logarithmica in 1620.
2. Developed notation and concepts to study higher powers of numbers, and derived laws such as the laws of indices.
3. Provided a table of natural sines accurate to 11 decimal places.
4. Was the first person to prove versions of Pascal's triangle.
5. Developed methods to compute the Gregorian calendar.
6. Conjectured that Fermat's Last Theorem was true for the cases where the power was a prime number.
7. Was the first to discover the value of the solution of the equation x^4 â€“ x^2 + 1 = 0, which was later called the "Saviile's equation." 
8. Discovered the ratio of the volume of a cone and a cylinder.
9. Coined the term "logarithm" and proposed its formal definition.
10. Discovered the Kepler-Tyson identity - a formula relating the binomial coefficients, triangle numbers and powers of two.

Born 30 November 1549, Bradley (near Halifax), Yorkshire, England. Died 19 February 1622, Eton, Berkshire, England.
