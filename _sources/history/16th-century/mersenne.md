**Marin Mersenne** was a French monk who is best known for his role as a clearing house for correspondence between eminent philosophers and scientists and for his work in number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Devised the first set of fundamental laws of vibration, which laid the groundwork for the modern understanding of sound and acoustics.
2. Formulated the law of quadratic reciprocity, which is fundamental in number theory.
3. Constructed the first table of prime numbers up to 257, and also compiled the “Great Mersenne Primes” – the largest known primes at the time.
4. Generated and studied the theory of perfect numbers and Mersenne primes.
5. Proposed Mersenne’s conjecture, which states that numbers that are one less than a power of two are always prime.
6. Contributed to theoretical work in acoustics, optics, and geometry.
7. Developed theories related to mathematics such as Divisibility, Binomial Theorem, Permutations and Combinations, among others.
8. His work on music theory, harmonic division and acoustics is credited with the introduction of the modern concept of absolute pitch.

Born 8 September 1588, Oizé, Maine, France. Died 1 September 1648, Paris, France.
