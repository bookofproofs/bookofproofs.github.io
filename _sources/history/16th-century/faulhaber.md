**Johann Faulhaber** was a German _Cossist_ or early algebraist. He is important for his work explaining the recently invented logarithms.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the formula to calculate powers of binomials.
2. Founded a method to calculate the Bernoulli numbers.
3. Created the Faulhaber’s formulas for the calculation of sums of powers of integerres.
4. Pioneered the Law of Separated Coefficients including a special case of Faulhaber's Formula.
5. Introduced the theory of special infinite series of polynomial functions, called the Bernoulli polynomials.
6. Developed an exact formula to evaluate integrals of rational functions.
7. Discovered a geometric method for the calculation of arcs and chords.
8. Published the first systematic treatment of logarithms with the title "Arithmetische und geometrische Progress Tabulen" in 1631.

Born 5 May 1580, Ulm, Germany. Died 1635, Ulm, Germany.
