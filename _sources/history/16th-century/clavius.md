**Christopher Clavius** was a German Jesuit astronomer who helped Pope Gregory XIII to introduce what is now called the Gregorian calendar.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Gregorian calendar.
2. Developed the mathematical system for computing the date of Easter.
3. Compiled and published commentaries of Euclid and Ptolemy, which were instrumental in helping to propagate their ideas throughout Europe.
4. Promoted the use of logarithms in trigonometry computations.
5. Expanded the use of the double false position method for solving equations.
6. Devised and published a system of mathematical proportions.
7. Wrote Treatise on the Sphere, which was a cornerstone in the development of modern celestial mechanics.
8. Overhauled the traditional educational system of the day by creating effective course curriculums and examination systems.
9. Invented new methods of teaching mathematics.
10. Proposed the adoption of decimal fractions by the European academic community.

Born 25 March 1538, Bamberg (now in Germany). Died 2 February 1612, Rome (now in Italy).
