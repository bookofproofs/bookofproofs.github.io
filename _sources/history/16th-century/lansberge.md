**Philippe van Lansberge** was a Flemish clergyman who wrote on mathematics and astronomy. He calculated `$\pi$` to 28 places by a new method.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an improved method of calculating longitude at sea, based on a globe set up with a meridional plane of reference.
2. Developed an improved system of spherical trigonometry, which greatly simplified calculative geometry.
3. Made the first published map of Holland based on exact triangulation and detailed scientific observation.
4. Developed a method for measuring distance between two points on earth based on trigonometry and geometry.
5. Invented a pedometer for use by sailors to measure their speed and distance traveled.
6. Reformulated the plane and spherical trigonometry equations with great success.
7. Reconstructed the latitudes and longitudes of many cities and places using his three main math disciplines.
8. Identified the concept of submersion and immersion of lines, surfaces, and an entire quadragedron to a plane and sphere.

Born 25 August 1561, Ghent, Spanish Netherlands (now Belgium). Died 8 December 1632, Middelburg, Netherlands.
