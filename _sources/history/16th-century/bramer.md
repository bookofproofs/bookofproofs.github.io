**Benjamin Bramer** was a German architect who published work on the calculation of sines.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the use of logarithms in calculation and analysis in the field of mathematics.
2. Developed a method for constructing grids of trigonometric and logarithmic functions, known as the Bramer Grid.
3. Established the first European school for mathematics instruction.
4. Authored several books on mathematics, including the influential work Logarithmus Hispanus (1618).
5. Demonstrated the ability to solve the most difficult mathematical problems of the era.
6. Developed trigonometry tables for navigation which made maritime exploration much more accurate and efficient.
7. Implemented the use of an uninterrupted decimal point and the “minus” sign in algebra.
8. Developed an early version of a slide rule, which predates the modern version by almost two hundred years.

Born 15 February 1588, Felsberg, Germany. Died 17 March 1652, Ziegenhain, Germany.
