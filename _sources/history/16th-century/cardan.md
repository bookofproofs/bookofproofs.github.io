**Girolamo Cardan** or **Cardano** was an Italian doctor and mathematician who is famed for his work _Ars Magna _ which was the first Latin treatise devoted solely to algebra. In it he gave the methods of solution of the cubic and quartic equations which he had learnt from Tartaglia.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for solving the cubic equation.
2. Authored the influential algebra textbook "Ars Magna" in 1545.
3. Explored the probability of casting various dice games, including the now famous "Cardano's wheel".
4. Oversaw the development of the fundamental theorem of algebra, which demonstrated the capability of solving any algebraic equation regardless of degree. 
5. Studied projective geometry and numbers theory.
6. In 1570 published a treatise on solving cubic equations and interpreting the solutions found in terms of areas, with the title "De Regula Aliza".
7. Developed mathematical rules for various games, including "Baruffa".
8. Authored and published "Libro di algebra" in 1545, which discussed algebraic problems and solutions.
9. Established the fundamental properties of complex numbers and related the imaginary number i to the problem of roots of negative numbers.
10. Pre-figured the Law of Inertia, which is a component of the Laws of Motion.

Born 24 September 1501, Pavia, Duchy of Milan (now Italy). Died 21 September 1576, Rome (now Italy).
