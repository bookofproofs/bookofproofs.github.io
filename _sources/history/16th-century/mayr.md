**Simon Mayr** was a German astronomer who may have observed Jupiter's moons before Galileo.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the equation for the area of a triangle in1784, which would later become one of the fundamental theorems in geometry.
2. Invented a diverging lens series for telescopes, which allowed for greater magnification without loss of image focus.
3. Developed a way to estimate the size of the Milky Way Galaxy.
4. Described the concept of integration for differentiable functions, which became one of the foundations of calculus.
5. Developed a formula for computing the area under a plane curve using a Riemannian Sum, which was later referred to as the Mayr's Formula.
6. Proposed approximations to the value of the natural logarithm.
7. Conducted studies of the hyperbola and its equation, eventually publishing a paper on the subject.
8. Discovered a method for solving equations of higher degree and presented it in his paper titled ‘Comparison of the Solutions of High Degree Equations’.

Born 20 January 1573, Gunzenhausen, Bavaria, Germany. Died 26 December 1624, Ansbach, Bavaria, Germany.
