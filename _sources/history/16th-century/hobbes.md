**Thomas Hobbes** was an English scholar and amateur mathematician who wrote on optics and on geometry. He attacked the 'new' methods of mathematical analysis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the geometrical method of scientific reasoning and analysis, which is the foundation of modern mathematical thinking. 
2. Suggested a dual approach to solving equations and understanding geometric problems. 
3. Wrote the book “De Corpore” which outlined a revolutionary method of mathematical studies.
4. Wrote the book “Leviathan” which stressed the importance of the geometric method. 
5. Invented a form of the calculus of variations and applied this to the analysis of mechanics. 
6. Recognized the importance of a comprehensive definition of space and used the concept of a continuum in his work. 
7. Expanded upon Descartes’ work on analytic geometry and solved problems using infinitesimal methods. 
8. Was among the first to propose the use of coordinate geometry. 
9. Developed the use of algorithms for the solution of mathematical problems. 
10. Published influential treatises on the foundations of geometry, motion, and optics.

Born 5 April 1588, Westport, Malmesbury, Wiltshire, England. Died 4 December 1679, Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire, England.
