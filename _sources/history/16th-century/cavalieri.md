**Bonaventura Cavalieri** was an Italian mathematician who developed a method of indivisibles which became a factor in the development of the integral calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the method of indivisibles, which laid the foundation for integral calculus.
2. Established the first rigorous algorithms for calculating volumes and areas of geometric figures.
3. Pioneered the use of logarithms for numerical calculations.
4. Solved problems of applied geometry such as finding the centre of gravity of a triangle.
5. Derived new results for the surface area of solids of revolution and the slide-rule.
6. Introduced a new method for solving certain polynomial equations by the aid of three arithmetic operations.
7. Proposed a method for squaring the circle and gave a formula for measuring the arc of a circle.
8. Developed the method of Exhaustion which formed the basis of the mathematical analysis of infinitesimal numbers.
9. Provided the first explicit solution of the ‘Pappus problem’.
10. Proved the first modern form of Pascal’s Theorem.

Born 1598, Milan, Duchy of Milan, Habsburg Empire (now Italy). Died 30 November 1647, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy).
