**William Oughtred** was an English mathematician who is best known for his invention of an early form of the slide rule. He invented many new symbols including X for multiplication and :: for proportion.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He published a book, Clavis Mathematicae (Key to Mathematics), which explored the use of symbols in algebra, trigonometry and logarithms. 
2. He invented the slide rule, a device used to simplify calculations that was widely used until the development of the calculator.
3. He developed the cross-footed (x-y) notation form of Cartesian coordinates.
4. He is credited with developing an early form of infinity symbol.
5. He is known for introducing the "is new to" symbol, now known as the "equals sign".
6. He developed a variant of the sine and tangent trigonometric tables.
7. He wrote one of the earliest works on arithmetic, Arithmetica Infinitorum.

Born 5 March 1574, Eton, Buckinghamshire, England. Died 13 June 1660, Albury, Surrey, England.
