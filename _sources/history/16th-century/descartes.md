**René Descartes** was a French philosopher whose work, _La géométrie_, includes his application of algebra to geometry from which we now have Cartesian geometry. His work had a great influence on both mathematicians and philosophers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Cartesian coordinate system, allowing for the description of geometrical shapes using algebraic equations.
2. Was a major contributor to the development of analytical geometry, which combines algebra and geometry into a single branch of mathematics. 
3. Pioneered the use of letters as mathematical symbols and created a system of representing numbers as powers of two.
4. Established the principles of logic in mathematics through his work La Geometrie, which is considered the foundation of modern Algebra. 
5. Developed the Law of Conservation of Momentum, which explains how a body's momentum affects its motion.
6. Introduced the concept of infinitesimals and used them to develop calculus and the theory of equations.
7. Was the first to show how tangents can be drawn to curves, creating the field of differential calculus.
8. Created principles for solving quadratic equations, discovering their roots and understanding their solution.
9. Was the founder of rationalism and was a major contributor to the development of modern scientific methodology.

Born 31 March 1596, La Haye (now Descartes),Touraine, France. Died 11 February 1650, Stockholm, Sweden.
