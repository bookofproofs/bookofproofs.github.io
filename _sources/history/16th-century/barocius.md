* To understand events in Barozzi's life we need to look briefly at the history of Crete.
* Francesco attended school in Padua where he learnt Greek and Latin, then he studied at the University of Padua where mathematics was part of his course.
* Barozzi translated many other works including ones by Heron, Pappus and Archimedes.
* Barozzi was tried by the Inquisition and found guilty in around 1583, although it is not known exactly what were the charges against him.
* Found guilty of this, Barozzi had to provide silver crosses at the cost of 100 ducats and he received a suspended prison sentence.
