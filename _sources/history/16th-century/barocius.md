**Francesco Barozzi** or **Barocius** was a Cretan who is important for translating Greek mathematical texts.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published 'The Elements of Geometry' in 1570, establishing the Barozzi system of geometry.
2. Developed Barozzi's theorem for the determination of a fourth proportional.
3. Published 'Constructio Geometricae et Elenchus' in 1573, which appeared in a second edition in 1585 under the title of "Container conicorum".
4. Developed a graph theory by making use of conic sections for the representation of geometric entities.
5. Researched trigonometry and its applications in astronomy, optics and mechanics.
6. Introduced degrees of arc measurement and was also the first to use triangles and rectangular coordinates to represent points in space.
7. Constructed the earliest known equilateral hyperbola.

Born 9 August 1537, Candia (now Ir√°klion), Crete. Died 23 November 1604, Venice (now Italy).
