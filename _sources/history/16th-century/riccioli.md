**Giovanni Battista Riccioli** was an Italian astronomer and a Jesuit priest. He is known for his experiments with pendulums and falling bodies.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to measure an arc of the meridian in Italy, and accurately determined its length.
2. He forbade the use of negative roots of equations, and was one of the first to realize the importance of the use of imaginary roots.
3. He was the first to make extensive use of small fractions, and to employ the diophantine analysis in large numbers.
4. He pioneered in the use of the decimal notation for fractions, and for the mathematical notation for roots and powers.
5. He was the first to use decimal fractions in universal computation, and discovered a new form of the quadratic equation.
6. His works on spherical trigonometry and surveying revolutionized the way land surveying was approached.
7. He wrote a treatise on the epicycloid, the quintic equation, and the method of the isoperimetric problems.
8. He was the first to construct a reasonably accurate model of the Ptolemaic universe.

Born 17 April 1598, Ferrara (now Italy). Died 25 June 1671, Bologna (now Italy).
