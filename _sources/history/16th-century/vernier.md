**Pierre Vernier** was a French engineer best known for inventing the Vernier measuring scale.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Franche-Comté was a Habsburg possession controlled by the Spanish Habsburgs throughout Vernier's life.
* Vernier became a government official holding various positions such as military engineer for the Hapsburgs and director general of the treasury in Dole and Besançon, the capital of Franche- Comté.
* Vernier also held various government posts with the government of Spain and became a Conseiller du Roi.
* In fact the threat of war was never far away and during the last two years of Vernier's life Franche-Comté was frequently invaded by France.
* Like many other mathematicians and scientists of this period, Vernier worked on cartography and on surveying.
* In this book Vernier gives a table of sines and a method for deriving the angles of a triangle if its sides are known.
* He also describes his most famous invention, that of the vernier caliper, an instrument for accurately measuring length.
* It has two graduated scales, a main scale like a ruler and a second scale, the vernier, that slides parallel to the main scale and enables readings to be made to a fraction of a division on the main scale.

Born 19 August 1584, Ornans, Franche-Comté, Spanish Habsburgs (now France). Died 14 September 1638, Ornans, Franche-Comté, Spanish Habsburgs (now France).
