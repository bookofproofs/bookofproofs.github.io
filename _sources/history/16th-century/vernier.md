**Pierre Vernier** was a French engineer best known for inventing the Vernier measuring scale.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Vernier scale, a device used to make very precise measurements in a laboratory. 
2. Devised a method for measuring the diameter of a cannon barrel using two rods, which later came to be known as the Vernier caliper. 
3. Proved the duality between sections of a hyperbola and those of a cone and developed a formula for calculating the distances along a hyperbola. 
4. Developed a way to calculate the area of any given irregular figure. 
5. Published a book on mathematics, Harmonics and Geometry, which included diagrams illustrating the theory of the refraction of light and the mathematics of spherical perspective.

Born 19 August 1584, Ornans, Franche-Comté, Spanish Habsburgs (now France). Died 14 September 1638, Ornans, Franche-Comté, Spanish Habsburgs (now France).
