**Girard Desargues** was a French mathematician who was a founder of projective geometry. His work centred on the theory of conic sections and perspective.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Desargues was an important influence in the development of projective geometry, a field that studies the properties of geometric figures that remain unchanged after perspective projection.
2. He formulated the concept of concurrency that states that three lines are concurrent at a point if the lines pass through the same point when extended.
3. He formulated the Desargues Theorem, which states that if two triangles are in perspective and two pairs of corresponding sides are parallel, then their corresponding lines intersect at the same point.
4. He was the first to propose the concept of cyclic order, now known as Desargues' theorem on connecting lines.
5. He published a book, Brouillon Project, which contained his ideas on projective geometry and constituted a major breakthrough in the field.
6. He is credited with developing the theory of inversive geometry and was the first to introduce barycentric coordinates in Euclidean space.
7. He proposed the use of acceleration and the line at infinity for solving geometric problems.
8. He was the first to describe the complete algorithms for calculating tangents of curves.

Born 21 February 1591, Lyon, France. Died October 1661, Lyon, France.
