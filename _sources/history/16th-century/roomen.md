**Adriaan van Roomen** or **Adrianus Romanus** was a Flemish mathematician who calculated `$\pi$` to 16 decimal places using Archimedes' method.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the solutions to polynomial equations of degree higher than two; was the first mathematician to do so.
2. Developed a modified Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.
3. Created two formulas to effectively calculate roots of cubic equations.
4. Demonstrated that xⁿ–a^n = (x–a) (xⁿ–1 + xⁿ–2a + xⁿ–3a² + ... + aⁿ–1).
5. Proved that the area of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the areas of its constituent triangles.
6. Investigated the number of solutions to a Diophantine equation.
7. Discovered the prime counting function.
8. Determined that pi is irrational.

Born 29 September 1561, Leuven, Spanish Netherlands (now Belgium). Died 4 May1615, Mainz, Germany.
