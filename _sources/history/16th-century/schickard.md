**Wilhelm Schickard** was a German astronomer who invented a calculating machine long before Pascal. He worked on astronomy, mathematics and surveying.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. First to construct a mechanical calculator.
2. Designed a machine to calculate astronomical tables known as the Schickard calculator.
3. Developed a binary counting system for automating the calculation of astronomical positions.
4. Discovered a correct method for determining the day of the week for any given date.
5. Discovered the possibility of false position calculations and developed methods for improving them.
6. Proposed a system for using Pascal's triangle in calculations and worked on methods for solving linear equations.
7. Predicted the introduction of probability theory and the use of analytical geometry in science.
8. Used mathematical methods to calculate the volumes of various types of objects, such as spheres and cones.
9. Developed methods for calculating sums and differences of geometric figures, such as triangles and circles.
10. Created methods of calculating differences and sums of infinite and infinitely small functions.

Born 22 April 1592, Herrenberg (near T端bingen), W端rttemberg (now Germany). Died 24 October 1635, T端bingen, W端rttemberg (now Germany).
