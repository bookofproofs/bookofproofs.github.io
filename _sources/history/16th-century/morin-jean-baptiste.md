**Jean-Baptiste Morin** was a French astrologer and astronomer who attempted to solve the longitude problem using lunar observations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new calculus of infinitesimals that served as a precursor to modern calculus.
2. Developed a treatise on integral calculus.
3. Developed a botanical and mathematical treatise on the properties of multiple angles.
4. Established the fundamental principles of asymptotic analysis of curved lines.
5. Pioneered the mathematical study of interactions between curves.
6. Solved certain complex quadratic equations.
7. Discovered Morin's theorem, a theorem related to the numerical solution of certain cubic equations.
8. Established the principles of differential equations that form the basis of Fourier's theorem.
9. Developed numerical methods for solving non-linear equations.
10. Developed the principles of least squares, used to identify optimal solutions to a wide variety of problems.
