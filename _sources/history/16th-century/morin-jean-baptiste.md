**Jean-Baptiste Morin** was a French astrologer and astronomer who attempted to solve the longitude problem using lunar observations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* During the years 1613 to 1621 Morin was employed by the Bishop of Boulogne.
* During this period Morin published a defence of Aristotle (1624) and he also worked on optics.
* Morin was appointed professor of mathematics at the Collège Royal in 1630 and he was to hold this post until his death.
* Morin remained firmly convinced that the Earth was fixed in space.
* Morin is best remembered for his attempts to solve the longitude problem.
* Since Morin put forward his method for a longitude prize, a committee was set up by Cardinal Richelieu to evaluate it.
* Étienne Pascal, Mydorge, Beaugrand, Hérigone, J C Boulenger and L de la Porte served on the committee and they were in dispute with Morin for the five years after he made his proposal.
* Morin realised that instruments had to be improved, improved methods of solving spherical triangles had to be found and better lunar tables were needed.
* Morin refused to listen to objections to his proposal.
* Even while the dispute was going on, in 1638, Morin attacked Descartes saying that he had realised as soon as they met how bad his philosophy was.
* These disputes alienated Morin from the scientific community.

Born 23 February 1583, Villefranche, Beaujolais, France. Died 6 November 1656, Paris, France.
