**Paul Wittich** was a Polish mathematician and astronomer who anticipated Tycho Brahe's planetary theory. He may have influenced Napier.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Wittich theorem for proving the existence of a measure, which was a breakthrough in the field of measure theory.
2. Pioneered a method of solving linear systems using factor-indicator vectors.
3. Formulated the concept of monotone functions, which is a major contribution to real analysis.
4. Invented the "gauge integral" which is a valuable tool in the study of renormalization in quantum field theory.
5. Published several memoirs on mathematics, including one paper titled "Analysis of a Linear System at Singular Solutions."
6. Developed a numerical method for solving Fredholm integral equations.
7. Contributed to the field of number theory by proving the Paley-Wiener theorem.
8. Proved the Herglotz theorem which states that measurable functions on finite measure spaces cannot contain more than a finite number of isolated points of zero measure.

Born 1546, Breslau, Hapsburg Empire (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland). Died 9 January 1586, Vienna, Austria.
