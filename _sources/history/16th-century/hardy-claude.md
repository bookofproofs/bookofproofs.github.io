**Claude Hardy** was a French lawyer and amateur mathematician who made Latin translations of some of Euclid's work.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Sébastien Hardy was an educated man who used his skill in languages to made translations from Spanish and Italian.
* We know nothing of Claude's upbringing other than the locations of the homes in which he lived.
* It is possible, of course, that Hardy did translate the work when nine years old but it was only published some six years later.
* The poetry was translated from Latin to French by Hardy and published as a prose work Les Distique Moraux de Michel Verin Ⓣ(The moral disorders of Michel Verin).
* translated into French by Claude Hardy, Parisian, aged eleven years.
* In 1625 we know for certain that Claude Hardy was a practising lawyer in Paris.
* Hardy, in his capacity as a lawyer, worked for the Parliament in Paris from 1625.
* He became involved with a group of mathematicians working in Paris at this time, in particular becoming a friend of Claude Mydorge.
* This was the beginning of a close friendship between Hardy and Descartes during which they exchanged views on all the scientific and philosophical issues of the day.
* Hardy's great skill in languages made him extremely useful to Descartes and to other scholars who often turned to him for help with translations, particularly from Arabic.
* It is believed that "Antoine Vasset" was a pseudonym for Claude Hardy.
* In 1630, under his own name, Hardy published Examen Ⓣ(Examination) and in 1638 he published Refutation.
* In addition to Mydorge and J de Beaugrand, Hardy exposed the fallacy of Yvon's construction ....
* Descartes wrote to Mersenne making sure that others, particularly his friend Hardy, be given details of the controversy.
* An argument followed in which Hardy took Descartes' side, as did Mydorge and Desargues, while Fermat was supported by Roberval and Étienne Pascal.
* The important point to make here is the high value which Descartes placed on Hardy's opinions and support.
* Finally, we know Hardy undertook chemistry experiments with Annibal Barlet, a physician who taught alchemy in Paris, and with Pierre Borel, before he became physician to Louis XIV in 1654.
* After the death of Descartes in 1650, information about Hardy vanishes and we know nothing about the last 25 years of his life.

Born 1598, Le Mans, France. Died 5 April 1678, Paris, France.
