**Claude Hardy** was a French lawyer and amateur mathematician who made Latin translations of some of Euclid's work.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He married Marie Belot Despontis in Paris around 1596 and their son Claude, one of their seven children, was born in Le Mans.
* Sébastien Hardy was an educated man who used his skill in languages to made translations from Spanish and Italian.
* The Hardy family moved to Paris soon after Claude was born where Sébastien was named as a Conseiller at the court.
* We know nothing of Claude's upbringing other than the locations of the homes in which he lived.
* composed in Latin by Erasmus; translated into French by Claude Hardy, Parisian, aged nine years.
* This, of course, suggests that Claude Hardy was indeed born in 1604 (being nine years old in 1613), but this seems somewhat at odds with when his father was known to be in Le Mans.
* It is possible, of course, that Hardy did translate the work when nine years old but it was only published some six years later.
* Although it might seem impossible for so young a child to translate from Latin to French, we do know that Hardy had the reputation for being a remarkable linguist with knowledge of thirty-six languages.
* Even if these claims are somewhat exaggerated, nevertheless it is clear that Hardy, taking after his father, had a remarkable ability to learn languages.
* The poetry was translated from Latin to French by Hardy and published as a prose work Les Distique Moraux de Michel Verin Ⓣ(The moral disorders of Michel Verin).
* translated into French by Claude Hardy, Parisian, aged eleven years.
* Perhaps given the young age of the translator, it is not too surprising that the translation has been described as "lively, sometimes obscure, and full of dubious and antiquated expressions." In the Preface, Hardy pays a fine tribute to his father.
* Nothing of Hardy's education in Paris is known and the first information about him after 1614 is not until 1622 when records show that Claude Hardy married Perrette Presche in Paris.
* In 1625 we know for certain that Claude Hardy was a practising lawyer in Paris.
* Hardy, in his capacity as a lawyer, worked for the Parliament in Paris from 1625.
* He became involved with a group of mathematicians working in Paris at this time, in particular becoming a friend of Claude Mydorge.
* This was the beginning of a close friendship between Hardy and Descartes during which they exchanged views on all the scientific and philosophical issues of the day.
* Hardy's great skill in languages made him extremely useful to Descartes and to other scholars who often turned to him for help with translations, particularly from Arabic.
* It is believed that "Antoine Vasset" was a pseudonym for Claude Hardy.
* In 1630, under his own name, Hardy published Examen Ⓣ(Examination) and in 1638 he published Refutation.
* Hardy took part in the meetings Mersenne organised with Roberval, Gassendi, Descartes and others such as Étienne Pascal and later his young son Blaise Pascal.
* Descartes wrote to Mersenne making sure that others, particularly his friend Hardy, be given details of the controversy.
* An argument followed in which Hardy took Descartes' side, as did Mydorge and Desargues, while Fermat was supported by Roberval and Étienne Pascal.
* The important point to make here is the high value which Descartes placed on Hardy's opinions and support.
* Finally, we know Hardy undertook chemistry experiments with Annibal Barlet, a physician who taught alchemy in Paris, and with Pierre Borel, before he became physician to Louis XIV in 1654.
* After the death of Descartes in 1650, information about Hardy vanishes and we know nothing about the last 25 years of his life.

Born 1598, Le Mans, France. Died 5 April 1678, Paris, France.
