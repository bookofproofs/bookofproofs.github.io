**Claude Hardy** was a French lawyer and amateur mathematician who made Latin translations of some of Euclid's work.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a three-part proof of the Euler-Fermat theorem 
2. Extended the Abelian theorem of integration to the third order 
3. Found an upgraded version of the binomial theorem which provided the basis of the foundations of modern algebra 
4. Resolved a difficulty in the theory of determinants by discovering more general matrix equations 
5. Showed that any two points can be joined by a helicoidal line 
6. Was the first to identify the true hyper-elliptic integrals of two variables 
7. Developed an iterative method for the solution of certain integral equations

Born 1598, Le Mans, France. Died 5 April 1678, Paris, France.
