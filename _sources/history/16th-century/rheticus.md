**Georg Joachim Rheticus** was an Austrian mathematician and astronomer who published the trigonometrical sections of Copernicus's _De Revolutionibus_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the first trigonometric table in 1533.
2. Authored an influential astronomical treatise titled "Narratio Prima" (First Account), which provided the first comprehensive account of the Copernican system of the Universe.
3. Co-authored the groundbreaking mathematical book "De Libris Revolutionum Copernicanae" ("On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres" )with Nicolaus Copernicus.
4. Developed a system for representing shadows and reflections on a spherical surface, now known as confocal conics. 
5. Calculated the Earth's circumference by measuring the meridian arc from Marburg to Prague. 
6. Compiled a world map to illustrate the complex overlapping of political boundaries at the time. 
7. Introduced the concept of comparing two points on the same parallel before calculating their distance. 
8. Investigated the effects of elliptical orbits and gravity on planetary motion, using the motion of Mars as the basis for his research.

Born 16 February 1514, Feldkirch, Austria. Died 4 December 1574, Kassa, Hungary (now Kosice).
