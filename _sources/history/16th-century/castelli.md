**Benedetto Castelli** was an Italian Benedictine who was a student of Galileo.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered and mathematically described the relationship between the speed of a fluid and its pressure, known as Bernoulli’s principle.
2. Developed the mathematical theory for the use of logarithms.
3. Developed a method for determining the area under a curve using the calculus of indivisibles.
4. Was the first to interpret the mathematical constant “e”  as the limiting value of (1 + 1/x)x
5. Was one of the first to use exponents and exponential notation.
6. Demonstrated the law of refraction of light.
7. Proved theorems connecting the radii of curvature of conic sections (which he also named) to angles and lengths.
8. Proved the so-called "right triangle theorem" which states that in any right triangle the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides equals the square of the length of the hypotenuse.

Born 1578, Brescia (now Italy). Died 9 April 1643, Rome (now Italy).
