**François Viète** was a French amateur mathematician and astronomer who introduced the first systematic algebraic notation in his book _In artem analyticam isagoge _. He was also involved in deciphering codes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algebraic notation which used symbols for unknowns and coefficients;
2. Established the science of analytic geometry, combining algebra and geometry;
3. Developed principles for the solution of polynomial equations with several unknowns;
4. Developed the product rule for differentiation of polynomials;
5. Discovered the relationship between an inscribed and circumscribed polygons;
6. Wrote treatises on trigonometry, spherical triangles and cyclometric equations; 
7. Solved many applied problems in mathematics, such as calculating shoreline geometry, predicting solar eclipses, and surveying land.

Born 1540, Fontenay-le-Comte, Poitou (now Vendée), France. Died 13 December 1603, Paris, France.
