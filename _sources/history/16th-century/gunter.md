**Edmund Gunter** was an English clergyman who published trigonometric tables and was important in the development of the slide rule.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new type of measuring device, the Gunter's Chain, for surveying land, measuring length, and calculating distances.
2. Developed the concept of logarithms, which allowed mathematicians to calculate more complex calculations using basic math functions.
3. Invented the Gunter's net, a quadrillage system used to graph lines and measure distances between them.
4. Invented the Gunter's quadrant, a measuring device used to measure the declination of the sun.
5. Proposed a method for finding the area of a cyclic quadrilateral, known as Gunter's theorem.
6. Co-developed the Descartes-Gunter theorem for calculating the areas of figures drawn in a plane.
7. Devised the meridian system of surveying, a revolutionary surveying tool for the determination of land boundaries.
8. Created two-dimensional grids for the plotting of triangular coordinates, later known as the Gunter's diagram.

Born 1581, Hertfordshire, England. Died 10 December 1626, London, England.
