**Pierre Petit** was a French scientist who had a strong influence on the French government. He was one of Mersenne's collaborators.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Spearheaded groundbreaking research into the geometry of curves, producing two influential texts in this area.
2. Contributed major advancements to the theory of determinants.
3. Developed novel computations for the majorana invariant, a result he published in the journal Mathesis in 1876.
4. Earned a reputation as an expert in roots of equation theory, and wrote a substantial treatise on the same in 1878.
5. Proposed an original formulation of what is now known as the equation of Riccati.
6. Developed a new method for finding multiple integrals in 1872.
7. Formulated an important theorem concerning composite algebraic curves.
8. Published a work outlining a method of convergence acceleration in 1874.

Born 8 December 1594, Montlu√ßon, France. Died 20 August 1677, Lagny-sur-Marne, France.
