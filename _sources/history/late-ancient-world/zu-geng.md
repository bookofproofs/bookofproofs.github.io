**Zu Geng** was a Chinese mathematician whose greatest achievement was to compute the diameter of a sphere of a given volume.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Zu Geng's greatest achievement was to compute the diameter of a sphere of a given volume.
* And, therefore, Zu suggested a new hypothesis himself.
* Li Chunfeng then goes on to indicate how Zu Geng proved his result.
* Zu cut his circumscribed cube into 8 small equal cubes.
* This is significant, for Zu Geng has seen the link between squaring the circle and cubing the sphere, and has been able to translate progress on the first of these two problems into progress on the second.
* Zu Geng's son, Zu Hao, was also well known as a mathematical astronomer making contributions to the science of the calendar.

Born about 450, Jiankang, (now Nanjing, Kiangsu province), China. Died about 520, China.
