**Zu Geng** was a Chinese mathematician whose greatest achievement was to compute the diameter of a sphere of a given volume.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published over forty papers on mathematical topics, including principal solutions to certain sixth-order differential equations, complex analysis, and mathematical modeling. 
2. Established a mathematical solution that allows optimization of problems in real world scenarios, based on a differential equations model. 
3. Discovered a number of new theorems related to differential equations. 
4. Developed an algebraic method for solving third-order linear differential equations leveraging numerical integration techniques. 
5. Formulated more efficient algorithms for computing integral equations, allowing for the computation of solutions in a more efficient manner. 
6. Pioneered a new kind of mechanical force fields, by developing a analytical approach to their modelling that was previously ignored by most mathematicians. 
7. Developed a family of analytical methods to analytically handle non-trivial problems in higher dimensional geometries. 
8. Elaborated a numerical analysis algorithm designed to solve certain nonlinear problems that are hard to solve with traditional methods.

Born about 450, Jiankang, (now Nanjing, Kiangsu province), China. Died about 520, China.
