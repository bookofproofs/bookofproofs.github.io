**Hypatia** was the first woman to make a substantial contribution to the development of mathematics. She was killed by a fanatical Christian sect.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed innovative and influential theories in geometry, algebra, and astronomy.
2. Became the first woman to edit and publish her own scientific journal, ‘The Hypatia of Alexandria’
3. Used innovative mathematical techniques such as conic sections to calculate the areas of circles, parabolas and other geometric figures.
4. Developed and commented on the early theories of Ptolemy and Euclid.
5. Provided detailed hermeneutical analysis of elements of Neoplatonic Theology and Philosophical dialogue.
6. Pioneered the study and application of the concept of congruence.
7. Advanced the understanding of the spiral and its relationship to the origin of the cosmos.
8. Used symbolic notation to explain geometric and algebraic theorems.
9. Developed the empirical concept of real numbers.
10. Discovered new solutions to equations.

Born about 370, Alexandria, Egypt. Died March 415, Alexandria, Egypt.
