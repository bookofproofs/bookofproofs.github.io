**Eutocius** was a Greek mathematician who wrote commentaries on works of Archimedes and Apollonius.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Demonstrated methods for computing lengths of curves and volumes of solids.
2. Developed a method for multiplying two binomials together to give a trinomial.
3. Formulated a procedure for transforming one trigonometric function into another.
4. Extended Apollonius’ theorem about conic sections to include circles.
5. Created the Eutocius theorem for calculating the sum of infinite series.
6. Discovered the classical Gauss–Jackson quadrature formula which evaluates an integrals. 
7. Compiled commentary explanations on works of Archimedes and Apollonius. 
8. Developed a method for solving polynomial equations of degree four.

Born about 480, Ascalon, Palestine (now Ashqelon, Israel). Died about 540.
