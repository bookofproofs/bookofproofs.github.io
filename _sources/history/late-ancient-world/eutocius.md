**Eutocius** was a Greek mathematician who wrote commentaries on works of Archimedes and Apollonius.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Eutocius wrote commentaries on three works of Archimedes.
* From this it was thought that Eutocius was a pupil of Isidorus and his dates were deduced from this information.
* However, further investigation showed that this contradicted other information such the dedications that Eutocius makes in some of his other works.
* It was then realised that the comment at the end of Eutocius's commentary to Archimedes' On the Sphere and Cylinder was inserted by a later editor of the work who was indeed a pupil of Isidorus of Miletus.
* It is thought that the first of Eutocius's commentaries on Archimedes was written around 510.
* Ascalon, where Eutocius was born, had a long history and is mentioned in the Old Testament as Askelon.
* It seems likely that Eutocius left Ascalon and went to Alexandria to study.
* Certainly this reads as if Eutocius is addressing his teacher and Paul Tannery's deduction seems secure.
* One has to assume that indeed Ammonius did approve, for Eutocius went on to write commentaries on other works by Archimedes, namely Measurement of the circle and On plane equilibria.
* Eutocius also edited and wrote commentaries on the first 4 books of the Conics of Apollonius.
* One sees immediately that commentators such as Eutocius are very important in the history of mathematics and many important works have only survived due to the work of the commentators.
* Eutocius does not appear to have done any original work.
* Obviously nothing of real astronomical interest has come down from Eutocius.

Born about 480, Ascalon, Palestine (now Ashqelon, Israel). Died about 540.
