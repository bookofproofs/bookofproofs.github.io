**Xu Yue** was a Chinese mathematician who wrote a commentary of the _Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Xu Yue was a pupil of Liu Hong and he studied mathematics under the famous calendar expert.
* Liu Hong worked at the Imperial Observatory and it was there that Xu Yue held discussions with him and also with the head of the Astronomical Bureau.
* It was natural, therefore that Xu Yue would gain expertise from these men in astronomy and calendar science.
* It is reported that Xu Yue wrote a commentary on the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art.
* This preceded the major commentary written by Liu Hui in the second half of the third century, and it would appear that Liu Hui commented on a version of the text which did not include Xu Yue's comments.
* As a result Xu Yue's commentary has not come down to us.
* Whether Xu Yue wrote the Shushu jiyi (Notes on Traditions of Arithmetic Methods) is uncertain.
* Finally, Xu Yue talks about calculations of the nine balls.

Born about 160, Donglai, Shandong province, China. Died about 227, China.
