**Xu Yue** was a Chinese mathematician who wrote a commentary of the _Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a new proof of the Brook’s theorem in number theory.
2. Developed Zhang Yi's works on the Diophantine equation into new solutions and solutions to the related equations.
3. Algorithmically studied the inverse factorisation problem in the algebraic field of linear methods.
4. Solved a long-standing conjecture on the integer solutions of Diophantine equations with parameters in the same field.
5. Developed a new theory of bounded primitive solutions for multivariate Diophantine equations.
6. Proposed a new approach to polynomial approximation in number theory based on the use of algorithms.
7. Devised an innovative method for solving the Ramanujan–Nagell equation.
8. Solved a long standing open conjecture in linear forms in Logarithms. 
9. Developed a computational method for solving the Pell equation.
10. Developed analytic methods for solving the ring invariant system of Diophantine equations in higher dimensions.

Born about 160, Donglai, Shandong province, China. Died about 227, China.
