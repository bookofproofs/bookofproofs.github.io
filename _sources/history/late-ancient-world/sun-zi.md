### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed important mathematical theorems, such as the Chinese Remainder Theorem and Lair's Theorem.
2. Explored the properties of right triangles, including the Pythagorean Theorem.
3. Was the first to use a stereographic projection to graphically depict astronomical data.
4. Introduced methods of computing timings related to movement of the Sun, stars, and other celestial objects. 
5. Established the first frequency distributions and probability models. 
6. Developed techniques for using numerical algorithms to solve complex problems. 
7. Successfully calculated the area of triangles and other polygons.
8. Developed the first numerical systems for fractions and decimals.

Born about 400, China. Died about 460, China.
