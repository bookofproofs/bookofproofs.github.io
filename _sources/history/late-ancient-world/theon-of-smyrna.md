**Theon** was a Greek philosopher who described how prime numbers, geometrical numbers such as squares, progressions, music and astronomy are interrelated.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the first commentary in Greek on [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621] of Geometry, providing an alternative to the existing commentary by Apollonius of Perga. 
2. Drafted the “Principles of Philosophy”, an important work of Stoic Logic.
3. Developed several theorems in mathematics and wrote “On the Moving Sphere” – a work studying the movement of planets and stars. 
4. He is credited with inventing the trajectory-preserving property of conic sections.
5. Among his inventions were the Anticipating Set Values method; a theorem for pyramidal solids, a theorem for tetrahedral solids, another theorem for pentagonal solids, as well as theorems for cones, circles and irregularities of a sphere. 
6. He is said to have been the first to prove theorems on concurrence of three lines in a triangle and the ratio of chords in a circle.
7. He proposed a method of integration and analyzed the “Archimedes’ Spiral” by seeking its tangents in order to calculate its area.

Born about AD 70, Smyrna (now Izmir), Turkey. Died about AD 135.
