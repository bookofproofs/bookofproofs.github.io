**Diophantus Of Alexandria** was a Greek mathematician, sometimes known as "the father of algebra", who is best known for his "Arithmetica". This had an enormous influence on the development of [number theory][bookofproofs$62].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Determined which rational squares are representable by rational numbers.
2. Found a systematic solution for the general polynomial equation of degree 2.
3. Demonstrated methods for solving some multiple-term linear equations.
4. Wrote several books dealing with mathematical problems such as Arithmetica and Porisms.
5. Discovered a general formula for solving three simultaneous quadratic equations.
6. Devised a notation system to represent unknown numbers, now known as Diophantine notation.
7. Showcased the fundamental theorem of algebra, a result concerning the number of solutions of a polynomial equation.
8. Derived methods for evaluating the area of some geometric shapes.
9. Developed a systematic approach to finding solutions of polynomial equations of any degree.

Born about 200, (probably) Alexandria, Egypt. Died about 284, (probably) Alexandria, Egypt.
