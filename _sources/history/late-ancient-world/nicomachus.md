**Nicomachus** was one of the leading members of the Pythagorean School whose _Introduction to Arithmetic_ was the standard arithmetic text for more than 1000 years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theorem for finding the sum of all perfect numbers, which is currently known as the Nicomachus Theorem.
2. Compiled a compilation of mathematics textbooks titled Introduction to Arithmetic and wrote several additional works on mathematics.
3. Developed the concept and method of categorizing numbers as odd, even or composite.
4. Advanced the study of ratios and proportions and formulated the first provision of the geometric series.
5. Wrote the first systematic treatise on mathematics, which outlined the fundamentals of arithmetic and algebra.
6. Discovered mathematical progressions and provided a unified definition of algebraic concepts. 
7. Provided the earliest documented proof of Euclid's Theorem.
8. Built on the number theories of his predecessors and clarified numerical systems.
9. Generously provided mathematical advice and guidance to contemporaries and future generations.
10. Coined the term modulo (as well as he “modus,” from which modulo is derived), which is used today in coding and other forms of computer language.

Born about 60, Gerasa, Roman Syria (possibly now Jarash, Jordan). Died about 120.
