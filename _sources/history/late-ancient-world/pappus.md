**Pappus** is the last of the great Greek geometers and one of his theorems is cited as the basis of modern projective geometry. He wrote commentaries on [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621] and Ptolemy's _Almagest_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pappus devised the Pappus Chain Theorem, which gives a formula for calculating the volume of a conic solid with two circular bases.
2. Pappus invented the theorem of Pappus on inscribed figures, which states that the area of the inscribed figures of a triangle is four times the area of the corresponding cyclic quadrangle.
3. Pappus proposed the Pappus Hexagon Theorem, which states that the area of a hexagon inscribed in a circle is equal to three times the area of a triangle with the same base and altitude.
4. Pappus also formulated the concept of “Pappus Triangle”, which states that the sum of the angle bisectors of any triangle is 180 degrees.
5. Pappus is credited with the theorem on the length of a power line, which states that the product of the segments of a line divided into three parts by two points is greater than the sum of the squares of those segments.
6. Pappus established the Pappus Graph theorem, which states the relationship between the coordinates of the vertices of a triangle and the quadrilateral whose sides are parallel to the sides of the triangle.

Born about 290, Alexandria, Egypt. Died about 350.
