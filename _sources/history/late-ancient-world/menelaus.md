**Menelaus** was one of the later Greek geometers who applied spherical geometry to astronomy. He is best known for the so-called Menelaus's theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the concept of analytic geometry, which provided the basis for modern mathematics and science.
2. Developed a method of integration for determining the position of an object in space, which became the basis for calculus.
3. Proved Euler's theorem, which is a cornerstone of number theory and advanced algebra.
4. Developed the concept of the "parabola" which describes the motion of a projectile in a curved manner.
5. Advanced the method of continued fractions and applied it to various problems in mathematics. 
6. Developed a method of proving theorems involving a category of higher-order geometric figures called “curvilinear shapes”.
7. Determined the number of solutions to equations with higher powers and fractions.
8. Introduced the Thales' Theorem, which states that if two equal straight lines intersect a circle at points A and B, then AB, at any other point P on the circumference of the circle, the triangle ABP is similar to the triangle ABC.

Born about 70, (possibly) Alexandria, Egypt. Died about 130.
