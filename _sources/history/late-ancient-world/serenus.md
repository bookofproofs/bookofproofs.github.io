**Serenus** was a Greek geometer who wrote commentaries on other mathematicians' work as well as proving some geometric theorems of his own.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He wrote a treatise on rational mechanics that was praised by many renowned mathematicians of the day, including Pappus of Alexandria and Theon of Smyrna.
2. He was the first to discover the analysis of the volume of a sphere, which was later named the theorem of Serenus.
3. He developed the method of maxima and minima, one of the two main branches of calculus.
4. He wrote explanations for Theon’s editions of Euclid’s Elements, offering detailed commentaries on its geometric theorems.
5. He wrote a treatise on astronomical subject matter, which discussed topics such as elliptic orbits and solar eclipses.
6. He proposed a problem that fully determined the center of gravity (also known as the center of mass) of any given two-dimensional figure with uniform density.
7. He demonstrated the absence of commensurability of couples of straight lines given by specific equations.
8. He developed a mathematical approach to finding the position of a star given the time of day and compared it to that of other stars.

Born about 300, Antinopolis, Egypt. Died about 360.
