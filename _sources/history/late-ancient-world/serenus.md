**Serenus** was a Greek geometer who wrote commentaries on other mathematicians' work as well as proving some geometric theorems of his own.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It can also be deduced from a copy of the second treatise of Serenus which has survived.
* Serenus was a commentator on the texts of others but, unlike some commentators, he was a fine mathematician in his own right.
* The two treatises by Serenus are On the Section of a Cylinder and On the Section of a Cone both of which have survived.
* Serenus shows how to find the cylinder which is cut in the ellipse EEE.
* It appears that Peithon's work treated as a bit of a joke and Serenus tries to in these propositions to show that Peithon's ideas are mathematically sound.
* In the first 57 propositions in On the Section of a Cone Serenus examined triangular sections of right and scalene cones made by planes passing through the vertex.
* Serenus wrote a commentary on Apollonius's Conics unfortunately is lost, except for a fragment preserved by Theon of Smyrna.
* That he wrote such a work is confirmed by Serenus in his own writings.

Born about 300, Antinopolis, Egypt. Died about 360.
