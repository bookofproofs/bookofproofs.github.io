**Proclus** was a Greek philosopher who became head of Plato's Academy and is important mathematically for his commentaries on the work of other mathematicians.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proclus wrote the Treatise on Elements, a basic summary of mathematics from previous Greek mathematics traditions.
2. Proclus was the first to recognize spatial and geometrical relationships in the movement of the celestial bodies, laying the groundwork for later mathematicians to develop theories of celestial motion.
3. Proclus developed a novel concept of the volume of a cone using its height and the radius of its base, a form of geometry later known as conic sections.
4. Proclus was the first to propose the use of irrational numbers, showing that certain values in geometry theory could not be represented as rational numbers.
5. Proclus wrote the Commentary on [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621], providing insight into Euclid's original works and making his theories accessible to later mathematicians.

Born about 411, Constantinople (now Istanbul), Byzantium (now Turkey). Died 17 April 485, Athens, Greece.
