**Marinus** succeeded Proclus as head of the Academy at Athens. He published some work on astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* When Proclus wrote a commentary on the Myth of Er, he dedicated it to Marinus.
* Marinus succeeded Proclus as head of the Academy at Athens in 485.
* Marinus was a great believer in mathematics, something which he shared with fellow late Neoplatonists.
* Although Marinus followed closely the views of his teacher, Proclus he did show originality which is much to his credit.
* Yet when Marinus felt that Proclus was in error he was quite prepared to give his own views.
* One concerns the Milky Way and Marinus discusses whether it is affected by precession.
* However this was still not the accepted view in the time of Marinus, who argues against this hypothesis in this commentary.
* Marinus did claim, however, that the Milky Way was part of the sphere of fixed stars and so underwent precession in the same way as the fixed stars.
* Marinus makes use of ideas by Pappus in making his corrections.

Born about 450, Neapolis, Palestine (called Shechem in Bible, now Nablus, Israel). Died about 500, possibly Athens, Greece.
