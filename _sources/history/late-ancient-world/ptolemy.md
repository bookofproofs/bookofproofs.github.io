**Ptolemy** was the most influential of Greek astronomers and geographers of his time. He propounded the geocentric theory of the solar system that prevailed for 1400 years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a system of geography, with a table of coordinates, and instructions for mapping, that became the foundation of later cartography. 
2. Came up with the first scientific approach to creating a three-dimensional map of the world.
3. Developed a sophisticated trigonometric and spherical geometry system, allowing him to calculate the position of celestial and terrestrial objects. 
4. Established a geocentric cosmology, and created Mathematical models to predict the motion of the Sun, Moon, and the five known planets. 
5. Developed an improved form of the Egyptian calendar, which served as the basis for the Georgian calendar. 
6. Produced an accurate table of chords (which allowed for the calculation of angles from the sides of a triangle) and the first work on conic sections (shapes such as ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas).
7. Published the first known trigonometry table, containing the first known trigonometrical functions.
8. Transformed [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621] and other astronomical data into Greek mathematical language.
9. Identified important geometric proofs and theorems, and made contributions to the theory of proportions. 
10. Developed a systematic approach to data collection and analysis that laid the groundwork for modern scientific research.

Born about AD 85, Egypt. Died about AD 165, Alexandria, Egypt.
