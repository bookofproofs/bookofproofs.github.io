**Theon** was a Greek mathematician who worked in Alexandria as a teacher of mathematics and astronomy. He was the father of the first woman mathematician Hypatia.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Compiled and organized [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621], the most influential and enduring mathematical treatise in history.
2. Produced works on conics, optics and mechanics, providing Euclid's postulates with new deductions and proofs.
3. Wrote a commentary on the work of Apollonius of Perga, inspiring the invention of the separation of distances by ‘geometric mean’ and creation of Ruler-Compasses.
4. Compiled a work entitled "On the Moving Sphere," exploring the path of a point on a sphere.
5. Innovated the idea of ‘spiral lines’, the theorem of Gauss-Bonnet, and the fundamental theorem of the calculus.
6. Wrote an edition of Book V of [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621] entitled "The Master of Geometry,” where he presented an improved version of Euclid's proof for the irrationality of √2.
7. Developed the epioptic system, a method for transferring astronomical observations from one point to another.
8. Wrote the work Ancilla, which covered the basic elements of geometry, arithmetic and mechanics in a simple and accessible way.

Born about 335, (possibly) Alexandria, Egypt. Died about 405.
