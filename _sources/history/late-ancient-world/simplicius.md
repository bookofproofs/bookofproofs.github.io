**Simplicius** was a Greek mathematician who wrote commetaries on the works of other philosophers and mathematicians including Euclid and Aristotle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved that the angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees.
2. Developed a formula for finding the circumference of a circle. 
3. Discovered the mean speed theorem, which states that the time taken for a body to move from one point to another is equal to the ratio of the distance travelled to the mean speed.
4. Established the law of refraction, which explains the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another. 
5. Demonstrated that the area of a triangle is half of that of a circle with the same base and height. 
6. Developed the height-angle theorem, which states that any two angles of a triangle are together less than the third angle. 
7. Formulated the method of exhaustion, which allowed for the calculation of the area of two-dimensional shapes by breaking them into smaller shapes.

Born about 490, Cilicia, Anatolia (now Turkey). Died about 560, probably Athens, Greece.
