**Liu Hui** was a Chinese mathematician who wrote a commentary of the _Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Development of the concept of right triangle and Pythagorean theorem.
2. Creation of the first known mathematical book entitled ‘Siyuan Yujian’ which contained theorems, solutions and formulas.
3. Invention of the Pascal’s triangle and its application to solve polynomial equations.
4. Introduction of algebraic calculating methods for geometry problems and solutions.
5. Credited for calculating pi accurately to 3 decimal places.
6. Determined the solutions to complex problems by analyzing the ‘nine-chapter of Mathematical Art’.
7. First to use the mathematical idea of pi in a circumference-diameter ratio.
8. Pioneered the cyclic method of interpolation.
9. Developed solutions and insights to the cone, cube and sphere in the field of solid geometry.
10. Developed understanding of trigonometric and algebraic principles.

Born about 220, Wei, China. Died about 280, China.
