**Yavanesvara** was an Indian astrologer who translated an important Greek text on astrology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Yavanesvara introduced the modern version of the zero digit, which revolutionized the way calculations were performed.
2. He developed a positional notation system, which allowed for much more efficient calculations.
3. He developed the Hindu-Arabic system, which introduced a base-10 numerical system, allowing for much more complex calculations.
4. He was the first to use fractions for calculations, thereby extending the base-10 numerical system even further.
5. Yavanesvara also developed a number of decimal-based mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Born about 120, Western India. Died about 180, India.
