**Domninus** was a Greek philosopher whose mathematical work was not appreciated until it was published in the 19th Century.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the main theorem of pentagonal numbers, which states that the sum of any two adjacent pentagonal numbers is equal to the sum of the two numbers preceding them.
2. Discovered the Pythagorean Theorem with a new proof that did not involve the construction of any triangles.
3. Demonstrated the theorem of irrational quantities, which states that any ratios of two irrational numbers must either be irrational, a whole number, or a simple fraction. 
4. Developed a method for solving cubic equations algebraically. 
5. Proposed the Euclidean Algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

Born about 420, Larissa (now Shaizar), Syria. Died about 480.
