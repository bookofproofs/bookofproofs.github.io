## Description

## Chronology

### about 100
* [Cleomedes][bookofproofs$Cleomedes] writes his book "On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies".
* [Heron][bookofproofs$Heron] writes "Pneumatica", a book with descriptions of over 100 machines such as a fire engine, a wind organ, a coin-operated machine, and a steam-powered turbine called an aeolipile.

### about 120 - 140
* [Yavanesvara][bookofproofs$Yavanesvara] invents methods for computing horoscopes.

### about 124
* [Nicomachus][bookofproofs$Nicomachus] writes "Introduction to Arithmetic", becoming later a standard arithmetic text for more than 1000 years.

### 127
* [Ptolemy][bookofproofs$Ptolemy]: first astronomical observation (26 March 127, last was made on 2 February 141).
   * He compares his own observations of equinoxes with those of Hipparchus and Meton.
   * He propounded the geocentric theory of the solar system that prevailed for 1400 years.
* [Theon][bookofproofs$Theon_of_Smyrna] making astronomical observations of Mercury and Venus between 127 and 132

### 132
* [Heng][bookofproofs$Zhang_Heng] invents the first seismograph for measuring earthquakes.

### about 138
* [Hipparchus][bookofproofs$Hipparchus]
   * Compiles trigonometric tables and gave methods for solving spherical triangles
   * His image "sitting and looking at a globe" appears on coins minted under five different Roman emperors between 138 AD and 253 AD.
* [Heng][bookofproofs$Zhang_Heng]'s seismograph detects an earthquake, no other evidence of the earthquake being felt in the capital Lo-yang.

### about 100
* [Nicomachus][bookofproofs$Nicomachus] finds perfect numbers, namely 6, 28, 496 and 8128.
   * Wrongly "deducts" from this that `$n$`th perfect number has `$n$` digits, and that all perfect numbers end in 6 and 8 alternately.

### about 200
* [Apollonius][bookofproofs$Apollonius] writes "Conics", containing 387 separate propositions.
   * Obtains an approximation of `$\pi$` between `$\frac{223}{71}<\pi<\frac{22}{7}$`.

### about 250
* [Diophantus][bookofproofs$Diophantus] writes "Arithmetica" which had an enormous influence on the development of number theory

### about 300
* [Callippus][bookofproofs$Callippus] forms what has been called the Callippic period, essentially a cycle of four Metonic periods. 
   * It was more accurate than the original Metonic cycle and made use of the fact that 365.25 days is a more precise value for the tropical year than 365 days.

### 320 to 340
* [Pappus][bookofproofs$Pappus] to write his commenatary on [Ptolemy][bookofproofs$Ptolemy]'s Almagest
   * Major work "Synagoge" or the "Mathematical Collection" which is a collection of mathematical writings in eight books.
   * One of his theorems is still cited as the basis of modern [projective geometry][bookofproofs$110].

### 364
* [Theon][bookofproofs$Theon] observes a solar eclipse on 16 June 364 at Alexandria and a lunar eclipse, again in Alexandria, on 25 November 364.
   * Father or [Hypatia][bookofproofs$Hypatia].

### 400
* [Hypatia][bookofproofs$Hypatia] becomes head of the Platonist school at Alexandria.
   * Wrote commentaries on Diophantus's Arithmetica, on Apollonius's Conics and on Ptolemy's astronomical works.
   * Killed by a fanatical Christian sect.

### about 468 to 486
* [Qiujian][bookofproofs$Zhang_Qiujian] writes his mathematical text "Zhang Qiujian Suanjing" (Mathematical Manual of Quijian)

### 474
* [Zi][bookofproofs$Sun_Zi] A new scale between chih and tuan established.
   * Writes his mathematical text "Sunzi suanjing" (Mathematical Manual of Sunzi)

### 510
* [Boethius][bookofproofs$Boethius]'s "Arithmetic" texts the best available for many centuries during a time when mathematical achievement in Europe was at a remarkably low point.

### 529
* [Plato][bookofproofs$Plato]'s Academy closed down by the Christian Emperor Justinian who claimed it was a pagan establishment.
