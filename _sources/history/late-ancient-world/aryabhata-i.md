**Aryabhata I** was an Indian mathematician who wrote the _Aryabhatiya_ which summarises Hindu mathematics up to that 6th Century.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Aryabhata is credited with discovering the place-value system, which involves expressing numbers as powers of 10 and placing them in distinct columns to denote units, tens, hundreds, etc.
2. He is also credited with inventing the zero symbol and how to use it in calculations.
3. He is also credited with accurately calculating the earth’s circumference, the value of π (pi) to four decimal places, and the length of the sidereal year.
4. He is credited with discovering the spherical law of cosines, which states that the square of the sine of the angle of one side of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the sines of the other two sides multiplied by the cosine of their angle. 
5. He is credited with several trigonometric identities, such as the summation of sines, cosines, and versines, which enabled the calculation of approximate values of trigonometric ratios.
6. He developed a method for calculating square roots using iteration.
7. He also worked on several mathematical formulas and processes, such as the sine table and the system of interpolation.
8. He was the first mathematician to identify and solve a set of simultaneous equations.

Born 476, Kusumapura (now Patna), India. Died 550, India.
