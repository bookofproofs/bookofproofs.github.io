**Sporus** was a Greek mathematician who worked on the classical problems of squaring the circle and duplicating the cube.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In his turn, Sporus taught Pappus of Alexandria, or perhaps was an older pupil at the same time as Pappus, and we know of him through Pappus's writings and the writings of Eutocius.
* Sporus worked mainly on the classical problems of squaring the circle and duplicating the cube.
* Sporus also used approximations which are early examples of integration.
* Not only did Sporus work on squaring the circle and duplicating the cube but he also constructively criticised others work in these areas.
* There seems little doubt that Sporus's criticism is valid.
* Sporus also criticised Archimedes for not producing a more accurate approximation of Ï€.
* Sporus also wrote on the size of the Sun and on comets.
* Sporus's writings and teaching clearly had a large impact on Pappus who describes him as having a high reputation.

Born about 240, (possibly) Nicaea (now Iznik), Bithynia (now Turkey). Died about 300.
