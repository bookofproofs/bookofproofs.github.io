**Pandrosion of Alexandria** was a Greek mathematician of the 4th century A.D. She developed an approximate method for doubling the cube. She lived earlier than Hypatia.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a mathematical system for solving geometry problems involving polygons and polyhedra.
2. Solved problems in solid geometry, specifically in the theory of polyhedra.
3. Credited with pioneers the five regular polyhedral (Plato's solids).
4. Demonstrated why the five semi-regular polyhedral are geometrically achievable.
5. Proved the number of faces, edges and diagonals of each polyhedron.
6. Became the first to understand the importance of proportion in determining the structure and form of polyhedra.
7. Found new solutions to problems in mathematics related to polyhedra.
8. Discovered solutions for calculations of interior and exterior angles of polygon.
9. Developed the trilateration method for calculating lengths and angles within and between polygons.
10. Established the concept that two polygons were equivalent if one could be turned into the other using a combination of translations or rotations.

Born about 300, possibly Alexandria, Egypt. Died about 360, possibly Alexandria, Egypt.
