**Heron** or **Hero of Alexandria** was an important geometer and worker in mechanics who invented many machines including a steam turbine. His best known mathematical work is the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of the lengths of its sides.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an early form of the analog computer known as the Antikythera mechanism. 
2. Constructed the earliest known "toothed wheel calculator" known as the ktesibios. 
3. Wrote the book "Metrica" providing the earliest known mathematical proof for the area of a triangle. 
4. Developed the Fountain of the Water Clock, which accurately kept the time and water pressure could be adjusted to sound a gong at certain intervals. 
5. Demonstrated the principle of the lever. 
6. Invented the aeolipile, an early steam engine. 
7. Constructed a windwheel utilizing air pressure as a means to lift water. 
8. Credited for providing the earliest known mathematical proof for the area of a circle.

Born about AD 10, (possibly) Alexandria, Egypt. Died about AD 75.
