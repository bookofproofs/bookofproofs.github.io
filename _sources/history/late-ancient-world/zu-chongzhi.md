**Zu Chongzhi** was a Chinese mathematician and astronomer. He introduced the approximation `$\frac{355}{113}$` to `$\pi$` which is correct to 6 decimal places.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He pioneered the use of a new type of equation, known as the ‘Jia Xin Shu’, for calculating pi accurately to the value of 365 digits.
2. He was the first to determine the concept of an ‘infinite number’ and solve a polynomial equation with over 20 terms.
3. He developed the cunning Tang Carter circle theorem which is still used in many astronomical recommendations and calculations.
4. He also discovered his famous ‘Daming calendar’ which distinguished between solar years, lunar years and intercalary years.
5. His famous works include Shaoshi, Zhogen and Xuanxue Qimeng, a mathematical treatise on philosophy.
6. He invented the digit system in mathematics and used the Jia Xun Shu equation to calculate the length of the year.
7. He calculated the tilt of the 40th east of the ecliptic plane accurately to three arcs of a degree. 
8. He made accurate estimations of esoteric astronomical constants such as precession, stellar parallax and orbital angular velocity. 
9. He also invented a calculating machine made of wooden gears for use in mathematical calculations. 
10. He was the first to correctly calculate the distances between the Earth and Moon and established that the Milky Way was a disc of stars.

Born 429, Jiankang, (now Nanjing, Kiangsu province), China. Died 501, China.
