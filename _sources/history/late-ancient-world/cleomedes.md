**Cleomedes** was a Greek astronomer who wrote an influential work: _On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of concentric sphere astronomical models.
2. Propounded the theory that the Moon's disk is illuminated by the Sun and not by rays emanating from the Moon itself.
3. Developed theories about the varying sizes of lunar eclipses and the frequency of eclipses of both the Moon and Sun.
4. Established a mathematical relation between the size of the Moon and its distance from the Earth.
5. Advocated that the Moon and all celestial bodies revolved around the Earth, later called the geocentric universe.
6. Calculated the precession of the equinoxes accurately.
7. Described the diurnal motion of the stars and demonstrated an astronomical theorem and predicted the occurrence of eclipses.
8. Proposed that the Earth is composed of four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.

Born about 10 AD possibly Lysimachia, Hellespont, Greece (now Turkey). Died about 70 AD.
