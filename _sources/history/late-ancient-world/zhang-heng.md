**Zhang Heng** was a Chinese mathematician, astronomer and geographer. He became chief astrologer and minister under the Emperor An'ti of China.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Zhang Heng was the first scientist in history to discover the concept of centrifugal force.
2. He developed a system of measuring earthquakes, which was instrumental in helping to predict future seismic activity.
3. He created a book entitled the "Book of Arithmetic", which contained various mathematical equations and principles.
4. He invented the odometer, which many consider to be the first step towards modern day GPS technology.
5. He was a prolific mathematician, contributing significantly to the development of the Chinese cosmological concept of “Heavenly Principles.”
6. He was among the first to introduce and use the decimal system of numeration, as well as a variety of mathematical symbols.
7. Zhang Heng invented the South-Pointing Chariot, a sophisticated tool for navigation.
8. He launched the first ever successful experiment to measure the circumference of the Earth.

Born AD 78, Nan-yang, China. Died AD 139, China.
