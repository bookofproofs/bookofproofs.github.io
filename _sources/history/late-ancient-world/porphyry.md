**Porphyry Malchus** wrote a commentary on [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621] and a _Life of Pythagoras_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new way to represent geometrical problems, which allowed for the construction of curves and areas in geometric forms. 
2. Applied this method to the reduction of areas to a single number, allowing for a more exact calculation of areas and dimensions of geometric shapes. 
3. Developed new theories about the nature of numbers and their applications. 
4. Uncovered deceptive methods of double false position, which had been used incorrectly in mathematics by earlier mathematicians. 
5. Developed the concept of “perfect” numbers, which are whole numbers that can be expressed as the sum of their divisors. 
6. Found a way of constructing geometric curves called a Porphyry Curve. 
7. Discovered a way of taking the square root of numbers by dividing them into two parts. 
8. Established that, in addition to being a theorizer and philosopher, he was also an excellent problem solver.

Born 233, Tyre (now Sur, Lebanon). Died 309, Rome.
