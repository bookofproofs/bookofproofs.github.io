**Porphyry Malchus** wrote a commentary on [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621] and a _Life of Pythagoras_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Both Porphyry's parents were Syrian and he would only get the nickname Porphyry later in his life as we shall explain below.
* Porphyry was named after his father so for many years he was known as Malchus.
* As a young man Porphyry tried to gain as broad a knowledge as he possibly could by studying many languages and religions.
* At that time Athens was the main centre for learning, so it was natural that someone with a thirst for knowledge as Porphyry had should travel there to continue his studies.
* It was Longinus who gave Porphyry that nickname.
* In about 263 Porphyry left Athens and went to Rome where he worked with Plotinus, the founder of Neoplatonism.
* Porphyry had mixed feelings when he heard the teachings of Plotinus.
* However Porphyry was very disappointed in the way that Plotinus expressed himself and he found Plotinus's lectures poorly structured and his arguments rather woolly.
* It is not entirely clear why Porphyry left Rome but there does seem to have been disputes over doctrine between the philosophers who formed Plotinus's circle.
* Porphyry went to Sicily where he wrote a text bringing the philosophies of Aristotle and Plato together.
* Porphyry had a strong respect for the views of Aristotle and further work by Porphyry at this time led to a revival in studies of the works of Aristotle.
* It would appear that Porphyry's views on Aristotle had something to do with the disputes in Plotinus's school which had led to the break-up.
* Also while Porphyry was in Sicily, he wrote a work on vegetarianism and a critical work against Christian doctrines.
* Porphyry did not break his links with Plotinus, however, and he continued to correspond with him on presenting his views in the most coherent fashion.
* Despite the fact that Porphyry's views were not completely at one with those of Plotinus, this description by Heath is a fair one.
* Porphyry certainly did go on to edit the works of Plotinus, for he returned to Rome in about 282 (which was about 12 years after Plotinus died).
* Also while in Rome Porphyry taught Iamblichus who was another important developer of Neoplatonism.
* However, Iamblichus developed his views away from those of Plotinus and soon found himself disagreeing with Porphyry.
* We should make some comments as to the importance of Porphyry in the history of mathematics.
* Proclus appears to have Porphyry's original comments to hand when he wrote his own commentary.
* This is a point on which it is impossible to be certain for there is a slight possibility that all Proclus knew about Porphyry's commentary was what Pappus had written.
* Another important contribution made by Porphyry was in writing his Life of Pythagoras.
* Certain important fragments of other mathematician's writings have also been preserved in the works of Porphyry including Nicomachus and Eudemus.
