**Anthemius** was the Byzantine architect who replaced the old church of Hagia Sophia at Constantinople. He described the construction of an _ellipse_ with a string fixed at the two foci and he described the focal properties of the parabola.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Anthemius came from a well educated family with two brothers who were doctors, one brother who was a lawyer and another who was described as a man of learning.
* Anthemius is known both as a mathematician and an architect.
* There are a number of stories told of Anthemius which may be totally fictitious but, as is often the case with such stories, they may give an indication of his character.

Born about 474, (possibly) Tralles (near Aydin in southwest Turkey). Died about 534.
