**Anthemius** was the Byzantine architect who replaced the old church of Hagia Sophia at Constantinople. He described the construction of an _ellipse_ with a string fixed at the two foci and he described the focal properties of the parabola.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the qualitative theory of mechanics, which was used by Zeno of Elea to disprove the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry.
2. Discovered the law of sines for spherical triangles and extended the Euclidian theory of continued proportions.
3. Coined the term for what is now known as the Golden Ratio.
4. Proposed a solutions manual to Pappus' Collection of Mathematical Problems, which was widely used as a problem-solving source in the Middle Ages.
5. Wrote a textbook on spherical trigonometry, which aided in the development of trigonometric tables.
6. Introduced stereographic projection, which was used to map mathematical models onto the surface of a sphere and simplified aspects of three-dimensional geometry.
 7. Conducted extensive research on the use of spheroids which further developed the field of geometry and mathematics.

Born about 474, (possibly) Tralles (near Aydin in southwest Turkey). Died about 534.
