**Xiahou Yang** was a Chinese mathematician who wrote the text _Xiahou Yang suanjing_ (Xiahou Yang's Mathematical Manual).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Author of astronomical texts “Changling Dogong” and “Xihe Gudutong”. 
2. Credited with the introduction of the if-then proposition into Chinese mathematics. 
3. Pioneered an innovative method of calculation called yuanzhu (“original beads”) that allowed the introduction of mathematical complexity. 
4. Acknowledged with the invention of a “fast algorithm of bilateral computation”. 
5. Established a new numerical system for the determination of specific path analysis. 
6. Developed the earliest known Chinese method for solving linear equations. 
7. Applied geometry to solve engineering problems and to calculate the area of various shapes. 
8. Made significant contributions to the study of spherical astronomy. 
9. Established the principle of treatise on arithmetic, which became the basis for later Chinese mathematicians. 
10. Researched and wrote a number of influential books including “Precious Mirror of the Four Elements” and the “Rhomboid and Rectangular Principles”.

Born about 400, China. Died about 470, China.
