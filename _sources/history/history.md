This part of the project <strong><span style='color:orange'>BookOf</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong> is dedicated to the history of mathematics, physics, and computer science and the development of mathematical concepts worldwide over the centuries. The part is structured chronologically. It is divided into sections, beginning with the Prehistory, the Ancient World, Middle Ages, and the centuries from the 10th to the 21st Century. 

This structure follows the western calendar. However, it does not mean that it only deals with the history of occidental mathematics. The western calendar only gives one possible chronological structure, and any calendar would serve equally well for this purpose.
