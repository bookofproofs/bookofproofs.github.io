**Hippocrates Of Chios** was a Greek mathematician who worked on the classical problems of squaring the circle and duplicating the cube.  

In his attempts to square the circle, Hippocrates was able to find the areas of "lunes", i.e. crescent-shaped figures, using his theorem that the ratio of the areas of two circles is the same as the ratio of the squares of their radii.

Born about 470 BC Chios, Greece. Died about 410 BC.
