**Theaetetus of Athens** was a Greek mathematician who made very important contributions to the theory of irrationals. His work is described in the [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Theaetetus Rectangle, which became an important tool in Euclidean geometry.
2. Discovered Theaetetus' theorem, a powerful technique for proving mathematics theories.
3. Posed and solved the classic problems of squaring the circle and trisecting the angle.
4. Established the foundations of integral calculus.
5. Derived an important theorem in solid geometry, now known as Theaetetus' theorem.
6. Wrote a work on the Elements of Geometry, which remains an important source for modern geometers.
7. Developed the method of exhaustion, a fundamental technique in mathematics and one of the cornerstones of the theory of limits.
8. Founded the field of number theory.
9. Explored and developed the general theory of numbers, including the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
10. Contributions to the development of irrational numbers including the squaring of the triangle.

Born about 417 BC, Athens, Greece. Died about 369 BC, Athens, Greece.
