**Xenocrates** was a student of Plato who went on to become head of the Academy. He was an early believer in the atomic theory and originated the classical distinction between mind, body and soul.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a unique theory of proportion to help explain geometric relationships.
2. Discovered an interesting proof regarding the greatest common measure of two numbers.
3. Established an important result in Euclidean geometry known as the "theorem of the genera.”
4. Provided a framework for understanding incommensurable magnitudes.
5. Discovered the relationship between the circumferences and diameters of circles.
6. Established two primary axioms of the theory of proportions.
7. Explored the basic principles of conic sections.
8. Developed the famous “Xenocrates cube” in order to better explain the properties of triangles.
9. Proposed a set of five postulates that formed the foundation for Euclidean geometry.

Born 396 BC, Chalcedon (now Kadiköy, near Istanbul), Bithynia (now Turkey). Died 314 BC, Athens, Greece.
