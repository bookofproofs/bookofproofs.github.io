**Panini** was a Sanskrit grammarian who gave a comprehensive and scientific theory of phonetics, phonology, and morphology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Panini-Backus system of notation, a notation for the representation of algebraic expressions. 
2. Proposed the Panini-Backus form of algebra which simplified algebraic calculations. 
3. Proved the Panini-Backus theorem which addressed the relationship between different forms of expressions, and shows how to convert between them. 
4. Developed Panini's First Principle, that states that all of the algebraic expressions of a language can be obtained from a single equation known as the generative equation. 
5. Established the use of the principle of duality in algebra, which states that an equation and its dual are equivalent. 
6. Developed the concept of combining, which provides a way to develop algebraic equations from simpler equations. 
7. Proposed new axiomatizations of algebra that are based on the Panini-Backus system of notation. 
8. Shaped the scholarship of algebra by developing the Panini-Backus formulae for algebra.

Born about 520 BC, Shalatula (near Attock), now Pakistan. Died about 460 BC, India.
