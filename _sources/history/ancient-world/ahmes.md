**Ahmes** was the Egyptian scribe who wrote the Rhind Papyrus - one of the oldest known mathematical documents.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ahmes claims not to be the author of the work, being, he claims, only a scribe.
* The Rhind Papyrus, which came to the British Museum in 1863, is sometimes called the 'Ahmes papyrus' in honour of Ahmes.
* Nothing is known of Ahmes other than his own comments in the papyrus.

Born about 1680 BC, Egypt. Died about 1620 BC, Egypt.
