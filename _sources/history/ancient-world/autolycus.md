**Autolycus** was a Greek astronomer and mathematician who wrote about the geometry of the sphere.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a geometrical method for calculating the area of circles and other curved figures as an alternative to the method of exhaustion.
2. Developed a visual geometry technique to calculate the angle in a semi-circle.
3. Calculated the area of a triangle using inscribed or circumscribed circles.
4. Introduced the concept of the radius to geometry.
5. Investigated the composition of the five regular geometric bodies (tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, dodecahedron).
6. Wrote a book on oblique and parallel lines from which Euclid used definitions in some works.
7. Devised a method to calculate the volumes of some prismatic figures.
8. Analyzed the properties of shapes and figures.
9. Investigated methods to classify figures.
10. Explored the properties of logarithms.

Born about 360BC, Pitane, Aeolis, Asia Minor (now Turkey). Died about 290 BC.
