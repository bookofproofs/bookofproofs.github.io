**Conon of Samos** was a Greek astronomer and mathematician who discovered the curve now known as the spiral of Archimedes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Conon developed a method to construct a triangle, a figure in Euclidean geometry, called "Conon's Triangle." 
2. He also advanced mathematical theory on geometric proportions, which determined the value of the square root of three. 
3.Conon is credited with certain developments on conic sections, a type of plane curve formed from the intersection of a cone with a plane.
4. He further introduced the quadratrix, a curve which he used to trisect an angle and to solve the trisection problem.
5. Finally, Conon is also credited with having found the solution to several types of isoperimetric problems.

Born about 280 BC, Samos, Greece. Died about 220 BC, (possibly) Alexandria, Egypt.
