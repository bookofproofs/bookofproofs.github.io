**Anaxagoras** was a Greek mathematician famed as the first to introduce philosophy to the Athenians. He was imprisoned for claiming that the Sun was not a god and that the Moon reflected the Sun's light.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Anaxagoras is credited with inventing the method of demonstrating geometrical theorems by means of a reductio ad absurdum, which is still in use today.
2. He was the first to apply mathematical analysis to natural phenomena, including the discovery of the circle and of other basic principles in geometry.
3. He applied this approach to cosmology, understanding the Universe as a complex system of interacting forces.
4. Anaxagoras made critical contributions to the development of mathematical astronomy, introducing trigonometry and astronomy as a fundamental tool for understanding the physical universe.
5. He was one of the first to describe the theorem of the mean proportion in geometry (both in the plane and the solid). 
6. He is credited with proposing a proof of the Pythagorean theorem and is credited with the discovery of the Pythagorean comma. 
7. Anaxagoras was the first to prove the existence of irrational numbers.
8. He showed that irrational numbers can be expressed as the ratio between a square root and some rectangle. 
9. He used a mathematical proof to demonstrate that the Moon reflects the Sun's light. 
10. He was the first to propose that the planets revolve around the Sun.

Born 499 BC, Clazomenae (30, km west of Izmir), Lydia (now Turkey). Died 428 BC, Lampsacus, Mysia (now Turkey).
