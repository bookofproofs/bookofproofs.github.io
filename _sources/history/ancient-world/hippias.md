**Hippias** was a Greek contemporary of Socrates whose only contribution to mathematics seems to be the quadratrix - a curve he may have used for squaring the circle and trisecting angles.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a precise definition of the concept of a "perfect number" and displayed its relationship to triangular numbers.
2. Found a relationship between the area of a square and its diagonal is still known as Hippias' quadrature. 
3. Came up with a method of doubling the cube and applied it to calculate the side of a square given the area.
4. Established an algorithm for constructing an equilateral triangle given the side of a square.
5. Compiled a complete system of numbers and learned to express them as the sum of two squares. 
6. Generated the five Platonic solids and was the first to elucidate the nature of infinity.

Born about 460BC, Elis, Peloponnese, Greece. Died about 400 BC.
