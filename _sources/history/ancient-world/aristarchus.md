**Aristarchus** was a Greek mathematician and astronomer who is celebrated as the exponent of a Sun-centred universe and for his pioneering attempt to determine the sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an Ancient Greek mathematical diagram called a klima, which showed the circle concept of the zodiac.
2. Proposed a heliocentric model of the universe, where the Sun, rather than the Earth, is assumed to be at the center of the universe.
3. Developed mathematical principles for calculating the sizes and distances of the Moon, Sun and planets from observations of their angles from Earth.
4. Developed a mathematical system that could accurately predict the motion of the planets.
5. Understand the relationship between the Moon, Sun and Earth and introduced the idea of the synodic month, the period of the Moon's phases.
6. Proposed a system of measuring longitude and latitude of celestial bodies that was used by astronomers for centuries.
7. Studied the motion of the planets and proposed a theory of the structure of the universe composed of several concentric spheres revolving around the Earth.
8. Developed a mathematical explanation of why objects appear larger when they are close to the Earth, versus when they are farther away.

Born about 310 BC, Samos, Greece. Died about 230 BC, Greece.
