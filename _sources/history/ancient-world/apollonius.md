**Apollonius** was a Greek mathematician known as 'The Great Geometer'. His works had a very great influence on the development of mathematics and his famous book _Conics_ introduced the terms parabola, ellipse and hyperbola.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He wrote a series of eight influential books on conic sections, now known as the Conics of Apollonius.
2. He is considered the founder of geometric optimization, a field of mathematics related to maximizing and minimizing functions.
3. He defined the ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola. 
4. He showed that a circle is a special case of a conic section.
5. He developed a method for calculating the areas of the lunes—areas bounded by two intersecting curved lines—which was later used by Ptolemy in his Geography.
6. He also provided an algebraic basis for the study of conic sections, which would later be adopted by Descartes.
7. He was the first to determine the length of a curve in terms of an integral.
8. He gave an explicit construction of a regular heptagon and other polygons.

Born about 262 BC, Perga, Pamphylia, Greek Ionia (now Murtina, Antalya, Turkey). Died about 190 BC, Alexandria, Egypt.
