**Plato** is one of the most important Greek philosophers. He founded the Academy in Athens. His works on philosophy, politics and mathematics were very influential and laid the foundations for Euclid's systematic approach to mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of using deductive reasoning to solve mathematical problems in his dialogues "Theaetetus" and "Parmenides".
2. Was the first philosopher to explore the logical consequences of assuming certain geometrical postulates, in his dialogue "Meno".
3. Proposed the theory that the universe is composed of a finite amount of indivisible particles called atoms.
4. Developed the idea of a Theory of Forms, which states that mathematical objects have an ideal, perfect form that is immutable and indestructible.
5. Was the first to recognize the importance of pi in constructing a circle and originated the only surviving formulation of Euclid's Parallel Line Postulate.
6. Proposed the Golden Ratio, a number that connects mathematics and beauty found in nature.

Born 427 BC, Athens, Greece. Died 347 BC, Athens, Greece.
