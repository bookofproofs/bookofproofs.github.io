**Oenopides Of Chios** was a Greek who made important contributions to astronomy and may have been the first to fix a value for the obliquity of the ecliptic. He estimated the period after which the motions of the sun and moon came to repeat themselves to 59 years. Oenopides also developed a theory to account for the Nile floods.
