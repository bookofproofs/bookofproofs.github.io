**Oenopides** was a Greek who made important contributions to astronomy and may have been the first to fix a value for the obliqity of the ecliptic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He invented the theorem of chords, which was the first systematic treatment of what is now known as the trigonometric functions.
2. He was the first scientist to prove the Pythagorean theorem in its general form.
3. He discovered the theory of the circle and wrote a major treatise on it, On the Circle.
4. He proposed a new theory of the ratio of circumference to diameter, which was later proved by Archimedes.
5. He showed that the area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height, and that the surface area of a sphere is four-thirds of the product of its diameter and circumference.
6. He established the first mathematical rule of proportion of similar solids. 
7. He proved the general law of the lever and was the first to provide a proof by weight of Archimedes' Theorem of Floating Bodies.
8. He conjectured that the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle is the same, regardless of the size of the circle.

Born about 490BC, Chios, Greece. Died about 420 BC.
