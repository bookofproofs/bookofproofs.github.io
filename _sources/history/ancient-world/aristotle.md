2. Developed an early form of the theory of deductive logic.
3. Established the concept of syllogisms and their use as a tool for understanding and constructing logical arguments.
4. Proved theorems related to circles and demonstrated the relationship between the angles of a triangle and their sides.
5. Developed several axioms and theorems regarding prime numbers and demonstrated that the sum of the angles of a triangle equals two right angles.
6. Developed the concept of mathematical induction and Aristotle's Wheel, an early form of the mechanical calculator.
