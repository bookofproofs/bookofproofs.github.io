## Description 
Different civilizations and forms of government form on the banks of big rivers in Afrika (Egypt), Asia (including Mesopotamia, India, China), later also in the Mediterranean Area (Greece, Roman Empire). Although different in regions and time of origin, all these state forms have still a lot in commona hierarchical system of social classes, with aristocracy on the top and many specialized classes below, including priests, scribes, soldiers, craftsmen, farmers, and slaves. Most of these state forms lasted for millennia and centuries. This allowed the melting of the religion with the state forms.

The mathematics in these different state forms was developed to serve practical means, for instance, administration or collection of taxes. But over the centuries, this practical respect of mathematics became more and more independent from the practical application. Scribes and priests began to bring more abstraction into the practical calculations, to think about the concepts behind the pure practical meaning of arithmetics and geometry.

Unfortunately, the knowledge of mathematics of this time is very limited, because only a little evidence is left. It did not survive, either because the material used by scribes to write what they knew was not so resistant (e.g. bamboo, papyrus, tree bark, clay), or because of wars, fire, or intentional destruction of generations which came after.

## Chronology
### about 2050 BC
* [Sumerian mathematics][bookofproofs$1637]
* Place-value sexagesimal system, numerical notation 

### about 2000 BC
* Megalithic stone and wood settings 
  * Found mainly on the British Isles; following astronomic and geometric principles. <br>
  * The most famous example is Stonehenge. The settings form circles, ellipses, egg-shaped rings or more complicated figures.

### ca. 1850 BC
* [Babylonian Mathematics][bookofproofs$6311]
  * Solving linear, quadratic and some cubic equations, square roots, interpolation of logarithms
    * First occurrence of theorem, later known as _Pythagoras' theorem_
    * Babylonians did not formulate any proofs for the theorems they stated.

### ca. 1400 BC
* Beginnings of [Ancient Chinese Mathematics][bookofproofs$6312]
* Decimal numeration carved on oracle bones

### ca. 660 BC
* [Thales Of Miletus][bookofproofs$Thales] formulates first theorems in [geometry][bookofproofs$75].


### ca. 380 BC
* [Anaxagoras Of Clazomenae][bookofproofs$Anaxagoras] formulates a first understanding of centrifugal force. He also formulates first known trials of squaring the circle with ruler and compasses (which was proven impossible not before 1882).


### ca. 450 BC
* [Empedocles Of Acragas][bookofproofs$Empedocles] formulates a four element theory of the worldfire, air, water, and earth. He also conducts on of the first **empiric science experiments** showing that air exists and is not just empty space by observing that water did not enter a vessel when placed underwater.
* First estimation of the period after which the motions of the sun and moon came to repeat themselves to 59 years by [Oenopides Of Chios][bookofproofs$Oenopides]. Development of a theory for the Nile floods.
* [Zeno Of Elea][bookofproofs$Zeno_of_Elea] formulates paradoxes concerning the continuum ("paradoxes of motion"), some of which had an influence on the later development of mathematics.

### ca. 440 BC
* Beginnings of atomic theory by [Leucippus Of Miletus][bookofproofs$Leucippus], i.e. the theory that matter and space are not infinitely divisible.
* First proposal of the **method of exhaustion** by [Antiphon][bookofproofs$Antiphon], i.e. calculating an area by approximating it by the areas of a sequence of polygons.
* Finding the areas of "lunes" by [Hippocrates Of Chios][bookofproofs$Hippocrates], i.e. crescent-shaped figures, using his theorem that the ratio of the areas of two circles is the same as the ratio of the squares of their radii.

### ca. 430 BC
* Contribution to the development of irrational numbers, [Theodorus Of Cyrene][bookofproofs$Theodorus] proved that `$\sqrt 3, \sqrt 5, \ldots, \sqrt {17}$` were not commensurable in length with the unit length.
* Further development of the atomic theory by [Democritus Of Abdera][bookofproofs$Democritus] i.e. the theory that matter and space are not infinitely divisible.
* Invention of "quadratrix" by [Hippias Of Elis][bookofproofs$Hippias] which may have been used by him for trisecting an angle and squaring the circle.

### ca. 420 BC
* First ideas towards the infinitesimal calculus: [Bryson Of Heraclea][bookofproofs$Bryson] claimed that the circle was greater than all inscribed polygons and less than all circumscribed polygons.

### ca. 400 BC
* A new cosmology: [Plato][bookofproofs$Plato]'s name is attached to the Platonic solids representing the "elements of the universe" i.e. cube (=earth), tetrahedron (=fire), octahedron (=air), icosahedron (=water). Plato associated the dodecahedron with the whole universe.
* [Archytas Of Tarentum][bookofproofs$Archytas] finds 
  * two mean proportionals between two line segments, 
  * a solution to the problem of duplicating the cube
  * a proof that there can be no number which is a geometric mean between two numbers in the ratio `$\frac{n+1}n.$`.

### ca. 380 BC
* Further developments in the theory of proportion, astronomy, exhaustion method by [Eudoxus Of Cnidus][bookofproofs$Eudoxus].


### ca. 340 BC
* Beginnings of [propositional logic][bookofproofs$66] by [Aristotle][bookofproofs$Aristotle]
