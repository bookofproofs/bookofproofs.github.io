**Theodorus** was a Greek philosopher in the Cyrenaic school of moral philosophy. He was a pupil of Protagoras and the tutor of Plato and of Theaetetus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Plato travelled to and from Egypt and on such occasions he spent time with Theodorus in Cyrene.
* Theodorus, however, did not spend his whole life in Cyrene for he was certainly in Athens at a time when Socrates was alive.
* A member of the society of Pythagoras, Theodorus was one of the main philosophers in the Cyrenaic school of moral philosophy.
* Our knowledge of Theodorus comes through Plato who wrote about him in his work Theaetetus.
* Our whole knowledge of Theodorus's mathematical achievements are given by this passage from Plato.
* The first point is that Plato does not credit Theodorus with a proof that the square root of two was irrational.
* This must be because √2 was proved irrational before Theodorus worked on the problem, some claim this was proved by Pythagoras himself.
* There is no doubt that Theodorus would have constructed lines of length √3, √5 etc.
* However there is little chance to do more than guess at Theodorus's method.

Born 465 BC, Cyrene (now Shahhat, Libya). Died 398 BC, Cyrene (now Shahhat, Libya).
