**Theodorus** was a Greek philosopher in the Cyrenaic school of moral philosophy. He was a pupil of Protagoras and the tutor of Plato and of Theaetetus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a proof of the existence of irrational numbers.
2. Contributed to the knowledge of why the square root of two cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.
3. Proved that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles.
4. Established the areas and volumes of various geometric figures.
5. Constructed the Pentagramma Mirificum, a diagram now used in algebra and geometry.
6. Was one of the first to apply algebra to solve number-theoretic and geometric problems.
7. Discovered and proved the irreducibility of the 12th- and 13th-degree equations.
8. Developed the cyclotomic equation, an equation that can be used to find the roots of any polynomial.

Born 465 BC, Cyrene (now Shahhat, Libya). Died 398 BC, Cyrene (now Shahhat, Libya).
