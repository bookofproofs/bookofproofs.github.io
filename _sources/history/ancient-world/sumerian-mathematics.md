In comparison to the "Egyptian mathematics":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/1550-bc-egyptian-mathematics/, the _Sumerian_ period (3rd dynasty of Ur in Mesopotamia) was much more sophisticated. The Sumers developed a placed-valued _sexagesimal system_, which differs from the currently world-wide used _decimal system_ only by the base of `$60$` instead of `$10$`. Thus, for instance, the number `$59$` would be written as a single Sumerian digit, while the number `$61$` would be written as two Sumerian digits used for `$1,$` i.e. as `$11=1\cdot 60^1+1\cdot 60^0.$` 

Sumerians used clay tablets with numerical notation. Their unique symbols are shown below.

The earliest texts contain tables with symbols for `$1$`, `$60$` and `$60^2$` as well as `$\frac {1}{60}$` and `$\frac {1}{60^2}$` and also contain examples of calculations connected with administrative tasks like cattle breeding, or taxes.

The sexagesimal placed-valued system was superior in comparison to the Egyptian number system, however, it still had some ambiguities. In particular, for a long time, the Sumers did not have a symbol for `$0$`. Moreover, the same symbols of numbers could mean different numbers, depending on the context. For instance, `$11$` could mean `$1\cdot 60^1+1\cdot 60^0$` or `$1\cdot 60^0+1\cdot 60^{-1}.$` 

The remnants of the sexagesimal system can be found in the modern measurements of angles ($360^\circ$), or of time ($60$ minutes, `$60$` seconds).
