**Thales** was the first known Greek philosopher, scientist and mathematician. He is credited with five theorems of elementary geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed logical principles of deductive reasoning, which is the foundation of Western mathematical proof.
2. Was one of the first to hold that, rather than relying on mythology to explain the universe, it could be understood by applying reason and observation.
3. Founded the concept of abstract geometrical figures and the use of them to solve geometric problems.
4. Demonstrated that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.
5. Developed the so-called Thales' theorem, a fundamental theorem in Euclidean geometry. 
6. Recognized the importance of mathematics in engineering, astronomy, and other scientific fields. 
7. Made important contributions to understanding the relationship between the angles and sides of a triangle.

Born about 624 BC, Miletus, Asia Minor (now Turkey). Died about 547 BC, Miletus, Asia Minor (now Turkey).
