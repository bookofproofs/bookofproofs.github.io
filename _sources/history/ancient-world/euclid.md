**Euclid Of Alexandria** was a Greek mathematician best known for his treatise on geometry [The Elements][bookofproofs$621]. This document influenced the development of Western mathematics for more than 2000 years.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Popularized the axiomatic approach to mathematics by laying out the foundational basis of the subject with the publication of his major work, The Elements.
2. Developed the rules of logic, which provided a unified framework to understand the fundamentals of mathematics.
3. Established the Euclidean algorithm, an algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
4. Formulated theorems on number theory, geometry, and math philosophy.
5. Discovered the Pythagorean theorem, which connects the sides of a right triangle.
6. Defined the parallel postulate, which states that “through a point not on a given line, there is one and only one line parallel to the given line.”
7. Demonstrated the infinitude of prime numbers and provided fundamental building blocks for number theory.

Born about 325 BC, (probably) Alexandria, Egypt. Died about 265 BC, Alexandria, Egypt.
