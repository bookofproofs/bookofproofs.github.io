As the Babylonians subdued the [Sumers][bookofproofs$1637] in the 18th century B.C, they have taken over their sexagesimal system and refined the underlying mathematics from [arithmetics][bookofproofs$195] to [algebra][bookofproofs$59]. Babylonians were able to solve linear and quadratic equations with up to two variables and also cubic equations of the form `$$x^3+x^2=a$$` for a given `$a.$` Geometrical problems were often transformed into their algebraic forms. Babylonians were in the possession of formulae for the areas of simple [right-angled][bookofproofs$6431] figures, including the so-called [Pythagorean theorem][bookofproofs$968] [Square roots][bookofproofs$1161] have been approximated using the formula `$$a=\sqrt{A}=\frac 12\left(a+\frac Aa\right).$$`
 
Babylonian mathematics allowed to compute compound interest, for instance, problems like how long would it take to double a sum of money if the interest was `$20$`%. This results in the equation `$$\left(1\frac 15\right)^x=2.$$` Although they did not know [logarithms][bookofproofs$6721], they solved such equations by finding that a solution `$x$` must be between `$ > 3$` and `$< 4$` and further approximating the result by a _linear interpolation_.

Babylonians also studied astronomy, including the movements of the Sun, the Moon and the Planets. Especially calculations related to astronomy had to be more precise than those related to every-day measurements or taxes. Some of them have been performed with the precision up to several sexagesimal digits after the comma.
