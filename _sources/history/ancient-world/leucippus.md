**Leucippus** was a Greek philosopher who originated the atomic theory of indivisibles developed later by Democritus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the atomist school of thought, which holds that all matter is composed of minute, indivisible particles called atoms.
2. Developed the notion of 'infinite divisibility', which states that matter can be infinitely divided.
3. Proposed a mathematical theory suggesting that motion and change are related to the arrangement and motion of atoms.
4. Demonstrated that probabilities could be used to explain physical processes.
5. Developed an atomic theory which states that atoms can take on any shape and that they have very specific properties, including size and weight.
6. Proposed the use of inference and deduction to make scientific predictions.
7. Established a precursor to the modern scientific method, which relies on experimentation to verify predictions.
8. Suggested that when atoms come together they form objects by filling in the gaps between them.

Born about 480BC, (possibly) Miletus, Asia Minor. Died about 420 BC.
