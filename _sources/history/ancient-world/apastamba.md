**Apastamba** was the Indian author of one of the most interesting of the Indian Sulbasutras from a mathematical point of view.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It would also be fair to say that Apastamba's Sulbasutra is the most interesting from a mathematical point of view.
* We do not know Apastamba's dates accurately enough to even guess at a life span for him, which is why we have given the same approximate birth year as death year.
* Apastamba was neither a mathematician in the sense that we would understand it today, nor a scribe who simply copied manuscripts like Ahmes.
* Apastamba would have been a Vedic priest instructing the people in the ways of conducting the religious rites he describes.
* It is clear from the writing that Apastamba, as well as being a priest and a teacher of religious practices, would have been a skilled craftsman.
* Below we give one or two details of Apastamba's Sulbasutra.
* Apastamba's work consisted of six chapters while the earlier work by Baudhayana contained only three.
* The general linear equation was solved in the Apastamba's Sulbasutra.
* A possible way that Apastamba might have reached this remarkable result is described in the article Indian Sulbasutras.
* As well as the problem of squaring the circle, Apastamba considers the problem of dividing a segment into 7 equal parts.

Born about 600 BC, India. Died about 600 BC, India.
