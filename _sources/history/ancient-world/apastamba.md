**Apastamba** was the Indian author of one of the most interesting of the Indian Sulbasutras from a mathematical point of view.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first to give the value of pi (Ï€) as 3.1416.
2. He is credited with introducing different geometric formulas related to orthocenters and altitudes of a triangle.
3. He is known for his treatise on arithmetic, which is referred to as the Apastamba Sulba Sutra.
4. He proposed several mathematical theorems, such as the Apastamba theorem and the Apastamba-Pulverizer theorem.
5. He is widely considered to be the founder of formulary algebra and is known for developing the Chakravala method for solving indeterminate equations.
6. He is said to have provided a geometric proof for the Pythagorean theorem.
7. He also formulated the famous 'Apastamba-Circles theorem', which is used in the construction of circles with the help of five circles.
8. He formulated algorithms for the calculation of square and cubic roots.

Born about 600 BC, India. Died about 600 BC, India.
