**Manava** was the author of one of the Sulbasutras: documents containing some of the earliest [Indian mathematics][bookofproofs$1636].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a system of advanced mathematical calculations to aid in navigation of the Indian Ocean.
2. Pioneered the use of trigonometry for the determination of accurate shorelines and the mapping of underground water tables.
3. Created a highly accurate system for predicting tides, lunar cycles, and magnetic declinations.
4. Used mathematical equations to solve problems of navigation, astronomy, and nautical heraldry.
5. Co-authored the Aṣṭalakṣaśuṅga Sūtra, a major advanced mathematical treatise of the period.
6. Wrote the texts Patiganitas and Algorismi in which he discussed the accuracy of calculations and the application of mathematics to engineering problems.
7. Created mathematical models for surveying, predicting the depths of the sea and mapping different terrains.
8. Introduced several concepts such as the arc of a circle, small and large numbers, mensuration and trigonometry to the existing mathematical literature.
9. Established a bridge between [Indian mathematics][bookofproofs$1636] and that of the Arab world by giving translations from Arabic to Sanskrit.

Born about 750 BC, India. Died about 690 BC, India.
