**Zeno of Elea** was a Greek philosopher famous for posing so-called paradoxes which challenged mathematicians' view of the real world for many centuries.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Zenoâ€™s Paradoxes, which questioned the validity of mathematics and served as a contribution to mathematics, logic and philosophy.
2. Introduced the concept of infinity and hypothesized that an infinitely-dividing process would never reach its ultimate end.
3. Argued that motion, velocity and rest were illusory concepts, instead believing that there was a metaphysical reality beyond the physical.
4. Demonstrated that there is an irreducible minimum measure, which is the same for all magnitudes.
5. Developed a method of mathematical description to describe an object's trajectory, later known as differential calculus.
6. Established what would become the foundation for much of logic and set theory through his paradoxes of motion.

Born about 490 BC, Elea, Lucania (now southern Italy). Died about 425 BC, Elea, Lucania (now southern Italy).
