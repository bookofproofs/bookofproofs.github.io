**Diocles** was a Greek mathematician who was the first to prove the focal property of a parabolic mirror and studied the cissoid curve as part of an attempt to duplicate the cube.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In this work we are told that Diocles studied the cissoid as part of an attempt to duplicate the cube.
* The extracts quoted by Eutocius from Diocles' On burning mirrors showed that he was the first to prove the focal property of a parabolic mirror.
* Although Diocles' text was largely ignored by later Greeks, it had considerable influence on the Arab mathematicians, in particular on al-Haytham.
* Latin translations from about 1200 of the writings of al-Haytham brought the properties of parabolic mirrors discovered by Diocles to European mathematicians.
* Recently, however, some more information about Diocles' life has come to us from the Arabic translation of Diocles' On burning mirrors whose discovery is described below.
* From this work we learn that Zenodorus travelled to Arcadia and entered into discussions with Diocles, so that certainly Diocles was working in Arcadia at the time.
* It is only recently that an Arabic translation of Diocles On burning mirrors has been found in the Shrine Library in Mashhad, Iran.
* The first of these propositions proves what has long been known to have been first established by Diocles, namely the focal property of the parabola.
* These constructions are again properties of the parabola that Diocles was the first to give.
* The duplication of the cube problem, again referred to by Eutocius, is studied by Diocles in Proposition 10.
* The next two propositions solve the problem of inserting two mean proportions between a pair of magnitudes using the cissoid curve which was invented by Diocles.
* In On burning mirrors Diocles also studies the problem of finding a mirror such that the envelope of reflected rays is a given caustic curve or of finding a mirror such that the focus traces a given curve as the Sun moves across the sky.

Born about 240 BC. Died about 180 BC.
