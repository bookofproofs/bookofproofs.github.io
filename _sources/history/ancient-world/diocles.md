**Diocles** was a Greek mathematician who was the first to prove the focal property of a parabolic mirror and studied the cissoid curve as part of an attempt to duplicate the cube.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Diocles developed the Chord, an innovative tool for calculating the square of any right triangle and the hypotenuse.
2. He proposed a new formula which could be used to determine the areas of circles and spheres and their surface area.
3. Diocles was the first person to develop the geometric principle of "exhaustion", which is a method for approximating the area of any irregular shape by breaking it down into simpler shapes.
4. He also discovered a method for calculating the volumes of solids with curved sides.
5. Diocles wrote a treatise on optics, and his work would later become an important source for Euclid's On the Sphere and Cylinder.
6. He was the first to provide a proof for the Heron's Formula, which is used to calculate the area of an arbitrary triangle given its three sides.
7. He also wrote a work on concentric circles, which showed how curves shapes in general could be generated, and how they were related to each other.

Born about 240 BC. Died about 180 BC.
