**Antiphon** was a Greek orator and statesman who took up rhetoric as a profession. He was a Sophist and a contemporary of Socrates. There is some dispute about whether there was one of two philosophers of this name.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a formal mathematical logic, which greatly advanced the field of mathematics by unifying disparate methods.
2. Developed an early geometric system, which was the foundation of basic concepts in geometry and trigonometry.
3. Expanding the knowledge of and theories related to mathematical ratios and numbers.
4. Demonstrated the “Hippocratic Method” of proof, which applied logical reasoning to geometrical propositions.
5. Introduced method of analytical analysis, which allowed for the systematic breaking down of problems into smaller parts to discover solutions.
6. Investigated the relationships between arithmetic and geometry and produced new ways of reckoning numbers.
7. Explored problems concerning prime numbers and the calculation of perfect numbers.
8. Published “On the Measurement of the Circle”, containing detailed calculations related to the circle's radius, circumference, area, and volume.

Born 480 BC, (possibly) Athens, Greece. Died 411 BC, Athens, Greece.
