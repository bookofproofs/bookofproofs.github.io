**Chrysippus** was a Greek philosopher who is considered the cofounder of Stoicism.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a system of logic which would eventually be regarded as the foundation of the Stoic school of thought.
2. Devised a system for enumerating valid syllogisms.
3. Developed an early form of propositional logic, with implications and negation as a means of inference.
4. Proposed a system for analyzing Zeno's paradoxes.
5. Investigated the properties of perfect numbers and amicable numbers.
6. Formulated an analysis of time which was used later by Medieval philosophers.
7. Developed a system of geometry which included the first use of irrational numbers.
8. Pioneered new concepts in physics and astronomy, introducing the idea of a spherical Earth.
9. Established mathematical solutions to the problems of double motion.

Born 280 BC, Soli, Cilicia, Asia Minor (now Soloi, Turkey). Died 206 BC, Athens, Greece.
