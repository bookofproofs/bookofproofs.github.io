**Philon** was a Greek who wrote about various aspects of Mechanics and worked on the problem of the duplication of the cube.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Composed the Elements, the most powerful work in mathematics of ancient Greece.
2. Managed to calculate the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, demonstrating the value of pi to be equal to 3 1/7.
3. Put forward the theory that the area of a circle is equal to the square of its radius multiplied by pi.
4. Developed the basic tools of modern geometry, including the axiomatic form, straightedge and compass constructions, and the theory of loci.
5. Was the first to use mathematical induction to prove theorems.
6. Came up with the idea about the five regular solids and described their construction.

Born about 280BC, Byzantium (Turkey). Died about 220 BC.
