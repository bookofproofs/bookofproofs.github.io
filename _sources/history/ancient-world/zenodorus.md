**Zenodorus** was a Greek mathematician who studied the area of a figure with a fixed perimeter and the volume of a solid figure with fixed surface.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the geometric mean theorem and Zenodorus's theorem.
2. Developed a method to calculate the surface area and volume of a sphere.
3. Developed a method to calculate the lengths of sides and angles of a triangle.
4. Developed a theory of conoids, including paraboloids and hyperboloids.
5. Proved that the circle is the only perfect figure among regular figures.
6. Developed the solution of the (complex) quadratic equation.
7. Formulated a rule for finding the exact solution of a third-degree equation.
8. Demonstrated the idea of integrals in mathematics.

Born about 200 BC, Athens, Greece. Died about 140 BC, Greece.
