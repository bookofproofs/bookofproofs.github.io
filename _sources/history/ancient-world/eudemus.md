**Eudemus** was a Greek who was the first major historian of mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the distinction between arithmetic and geometry, which was a major breakthrough in mathematics. 
2. Discovered and published various theorems including the “Pythagoreans” and the “Eudemian Theorems”.
3. Made significant advances in the study of conic sections.
4. Discovered the notions of similarity and proportionalities.
5. Proved the concept of the harmonic mean, which is helpful in solving several related problems.
6. Generated a formula for calculating the surface area of a sphere.
7. Suggested a method of calculating partial equations.
8. Instituted a system of notation that enabled more complicated calculations and equations.

Born about 350BC, Rhodes, Greece. Died about 290 BC.
