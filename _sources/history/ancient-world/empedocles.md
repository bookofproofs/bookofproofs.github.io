description: Empedocles advocated the idea that all matter is composed of four elements and proposed that they cycled through phenomena such as birth, growth and decay to achieve divine harmony and balance. He used mathematics to explain natural forms such as the cone & Earth's shape.

**Empedocles** was a Greek philosopher who is best known for his belief that all matter was composed of four elements: fire, air, water, and earth. Some have considered him the inventor of rhetoric and the founder of the science of medicine in Italy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of elemental equilibrium - popularised the idea that everything is made up of four elements: earth, water, air and fire. 
2. Introduced the concept of cyclic change - proposed that the elements constantly cycled and produced phenomena such as birth, growth and decay. 
3. Recognised the importance of balance and harmony in nature - linked this to the idea of an underlying divine justice.
4. Discovered the properties of the cone - recognised that its shape was determined by its height and circle of curvature.
5. Deduced the shape of the Earth - suggested that the Earth had the shape of a sphere. 
6. Contributed to the study of refraction - proposed that the angle of refraction was directly related to the angle of incidence.
7. Advocated the use of mathematics to explain natural phenomena - encouraged the use of mathematics in philosophical as well as scientific fields.

Born about 492 BC, Acragas (now Agrigento, Sicily, Italy). Died about 432 BC, Peloponnese, Greece.
