 **Hippasus** was a Greek philosopher among the Pythagoreans. 
 Some legends say that he discovered the [incommensurablility][bookofproofs$140] of the diagonal of a square and was drowned for his proof, or for letting people know about it. It is the only known case of a person who lost his life becoming a victim of a mathematical proof. The exact dates of his birth and death are unknown.
