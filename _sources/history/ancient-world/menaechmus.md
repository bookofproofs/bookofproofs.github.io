**Menaechmus** was a Greek mathematician who tutored Alexander the Great in the subject. He was the first to investigate the ellipse, parabola and hyperbola as sections of a cone.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved the fundamental theorem of parabolic conic sections (which states that a conic section is determined by four points).
2. Discovered the Menaechmus' theorem, which states that any two distinct points in a parabola can be connected with a straight line.
3. Discovered the Menaechmus' theorem for Ellipses, which states that any two distinct points of an ellipse can be connected with a straight line.
4. Developed the doubling the cube problem, which involved the construction of two cubes with the same volume as a given cube, by means of two intersecting lines.
5. Proposed the construction of a regular pentagon using compass and straightedge.
6. Developed the method of solving the obtuse angle problem using the intersection of a circle and a straight line.
7. Introduced the idea of "infinite magnitudes" or irrational numbers.

Born about 380BC, Alopeconnesus, Asia Minor (now Turkey). Died about 320 BC.
