**Hypsicles of Alexandria** was a Greek mathematician who wrote a treatise on regular polyhedra. He is the author of what has been called Book XIV of [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621], a work which deals with inscribing regular solids in a sphere.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method of solving second-order indeterminate equations.
2. Solved the problem of trisecting an angle using only straightedge and compass.
3. Devised a method of approximating the value of pi with the use of arithmetic and geometric series.
4. Proved the law of calculi, which states that any constant multiple of an integer is divisible by the same divisors as the integer itself.
5. Found the rules of an ellipse construction using only straightedge and compass.
6. Propounded the theory of amicable numbers, and computed the first pair of amicable numbers.
7. Developed an algorithm to determine the greatest common divisor of two integers.
8. Discovered a method for finding the width of a given circle by measuring the circumference.
9. Advanced the existing knowledge on the properties of conic sections.
10. Initiated a study of lunes and their shapes in plane geometry.

Born about 190BC, Alexandria, Egypt. Died about 120 BC.
