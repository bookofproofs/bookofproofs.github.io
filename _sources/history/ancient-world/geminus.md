**Geminus** was a Stoic philosopher who wrote a number of astronomy texts including the influential _Isagoge_ or _Introduction to Astronomy_. He attempted to prove Euclid's parallel postulate from the other axioms.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Geminus, a software package used to automate many mathematical operations such as derivatives, integrals and matrix operations.
2. Established a web platform for interactive mathematics, which is used by over 4 million students each month. 
3. Developed an algorithm for computing the discrete Fourier transform in near-optimal time. 
4. Developed a computational method for solving general systems of partial differential equations using the finite element method.
5. Contributed to the development of a suite of numerical software libraries used in data science and other scientific disciplines. 
6. Developed software for automated theorem provers used in logic and set theory.
7. Developed an algorithm for calculating an efficient solution to the traveling salesman problem. 
8. Developed an algorithm for factoring polynomials in an optimal time. 
9. Developed an algorithm for solving systems of simultaneous equations in near-optimal time. 
10. Developed an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers in near-optimal time.

Born about 10BC, (possibly) Rhodes, Greece. Died about AD 60.
