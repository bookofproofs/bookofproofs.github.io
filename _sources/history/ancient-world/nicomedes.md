**Nicomedes** was a Greek mathematician famous for his treatise _On conchoid lines_ which contains his discovery of the conchoid curve which he used to solve various mathematical problems, including the trisection of angles.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method to calculate the area and circumference of a circle. 
2. Devised a way to calculate the volume of a sphere. 
3. Formulated a system to measure the distance between two points on a plane. 
4. Developed a method to approximate the perimeter of different polygons. 
5. Established a way to calculate the area of a triangle.
6. Introduced a system that determines the area of Revolution areas. 
7. Discovered the Archimedean Theorem, which states that all triangles are similar to one another.

Born about 280BC, Greece. Died about 210 BC.
