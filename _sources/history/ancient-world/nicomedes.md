**Nicomedes** was a Greek mathematician famous for his treatise _On conchoid lines_ which contains his discovery of the conchoid curve which he used to solve various mathematical problems, including the trisection of angles.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Nicomedes himself criticised the method that Eratosthenes used to duplicate the cube and we have made a reasonably accurate guess at Eratosthenes' life span (276 BC - 194 BC).
* A less certain piece of information comes from Apollonius choosing to name a curve 'sister of the conchoid' which is assumed to be a name he has chosen to compliment Nicomedes' discovery of the conchoid.
* Since Apollonius lived from about 262 BC to 190 BC these two pieces of information give a fairly accurate estimate of Nicomedes' dates.
* However, as we remarked the second of these pieces of information cannot be relied on but nevertheless, from what we know of the mathematics of Nicomedes, the deduced dates are fairly convincing.
* Nicomedes is famous for his treatise On conchoid lines which contain his discovery of the curve known as the conchoid of Nicomedes.
* How did Nicomedes define the curve.
* Nicomedes recognised three distinct forms in this family but the sources do not go into detail on this point.
* Nicomedes also used the quadratrix, discovered by Hippias, to solve the problem of squaring the circle.

Born about 280BC, Greece. Died about 210 BC.
