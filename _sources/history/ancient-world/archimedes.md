**Archimedes** was the greatest mathematician of his age. His contributions in geometry revolutionised the subject and his methods anticipated the integral calculus. He was a  practical man who invented a wide variety of machines including pulleys and the Archimidean screw pumping device.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Principle of Lever, otherwise referred to as “Archimedes’ Principle of Lever,” which states an object placed on a fulcrum will remain in equilibrium as long as the forces on either side are balanced.
2. Developed a mathematical formula to calculate the area of a circle, now known as “Archimedes’ Circular Area Theorem.”
3. Devised the “Eureka Theorem,” which allows for the approximate calculation of pi.
4. Created the “Archimedes’ Number System,” the first known system of numeration with non-whole numbers.
5. Derived the law of equilibrium of fluids and the law of acceleration of solid bodies which are still used by physics and engineering to this day.
6. Found a general solution to the problem of determining the center of gravity of any triangle.
7. Developed an indivisible and continuous line, otherwise known as “Archimedes’ straight line,” and proved the theory that any straight line can be divided in an infinite number of points.

Born 287 BC, Syracuse, Sicily (now Italy). Died 212 BC, Syracuse, Sicily (now Italy).
