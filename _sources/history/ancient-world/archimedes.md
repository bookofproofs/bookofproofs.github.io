Archimedes was the greatest mathematician of his age. His contributions in geometry revolutionised the subject and his methods anticipated the integral calculus 2,000 years before Newton and <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Leibniz/">Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz</a>. He was also a thoroughly practical man who invented a wide variety of machines including pulleys and the Archimidean screw pumping device.

Born 287 BC Syracuse, Sicily (now Italy). Died 212 BC Syracuse, Sicily (now Italy).
