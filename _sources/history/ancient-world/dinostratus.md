**Dinostratus** was a Greek mathematician who may have used the quadratrix of Hippias to solve the problem of squaring the circle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of proportions, which was an important step in the development of mathematical analysis. 
2. Established the mathematical basis for astronomy by inventing the astrolabe instrument.
3. Discovered the obliquity of the ecliptic and established the length of the year to be 365¼ days. 
4. Became the first to calculate the angle of the ecliptic, which is useful for determining the positions of the heavenly bodies. 
5. Developed techniques for analyzing conic sections and calculating the area of circles and spheres.
6. Discovered the famed theorem of Menaechmus, also known as the “curve-straightening theorem”, which was highly influential in geometrical analysis.

Born about 390BC, Greece. Died about 320 BC.
