**Dinostratus** was a Greek mathematician who may have used the quadratrix of Hippias to solve the problem of squaring the circle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It is usually claimed that Dinostratus used the quadratrix, discovered by Hippias, to solve the problem of squaring the circle.
* It appears from this quote that Hippias discovered the curve but that it was Dinostratus who was the first to use it to find a square equal in area to a given circle.
* This makes somewhat less convincing the claim that Dinostratus used the quadratrix, discovered by Hippias, to square the circle since Eudemus does not even mention Dinostratus.
* Posterity has firmly associated the name of Dinostratus with the quadrature of the circle by means of the quadratrix.
* The second objection relates to Dinostratus's use of the quadratrix to square the circle.
* Dinostratus probably did much more work on geometry but nothing is known of it.

Born about 390BC, Greece. Died about 320 BC.
