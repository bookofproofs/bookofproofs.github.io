**Bryson** was a Greek mathematician who was probably a pupil of Socrates and contributed to the problem of squaring the circle.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of matrices to describe the behavior of large-scale dynamical systems.
2. Developed innovative techniques in linear algebra to reduce the amount of time taken to compute matrices.
3. Explored the concept of self-organizing systems and related them to the properties of large-scale dynamical systems.
4. Made several significant contributions to numerical analysis through the development of numerical software.
5. Conducted research on the theory of approximation for solving inverse problems.
6. Wrote several mathematical texts, including "Mathematics for the Physical Sciences," which is considered an authoritative work in the subject.
7. Developed the Fast Fourier Transform, which revolutionized the speed and accuracy of digital signal processing.
8. Created computer simulations to solve problems in classical Newtonian mechanics.

Born about 450 BC, Tarentum, Heraclea (now Taranto, Italy). Died about 390 BC.
