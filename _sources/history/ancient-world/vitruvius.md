**Marcus Vitruvius Pollio** was a Roman who wrote an influential early work on Architecture.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of modulor, a proportioning system based on the proportions exhibited by the human body based on the writings of the Roman architect and philosopher Marcus Vitruvius.
2. Developed the principle of the “three orders,” or the three architectonic orders: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian.
3. Developed the principles of linear perspective, which is the mechanism through which the three-dimensionality of the real world could be depicted in two-dimensional drawings. 
4. Proposed a system for the construction of large buildings in which floors would be capable of supporting the weight of upper levels.
5. Planned a system for the construction of bridges in his treatise on civil engineering and mechanics, De Architectura.
6. Developed an understanding of geometrical measurements and the effects of earthquakes on buildings.

Born about 85 BC, possibly Fundi, Campania (now Italy). Died about 20 BC, Italy.
