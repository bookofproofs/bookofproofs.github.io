**Marcus Vitruvius Pollio** was a Roman who wrote an influential early work on Architecture.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Even his name is in doubt with only Vitruvius being certain.
* The Romans were building a city there in Vitruvius's time.
* After Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, Vitruvius joined the army of Octavian (later the Emperor Augustus), as a military engineer.
* His most famous (and only known) work is the ten volumes of On Architecture which we know was written near the end of Vitruvius's life.
* The second comment must be that, for Vitruvius, architecture had a much wider scope than we would consider today.
* For example water clocks, sundials and pumps are all described by Vitruvius, topics which would hardly be considered to be part of the study of architecture today.
* Next we note Vitruvius's interest in history - this means that we are treated to information about earlier works and scientists which would otherwise have been lost.
* After giving the fundamentals of architecture, Vitruvius looks at the siting of a city and city walls.
* Vitruvius describes machines for lifting and transporting weights using a pulley, he gives the principle of the lever, and describes machines that convert circular to linear motion and vice-versa.

Born about 85 BC, possibly Fundi, Campania (now Italy). Died about 20 BC, Italy.
