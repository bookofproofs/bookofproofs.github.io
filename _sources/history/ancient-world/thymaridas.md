**Thymaridas** was a Greek follower of Pythagoras who wrote on prime numbers and gave methods for solving simultaneous linear equations .

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded a school of mathematics in Corinth, where he taught a wide range of mathematical subjects including geometry, astronomy and harmonics.
2. Developed the concept of an irrational number and studied the important concepts of parallel lines and isoperimetric problems.
3. Proved the irrationality of the square root of two and of other proportions such as three by two.
4. Developed an algorithm to compute the Pythagorean triple using the two line method.
5. Studied the method of exhaustion, which later became a basis of the modern calculus.
6. Established the base-12 number system, which has become the standard today.
7. Identified the first geometric proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. 
8. Explored the mathematical properties of Archimedes' spiral.
9. Demonstrated the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every composite number can be factorized into prime numbers.
10. Investigated the five regular polyhedra, known as the Platonic solids.

Born about 400BC, Paros, Greece. Died about 350 BC.
