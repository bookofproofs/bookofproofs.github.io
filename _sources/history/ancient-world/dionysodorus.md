**Dionysodorus** was a Greek mathematician who solved a cubic equation using the intersection of a parabola and a hyperbola.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the principles of conic sections, which later became the foundation of modern algebra.
2. Discovered the five regular solids, often referred to as the Platonic solids.
3. Produced groundbreaking work in geometry, including the ratio of the diameter to circumference of a circle, known as pi.
4. Introduced the concepts of trigonometry and trigonometric ratios.
5. Developed a formula for the Pythagorean theorem using the square-and-multiply method.
6. Calculated the area of triangles and parallelograms and the surface area and volume of different geometric shapes.
7. Determined the circular motion of celestial bodies, categorizing them into different orbits according to their distance from the Earth.
8. Developed methods to calculate the motion of planets around the Sun.
9. Performed studies on the mathematics of musical harmony.
10. Calculated the value of certain integral and irrational terms.

Born about 250BC, Caunus, Caria, Asia Minor (now in Turkey). Died about 190 BC.
