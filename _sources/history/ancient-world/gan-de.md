**Gan De** was one of the earliest of the Chinese astronomers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Compiled the bundle of the nine chapters on mathematics, a text known today as the "Sea Mirror of the Circle Measurements". 
2. Introduced the use of negative numbers to solve equations involving ratios.
3. Discovered the square root of 2 could be expressed as a continued fraction.
4. Discovered pi's numerical value and proved pi can be calculated as the ratio between a circle's circumference and diameter.
5. Developed an algebraic method to calculate the cube root and quartic root of numbers.
6. Performed numerous calculations of the square of a circle and the area of a triangle.
7. Discovered the quadratic formula for determining the solution to any quadratic equation.
8. Recognized and described the concept of a right angle.
9. Developed a sophisticated approach to solving various problems in trigonometry. 
10. Developed a novel compass-and-straightedge construction for calculating the area of a circle.

Born about 400 BC, China. Died about 340 BC, China.
