**Hipparchus** was a Greek mathematician who compiled an early example of trigonometric tables and gave methods for solving spherical triangles.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the unequalled Hipparchus star catalog, featuring over 850 stars, including their positions and brightness.
2. Developed a system of astronomical measurement called the Hipparchic system.
3. Developed the trigonometric tables to calculate exact positions of the stars and planets.
4. Used mathematical principles to create the first known methods of predicting eclipses and calculating the rotations of heavenly bodies.
5. Formulated a basic linear regression model to calculate the speed of light.
6. Developed a model of the universe that placed the sun at its center.
7. Used trigonometry to calculate the sizes and distances of the Sun, Moon and stars.
8. Developed a measurement of time – the Hipparchic Cycle – that is still used today.
9. Applied geometry to calculate the circumference of the Earth.

Born 190 BC, Nicaea (now Iznik), Bithynia (now Turkey). Died 120 BC, probably Rhodes, Greece.
