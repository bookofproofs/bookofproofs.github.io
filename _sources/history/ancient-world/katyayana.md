**Katyayana** was the author of one of the Sulbasutras: documents containing some of the earliest [Indian mathematics][bookofproofs$1636].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
Katyayana was a Hindu mathematician and astronomer who flourished in the 3rd century BCE. He is best known for his work on the Sulba Sutras, a collection of mathematical rules under the Vedic religions.

1. Katyayana's most notable achievements in the field of mathematics include:
- the development of geometry, including formulae for calculating areas and volumes of rectangles and squares.
- the discovery of the Pythagorean theorem
- the development of the algorithm for finding approximate solutions for equations, known as the Katyayana algorithm
- the invention of numerical methods for solving linear and quadratic equations
- the formulation of the Chakravala method for factorization
- the development of the table of sines
- the creation of the metric notation system 
- the discovery of the point-type method for calculating sums.

Born about 200 BC, India. Died about 200 BC, India.
