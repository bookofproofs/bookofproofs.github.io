**Posidonius** was a Greek philosopher, astronomer and mathematician. He followed the Stoic doctrine and attemped to estimate the size of the Sun and moon.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new system of spherical geometry, replacing the earlier flat-Earth geometrical system.
2. Described an early version of the Magnus effect, a phenomenon in which a spinning object creates a torque when it moves through a fluid.
3. Constructed the earliest known table of sines, which used 1000 arcs of a circle.
4. Offered a sound mathematical proof of the Earth's rotation on its axis and the inclination of the ecliptic plane.
5. Discovered that the rate at which a heavenly body moves towards the sun is not a uniform motion but rather described by the equation distance square = time cube.

Born 135 BC, Apameia, near Shaizar, Syria. Died 51 BC, Rhodes.
