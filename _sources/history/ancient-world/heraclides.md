**Heraclides** is a Greek astronomer who proposed that the earth rotates on its axis once a day and who may have believed that the sun was the centre of the solar system.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He discovered the Heraclean formula of double integration, which simplified the process of calculating integrals.
2. He significantly advanced the understanding of the Eratosthenes sieve.
3. He discovered the principle of continuity, which is an essential component of calculus.
4. He created the spiral of Archimedes, a type of device for calculating areas.
5. He discovered the concept of mean proportional, which is an important mathematical law.
6. He was the first to recognize that an arbitrary surface could be generated by rotating a rectangular area, thus contributing to the development of multivariable calculus.
7. He developed several theories related to areas and volumes, and the existence of irrational numbers between integers.

Born 387 BC, Heraclea Pontica (now Eregli, Turkey). Died 312 BC, Heraclea Pontica.
