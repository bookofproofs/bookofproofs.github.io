**Heraclides** is a Greek astronomer who proposed that the earth rotates on its axis once a day and who may have believed that the sun was the centre of the solar system.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* We do have some details of Heraclides' life.
* Heraclides attended the Academy in Athens and was left in charge of it during Plato's third visit to Sicily in 360 BC.
* It was a close battle between Xenocrates, Menedemus of Pyrrha and Heraclides Ponticus but Xenocrates triumphed by just a few votes.
* At this point Heraclides left the Athens and returned to Heraclea Pontica.
* Stories told of his death are not really believable yet they must at least point to the type of person that Heraclides was.
* It is said that Heraclea Pontica suffered a famine and Heraclides bribed the messengers sent to the Delphic oracle to say that the city would be saved if Heraclides was given a gold crown and made a hero after his death.
* The story relates that Heraclides died while being presented with the golden crown.
* Perhaps Heraclides had the last laugh here for indeed he did become a hero after is death based on a false interpretation of his writing.
* T H Martin, in 1849, pointed out the significance of the passage saying that Venus is sometimes above, sometimes below the sun clearly means that Heraclides believed that it was in orbit round the sun.
* Schiaparelli accepted Martin's argument and went further to claim that Heraclides must have proposed the theory that the sun revolves round the earth, but the planets revolve round the sun.
* Heraclides does, however, still have a claim to fame for an astronomical hypothesis.
* We do know a little more concerning Heraclides.
* Apart from his writings on astronomy, Heraclides wrote on many of the usual topics that a leading philosopher of his day would have written on.

Born 387 BC, Heraclea Pontica (now Eregli, Turkey). Died 312 BC, Heraclea Pontica.
