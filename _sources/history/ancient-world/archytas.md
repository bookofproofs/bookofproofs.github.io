**Archytas** was a Greek mathematician, statesman and philosopher who worked on the harmonic mean and the problem of duplicating the cube.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Re-discovered the science of conic sections, and was the first to study the ellipse, parabola and hyperbola.
2. Developed the mathematical theory of proportion, leading to the development of modern analytic geometry.
3. Discovered the limit of ratio of the two shorter sides to the longer in a right triangle, which is known as Archytas' Theorem.
4. Devised a system for deriving the four arithmetic means, which is a precursor to modern algebra.
5. Introduced 'double-positioning' in geometry, which is a powerful tool for solving complicated problems in finite terms.
6. Compiled a widely-used and respected geometric theorems, expanding on the works of Euclid and creating the foundations of Euclidean geometry.

Born about 428BC, Tarentum, Magna Graecia (now Taranto, Italy). Died about 350 BC.
