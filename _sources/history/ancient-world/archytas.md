**Archytas** was a Greek mathematician, statesman and philosopher who worked on the harmonic mean and the problem of duplicating the cube.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Archytas led the Pythagoreans in Tarentum and tried to unite the Greek towns in the area to form an alliance against their non-Greek neighbours.
* Plato wrote to Archytas who sent a ship to rescue him.
* This is done, however, because of the style of Archytas's philosophy rather than the strict chronology.
* Archytas was a pupil of Philolaus and so was a firm supporter of the philosophy of Pythagoras believing that mathematics provided the path to the understanding of all things.
* Although Archytas studied many topics, since he was a Pythagorean, mathematics was his main subject and all other disciplines were seen as dependent on mathematics.
* Archytas worked on the harmonic mean and gave it that name (it had been called sub-contrary in earlier times).
* Archytas solved the problem with a remarkable geometric solution (not of course a ruler and compass construction).
* One interesting innovation which Archytas brought into his solution of finding two mean proportionals between two line segments was to introduce movement into geometry.
* We know of Archytas's solution to the problem of duplicating the cube through the writings of Eutocius of Ascalon.
* Another interesting mathematical discovery due to Archytas is that there can be no number which is a geometric mean between two numbers in the ratio (n+1):n(n+1) : n(n+1):n.
* Archytas built on this earlier work and his discoveries are then largely those presented by Euclid in the Elements Book VIII.
* Archytas is sometimes called the founder of mechanics and he is said to have invented two mechanical devices.
* Finally we quote again from the writings of Archytas about his theory of how to learn.

Born about 428 BC, Tarentum, Magna Graecia (now Taranto, Italy). Died about 350 BC.
