**Perseus** is associated with the discovery of so-called _spiric curves_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Perseus is credited with inventing a classical method for doubling a cube, utilizing two geometric constructions.
2. He was a skilled geometer and constructed a Heptagon and Dodecagon, which are two of the most complex figures at the time.
3. He also developed a geometric curved line, now known as the conchoid, which was used to solve cubic equations.
4. He wrote and edited an important work on the properties of polygonal numbers and demonstrated a method to calculate the volume of a sphere using principles of integral calculus.
5. He also made important contributions to trigonometry, including a calculation of the length of a chord (the curved line connecting two points on a circle) through trigonometric functions.

Born 2nd century BC. Died 2nd century BC.
