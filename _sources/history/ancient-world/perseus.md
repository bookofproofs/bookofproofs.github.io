**Perseus** is associated with the discovery of so-called _spiric curves_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The first reference says that Perseus is associated with the discovery of the "spiric" curves in the same way as that of Apollonius is with conics.
* All that can be deduced with certainty is that Perseus must have lived before Geminus.
* The references do not really give enough details to be able to tell what Perseus discovered.

Born 2nd century BC. Died 2nd century BC.
