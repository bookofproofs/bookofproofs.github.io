**Anaximander of Miletus** was a Greek scholar who first proposed that the sun, moon and planets revolved around the earth. he invented the gnomon of a sun-dial.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the earliest known map of the world using constellations and geography. 
2. Developed a theory of the "boundless" which was a circular representation of the universe. 
3. Developed a primitive form of geometry by utilising points, circles, and rectangles. 
4. Introduced a concept of time and motion by proposing a mechanism for the motion of heavenly bodies around the Earth. 
5. Provided an explanation for eclipses by theorizing that the Sun and Moon are both spheres. 
6. Established a mathematical formula to calculate the distance of stars by determining the ratio of the Earth's circumference to the distance of the stars. 
7. Proposed a theory of circular motion to explain the rotation of the Milky Way. 
8. Established the concept of the "golden mean" by using a geometric construction known as "The Anaximander Triangle".

Born 611 BC, Miletus near SÃ¶ke, Turkey. Died 546 BC.
