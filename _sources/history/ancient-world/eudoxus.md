**Eudoxus Of Cnidus** was a Greek mathematician and astronomer who contributed to [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621]. He mapped the stars and compiled a map of the known world. His philosophy influenced [Aristotle][bookofproofs$Aristotle].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the method of exhaustion, which laid the foundations of integral calculus.
2. Formulated the theory of proportion, which unified and extended earlier proportional theories.
3. Developed the Platonic theory of proportion, which proposed that all areas, volumes, and other geometrical figures could be much simpler if defined as ratios of line segments.
4. Was the originator of the “Coupled Argument” in geometrical proofs.
5. Established the astronomical “Octaeteris” (or “eight years cycle”) which was used for several centuries for the calculation of dates and movements of heavenly bodies.
6. Systemized the works of previous astronomers such as Hipparchus and Callippus.
7. Constructed the first Astrolabe, a device used to measure the positions of the stars and planets.
8. Was the founder of Mathematical Analysis, using deductive proofs, which he applied to the theory of proportion.

Born 408 BC, Cnidus (on Resadiye peninsula), Asia Minor (now Knidos, Turkey). Died 355 BC, Cnidus, Asia Minor (now Turkey).
