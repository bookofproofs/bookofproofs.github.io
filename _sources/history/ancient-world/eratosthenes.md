**Eratosthenes** was a Greek mathematician who is famous for his work on prime numbers and for measuring the diameter of the earth.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method to calculate the circumference of Earth using the difference in the angle of sunlight in two different locations.
2. Developed a system of prime numbers and suggested a sieve method to find prime numbers.
3. Established an estimated date for the beginning of the Olympiads.
4. Formulated a metric system for measuring distances across the Earth. 
5. Catalogued the stars of the Northern and Southern hemispheres.
6. Developed a calendar system for measuring the passage of time.
7. Calculated the tilt of the Earth’s axis to the Earth’s orbit around the sun.
8. Determined the Earth was not perfectly spherical, but instead slightly flattened at the poles.

Born 276 BC, Cyrene, North Africa (now Shahhat, Libya). Died 194 BC, Alexandria, Egypt.
