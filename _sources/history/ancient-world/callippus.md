**Callippus** was a Greek astronomer who made accurate determinations of the lengths of the seasons and constructed a calendarused by all later astronomers.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Callippic Cycle, which is an improvement of the Metonic Cycle, which was the primitive system of determining the periods of the moon.
2. Proposed a new method of astronomy, which was based on trigonometry.
3. Established an improved model of the solar system which included the motion of the sun and planets.
4. Used mathematical equations to measure the size and distance of the moon, planets and stars.
5. Performed calculations on the orbits of the planets, predicting eclipses and other celestial events.
6. Discovered that the length of a year was slightly different from the length of the seasons. 
7. Developed a way of predicting the length of a lunar month and the date of a lunar eclipse.
8. Discovered the precession of the equinoxes, the slow movement of the Earth's axis throughout space due to the gravitational pull of the sun and moon.

Born about 370BC, Cyzicus, Asia Minor (now Turkey). Died about 310 BC.
