**Democritus** was a Greek scholar who is best known for his atomic theory although he was also an excellent geometer.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the atomic theory of matter in around 460 BC, which posited that all matter is composed of indivisible and indestructible particles.
2. Developed various theories on the nature of void.
3. Proposed the existence of an infinite number of invisible atoms that combined to form all physical objects.
4. Proposed that atoms come in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes, with differing behavior.
5. Devised a system of reasoning that seeks to explain natural phenomena by breaking them down into constituent components.
6. Developed the idea of insignificance: that a single atom's behavior had no effect on that of the whole, thus establishing the concept of the conservation of matter.
7. Used mathematics to explain all known physical phenomena, such as magnetism, light, and gravity.
8. Proposed that all physical traits are predetermined by the shape, size, and motion of atoms.
9. Developed a philosophical system based on the concept of "atomism" that laid the foundations of modern science.

Born about 460BC, Abdera, Thrace, Greece. Died about 370 BC.
