**Theodosius** was a Greek mathematician and astronomer who worked on the geometry of the sphere.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered theorems for finding squares of pentagons, solutions for related problems and theorems concerning circles.
2. Developed a method to calculate the area of any triangleusing the lengths of its sides.
3. Proved a theorem that a circle can be equilateral inscribed in a triangle.
4. Developed an iterative method for approximating roots of equations.
5. Proposed the formula for finding the area of an ellipse.
6. Discovered a solution for proving the Pythagorean theorem.
7. Developed a theory on finding the volume of a conical frustum.
8. Proved theorems on volume and surface area of paraboloid sections.
9. Developed a solution to the problem of finding the surface area of a sphere using only the radius.
10. Published a treatise outlining his discoveries in geometry and arithmetic.

Born about 160BC, Bithynia, Anatolia (now Turkey). Died about 90 BC.
