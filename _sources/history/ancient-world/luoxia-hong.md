**Luoxia Hong** was a Chinese astronomer who was involved in calendar reform.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 140 BC, probably before Luoxia Hong was born, Emperor Wu-ti came to power and ruled from his capital Chang'an.
* Luoxia Hong was one of the astronomers who went to Chang'an in answer to Emperor Wu-ti's request.
* Luoxia, however, lived in the southwest of China.
* Emperor Wu-ti received eighteen proposals for a new calendar, and he judged the best one was that received from Luoxia Hong and one of his colleagues Deng Ping.
* Luoxia Hong's calendar was much more than simply an attempt to bring the sun and moon into a common system for he also gave predictions for the positions of the planets and predictions of eclipses.
* All this was only possible with good observations and the reason that they were good is that Luoxia Hong made an equatorial armillary sphere to make observations for his new calendar.
* Emperor Wu-ti was delighted with Luoxia Hong's achievements and offered him an official position in Chang'an.
* This offer, however, was refused, and Luoxia Hong returned to live a solitary life.

Born about 130 BC, Southwest China. Died about 70 BC, China.
