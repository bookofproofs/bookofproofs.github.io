**Pythagoras Of Samos** was a Greek philosopher who made important developments in mathematics, astronomy, and the theory of music. The theorem now known as [Pythagorean theorem][bookofproofs$968] was known to the Babylonians 1000 years earlier, but he may have been the first to prove it. 

The Pythagoreans find interconnections between number theory, geometry, astronomy, and music.

Born about 570 BC Samos, Ionia. Died about 490 BC.
