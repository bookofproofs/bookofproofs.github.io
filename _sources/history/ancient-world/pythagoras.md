**Pythagoras of Samos** was a Greek philosopher who made important developments in mathematics, astronomy, and the theory of music. The theorem now known as [Pythagorean theorem][bookofproofs$968] was known to the Babylonians 1000 years earlier but he may have been the first to prove it.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the famous theorem, known as “Pythagorean theorem”, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides in a right angle triangle. 
2. Developed the concept of irrational numbers which were previously thought to be impossible to express.
3. Developed a method for calculating the volume of a truncated pyramid.
4. Described the relationships between musical notes and mathematical ratios.
5. Improved understanding of the workings of geometric shapes and polygons.
6. Discovered relations between regular polygon side numbers and their respective angles. 
7. Founded a school with an emphasis on mathematics and astronomy to teach his theories and share his knowledge. 
8. Discovered that the morning star and evening star are the same celestial body.
9. Determined that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always equal to 180 degrees. 
10. Identified the idea of the golden ratio – a specific type of number that has a special relationship to other numbers and shapes.

Born about 570BC, Samos, Ionia. Died about 490 BC.
