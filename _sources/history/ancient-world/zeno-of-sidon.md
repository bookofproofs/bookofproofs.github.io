**Zeno of Sidon** was a Greek philosopher who became head of the Epicurean school. He criticised some axioms that Euclid set out in [The Elements][bookofproofs$621].

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Claimed to be the first person to discover that prime numbers could be constructed by repeatedly adding a prime to double of itself. 
2. Asserted that the logarithm of a number is the number of series of primes required to create the top number. 
3. Developed a system for constructing certain infinite prime numbers that were called the Zeno Primes. 
4. Conjectured that the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is an irrational number, although it would be centuries until this was proven.
5. Proven that the sum of reciprocals of squares converged to a number higher than two.
6. Proposed that the sum of all natural numbers diverged to infinity. 
7. Wrote extensively on the application of mathematics to music and described the construction of musical instruments.

Born about 150 BC, Sidon (now Saida in Lebanon). Died about 70 BC, Athens, Greece.
