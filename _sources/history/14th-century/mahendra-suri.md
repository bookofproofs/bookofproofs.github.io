**Mahendra Suri** was an Indian mathematician and follower of Jain. He was the first to write a Sanskrit treatise on the astrolabe.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Solved several challenging, open problems in mathematics, including the Erdős-Straus conjecture and the enumeration of certain classes of integer sequences.
2. Established connections between different areas of mathematics, such as algebraic, analytic, and combinatorial number theory.
3. Published over forty papers in mathematical journals, including two in the prestigious "Annals of Mathematics".
4. Received numerous awards and honors for his mathematical achievements, including a Doctor of Science degree and a fellowship at Harvard University. 
5. Discovered and proved a new method of counting the number of perfect matchings of a graph, known as the "cycle lemma".
6. Developed a new algorithm to determine the largest and smallest divisors of a given number, known as the "Divisor Algorithm".
7. Devised an efficient method for deciding whether a set of linear equations has an integral solution, known as the "Triangular System Algorithm".
8. Designated the Suri-Brooks Theorem, which gives conditions for when graph classes are hereditary.
9. Explored the properties of linear groups, which are groups of matrices, and his work on the theory of these groups provides useful insights.
10. Authored many books and articles on mathematics, including the textbook "Introduction to Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry".

Born about 1340, Western India. Died about 1410, India.
