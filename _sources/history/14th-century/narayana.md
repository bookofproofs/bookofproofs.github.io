* In the Ganita Kaumudi Narayana considers the mathematical operation on numbers.
* One of the unusual features of Narayana's work Karmapradipika is that he gave seven methods of squaring numbers which are not found in the work of other Indian mathematicians.
* In terms of geometry Narayana gave a rule for a segment of a circle.
* Narayana also gave a rule to calculate approximate values of a square root.
* Narayana gave the rules for the formation of doubly even, even and odd perfect magic squares along with magic triangles, rectangles and circles.
