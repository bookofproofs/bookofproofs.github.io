**Narayana** was an Indian mathematician who wrote on arithmetic following the work of Bhaskara II.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Narayana proved the mathematical question, "If a number is divided by 498, the remainder is 3; what is the number?"
2. He invented a counting system using zero as a placeholder which later became the foundation of modern arithmetic.
3. He developed the revolutionary astrological algorithm called Grahavigara.
4. He wrote the book Ganita Kaumudi which contained detailed methods of computation and other mathematical techniques.
5. He synthesized the existing knowledge of mathematics related to algebra, geometry, trigonometry, arithmetic and mathematical series.
6. He accurately calculated the value of pi and demonstrated the use of a series for calculating square roots.
7. He solved algebraic equations including linear equations, quadratic equations and indeterminate equations.
8. He devised the Newton-Gauss interpolation formula.
9. He developed the concept of continuity, proving the relationship between a finite and infinite series.
10. Narayana is credited with the discovery of the arithmetical triangle, extending the use of Pascal's triangle.

Born about 1340, India. Died about 1400, India.
