**Filippo Brunelleschi** was a Florentine artist and architect best known for the dome of Florence's cathedral.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed linear perspective in the early 1400s, allowing for more realistic painting options.
2. Developed the theory of solid geometry and elementary mechanics.
3. Developed mechanics of motion and devised a new way to determine the center of gravity.
4. Refined the use of proportion as it related to architecture, setting the standard for all Renaissance buildings.
5. Measured vertical distances and determined the proportion of image geometry through mathematical equations.
6. Applied geometry to design mechanical devices and perfected the construction of the arch and dome.
7. Revived the use of the Roman numeral system and Greek multiplication tables in the 1400s.
8. Developed a practical method for computing the surface area of the hemisphere.
9. Constructed the first successful modern style of dome vaulting, the landmark of Florence Cathedral.
10. Developed trigonometry in order to calculate the angles of construction of the dome.

Born 1377, Florence (now Italy). Died 15 April 1446, Florence (now Italy).
