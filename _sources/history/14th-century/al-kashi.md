**Jamshid al-Kashi** was an Islamic mathematician who published some important teaching works and anticipated Stevin's work on decimals.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Completed large astronomical work, the Zij-i Ilkhani, which included tables of solar, lunar and planetary motions and zig zags as well as a star catalogue.
2. Developed innovative methods of performing calculations with large numbers, including decimal fractions.
3. Calculated the most accurate trigonometric tables of his time, accurate to the 8th decimal
4. Introduced the concept of the sine rule to calculate the lengths of the sides of a triangle from the measure of its angles.
5. Developed a method for solving cubic equations.
6. Discovered a general formula for the volume of a tetrahedron and a cube.
7. Determined the area of a triangle from the length of its sides.
8. Calculated the surface of a sphere from its radius.
9. Developed a system of geometrical progression to accurately calculate the approximate value of square roots and cube roots.

Born about 1380, Kashan, Iran. Died 22 June 1429, Samarkand, Transoxania (now Uzbek).
