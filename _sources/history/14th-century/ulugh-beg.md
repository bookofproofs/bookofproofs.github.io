**Ulugh Beg** was the grandson of the conqueror Tamerlane and was a mathematician and astronomer. He founded an important centre for study at Samarkand staffed with the best scientists of the time. He did important early work on trigonometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established an astronomical observatory at Samarkand in 1424, which featured the world's most advanced astronomical instruments of that era. 
2. Wrote the Kitab-i-Miyari, a zij star catalogue based on the results of the observatory.
3. Computed the length of a year as 365.24219858156 days, which was the most accurate measurement until the 16th century. 
4. Expanded the astronomical notation system and invented the Zij-i-Sultani, an important astronomical text. 
5. Proposed a mathematical formulation for the machinery of the universe, which incorporated a variety of mathematical theorems from Euclid and the Pythagorean school. 
6. Conducted a major survey of the star system, resulting in 2,531 accurately plotted stars. 
7. Introduced the first Islamic methods of trigonometry. 
8. Computed the latitudes of various cities, such as Samarkand, Mecca, and Mashhad.

Born 1393, Soltaniyeh, Timurid, Persia (now Iran). Died 27 October 1449, Samarkand, Timurid empire.
