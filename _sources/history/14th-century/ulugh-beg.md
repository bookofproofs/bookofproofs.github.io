**Ulugh Beg** was the grandson of the conqueror Tamerlane and was a mathematician and astronomer. He founded an important centre for study at Samarkand staffed with the best scientists of the time. He did important early work on trigonometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Although in this archive we are primarily interested in Ulugh Beg's achievements in mathematics and astronomy, we need to examine the history of the area since it had such a major impact on Ulugh Beg's life.
* Timur, Ulugh Beg's grandfather, came from the Turkic Barlas tribe which was a Mongol tribe that was living in Transoxania, today essentially Uzbekistan.
* Shortly after his grandson Ulugh Beg was born, Timur invaded India and by 1399 he had taken control of Delhi.
* Ulugh Beg's father Shah Rukh was the fourth son of Timur and, by 1407, he had gained overall control of most of the empire, including Iran and Turkistan regaining control of Samarkand.
* Samarkand had been the capital of Timur's empire but, although his grandson Ulugh Beg had been brought up at Timur's court, he was seldom in that city.
* When Timur was not on one of his military campaigns he moved with his army from place to place and his court, including his grandson Ulugh Beg, travelled with him.
* However Shah Rukh did not give up Samarkand, rather he decided to give it to his son Ulugh Beg who was more interested in making the city a cultural centre than he was in politics or military conquest.
* Although Ulugh Beg was only sixteen years old when his father put him in control of Samarkand, he became his father's deputy and he became ruler of the Mawaraunnahr region.
* Ulugh Beg was primarily a scientist, in particular a mathematician and an astronomer.
* In 1417, to push forward the study of astronomy, Ulugh Beg began building a madrasah which is a centre for higher education.
* The madrasah, fronting the Rigestan Square in Samarkand, was completed in 1420 and Ulugh Beg then began to appoint the best scientists he could find to positions there as lecturers.
* Ulugh Beg invited al-Kashi to join his madrasah in Samarkand, as well as around sixty other scientists including Qadi Zada.
* There is little doubt that, other than Ulugh Beg himself, al-Kashi was the leading astronomer and mathematician at Samarkand.
* In the letters al-Kashi praises the mathematical abilities of Ulugh Beg but of the other scientists in Samarkand, only Qadi Zada earned his respect.
* Ulugh Beg led scientific meetings where problems in astronomy were freely discussed.
* Usually these problems were too difficult for all except al-Kashi and the letters confirm that al-Kashi was the closest collaborator of Ulugh Beg at his madrasah in Samarkand.
* In addition to the madrasah, Ulugh Beg built an observatory at Samarkand, the construction of this beginning in 1428.
* Al-Kashi and other mathematicians and astronomers appointed to the madrasah also worked at Ulugh Beg's Observatory.
* This excellent book records the main achievements which include the following: methods for giving accurate approximate solutions of cubic equations; work with the binomial theorem; Ulugh Beg's accurate tables of sines and tangents correct to eight decimal places; formulae of spherical trigonometry; and of particular importance, Ulugh Beg's Catalogue of the stars, the first comprehensive stellar catalogue since that of Ptolemy.
* The catalogue was the results of a combined effort by a number of people working at the Observatory including Ulugh Beg, al-Kashi, and Qadi Zada.
* The calculation is built on an accurate determination of sin 1Â° which Ulugh Beg solved by showing it to be the solution of a cubic equation which he then solved by numerical methods.
* Data from his Observatory allowed Ulugh Beg to calculate the length of the year as 365 days 5 hours 49 minutes 15 seconds, a fairly accurate value.
* Ulugh Beg's politics were not up to his science and, after his father's death in 1447, he was unable to retain power despite being an only son.
* It was discovered that Ulugh Beg had been buired in his clothes which is known to indicate that he was considered a martyr.

Born 1393, Soltaniyeh, Timurid, Persia (now Iran). Died 27 October 1449, Samarkand, Timurid empire.
