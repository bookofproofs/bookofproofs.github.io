**Madhava** was a mathematician from South India. He made some important advances in infinite series including finding the expansions for trigonometric functions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the infinite series approximation of π, now known as the Madhava-Leibniz series. 
2. Developed a method of integration to solve equations, now known as the ‘Kerala School Integration’. 
3. Developed the power series expansion of trigonometric functions, now known as the Taylor series.
4. Developed the concept of partial derivative and differential equations, now known as the Taylor-Madhava differential equations.
5. Established the basic rules about solving cubic equations. 
6. Allowed for the approximation of large-sized powers, now known as the Larder expansion. 
7. Developed an infinite continued fraction representation of the irrational numbers, now known as the Madhava-Newton continued fraction.

Born 1350, Sangamagramma (near Cochin), Kerala, India. Died 1425, India.
