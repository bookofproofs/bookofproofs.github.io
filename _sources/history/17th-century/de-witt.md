**Jan de Witt** was a Dutch mathematician and statesman who wrote on geometry and finance.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* De Witt was an associate of van Schooten and lived for a while in his house.
* His most important work Elementa curvarum linearum Ⓣ(Elements of curves) (1659-61)  was finished in 1649, and was the first systematic development of the analytic geometry of the straight line and conic.
* It was published by van Schooten as part of his edition of Descartes' Géometrie (1660).
* In 1650 de Witt was appointed Pensionary of Dordrecht, the leader of Dordrecht's deputation in the government of Holland.
* As leader of Holland, de Witt applied his mathematical knowledge to the financial and budgetary problems of the republic.
* He wrote The Worth of Life Annuities Compared to Redemption Bonds  which applied probability to questions of state finance.
* De Witt brought about peace with England in 1654 and after this he was extremely successful in bringing prosperity to Holland.
* When war broke out again with England in 1665 de Witt was able to bring about a very satisfactory settlement at the Treaty of Breda (1667).
* In 1672 France invaded and there were demonstrations against de Witt.
* When Jan came to visit Cornelius in prison they were attacked and killed by a large crowd.
* Let us look now at de Witt's major mathematical work, the Elementa curvarum linearum Ⓣ(Elements of curves).
* Let us point out that the word directrix  was first used by de Witt and appears in this work.
* In the same letter Witt criticises Apollonius who, in his opinion, had made things much too complicated.
* De Witt read the proofs and had the final say regarding changes to what van Schooten produced.

Born 24 September 1625, Dordrecht, Netherlands. Died 20 August 1672, The Hague, Netherlands.
