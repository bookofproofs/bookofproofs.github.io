**Jan de Witt** was a Dutch mathematician and statesman who wrote on geometry and finance.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In 1645 Jan and his elder brother Cornelius visited France, Italy, Switzerland and England, then on his return Jan lived at The Hague as an advocate from 1647 to 1650.
* De Witt was an associate of van Schooten and lived for a while in his house.
* His most important work Elementa curvarum linearum Ⓣ(Elements of curves) (1659-61)  was finished in 1649, and was the first systematic development of the analytic geometry of the straight line and conic.
* It was published by van Schooten as part of his edition of Descartes' Géometrie (1660).
* At this point we note that the reason for this long delay was that de Witt held high office in Holland  during the period following completion of the book and he was too occupied with his political work to do the necessary editing to prepare it for publication.
* In 1650 de Witt was appointed Pensionary of Dordrecht, the leader of Dordrecht's deputation in the government of Holland.
* Three years later he was appointed Grand Pensionary of Holland; this was the office of the Government Attorney (counsel for the defence of the rights of Holland) which effectively combined the offices of Prime Minister and Foriegn Secretary making de Witt the political leader of Holland.
* As leader of Holland, de Witt applied his mathematical knowledge to the financial and budgetary problems of the republic.
* He wrote The Worth of Life Annuities Compared to Redemption Bonds  which applied probability to questions of state finance.
* De Witt brought about peace with England in 1654 and after this he was extremely successful in bringing prosperity to Holland.
* When war broke out again with England in 1665 de Witt was able to bring about a very satisfactory settlement at the Treaty of Breda (1667).
* His political skills were further seen in the Triple Alliance (1668) between the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden.
* In 1672 France invaded and there were demonstrations against de Witt.
* His brother Cornelius was arrested on July 24 and two weeks later Jan de Witt resigned as political leader of Holland.
* When Jan came to visit Cornelius in prison they were attacked and killed by a large crowd.
* A vast crowd, hearing this, collected outside and finally burst in, seized the two brothers, and tore them to pieces.
* Let us look now at de Witt's major mathematical work, the Elementa curvarum linearum Ⓣ(Elements of curves).
* Let us point out that the word directrix  was first used by de Witt and appears in this work.
* In the same letter Witt criticises Apollonius who, in his opinion, had made things much too complicated.
* De Witt read the proofs and had the final say regarding changes to what van Schooten produced.

Born 24 September 1625, Dordrecht, Netherlands. Died 20 August 1672, The Hague, Netherlands.
