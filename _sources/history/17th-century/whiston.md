**William Whiston** was an English mathematician who succeeded Newton as Lucasian professor at Cambridge, but was later deprived of his chair on religious grounds.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published a groundbreaking book, A New Theory of the Earth in 1696, which formed the basis of modern geology. 
2. Made significant improvements on the algebraic notation of Isaac Newton (such as the use of the abbreviation '&' for 'and'). 
3. Proposed a novel system for solving polynomial equations. 
4. Discovered the laws of planetary motion and gravitation, as expressed in Newton's Principia. 
5. Developed a method for calculating logarithms and extending the range of tables of logarithms.
6. Published a book on trigonometry, The Doctrine of Triangles, in 1707. 
7. Contributed to the development of calculus by developing a general rule for integration.

Born 9 December 1667, Norton-juxta-Twycross, Leicestershire, England. Died 22 August 1752, Lyndon Hall, Rutland, England.
