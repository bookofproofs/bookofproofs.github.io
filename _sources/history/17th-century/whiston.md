**William Whiston** was an English mathematician who succeeded Newton as Lucasian professor at Cambridge, but was later deprived of his chair on religious grounds.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* William's mother was Katherine Rosse, whose father Gabriel Rosse had been the minister of Norton parish immediately prior to Josiah Whiston.
* William, the fourth of his parents nine children, was born in the rectory at Norton.
* William was taught by his father until he was 17, but he also acted in a secretarial role by copying manuscripts for his father.
* However Whiston inherited the family library and was following his father's wishes that he train to become a presbyterian minister.
* William attended Newton's lectures while at Cambridge and he showed great promise in mathematics.
* Of course the work mixed science and religion to the extent that Whiston claimed that the comet was divinely guided.
* Even those such as Buffon who criticised Whiston's book accepted some his ideas which they incorporated into their own theories.
* In 1698 Whiston obtained a vicarage in Suffolk at Lowestoft-with-Kissingland.
* They had eight children, of whom four (Sarah, William, George, and John) reached adulthood.
* However Whiston fell out with Newton over Bible chronology for, unlike Newton's, his cosmology involved direct intervention by God.
* Despite this much of Whiston's religious beliefs seem close to those of Newton.
* In May 1702 Whiston succeeded Newton as Lucasian professor and, in the following year, he published an edition of Tacquet's Euclid "for the use of young students in the University".
* With Newton's agreement, Whiston published Newton's algebra lectures in 1707 under the title Arithmetica universalis Ⓣ(Universal arithmetic) and, three years later, his own astronomy lectures as Praelectiones astronomicae Ⓣ(Astronomical lectures).
* He lectured at Cambridge on mathematics and natural philosophy and, after Roger Cotes was appointed to the Plumian professorship in 1706, receiving strong recommendations from Whiston, they undertook joint research.
* Whiston also published religious works such as Essay on the Revelation (1706).
* Whiston was now rather poor and lived off the income of a small farm near Newmarket.
* In 1714, along with Humphrey Ditton, Whiston approached parliament advising them to encourage work on solving the longitude problem by offering large financial rewards.
* Having been one of the main enthusiasts for the Longitude Act, Whiston now proposed a number of methods of finding the longitude at sea; there was a lot of money for a good solution but he never succeeded.
* It is suggested that Whiston fitted the surfaces using observations of inclination at a chosen triple of localities; and that he did this in order to use data from non-included localities as a check on his model.
* Whiston published The Longitude and Latitude Found by the Inclinatory or Dipping Needle in 1721.
* Wanting to return to an early form of Christianity, he founded the Society for Promoting Primitive Christianity in 1715 which held meetings in Whiston's London home.
* Lyndon Hall, where Whiston died, was the residence of Samuel Barker, the husband of Whiston's daughter Sarah.
* Ruth Whiston died in 1751, and Whiston died in the following year after being ill for one week.

Born 9 December 1667, Norton-juxta-Twycross, Leicestershire, England. Died 22 August 1752, Lyndon Hall, Rutland, England.
