**Takakazu Seki** was a Japanese mathematician who was the first person to study determinants. He also discovered Bernoulli numbers before Jacob Bernoulli.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the identity now known as Seki's Quintuple product identity.
2. Invented the mathematical field of binary arithmetic and subsequently introduced the "Null operator".
3. Established a new way of thinking by applying calculus to complex numbers, producing modern-day complex analysis.
4. Created fundamental methods for solving various mathematical problems, such as the separation of two different variables.
5. Developed the new school of algebra, known as Algebraic Calculus, which was instrumental for further progress in mathematics in the Edo period.
6. Discovered a new way to factorize quartic equations, which is now known as the "Seki–Umezawa method".
7. Authored a number of influential books such as Sanpo-Ao-Kisho, Kisei Yougyou, and Jinkoki.
8. Discovered longer Hayashi's formula, now referred to as Seki's formula.
9. Pioneered the use of often overlooked Fibonacci numbers and developed novel algebraic equations related to the numbers.
10. Established a new way of counting prime numbers in Japanese culture, which gave birth to modern-day “mizunara” theory.

Born March 1642, Fujioka (now Gunma), Kozuke, Japan. Died 5 December 1708, Edo (now Tokyo), Japan.
