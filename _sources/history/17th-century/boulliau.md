**Ismael Boulliau** was a French clergyman and amateur mathematician who proposed an inverse square law for gravitation before Newton.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* He is the Ismael Boulliau of this biography.
* Let us note that there was in Loudun an important circle of intellectuals of which Ismael Boulliau Senior was part.
* It was important for the young Ismael who attended these meetings and became acquainted with many leading men of the day.
* Boulliau was brought up a Calvanist by two Calvanist parents.
* It had been catalogued in 1622, ten years before Boulliau arrived in Paris, and Pierre and Jacques Dupuy travelled throughout France amassing books and manusctripts for the library.
* In his capacity as librarian Boulliau travelled widely in Italy, Holland and Germany buying books.
* Boulliau was a friend of Pascal, Mersenne and Gassendi and supported Galileo and Copernicus.
* In 1645 Boulliau published Astronomia philolaica â“‰(The astronomy of Philolaus)  which accepts elliptical orbits for planets.
* There is one aspect of Boulliau's philosophy which is well worth commenting on - namely the fact that he believed in simple explanations and moreover he wanted many different observed properties to result from a single cause.
* Boulliau was a close associate of Huygens who turned to him first with his discovery of the rings of Saturn and sent him pendulum clocks.
* One of the most interesting aspects for modern research into Boulliau, however, is that he was a prolific correspondent.

Born 28 September 1605, Loudun, France. Died 25 November 1694, Paris, France.
