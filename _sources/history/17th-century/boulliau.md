**Ismael Boulliau** was a French clergyman and amateur mathematician who proposed an inverse square law for gravitation before Newton.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ismael Boulliau, the father, was a notary by profession but was an amateur astronomer who made observations in Loudun.
* Susanna and Ismael Senior had their first son on 3 August 1604.
* He was called Ismael after his father but he did not live.
* They then called their second child, who was born in the following year, Ismael.
* He is the Ismael Boulliau of this biography.
* Let us note that there was in Loudun an important circle of intellectuals of which Ismael Boulliau Senior was part.
* It was important for the young Ismael who attended these meetings and became acquainted with many leading men of the day.
* We know that Boulliau's father observed the comet of 1607 which would later be called Halley's comet.
* This must have been an exciting event for both father and son, and Boulliau later published details of his father's observations of these comets in his famous treatise of 1645.
* Boulliau was brought up a Calvanist by two Calvanist parents.
* It had been catalogued in 1622, ten years before Boulliau arrived in Paris, and Pierre and Jacques Dupuy travelled throughout France amassing books and manusctripts for the library.
* The de Thou family were also heavily involved with the Bibliothèque du Roi, and they provided financial support for Boulliau in his work as a librarian.
* Boulliau had the right skills for the work he undertook, for he was a broad scholar with a deep interest in history, philosophy and classics, yet equally at home in the scientific circles of Paris where he began to shine building on the firm foundations in astronomy taught by his father.
* In his capacity as librarian Boulliau travelled widely in Italy, Holland and Germany buying books.
* Boulliau was a friend of Pascal, Mersenne and Gassendi and supported Galileo and Copernicus.
* In 1645 Boulliau published Astronomia philolaica Ⓣ(The astronomy of Philolaus)  which accepts elliptical orbits for planets.
* There is one aspect of Boulliau's philosophy which is well worth commenting on - namely the fact that he believed in simple explanations and moreover he wanted many different observed properties to result from a single cause.
* Boulliau was a close associate of Huygens who turned to him first with his discovery of the rings of Saturn and sent him pendulum clocks.
* One of the most interesting aspects for modern research into Boulliau, however, is that he was a prolific correspondent.

Born 28 September 1605, Loudun, France. Died 25 November 1694, Paris, France.
