**Ismael Boulliau** was a French clergyman and amateur mathematician who proposed an inverse square law for gravitation before Newton.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed influential theories on the orbit of the planets and the cycle of the moon.
2. Discovered that certain comets have an oval-shaped orbit and are not periodic.
3. Predicted the time of an eclipse. 
4. Developed innovative methods of calculating planetary positions, which enabled greater accuracy in calculating the orbits of planets.
5. Established the concept of an inverse square law governing the relationship between distances between attracted bodies. 
6. Pioneered various methods for the calculation of logarithms. 
7. Wrote “Exposure of the Planetary Motions” which contains a description of the geometric figures behind the calculations of planetary motion. 
8. Proved the heliocentric theory of Copernicus.
9. Demonstrated that Kepler’s three laws were correct by mathematical calculations.
10. Wrote his major treatise Astronomiae Philolaicae, or the Mathematical Elements of Astronomy.

Born 28 September 1605, Loudun, France. Died 25 November 1694, Paris, France.
