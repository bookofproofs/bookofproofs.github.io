**John Hadley** was an English instrument maker who improved the Gregorian reflecting telescope and invented the quadrant for navigation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. John Hadley was the first to successfully integrate mathematics and astronomy to precisely measure the angle of inclination of a planet’s orbit. 
2. He formulated Hadley’s Canon of dialling and developed the first sundial of the backstaff in 1683. 
3. He was the first to use logarithmic tables for navigation and his efforts for trigonometry and spherical astronomy made navigation much simpler and systematic. 
4. He is also noted for his experiments in barometric level that eventually led to the development of Newton’s Law of Gravity. 
5. He is credited for developing the first reflecting telescope that allowed for narrower and brighter imagines.

Born 16 April 1682, Bloomsbury, London, England. Died 14 February 1744, East Barnet, Hertfordshire, England.
