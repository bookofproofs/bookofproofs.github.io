### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* George Hadley became high sheriff of Hertfordshire when John was nine years old.
* John was five years older than Henry and three years older than George.
* Hadley was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 21 March 1717 and he attained high office in the Society when he was elected Vice President on 12 February 1728.
* We have indicated above that Hadley had a financial position which enabled him to devote both time and money to science.
* This motivated Hadley to tackle the problem and in 1730 he invented the reflecting octant which measured the altitude of the sun or of a star.
* In 1731 Hadley showed his new quadrant to theRoyal Society and published a description in his paper Description of a new instrument for taking angles which appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.
