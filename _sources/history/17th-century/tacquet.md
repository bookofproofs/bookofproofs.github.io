**Andrea Tacquet** was a Flemish Jesuit who wrote some popular teaching works.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored the book "Cylindricall Mathematics", considered one of the most innovative works on geometry in the 17th century.
2. Developed a series of theorems helping to solve non-Euclidean problems related to trigonometry.
3. Discovered a method to calculate the lengths of all sides of any triangle without having to measure them directly.
4. Developed the first algorithm to calculate the area of any polygon accurately.
5. Pioneered the study of ellipses, which led to the creation of new textbooks and tables.
6. Proposed an improved method for calculating the area of a circle and arc.
7. Was the first mathematician to suggest the concept of the "zero" when solving equations.
8. Established the binomial theorem for any power of two, which enabled the faster solving of higher-order equations.
9. Explored the symmetry of curves and their applications in geometry.
10. Developed new methods for analyzing complex 3-dimensional shapes.

Born 23 June 1612, Antwerp, Dutch Republic (now Belgium). Died 22 December 1660, Antwerp, Dutch Republic (now Belgium).
