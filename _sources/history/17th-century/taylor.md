**Brook Taylor** was an English mathematician who added to mathematics a new branch now called the 'calculus of finite differences', invented integration by parts, and discovered the celebrated formula known as Taylor's expansion.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Formulated Taylor's theorem, an important theorem in calculus which was later generalized by Lagrange.
2. Developed a method for solving linear differential equations with many variables.
3. Provided scientific and mathematical underpinning for the calculus of variations.
4. Wrote the book ‘Methodus Incrementorum Directa et Inversa’ which is considered one of the groundbreaking works on calculus.
5. Established what is now known as the Brook Taylor's Law of Perspective, a set of rules for defining and transforming graphical perspective.
6. Devised an early method of analytical geometry by which geometrical properties could be expressed in a series of equations.
7. Put forward a theory of probabilities that laid the foundations of what is now known as the Bayesian Inference.

Born 18 August 1685, Edmonton, Middlesex, England. Died 29 December 1731, Somerset House, London, England.
