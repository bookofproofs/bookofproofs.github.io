**John Wilkins** was an English mathematician who was one of the founders of the Royal Society. He wrote on astronomy and mechanical machines.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established mathematical principles of uniform acceleration and its application to freely falling bodies.
2. Proposed the systematic use of mathematical principles to explain the universe and its contents.
3. Developed a classification system for storage of scientific knowledge; the basis for modern scientific literature.
4. Advanced the science of optics through his studies in reflection, refraction and colours.
5. Enabled navigation at sea by demonstrating the possibility of accurately measuring longitude and thus establishing geographical boundaries.
6. Devised a mathematical system for calculating the area of circles. 
7. Propounded theories on the nature of the planets and gravity.
8. Suggested the use of telescopic lenses to better examine the cosmos.

Born 1614, Fawsley (4, km S of Daventry), Northamptonshire, England. Died 19 November 1672, Chester, England.
