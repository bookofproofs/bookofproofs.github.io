**Giovanni Ceva** was an Italian mathematician who rediscovered Menelaus's theorem and proved his own well-known theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Ceva's father, Carlo Francesco Ceva (1610-1690), was a man who undertook many different activities such as buying and selling houses and land.
* They had several children: Laura Maria Francesca Elisabetta Ceva (born 1640), Clara Giustina Bonaventura Ceva (born 1642), Iginio Nicol√≤ Ceva (born 1644), Francesco Ceva (born 1645), Giovanni Benedetto Ceva (the subject of this biography, born 1647), Tommaso Ceva (who also has a biography in this archive, born 1648), Teresa Francesca Ceva (born 1650), and Cristoforo Vittore Ceva (born 1652).
* Giovanni Ceva's cousin, also named Carlo Francesco Ceva, was the Bishop of Tortona.
* We know no details of Ceva's youth, but he does make an intriguing comment that his youth was saddened by "many kinds of misfortune".
* Giovanni Ceva was educated at the Collegio di Brera, a Jesuit college in Milan, where he showed a particular aptitude for science, particularly for mathematics.
* He also studied under Alessandro Marchetti (1633-1714), who succeeded his teacher Giovanni Alfonso Borelli (1608-1679) as professor of mathematics at Pisa in 1679.
* While studying in Pisa, Ceva also met Michelangelo Ricci who, like Rossetti, was a member of the Mathematics-Physics Academy of Rome.
* It is highly likely, therefore, that Ceva spent some time at the Academy in Rome during his two years of residence in Pisa.
* Following his stay in Pisa, Ceva carried on with his mathematical studies which he would publish in his work De lineis rectis se invicem secantibus statica constructio (1678), and, at the same time, he continued with similar activities to those of his father.
* In this administrative position, Ceva was essentially responsible for the economy of Mantua and Montferrat.
* Major government roles did not stop Ceva finding time to pursue his scientific studies, however, for during this period he undertook the work that he wrote up in Opuscula mathematica de potentiis obliquis, de pendulis, de vasis et de fluminibus  in 1682.
* In 1683 the Duke of Mantua granted Ceva citizenship of Mantua, showing how important the Duke considered Ceva's contributions to the state.
* Although he was very busy with his duties for the Duke, Ceva continued to undertake mathematical research.
* The Duke of Mantua extended the citizenship, which he had already given to Ceva, to his children.
* Ceva continued to undertake research on geometric problems and to work on economic issues, the results of his research being published in the two works of 1710 and 1711, respectively, mentioned below.
* Giovanni Ceva quickly moved to support the new Austrian regime and in fact he was chosen by the people of a district of the city as their nominee to swear allegiance to their new political masters.
* For most of his life Giovanni Ceva worked on geometry.
* Ceva also rediscovered and published Menelaus's theorem in this work.
* That the book was not fully appreciated at the time of its publication is suggested by the fact that only one edition appeared and also by the fact that many of the results in the book were later rediscovered by others who were unaware of Ceva's work.
* The importance of Ceva's discoveries was only fully appreciated when pointed out by Michel Chasles in the 19th  century.
* In addition to his work on geometry, Ceva studied applications of mechanics and statics to geometric systems.
* As we mentioned above, Ceva published Opuscula mathematica in 1682.
* In the following year he published De re nummeraria quod fieri potuit, geometrice tractata, one of the first works in mathematical economics; in it Ceva attempted to solve the conditions of equilibrium for the monetary system of a state like Mantua.
* As we have mentioned a number of times, Ceva did important work on hydraulics.
* In his role in the government of Mantua he was able to use his knowledge of hydraulics and argue successfully against a project which proposed to divert the river Reno into the river Po. Ceva put forward his views in the pamphlet Conseguenze del Reno, se coll'aderire al progetto de' Signori Bolognesi, si permettesse in Po grande (1716) but these views were opposed by Eustachio Manfredi who replied with the pamphlet Ragioni del Signor G.
* The argument was finally settled in Ceva's favour with his final pamphlet on the topic Risposta alle osservazioni del Sig.

Born 1 September 1647, Milan, Hapsburg Empire (now Italy). Died 13 May 1734, Mantua, Hapsburg Empire (now Italy).
