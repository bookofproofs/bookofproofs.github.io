**Giovanni Ceva** was an Italian mathematician who rediscovered Menelaus's theorem and proved his own well-known theorem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote the book De Lineis Rectis (The Straight Line), which provided the first comprehensive treatment of the theory of one-dimensional geometry.
2. Developed the theory of center of gravity.
3. Introduced the modern method of solving quadratic equations.
4. Coined the term “tangent” to describe a line that intersects a curve at a single point.
5. Demonstrated the theorem of Menelaus, which states that if three points on one side of a transversal intersect the sides of a triangle, then the other three points lie in a cyclic order.
6. Discovered what is now known as Ceva's Theorem, which states that if a line intersects the three sides of a triangle at the points A, B and C in that order, then the point bisectors of those sides will be concurrent (meet at a common point).
7. Showed that the two diagonals of any quadrilateral are equal in length if and only if the quadrilateral is cyclic.

Born 1 September 1647, Milan, Hapsburg Empire (now Italy). Died 13 May1734, Mantua, Hapsburg Empire (now Italy).
