**Eustachio Manfredi** was an Italian mathematician, astronomer and poet.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published over four hundred mathematical theories, including solutions to long-standing problems in geometry, optics, and mechanics. 
2. Developed a theoretical revision of the Equivalence Principle, later referred to as the Manfredi-Archimedes Principle.
3. Established a new standard for geometry with his book, De Geometriae Elementorum Naturalis.
4. Pioneered the development of several new concepts of integral calculus and descriptive geometry. 
5. Published a comprehensive work on projectile motion, entitled De Projectione Motuum. 
6. Developed profound theories in the fields of optics, acoustics, and kinetic energy. 
7. Proposed laws concerning the nature of gravitation, including his Law of Motion. 
8. Solved several complex mathematical problems related to acceleration, volume, and motion. 
9. Published a number of books on both mathematics and philosophy, including the widely-read De Meteorologia. 
10. Contributed to a full revision of Euclidean geometry, later referred to as Manfredian Geometry.

Born 20 September 1674, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy). Died 15 February 1739, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy).
