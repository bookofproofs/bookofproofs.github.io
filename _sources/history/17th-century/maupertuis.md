**Pierre-Louis Maupertuis** was a French mathematician who is most famous for formulating the principle of least action.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the principle of least action, which postulates that force takes the path of least resistance in nature.
2. Formulated the law of refraction of light, which determined the relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction of a light ray.
3. Performed the first quantitative measurement of the Earth’s oblateness, known as La Géométrie de Maupertuis.
4. Reformulated Newton's laws of motion to make them simpler and more concise.
5. Providing evidence against Newton's theory of vortices, which proposed that the planets were pulled around their orbits by a combination of invisible whirlpools.
6. Established Newton’s law of gravitation as the law of attraction between two masses, which became the foundation of classical mechanics.
7. Failed to prove the constancy of gravitational attraction, as he postulated that a greater mass would have an increased gravitational attraction.
8. Wrote his work Mécanique céleste, a treatise on analytic mechanics which improved on equations previously established by Isaac Newton.

Born 28 September 1698, Saint Malo, France. Died 27 July 1759, Basel, Switzerland.
