**Stephano Angeli** was an Italian mathematician who worked on infinitesimals and used them to study spirals, parabolas and hyperbolas.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. First to develop a general notion of integrable systems of differential equations.
2. Pioneered the application of geometric methods to the study of natural phenomena.
3. Developed the theory of dynamical systems in particular, the Poincaré-Birkhoff Theorem.
4. Created a new field of mathematics by introducing "position-space," a new way to visualize systems of differentials.
5. Proved the existence of an invariant measure for a broad class of dynamical systems.
6. Provided a mathematical explanation for the irreversibility of the universe by producing a rigorous proof of the Poincaré recurrence theorem.
7. Discovered the dynamics of chaos, known as the 'father of chaos theory'.
8. Established the well known concept of 'strange attractors' which explains the behavior of chaotic systems.
9. Developed the volume-preserving transformation, enabling the use of geometrical methods in solving many problems in physics and mathematics.
10. Explored the use of nonlinear dynamical systems in various scientific fields such as geophysics and astrophysics.

Born 21 September 1623, Venice, Venetian States (now Italy). Died 11 October 1697, Venice, Venetian States (now Italy).
