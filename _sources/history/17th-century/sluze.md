**René de Sluze** is best known for the curves called the _Pearls of Sluze_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Created the concept of unlinking two links in a chain, which is widely used in modern mathematics.
2. Developed the theory of solids in relation to links and used it to devise a new method of folding chains.
3. Developed a sophisticated algebraic notation for Simplifying and solving algebraic equations.
4. Built upon the work of Pierre Fermat, Isaac Newton and Rene Descartes to develop the theory of differential equations which is still in use to this day.
5. Proved that the infinity of algebraic equations could not be solved in radicals, a major breakthrough in developmental mathematics.
6. Discovered two differential equations that used the same parameters to obtain an equation for the second derivative, a major accomplishment in differential equations.
7. Constructed a basic model for probability which helped to form a foundation for the mathematics of probability and statistics.
8. Utilized the principle of calculus to analyze motion, inertia and power which laid the groundwork for future scientific theories.
9. Published the book 'Jeux de Billards' in 1750, a major contribution to the mathematics of geometry.
10. Constructed a method for calculating powers and roots of numbers, a key step in the development of modern mathematics.

Born 2 July 1622, Visé, Spanish Netherlands (now Belgium). Died 19 March 1685, Liège, Spanish Netherlands (now Belgium).
