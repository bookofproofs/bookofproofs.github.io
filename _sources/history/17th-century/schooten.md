**Frans van Schooten** was a Dutch mathematician who was one of the main people to promote the spread of Cartesian geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was one of the most influential Dutch mathematicians of the 17th century who laid the foundations of modern-day analytical geometry.
2. He wrote the first edition of Van Schooten's Geometry as well as 3 additional works on mathematical topics.
3. He invented a method for automatic algebraic differentiation, and extended Descartes' work on geometry which allowed for a better understanding of curves and surfaces, and led to the development of calculus.
4. He introduced and explained the use of coordinate systems and showed how to solve equations and systems of equations by graphical methods.
5. He greatly improved the methods of solving linear algebraic equations, alternating them with geometric operations.
6. He popularized the use of exponential and logarithmic functions by introducing them to the public through his works.
7. His works also included an explanation of the areas and volumes of certain analytical figures, as well as the querie (a method of finding the centers of gravity and masses rising from three-dimensional bodies).

Born 15 May 1615, Leiden, Netherlands. Died 29 May 1660, Leiden, Netherlands.
