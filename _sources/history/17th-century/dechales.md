**Claude Dechales** was a French Jesuit who published a widely used textbook on mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He wrote the treatise “Cours de mathematiques”, which creates the foundation of modern mathematics. 
2. In his works, Dechales applied spherical trigonometry to astronomy and geography. 
3. He developed the concept of circumcenters, which overlaps with modern concepts of circumcenters used in geometry. 
4. He studied properties of conic sections and the nature of curved lines. 
5. He formulated the rules of coordinate geometry, which contributed to the development of analytic geometry. 
6. He wrote “De Mensuris et Ponderibus” which described the history of weights and systems of measuring.
7. He wrote “De Arithmeticae Practica”, a treatise on arithmetical operations and mathematical instruments. 
8. He wrote his major work “Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus” which discusses quadrature of curves, plane and spherical trigonometry, calculations of eclipses, and diastematum. 
9. He produced several treatises on the 'Fundamental Theorem of Algebra', a turning point of mathematics. 
10. He held the position of mathematic professor at the University of Strasbourg for more than twenty years.

Born 1621, Chambéry, France. Died 28 March 1678, Turin (now Italy).
