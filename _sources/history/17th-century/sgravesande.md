**Willem 'sGravesande** was a Dutch mathematician who expounded Newton's philosophy in Europe.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed new geometrical proofs of basic Euclidean theorems. 
2. Established a system of mathematical notation. 
3. Described several physical experiments that demonstrate the basic laws of mechanics.
4. Proposed a systematic procedure for treating collisions of two hard bodies. 
5. Demonstrated how to calculate curvilinear figures in a mechanical way. 
6. Developed a numerical system for calculating the trajectory of a ball in projectile motion. 
7. Deduced the law of action and reaction from a series of experiments. 
8. Applied the mathematical theories of calculus to investigate the motion of free-falling bodies. 
9. Founded the mathematical field of hydrodynamics by developing a mathematical theory of fluid dynamics.
10. Introduced the concept of inertia into Dutch physics.

Born 26 September 1688, 'sHertogenbosch, Netherlands. Died 28 February 1742, Leiden, Netherlands.
