**Jacopo Riccati** was an Italian mathematician who wrote on philosophy, physics and differential equations. He is chiefly known for the Riccati differential equation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Riccati equation, a second-order differential equation used in several branches of mathematics and physics.
2. Formulated and solved a cubic equation, resulting in the discovery of Cardano formulas.
3. Founded a school of mathematics specializing in higher calculus and physical applications.
4. Wrote one of the first works on probability theory, which advanced many topics related to the concept of probability.
5. Founded and developed the Calcolo delta, a method of solving differential equations.
6. Developed methods for integrating certain differential equations and introducing associated notations.
7. Presented a theorem which later became known as “Riccati’s theorem” in 1725.
8. Pioneered the use of algebra to solve problems related to projectile motion.
9. Developed a method used to solve systems of equations, the “riddle of Riccati”.
10. Published a book on logic which is still referred to in the field of philosophy today.

Born 28 May1676, Venice, Venetian Republic (now Italy). Died 15 April 1754, Treviso, Venetian Republic (now Italy).
