**Isaac Barrow** was an English mathematician who developed a method of determining tangents that closely approached the methods of calculus, and he was first to recognise that integration and differentiation are inverse operations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Creating the foundation for differential and integral calculus.
2. Defining the relation between a tangent line and a curve.
