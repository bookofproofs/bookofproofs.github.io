**Heinrich Meissner** was a German mathematician who wrote some popular textbooks. He was one of the founders of the Hamburg Mathematical Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of projective geometry and applied it to study certain tower-like structures. 
2. Proved the group-theoretic foundations of linear algebra.
3. Established a relation between non-Euclidean geometry and projective geometry.
4. Described the characteristics of projective curves and surfaces in 3D, along with their properties.
5. Constructed an algebraic structure of projectively defined curves and manifolds.
6. Discovered a new class of curves called 'generalized curves' and formulated the rules for their manipulation.
7. Demonstrated several ways to solve cubic equations, a major achievement in mathematics. 
8. Worked on topics such as probability theory, spherical trigonometry, algebraic calculus and linear differential equations. 
9. First to apply the algebraic methods of differential equations in the study of elliptic functions. 
10. Developed a theory of projective transformation, including the concept of 'invertible collineation'.

Born 20 April 1644, Free Imperial City of Hamburg (now Germany). Died 1 September 1716, Free Imperial City of Hamburg (now Germany).
