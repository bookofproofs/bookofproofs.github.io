**Jeremiah Horrocks** was an English astronomer who improved Kepler's tables and worked on the lunar theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered a new method to calculate the solar eclipse.
2. Discovered that the Moon's orbit was an ellipse rather than a circle.
3. Predicted the first transit of Venus in 1639 and successfully observed it.
4. Calculated a more accurate value for the length of the year than was previously known.
5. Developed a hypothesis for gravitational forces between the Earth and the Sun.
6. Showed that a partial lunar eclipse was caused by the shadow of the Earth.
7. Developed a new method for treating planetary orbits.
8. Became the first to calculate a true astronomical forecast.

Born 1618, Toxteth, Liverpool, England. Died 3 January 1641, Toxteth, Liverpool, England.
