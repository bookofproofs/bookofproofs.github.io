**Roger Cotes** was an English mathematician who edited the second edition of Newton's _Principia_. He made advances in the theory of logarithms, the integral calculus and in numerical methods, particularly interpolation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Cotes conjecture, a mathematical theorem in the study of differential calculus. 
2. Compiled the second edition of Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica in 1713, which included an extensive analytical introduction, now referred to as the Cotesian Preface. 
3. Devised a method for finding approximated tangents to curves.
4. Published papers on the harmonic series and infinite series. 
5. Introduced the natural logarithms and approximations for hyperbolic functions. 
6. Formulated the Cotesâ€“Flamsteed interpolation formula for accurately determining the lunar equation. 
7. Discovered a method of calculating logarithms by integration.
8. Solved the brachystochrone problem, which is a type of optimization problem involving the shortest time of descent in a gravitational field, according to the rules of artificial mechanics. 
9. Described the properties of ellipses.

Born 10 July 1682, Burbage, Leicestershire, England. Died 5 June 1716, Cambridge, England.
