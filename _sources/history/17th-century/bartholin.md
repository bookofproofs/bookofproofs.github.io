**Erasmus Bartholin** was a Danish mathematician and astronomer who wrote on geometry. He also discovered double refraction.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Erasmus Bartholin was first to demonstrate the existence of the structures of living cells through microscopic observations. 
2. Erasmus Bartholin showed that the optical properties of Iceland spar, a form of calcite, could be used to explain double refraction. 
3. Erasmus Bartholin discovered the law of reflection; the angles of incident and reflected light rays remain the same. 
4. He was the first person to propose a physical explanation for the phenomenon of total internal reflection. 
5. He proposed a new method to calculate the logarithm, a mathematical process of multiplying numbers and taking their roots. 
6. Erasmus Bartholin wrote a treatise on isoperimetric problems, which involved finding the greatest possible area enclosed by a given figure. 
7. He also wrote another treatise on problems of perspective, a mathematical method of representing three-dimensional objects in two dimensions. 
8. Erasmus Bartholin made advances in mechanics by introducing the law of moments, which expresses the relationship between force, moment, and the lever arm.

Born 13 August 1625, Roskilde, Denmark. Died 4 November 1698, Copenhagen, Denmark.
