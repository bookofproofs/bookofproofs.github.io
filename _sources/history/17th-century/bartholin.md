**Erasmus Bartholin** was a Danish mathematician and astronomer who wrote on geometry. He also discovered double refraction.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Caspar Bartholin was a Danish physician and theologian who wrote one of the most widely read Renaissance manuals of anatomy.
* He was a professor at the University of Copenhagen when Erasmus was born but died when Erasmus was less than four years old.
* Erasmus received his first education from private tutors, then he attended a Latin school.
* Bartholin edited Introduction to the geometry of Descartes  by van Schooten and also translated Optics  of Larissa into Latin.
* Bartholin considered the problem in geometric form.
* Bartholin could well have come across the proof in papers which Debeaune sent him for safe keeping shortly before his death in 1652.
* To see the range of topics on which Bartholin wrote, consider his book De naturae mirabilibus quaestiones academicae â“‰(Academic questions on the wonders of the nature)  which he published in 1674.
* Bartholin wrote a large number of mathematical works but he is best remembered for his discovery of the double refraction of light through a crystal of Iceland spar which had been gathered in an expedition to Iceland in 1668.
* During his experiments, Bartholin also observed that when the crystals of Iceland spar are rotated about their axis, one of the two images moves in a circle around the other.
* Bartholin's explanation was based on Descartes' theory of light along with his idea that there were two sets of "pores" in the crystal.
* Bartholin also prepared for publication the observations of Tycho Brahe.
* Bartholin is also famed for his medical work, in particular his introduction of quinine in the fight against malaria.
* Thomas Bartholin founded the journal Acta medica et philosophica Hafniensia  to which Erasmus Bartholin contributed papers.

Born 13 August 1625, Roskilde, Denmark. Died 4 November 1698, Copenhagen, Denmark.
