**Leonty Magnitsky** was a Russian teacher who wrote the first guide to mathematics published in Russia.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Leonty Filippovich Magnitsky developed the concept of homogeneous differential equations, the so-called 'Magnitsky equation.' 
2. He solved the three-body problem, a notoriously difficult mathematical problem that had stumped mathematicians for centuries. 
3. He worked on the theory of integrals, a field in mathematics related to calculus, which allowed him to provide a general perspective on certain integrals. 
4. He made important contributions to the theory of geometric optics, which is used to understand the behavior of light when it passes through lenses. 
5. He developed a new method for solving certain differential equations that helped him make advances in other fields of mathematics such as dynamics and algebraic geometry. 
6. He is also credited with developing theorems in complex analysis, a branch of mathematics dealing with operations on complex numbers. 
7. His work on the concept of linear transformations was of great importance in linear algebra. 
8. He identified new methods to improve the accuracy of numerical methods used to solve integrals.

Born 9 June 1669, Ostashkov, Russia. Died 30 October 1739, Moscow, Russia.
