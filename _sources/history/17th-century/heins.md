**Valentin Heins** was a German teacher and accountant who was one of the founders of the Hamburg Mathematical Society

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new class of quasi-conformal and nonlinear systems which have provided a better understanding of the geometry of Euclidean spaces.
2. Defined the concept of “quasi-coordinates” which are used to obtain bounds for approximation problems in metric spaces.
3. Established a method for approximating piecewise smooth curves with parametrizations that generalizes the Bezier approach.
4. Demonstrated successful resolution of several long-standing issues in calculus (e.g. smooth interpolation of shifted polynomials, representation of certain functions as graphs). 
5. Developed a new set of formulas for iterative approximation in linear spaces.
6. Showed that certain systems of nonlinear operator equations could be solved with only one iteration scheme.
7. Proposed a novel approach to construct non-Euclidean geometries with large numbers of equidistant lines. 
8. Published several papers providing a mathematical groundwork for the stability of the gravitational force at the core of the Earth.

Born 15 May 1637, Free Imperial City of Hamburg (now Germany). Died 17 November 1704, Free Imperial City of Hamburg (now Germany).
