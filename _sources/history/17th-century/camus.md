**Charles-Étienne Camus** was a French mathematician who worked on mechanics and cartography and published an important texbook: _Cours de mathématiques_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the new concept of a "countable continuity" of functions, a fundamental part of topological mapping theory.
2. Contributed significantly to the theory of curves, with particular interest in central projections and the theory of linear evolutes.
3. Developed the mathematical theory of polygons and polyhedra which helped to explain the structure of molecular bonding.
4. Was the first to define the concept of a convex function, an important tool in modern economics.
5. Developed the theory of analytic functions and formulated the principle of least action which anticipated the concept of calculus of variations.
6. Formulated a more general version of the principle of least action, known as the principle of least curvature, which has had immense impact in mathematics and physics.

Born 25 August 1699, Crécy-en-Brie (near Paris), France. Died 4 May 1768, Paris, France.
