**Philippe de la Hire** was a French mathematician who worked on conic sections and on geodesy and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed to the development of analytic geometry and established the principles of analytical methods for solving geometric problems. 
2. Introduced the graphical representation of algebraic equations.
3. Pioneered the use of 'infinitesimals' (infinity divided by infinity) to solve mathematical equations.
4. Developed a method for finding the center of gravity for a body of any shape or form. 
5. Discovered the analytical solution to the arc tangent equation and the generalization of the 'logarithmic spiral'.
6. Made significant contributions to the field of mechanics, by introducing the rule of the parallelogram of forces. 
7. Instrumental in providing mathematical proof and groundwork of the law of refraction of light. 
8. Approximated Pi using a method now known as the De la Hire Method. 
9. Demonstrated how two conic sections can be differentiated by their coordinates.

Born 18 March 1640, Paris, France. Died 21 April 1718, Paris, France.
