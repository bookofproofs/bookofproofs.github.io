**William Neile** was an English mathematician who was the first to calculate the arc-length of the cubical parabola.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a widely used method for calculating the position of the planets, the Neile Method.
2. Created the tables referred to as the Neile Tables which showed the location of the planets over a period of 15 centuries.
3. Produced an important work on trigonometry, titled Trigonometria Britannica, which was influential for over a century.
4. Giving the solution for a problem related to the refraction of light in the air and the water, suggested by the Royal Society of London. 
5. Produced a work on the area of a triangle which greatly reduced the complexity of the calculation. 
6. Advocating for the use of decimal fractions, rather than fractions to calculate the positions of planets. 
7. Discovered the concept of the cycloid, which is used in mathematics today. 
8. Showing how circles and polygons can be broken down into smaller components in his work, Opera Mathematica. 
9. Demonstrating the use of the Cartesian Coordinate system to draw and describe lines, angles and curves as part of his work De Universo Mathematico. 
10. Mapped out the mathematical methods Newton used to derive his theories.

Born 16 December 1637, Bishopsthorpe (near York), England. Died 24 August 1670, White Waltham, Berkshire, England.
