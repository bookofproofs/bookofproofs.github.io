**Robert Boyle** was an Irish-born scientist who was a founding fellow of the Royal Society. His work in chemistry was aimed at establishing it as a mathematical science based on a mechanistic theory of matter.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of Boyle's law of gases, which states that the pressure of an enclosed gas is inversely proportional to its volume.
2. Formulated an equation that describes the amount of gas pressure as a function of volume.
3. Conducted experiments on the elasticity or compressibility of air which led to his discovery of the inverse relationship between pressure and volume.
4. Described the particle theory of matter and the wave theory of light.
5. Used mathematics to calculate the mass and volume of atoms.
6. Developed a model for gases based on the behavior of discrete molecules.
7. Proposed a law of nature to explain the behavior of gases as they expand to fill their containers.
8. Explored the relationship between temperature and pressure while investigating Boyle's law.
9. Investigated the behavior of gases in confined spaces, such as in a closed container or in a vacuum.

Born 25 January 1627, Lismore, County Waterford, Ireland. Died 30 December 1691, London, England.
