**John Wallis** was an English mathematician who built on Cavalieri's method of indivisibles to devise a method of interpolation. Using Kepler's concept of continuity he discovered methods to evaluate integrals.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the early concepts of integration, including the integration of both algebraic and trigonometric equations.
2. Developed the concept of infinity in mathematics with his work on the infinite series.
3. Formulated the "Wallis Product," an important tool for numerical integration which is still in use today.
4. Contributed to the development of calculus with his formula for calculating the area under a curve (the Wallis Integral).
5. Developed the arithmetic underlying the binary system and studied the relationships between geometry and algebra.
6. Published important treatises on subjects such as Fourier series, the conic sections, linear equations, and the calculus of variations.
7. Showed how the cycloid can be used to solve a variety of problems in mathematics.
8. Evaluated the works of other leading scientists of his day and wrote to them about math-related topics.

Born 23 November 1616, Ashford, Kent, England. Died 28 October 1703, Oxford, England.
