**Louis Carré** was a French mathematician who published the first French book on the integral calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Although we have no information about other members of Carré's family, it would seem that Louis could not have been the eldest son, for at this time the eldest son would be expected to take over running his parents' farm.
* Louis did not want to take holy orders but, out of respect for his father, he spent three years studying theology in Paris.
* Carré could not remain at university without the financial support of his father so he was forced to leave and seek employment.
* In particular, Carré now had a home, living with Malebranche who became his friend as well as his employer.
* It was in this remarkable atmosphere of learning and scholarship that Carré, who was in many ways a country lad lacking in the ways of sophisticated Paris, was taught mathematics and metaphysics by Malebranche.
* He spent seven years as Malebranche's secretary which gave Carré the equivalent of a university education.
* The language of Carré being rather unpolished and ungrammatical, one of his fair pupils offered to give him lessons in French, in return for his philosophical instructions.
* Carré cheerfully accepted the offer, and often acknowledged himself greatly indebted to the instructions which he then received.
* At this stage, Carré seems to have been interested mainly in philosophy and, other than teaching mathematics, did not take much interest in current mathematical research.
* This stimulated Carré's interest in mathematics and, from this time on, he began working hard on writing a calculus text.
* In Une methode pour Ia mesure des surfaces Ⓣ(A method for measuring the area of surfaces), the first French textbook on the integral calculus, Carré made a mistake in calculating the integral for the moment of inertia of a cone suspended from its vertex, a mistake that led to an incorrect expression for the centre of oscillation of the cone.
* Although leading mathematicians such as Johann Bernoulli were aware of weaknesses in Carré's book, his error was never publicly identified and indeed was carried over into the textbooks Treatise on Fluxions, or an Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy (1704) by Charles Hayes (1678-1760), and The Method of Fluxions, both Direct and Inverse (1730) by Edmund Stone.
* Between 1701 and 1705, Carré published over a dozen papers on a variety of mathematical and physical subjects:  Méthode pour la rectification des lignes courbes par les tangentes Ⓣ(Method of measuring the lengths of curved lines using tangents) (1701); Solution du problème proposé aux Géomètres dans les mémoires de Trévoux, des mois de Septembre et d'Octobre Ⓣ(Solution of the problem proposed to geometers in the memories of Trevoux in the months of September and October) (1701); Réflexions ajoutées par M Carré à la Table des Equations Ⓣ(Notes added by M Carré to the  Table of Equations) (1701); Observation sur la cause de la réfraction de la lumière Ⓣ(A comment on the cause of refraction of light) (1702); Pourquoi les marées vont toujours en augmentant depuis Brest jusqu'à Saint-Malo, et en diminuant le long des côtes de Normandie Ⓣ(Why tides are always rising from Brest to Saint-Malo, and decreasing along the coast of Normandy) (1702); Nombre et noms des instruments de musique Ⓣ(The number and names of musical instruments) (1702); Observations sur la vinaigre qui fait rouler de petites pierres sur un plan incline Ⓣ(Observations on the forcce that makes small stones roll on an inclined plane) (1703); Observation sur la rectification des caustiques par réflexions formées par le cercle, la cycloïde ordinaire, et la parabole, et de leurs développées, avec la mesure des espaces qu'elle renferment Ⓣ(An observation on rectification by caustic reflections formed by the circle, the ordinary cycloid, and the parabola, and their developed, with the measure spaces that they contain) (1703); Méthode pour la rectification des courbes Ⓣ(A method for the rectification of curves) (1704); Observation sur ce qui produit le son Ⓣ(Observation of what produces sound) (1704); Examen d'une courbe formée par le moyen du cercle Ⓣ(Review of a curve formed by means of the circle) (1705); Expériences physiques sur la réfraction des balles de mousquet dans l'eau, et sur la résistance de ce fluide Ⓣ(Physical experiments on the refraction of musket balls in the water and on the resistance of the fluid) (1705); and Problème d'hydrodynamique sur la proportion des tuyaux pour avoir une quantité d'eau déterminée  Ⓣ(Hydrodynamic problem on the proportion of  pipes for a given amount of water).

Born 26 July 1663, Colfontaine, near Nangis, Brie, France. Died 11 April 1711, Paris, France.
