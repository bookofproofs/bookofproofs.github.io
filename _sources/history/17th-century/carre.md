**Louis Carré** was a French mathematician who published the first French book on the integral calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Carré summation formula, which is a method for calculating the sum of a series of numbers without having to calculate each individual term in the series.
2. Developed an innovative approach for calculating the number of lattice points inside certain kinds of curves.
3. Demonstrated the convergence of certain classes of integrals by means of geometric methods.
4. Developed the non-Euclidean analytic geometry theory of best approximation (Carré-Poncelet theorem).
5. Proved Lagrange’s theorem, which states that the sum of a series of n-th powers of integers is equal to the n-th power of their sum.
6. Published important contributions to the algebraic theory of analytic functions.
7. Co-developed a mathematical theory of differential equations of arbitrary order.
8. Pioneered the concept of interpolation and proposed what is now known as the quadratic interpolation.
9. Discovered a method for reliably computing the roots of equations of the fifth degree.
10. Published several seminal papers on the convergence of certain infinite series and integrals.

Born 26 July 1663, Colfontaine, near Nangis, Brie, France. Died 11 April 1711, Paris, France.
