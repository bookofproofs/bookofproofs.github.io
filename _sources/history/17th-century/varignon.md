**Pierre Varignon** was a French mathematician who worked on graphical statics and mechanics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed the concept of moments and applied it to the mathematics of statics and mechanics.
2. He produced a highly original and influential work in phrénology.
3. He wrote influential essays on mechanics and formulated a general law of impact, which is now known as the Varignon laws of impact.
4. He studied closely the works of Galileo, Huygens, and Descartes and developed the idea of angular momentum.
5. He proposed an algebraic approach to the calculus of variations, which is now known as the Varignon equations.
6. He developed several theories of probability and Random Variables.
7. He was one of the first mathematicians to study kinematics and the trajectory of projectiles.
8. He wrote hundreds of letters on mathematics and mechanics to correspondents such as Euler, Lagrange, and Clairaut.
9. He created the first book on Descartes’s analytic geometry and developed the foundations of analytic geometry.
10. He made important contributions to the field of hydrodynamics.

Born 1654, Caen, France. Died 23 December 1722, Paris, France.
