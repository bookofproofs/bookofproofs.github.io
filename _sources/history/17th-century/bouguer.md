**Pierre Bouguer** was a French surveyor who took part in an expedition to South America to calculate the size of a degree of latitude.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Designed a method for constructing a hyperbola through three given points.
2. Established a method of triangulation to measure distances.
3. Evaluated the total curvature of the earth.
4. Analyzed the beam balance to determine gravity variations.
5. Proved that changes in atmospheric pressure affect the pendulum's period.
6. Used trigonometric functions to calculate the ring tilt's optical phenomena.
7. Developed an accurate Breguet clock to measure the Meridian Arc distance.
8. Applied the calculus of variations to maximize the sensitivity of the spring balance. 
9. Introduced principles of refraction to explain the pale color of distant stars.
10. Calculated the effect of the Sun's gravity on the movement of the Moon.

Born 16 February 1698, Le Croisic, France. Died 15 August 1758, Paris, France.
