**Takebe** was a Japanese mathematician who wrote most of Seki's _Encyclopaedia_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Authored a book titled 'Mathematical Engineering' (1708) which detailed the fundamentals of mathematics in engineering applications.
2. Established a series of equations and solutions for the study of string tension to determine the properties of a bridge.
3. Proposed an analytical approach for solving second-order linear equations.
4. Developed methods for approximating solutions for cube and higher-order equations.
5. Established methodology for the calculation of mathematical graduations of a compass.

Born 1664, Edo (now Tokyo), Japan. Died 24 August 1739, Edo (now Tokyo), Japan.
