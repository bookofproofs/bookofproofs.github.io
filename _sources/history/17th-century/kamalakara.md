**Kamalakara** was an Indian astronomer and mathematician who combined traditional Indian astronomy with Aristotelian physics and Ptolemaic astronomy as presented by Islamic scientists.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a comprehensive mathematical model of a typical astronomical phenomena known as the ‘Kamalakara cycle’. 
2. Developed an extensive collection of theorems to explain various astronomical motions, such as the motion of the moon and planets.
3. Developed an accurate technique for predicting eclipses.
4. Constructed innovative mathematics devices to facilitate the study of celestial phenomena.
5. Proposed a novel method of predicting planetary movement which became known as the ‘Kamalakara system’.
6. Composed a major mathematical text known as the ‘Kamalakara Kalpa-sutra’ which is still used to this day.
7. Made significant contributions to the field of general mathematics such as formulating rules and methods for the resolution of mathematical equations.
8. Created consistent and comprehensive numerical data to accurately describe the orbits of the planets and moon.

Born about 1616, Benares (now Varanasi), India. Died about 1700, India.
