**Kamalakara** was an Indian astronomer and mathematician who combined traditional Indian astronomy with Aristotelian physics and Ptolemaic astronomy as presented by Islamic scientists.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Kamalakara's father was Nrsimha who was born in 1586.
* Two of Kamalakara's three brothers were also famous astronomer/mathematicians, these being Divakara, who was the eldest of the brothers born in 1606, and Ranganatha who was younger than Kamalakara.
* In particular Kamalakara was taught by his elder brother Divakara while Divakara himself had been taught by their uncle Siva.
* Kamalakara's most famous work, the Siddhanta-tattva-viveka, was commented on by Kamalakara himself.
* In that chapter Kamalakara used the addition and subtraction theorems for the sine and the cosine to give trigonometric formulae for the sines and cosines of double, triple, quadruple and quintuple angles.
* The Siddhanta-tattva-viveka is a Sanskrit text and in it Kamalakara makes frequent use of the place-value number system with Sanskrit numerals.

Born about 1616, Benares (now Varanasi), India. Died about 1700, India.
