**William Molyneux** was an Irish scientist and philosopher who worked on optics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. In 1675 William Molyneux wrote the book Euclidean Demonstration, which was the first English-language treatment of Euclidean geometry.
2. In 1670 William Molyneux published the first equation in Ireland involving x and y, which are now a standard part of algebra.
3. In mathematics, William Molyneux was an important pioneer in the use of experiments to support hypotheses, describing in his treatise Dioptrica Nova the first example of a far-sighted person being able to distinguish between the two star images formed by a double star in a telescope.
4. Molyneux was the first to experimentally observe and describe the mathematical relation between the angle of incidence and angle of reflection now known as the law of reflection.
5. He was a founding member of the Dublin Philosophical Society, which later became the Royal Dublin Society.

Born 17 April 1656, Dublin, Ireland. Died 11 October 1698, Dublin, Ireland.
