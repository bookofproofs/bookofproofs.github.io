**Ferdinand Verbiest** was a Flemish missionary to China in the 17th century. He produced the first Manchu edition of the first six books of Euclid, a remarkable world map, and a steam automobile. He is also famed as an astronomer, designing astronomical instruments and producing calendars.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Verbiest published various texts on mathematics, including “An Expanded Version of Ten Mathematical Classics,” which was written in Chinese.
2. He was the first known European to make use of Chinese mathematical methods, such as using formulas and expressing equations in terms of powers of ten.
3. He worked as an engineer for over 15 years and built several astronomical instruments such as an armillary sphere and a celestial globe, as well as a mechanical water clock.
4. Verbiest created an atlas of astronomical charts to accurately chart the stars and constellations, known as the "Auxiliary Root-Vegetable System", which was highly regarded in Europe.
5. He solved an equation of the 23rd degree with the use of Chinese mathematics, which almost no European mathematician could solve at that time.
6. Verbiest used trigonometric functions and the logarithm to accurately calculate the values of numerous astronomical constants.
7. He made great advances in the area of celestial mechanics, accurately predicting the behavior of the planets. 
8. Verbiest invented a calculating device that allowed logarithmic and trigonometric calculations and was the first known to have discussed the division of the circle into 360 degrees. 
9. Verbiest was the first to introduce an Arabic system of numerals to China, which was widely adopted by the Chinese. 
10. He was awarded a prestigious prize in mathematics from the Chinese Empire for his work on mathematics and astronomy.

Born 9 October 1623, Pittem, Flanders, Spanish Netherlands (now Belgium). Died 28 January 1688, Beijing, China.
