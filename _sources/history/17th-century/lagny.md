**Thomas De Lagny** was a French mathematician who is well known for his contributions to computational mathematics, calculating `$\pi$` to 120 places.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a geometric theory for the solution of cubic equations through his analysis of the medieval works of Al-Khwarizmi.
2. Developed a method for the integration of polynomial equations with rational coefficients.
3. Demonstrated an understanding of permutations and their application to equations of the third and fourth degrees.
4. Discovered the modulus sign and its utility in depicting the absolute value of a mathematical equation.
5. Showed deep understanding of motion problems and advanced ideas related to accelerated motion.
6. Devised methods for solving trigonometric equations and updated ideas concerning the rotation of the earth.
7. Published the first comprehensive treatise on higher analysis, called "De Analyse Supérieure".
8. Defined and studied what would become known as "Lagrange coefficients" and their application to fundamental number theory.
9. Established the algorithmic technique for solving quadratic equations.
10. Presented the concept of mathematical induction and employed this to analyze problems concerning permutations and probability.

Born 7 November 1660, Lyon, France. Died 11 April 1734, Paris, France.
