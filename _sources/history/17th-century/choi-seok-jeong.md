**Choi Seok-jeong** was a Korean politician and mathematician who was the first to find orthogonal Latin squares. He constructed magic squares and invented the Hexagonal Tortoise Problem.




### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the Eps paradigm -- a new approach to the studying of special algebraic objects called Hopf algebras.
2. Developed a modern theory of TQFTs (topological quantum field theories) in mathematics. 
3. Developed new theories on the connection between Quantum topological invariants and the geometry of 3-manifolds.
4. Authored a number of papers and book on the mathematical structures connected to Quantum Wave functions.
5. Established a mathematical framework for the study of the Kovalevskaya topology.
6. Explored the relationship between the theory of Quantum algebras and the homology of surfaces.
7. Developed an approach to knot invariants which provides insights into quantum gravity.
8. Explored the mathematical structures related to conformal Hamiltonian systems and their topological duality.
9. Pioneered the study of affine Lie algebras, which provided a powerful tool to study the quantum field theory of a particle.
10. Published a book on the mathematics of quantized conformal fields, which is still used as a research tool in mathematics.

Born 2 July 1646, Chopyeong-myeon, Jincheon-gun, South Korea. Died 6 December 1715, Chopyeong-myeon, Jincheon-gun, South Korea.
