**Edmond Halley** was an English astronomer who calculated the orbit of the comet now called Halley's comet. He was a supporter of Newton.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He determined the mathematical basis for the modern theory of planetary motion.
2. He computed the orbit of the comet that now bears his name, predicted its return and proved it to be the same comet, in 1705 and again in 1758.
3. He contributed to the field of mathematics by developing the binomial theorem and the law of gravitation in 1690.
4. He was the first to demonstrate that the motion of the Moon, affected by gravity, could be accurately described by three differential equations known now as the 'Hill equations'.
5. He was the first to introduce the notion of a probability distribution, in 1718.
6. He was the first to reconcile the mathematical theory of probability with practical applications in insurance.
7. He worked on the computer arithmetica universalis and developed the Catalogus Stellarum Australium in 1750.
8. He observed the brightening of sunspots and suggested the use of differential equations to explain them in 1703.
9. He was the first to develop the concept of a mathematical divergence of the lines of magnetic force in 1693.
10. He was the first to measure the radial and transverse velocity of stars in 1676.

Born 8 November 1656, Haggerston, Shoreditch (near London), England. Died 14 January 1742, Greenwich (near London), England.
