**James Gregory** was a Scottish scientist and first Regius Professor of Mathematics at St Andrews who described the first practical reflecting telescope. He worked on using infinite convergent series to find the areas of the circle and hyperbola.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first practical & detailed description of the concept of integration in 1668.
2. Invented the cycloid pendulum, a highly precise time measurement system in 1675.
3. Wrote the book, 'Geometriae Pars Universalis', which applied algebra to geometry in 1668.
4. Developed the first efficient methods for computing infinite series used in calculus in 1671.
5. Envisioned the fundamental theorem of calculus before either Isaac Newton or Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1675.
6. Devised one of the earliest forms of the theorem of the mean in 1668.
7. Was the first to use periodic distinctions of Integration in 1673.

Born November 1638, Drumoak (near Aberdeen), Scotland. Died October 1675, Edinburgh, Scotland.
