**Jean Picard** was a French astronomer who increased the accuracy of astronomical observations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the so-called "precessional motion" of the Earth.
2. Developed a method of converting a spherical geodetic triangle into a plane triangle.
3. Determined the shape of the earth to be an ellipsoid.
4. Accurately measured the length of a degree of arc on the Earth's surface.
5. Pioneered the first modern trigonometric tables.
6. Calculated the circumference of the Earth with remarkable accuracy.
7. Accurately calculated the width of the French meridian between the North Sea and the Mediterranean.
8. Proposed the Picard Theorem, which states that the surface area of an ellipsoid is determined by its two axes.

Born 21 July 1620, La Fl√®che, France. Died 12 October 1682, Paris, France.
