**Evangelista Torricelli** was an Italian scientist who was the first man to create a sustained vacuum and to discover the principle of a barometer. He also achieved some important results in the development of the calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first person to demonstrate that air has weight by measuring the pressure of a column of mercury in a tube.
2. He developed theories concerning the relationships between pressure and volume of fluids, later known as Torricelli's Law or Torricelli's Principle.
3. He formulated a theory of infinite series, now known as Torricelli's law of convergence.
4. He developed a method to calculate the volume of a cylinder and the surface area of a sphere, commonly referred to as the “Torricelli” method.
5. He discovered the existence of water pressure, called Torricelli’s Principle.
6. He made important contributions to analytic geometry and projective geometry.
7. He invented the barometer in 1644, which measures atmospheric pressure.
8. He proposed and proved a theorem about the center of gravity of plane figures that is now known as Torricelli’s Theorem.

Born 15 October 1608, Faenza, Romagna (now Italy). Died 25 October 1647, Florence, Tuscany (now Italy).
