**Louis Castel** was a French mathematician who was a strong opponent of Newton's philosophy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first algebraic equation that could be solved in an automated manner.
2. Pioneered the use of linear algebra in solving mathematical problems.
3. Outlined the basis for linear programming and game theory.
4. Devised the modern concept of a limit in calculus.
5. Revolutionized trigonometry by introducing the notion of a trigonometric equation.
6. Developed the “trapezoid rule” for approximate numerical integration.
7. Introduced complex analysis to the field of mathematics.
8. Pioneered the process of proving theorems with synthetic methods. 
9. Established the general triangular inequality theorem of four variables.
10. Formulated the “weak law of large numbers” in probability theory.

Born 15 November 1688, Montpellier, France. Died 11 January 1757, Paris, France.
