**Gilles Roberval** was a French scientist who developed powerful methods in the early study of integration.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Was one of the first mathematicians to use the method of indivisibles to calculate areas and volumes.
2. Developed the theory of "solid geometry" as an alternative to Euclidean geometry.
3. Published a treatise on the subject of `infinitesimal calculus` in 1691.
4. Established the link between geometry and algebra, and solve algebraic equations.
5. Wrote a Latin treatise on the solution of equations of degree with double and triple roots.
6. Developed the solution for three-dimensional problems, which involved a series of exponential equations. 
7. Proved the existence of an infinity of infinitely small quantities.
8. He was one of the early proponents of the method of `statical analysis` for solving problems.
9. Introduced the concept of a geometrical locus.
10. Published the important works `New Analytical Geometry` and `On the Problem of the Three Interpretations of Projective Geometry`.

Born 9 August 1602, NoÃ«l-Saint-Martin, Villeneuve-sur-Verberie, Oise, France. Died 27 October 1675, Paris, France.
