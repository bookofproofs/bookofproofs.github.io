**Ehrenfried Tschirnhaus** was a German mathematician who worked on the solution of equations and the study of curves. He is best known for the transformation which removes the term of degree _n_-1 from an equation of degree _n_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a process to calculate curvature of lenses which could be used in telescopes and microscopes.
2. Founded the calculus of differences which would later become a base element of integral calculus. 
3. Improved Rene Descartes' system of notation, which allowed mathematical expressions to be more concise and easier to comprehend.
4. Proved several general theorems in calculus that are still used today.
5. Proposed the concept of optimization in calculus, which allowed for a better understanding of the way mathematics can be used to solve specific problems.
6. Developed a sophisticated method for solving polynomial equations using solids. 
7. Discovered the oblique asymptote, which describes the behavior of curves in terms of the x-axis. 
8. Researched and proved the existence of the so-called Tschirnhaus transformation, a geometric transformation that is commonly used in the calculation of spherical lenses. 
9. Contributed to the development of the quadratic equation, which today remains one of the most important tools in mathematics.  
10. Developed a method for solving so-called quartic equations, of which mathematics had no prior knowledge.

Born 10 April 1651, Kieslingswalde (near Görlitz), Germany (now Sławnikowice, Poland). Died 11 October 1708, Dresden, Germany.
