2. Developed a new way to calculate integrals of an infinite number of terms.
3. Established the foundations of modern algebraic analysis.
4. Discovered the convergence criteria of Fourier series. 
5. Formulated the notion of divisible coefficients with reference to algebraic equations. 
6. Discovered the algebraic structure of quadratic surds.
