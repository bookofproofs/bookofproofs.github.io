**Vincenzo Viviani** was an Italian engineer who worked on the geometry of the cycloid.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algebraic formula for the surface area of a cone. 
2. Offered the earliest proof of the area of a cyclic quadrilateral. 
3. Published a treatise on the path of comets. 
4. Idealized the theory of centrifugal force. 
5. Expanded the theory of gravity with a law of inertia. 
6. Discovered the principle of the transversality of chords. 
7. Demonstrated the fundamental theorem of calculus. 
8. Devised a method of extrapolating exponential functions. 
9. Wrote a definitive book on the early development of calculus. 
10. Developed the concept of velocity being equivalent to a line's slope.

Born 5 April 1622, Florence (now Italy). Died 22 September 1703, Florence (now Italy).
