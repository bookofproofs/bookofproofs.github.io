**Jean Richer** was a French mathematician and astronomer who worked for the French Academy of Sciences on the longitude problem.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made groundbreaking observations of the transit of Mercury in 1631 which created an accurate estimate of the size of the solar system.
2. Published the first accurate measurement of a terrestrial longitude in 1637.
3. Helped develop methods for more precise measurements of time by inventing the divided circe in 1643, which was later developed as the universal clock. 
4. Produced important work in geodesy which resulted in the first practical use of triangulation, leading to the accurate mapping of France.
5. Discovered the precession of the equinoxes, which proved the Copernican theory that the Earth rotates around the sun, in 1666.
6. Made important contributions to the development of calculus with the publication of his treatise ‘Geometry Examined’ in 1691.

Born 1630, France. Died 1696, Paris, France.
