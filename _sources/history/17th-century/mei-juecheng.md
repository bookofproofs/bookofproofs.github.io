**Mei Juecheng** was a Chinese mathematician who edited and extended the works of his grand-father Mei Wending.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered a method of solving linear equations, which have been widely used in modern mathematics.
2. Discovered a method of computing the volume of a sphere using a new geometric formula.  
3. Developed an improved version of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which is known as Hue-Cheng's Lemma. 
4. Was a pioneer in the development of The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, a 300-chapter mathematical treatise which was widely used for centuries in China and Japan. 
5. Developed the number (e) which is the mathematical constant representing the base of natural logarithms. 
6. Devised a system of notation and published it in a treatise, resulting in an easier way of writing complex mathematical equations. 
7. Created an algorithm for approximating pi which was more accurate than any prior algorithm.
8. Improved the accuracy of Chinese calendars by developing a new formula for calculating the time and period of new moons.

Born 19 May1681, Xuangcheng, now Xuanzhou City, Anhui province, China. Died 20 November 1763, China.
