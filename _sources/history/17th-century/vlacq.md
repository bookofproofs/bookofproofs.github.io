**Adriaan Vlacq** was a Dutch bookseller and publisher who devised and published tables of logarithms.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Vlacq worked with de Decker and translated Latin books written by Napier and Briggs into Dutch for him.
* In 1626 Het eerste deel van de Nieuwe telkonst Ⓣ(The first part of the new thesis)  was published under de Decker's name with acknowledgement to Vlacq for considerable help.
* This contained Briggs's logarithms from 1 to 10,000 but promised to publish, with Vlacq's assistance, a further work giving the logarithms from 1 to 100,000.
* The full table of logarithms of 1 to 100,000 appeared in 1627 as Het tweede deel van de Nieuwe telkonst Ⓣ(The second part of the new thesis) under de Decker's name with again acknowledgement to Vlacq.
* In 1628 Vlacq republished the 10 decimal place logarithm tables as Arithmetica logarithma sive logarithmorum chiliades tentum, pro numeris naturali serie crescentibus ab unitate ad 100000 ...
* He appears to have had a connection with the Gouda firm of Petrus Rammaseyn and it is this firm that published the work, this time under Vlacq's name.
* A French translation, Arithmetique logarithmetique, ou, La construction et usage d'une table contenant les logarithms de tous les nombres depuis l'unité jusque 100000 Ⓣ(Logarithmic arithmetic  or the construction and use of a table containing the logarithms of all numbers from 1 to 100000)  by Vlacq was also published Petrus Rammaseyn at almost the same time.
* Vlacq's fame rests on these tables, which were well received and contain relatively few errors.
* Vlacq became a bookseller and publisher who, in 1632, settled in London and opened a bookshop.
* Vlacq decided that London was not a good place to sell books with the approaching unrest so he left for Paris in 1642.
* In Paris Vlacq again set up a book business.
* Vlacq also constructed logarithm trigonometric tables which he published as Trigonometria artificialis Ⓣ(Trigonometrical logarithms)  in 1633 during his time in London.
* Vlacq also published many mathematical works by other authors including, perhaps surprisingly, Briggs himself and also by Gellibrand.

Born 1600, Gouda, Netherlands. Died 1667, The Hague, Netherlands.
