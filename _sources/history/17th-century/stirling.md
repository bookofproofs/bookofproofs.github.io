**James Stirling** was a Scottish mathematician whose most important work _Methodus Differentialis _ in 1730 is a treatise on infinite series, summation, interpolation and quadrature.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. One of the founders of modern Matrix Theory: Stirling was one of the first to recognize that the traditional notation for calculating determinants was simpler, and led to a transformational approach to the subject.
2. Developed his own set of rules and calculation methods for determinants: Stirling developed his own set of rules for working out determinants and argued for their correctness by proving several theorems.
3. Developed and advocated new methods of integration: Stirling argued for better methods of integration and developed several himself, such as the midpoint rule, Simpson's rule, and Euler's formula.
4. Classified problems related to probability: Stirling developed a classification of problems related to probability, which is still used by mathematicians today.
5. Discovered an efficient algorithm for solving linear equations: Stirling was the first to discover an efficient algorithm for solving linear equations by decomposing the matrices.
6. Revolutionized the field of algebraic geometry: Stirling developed a theory of algebraic curves, which revolutionized the field of algebraic geometry and allowed for new kinds of curves to be plotted.

Born May 1692, Garden (near Stirling), Scotland. Died 5 December 1770, Edinburgh, Scotland.
