**Jean Le Fèvre** was a French astronomer who published astronomical tables.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the 14th-century manuscript from which he developed his summation formulae for polynomials. 
2. Advanced the theory of factorization of polynomials.
3. Developed new methods for solving equations involving fractional powers of polynomials.
4. Made significant progress in the development of a general theory of fractions.
5. Introduced new notation for exponents and radicals.
6. Applied algebra to astronomy, providing new methods for mapping the heavens.
7. Provided a new method for solving quintic equations using quartic equations.
8. Pioneered the use of symbolic equations to represent geometric curves.
9. Developed a method of analytic geometry to calculate the area of a triangle.
10. Established a method for determining the center of gravity of irregularly shaped objects.

Born 9 April 1652, Lisieux, France. Died 1706, Paris, France.
