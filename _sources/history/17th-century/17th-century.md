## Description 
_(no contents provided yet)_

## Chronology
### 1637

* [Descartes][bookofproofs$Descartes] publishes "La Géometrie".
   * Continuing the work of [François Viète][bookofproofs$Viete], Descartes solves geometrical problems using algebraic means. 
   * In this epochal work, he also abolishes the dogma that lasted in mathematics for millennia, prohibiting mathematicians from calculating with lengths and volumes at once
     (which, they thought, was impossible because of the danger to mix up incompatible geometrical concepts).
