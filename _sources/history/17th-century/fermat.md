**Pierre de Fermat** was a French lawyer and government official most remembered for his work in number theory; in particular for Fermat's Last Theorem. He is also important in the foundations of the calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proved fundamental theorem of calculus which states that the area under an indefinite integral is equal to the value of that integral.
2. Used mathematical induction to prove a version of the Binomial Theorem, which states that the powers of a binomial can be expressed as sums of powers of the individual terms.
3. Developed a method of solving Diophantine equations, which are equations involving arbitrary powers, exponential terms, and constrains of the form “x must divide y”.
4. Proved Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if n is a prime number, then a^n-a is divisible by n, for any integer a.
5. Developed a technique outside of Euclidean geometry to consider problems of tangents.
6. Established the basic premise for analytical geometry, which exploits the relationships between algebra and geometry.
7. Proved Fermat's theorem, which states that any number raised to a higher power than the second can not be a sum of two lower powered numbers.
8. Developed a technique for factorization which factored large numbers into multiple smaller numbers.

Born 17 August 1601, Beaumont-de-Lomagne, France. Died 12 January 1665, Castres, France.
