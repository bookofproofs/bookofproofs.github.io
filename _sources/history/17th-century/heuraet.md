**Hendrik van Heuraet** was a Dutch mathematician who made some contributions to integration.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the study of analytic number theory, in particular the subject of algebraic number theory.
2. Developed the Van Heuraet zeta-function and the Van Heuraet approximation formula.
3. Published a series of six influential papers on quadratic forms in which he named and developed the “discriminant”.
4. Provided key contributions to the theory of elliptic curves and modular forms.
5. Researched diophantine approximations and published a biography of the mathematician Leonhard Euler.
6. Developed the Van Heuraet transform, used to estimate best-fit parameters in statistical models.

Born 8 September 1634, Haarlem, Netherlands. Died about 1660, (probably) Leiden, Netherlands.
