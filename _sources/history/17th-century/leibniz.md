**Gottfried Leibniz** was a German mathematician who developed the present day notation for the differential and integral calculus though he never thought of the derivative as a limit. His philosophy is also important and he invented an early calculating machine.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the notation for differentials, integral calculus, and the law of continuity. 
2. Came up with a system of the binary number which is used in the modern computer. 
3. Founded the field of symbolic logic with the introduction of his "calculus ratiocinator."
4. Proved the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
5. Formulated the theories of monads, pre-established harmony and vis viva.
6. Implemented Heaviside's operational calculus which is useful in solving differential equations. 
7. Developed the modern notation for the calculus of functions of several variables. 
8. Introduced the mathematical concepts of function, variation, and dynamics. 
9. Developed the theories of determinants and the law of inertia. 
10. Proposed the concept of the transcendental curve.

Born 1 July 1646, Leipzig, Saxony (now Germany). Died 14 November 1716, Hannover, Hanover (now Germany).
