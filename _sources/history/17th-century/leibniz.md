**Von Leibniz** was a German mathematician who developed the present day notation for the differential and integral calculus though he never thought of the derivative as a limit. His philosophy is also important and he invented an early calculating machine.

Born 1 July 1646 Leipzig, Saxony (now Germany). Died 14 November 1716 Hannover, Hanover (now Germany).
