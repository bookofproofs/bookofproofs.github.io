**John Pell** was an English mathematician best known for _Pell's equation_ which in fact he had little to do with.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed Pell's equation, which is a type of mathematical statement that can be used to solve a wide range of mathematical problems.
2. He was the first to prove Fermat's last theorem for the j=4 case.
3. He developed a way to calculate the sum of the power series of a polynomial.
4. He provided a numerical solution to the cycloid that was used by Galileo Galilei.
5. He solved the problems of finding the area and volume of a sphere.
6. He solved a centuries-old problem related to the division of an ellipse.
7. He developed a method to find the rational roots of an equation.
8. He developed a numerical method to solve a cubic equation.

Born 1 March 1611, Southwick, Sussex, England. Died 12 December 1685, Westminster, London, England.
