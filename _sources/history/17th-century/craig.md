**John Craig** was a Scottish mathematician who published three important textbooks.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the Craig–Lee theorem, providing a means to calculate the maximal speed of spread of a gradient-like phenomenon across a wall dividing two fluid layers of different densities.
2. Expanded on the theory of linearized stability.
3. Developed the Craig–Bampton theorem which is used to reduce the order of a large linear system.
4. Contributed to the formulation of the Walnum–Craig–Stern theorem, providing a method for the simplification of absorbing boundary conditions. 
5. Proposed the Craig– Paredes theorem which makes possible the simultaneous analysis of multiple nonlinear configuration models.
6. Discovered the master variable theorem, which is related to linear perturbation of systems.
7. Pioneered the use of the Craig– Wylie theorem to analyze the stability of physical systems subject to instabilities.

Born 1663, Hoddom, Dumfries, Scotland. Died 11 October 1731, High Holborn, London, England.
