description: Guarino Guarini was an Italian mathematician who worked on geometry, philosophy and formulated the unity of composition concept to relate architecture to algebra and optics. He used geometrical proportions and a polyhedron system to create beautiful architectural harmony.

**Guarino Guarini** was an Italian mathematician who worked in geometry and philosophy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Proiettivo Method which relates architecture to geometry, algebra and optics. 
2. Was among the first to use an ingenious system of mathematical ratios to regulate the composition of a façade in order to create harmony in the design. 
3. Their ideas on symmetry in architecture were discussed in his best-known work, The Principles of the Most Excellent Art of Architecture (1687). 
4. Proposed novel methods and ideas for dealing with problems in geometry and architecture. 
5. Used the figure of the polyhedron in order to come up with a logical and rigorous architecture. 
6. Published a treatise titled the 'Theoria Purae Geometriae'. 
7. Coined the phrase “unity of composition” to represent his approach to mathematics and architecture together. 
8. Developed a three-dimensional geometric system, combining optic, perspective and projective studies and a union between algebra, geometry and optics.
9. Devised a system to render buildings and monuments with exact proportions, using ornamental patterns of the geometry of the cube and octahedron. 
10. Pioneered the use of optical illusions in squaring circles and creating the illusion of solidity amongst arches and columns.

Born 1624, Modena (now Italy). Died 1683, Milan (now Italy).
