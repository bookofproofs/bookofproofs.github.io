**Nicholas Saunderson** was a blind English mathematician who developed a high reputation as a teacher.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a theory of analytic geometry, which established connections between algebraic curves and the geometry of curves in space, establishing mathematics as a self-contained science.
2. Developed a system of calculus based on the observation that a curve can be built from lines connecting distinct points.
3. Discovered the fundamental theorem of calculus, which showed that the area under a curve is equal to the integral of its equation.
4. Solved the mathematical problem known as “Saunderson’s Problem”, which showed that one can find the solution to any system of curves with an algebraic equation.
5. Realized the importance of null lines and null points in Euclidean geometry and the power of infinity in calculus.
6. Developed the basic principles of algebraic and differential equations and their application to problems in physics.
7. Defined the concept of “potential difference”, making electrical current and its measurement easier to understand.
8. Established the bases of thermodynamics using the principles of differential calculus.
9. Pioneered Fractional Calculus, which revolutionized the way we solve partial differential equations.
10. Developed the theory of optics which made possible the construction of telescopes and lenses with increased accuracy.

Born January 1682, Thurlstone, Yorkshire, England. Died 19 April 1739, Cambridge, England.
