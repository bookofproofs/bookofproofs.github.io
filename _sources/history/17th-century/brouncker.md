**William Brouncker** was an Irish mathematician who was a founder and the first president of the Royal Society of London. He worked on continued fractions and calculated logarithms by infinite series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* William Brouncker's mother was Winifred Leigh who came from Newenhan in Warwickshire.
* In a time in England when King and Parliament would fight the Civil War, the Brouncker family were staunch Royalist supporters.
* We know little of Brouncker's early life.
* About the first we know for certain of Brouncker is that he entered Oxford University when he was sixteen years old and there he studied mathematics, languages and medicine.
* This was a difficult time for Brouncker for the political situation in England was in turmoil.
* Brouncker and his father were Royalists and were very definitely on the losing side.
* On 12 September 1645 Brouncker's father became Viscount Brouncker of Castle Lyons.
* The First Viscount Brouncker of Castle Lyons did not live long to enjoy the peerage he bought for he died two months later.
* At this time William Brouncker, his mathematician son, succeeded him to the title becoming the Second Viscount Brouncker of Castle Lyons.
* It was a time for Royalists to keep their heads down if they wanted to survive and that is exactly what Brouncker did.
* These studies were mathematics and music, two topics which Brouncker loved.
* In 1653 Brouncker published his English translation of Descartes' work but he added notes of his own which doubled the size of the work.
* Mersenne had proposed a scale of 12 equal semitones after Descartes' manuscript had been written and in his notes Brouncker proposed a variation of Mersenne's ideas but he divided the scale into 17 equal semitones.
* One should not be surprised that all these mathematicians were contributing to musical theory and indeed Brouncker's notes are highly mathematical using algebra and logarithms.
* One might wonder why Brouncker chose 17 equal semitones and again the reason was a mathematical one for he derived this from taking ratios based on the golden section.
* The years of the Protectorate were the most productive years for Brouncker in terms of mathematics.
* Brouncker was one of those who signed a Declaration acknowledging Monck's rights.
* Brouncker stood in the new parliamentary elections and was elected as Member for Westbury in 1660.
* On Wednesday 28 November 1660 Brouncker was one of a dozen scientists at a meeting in Gresham College which constituted their Society for the Promoting of Physico-Mathematical Experimental Learning which they declared would promote experimental philosophy.
* Brouncker's father had been vice-chamberlain to Charles when he was Prince of Wales and so Brouncker was well known to the new King who soon repaid him for his loyal support.
* In 1662 the King appointed Brouncker as Chancellor to Queen Anne and Keeper of the Great Seal.
* Brouncker worked hard for the Society ensuring that it was active.
* The Royal Charter which was passed by the Great Seal on 15 July 1662 created the Royal Society of London and the Royal Charter nominated Brouncker as its first President.
* Given the quality of the founder members of the Society, it might be considered slightly strange that Brouncker, certainly not the most eminent academically, was made President.
* Well certainly Brouncker was on the best terms with the King and this must have been a major factor, but there were other reasons.
* Brouncker was a man of independent means, and he was also unmarried, so he had time to devote to the Society which most others would not have had.
* Again nobody could have been more enthusiastic in promoting the aims of the Society than Brouncker so he was a good choice.
* Brouncker now took on a number of roles.
* One of Brouncker's interests was in ships and he built, to his own design, a yacht for King Charles II.
* In 1668 Brouncker was appointed as Controller of the Navy Accounts.
* Things began to go less well for Brouncker from around 1675.
* Brouncker seems to have only infrequent attended the Society in 1677 but he still seems to have wanted to continue as President.
* Brouncker was not present at the November meeting which elected Sir Joseph Williamson to succeed him as President.
* Brouncker's mathematical achievements includes work on continued fractions and calculating logarithms by infinite series.
* However after Brouncker correctly computed the first 10 places in the decimal expansion of Ï€ using his continued fraction expansion, Huygens accepted the result.
* Probably also in 1654 Brouncker computed the quadrature of the hyperbola although he did not publish this result until 1668.
* It appeared in a paper published by Brouncker in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of 1668 but he clearly states that this result is the one referred to by Wallis in 1665.
* It is believed that Euler made an error in naming the equation 'Pell's equation', and that he was intending to acknowledge the outstanding contribution made by Brouncker.
* It is interesting to think that if Euler had not made this error then Brouncker, instead of being relatively unknown as a mathematician, would be universally known through 'Brouncker's equation'.
* Brouncker has gained a somewhat unfortunate reputation.
* There are other negative comments regarding his character which are believed to be unfair in that the writer has confused Brouncker with his brother Henry Brouncker.
* It seems a cruel twist that two misidentifications, mistaking him for Pell and also for his brother Henry, has led to Brouncker receiving less than his just deserts.

Born 1620, Castlelyons (N of Cork), Ireland. Died 5 April 1684, Westminster. London, England.
