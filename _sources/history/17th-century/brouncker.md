**William Brouncker** was an Irish mathematician who was a founder and the first president of the Royal Society of London. He worked on continued fractions and calculated logarithms by infinite series.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was the first president of the Royal Society and was responsible for starting the publication of Philosophical Transactions, which became one of the most important scientific journals of the 17th century.
2. He formulated an algorithm to determine the nth root of a number by Newton’s method, now known as Brouncker's algorithm.
3. He is credited with introducing the notations for powers and for the ‘least common multiple’
4. Widely acknowledged for his work on the theory of continued fractions.
5. He pioneered the use of Bernoulli numbers and was the first to use algebraic integration to solve polynomial equations.
6. He was also the first to determine the quadrature of the lune, an important and difficult problem.
7. He introduced a new way of approximating the area of curvilinear figures using series of polygons.

Born 1620, Castlelyons (N of Cork), Ireland. Died 5 April 1684, Westminster. London, England.
