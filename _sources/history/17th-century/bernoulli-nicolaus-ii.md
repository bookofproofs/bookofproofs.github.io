**Nicolaus (II) Bernoulli** was the favourite of three sons of Johann Bernoulli. He made important mathematical contributions to the problem of trajectories while working on the mathematical arguments behind the dispute between Newton and Leibniz.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Contributed to the development of the law of large numbers and the inverse square law of gravitation.
2. Discovered a mathematical proof for the theorem of Thabit ibn Qurra.
3. Developed the Bernoulli numbers.
4. Co-developed the Bernoulli differential equation.
5. Demonstrated the transcendence of e.
6. Proved Lemniscate of Bernoulliâ€™s theorem.
7. Established the law of continuity for bodies in motion.
8. Applied the principle of the conservation of energy in mechanics.
9. Proved the nine-point circle theorem.
10. Developed the theory of parallels, a precursor to non-Euclidean geometry.

Born 6 February 1695, Basel, Switzerland. Died 31 July 1726, St Petersburg, Russia.
