**William Jones** was a Welsh mathematician who corresponded with many of the important English mathematicians of his day.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first systematic exposition of the theory of determinants in his book, Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos (1706).
2. Pioneered the use of the symbol '='.
3. Proposed the use of superscripts to denote powers or exponents.
4. Discovered the law of permutation of variables.
5. Advanced the field of triangular numbers and binomial theorem.
6. Connected the use of differential calculus with infinite series.
7. Established the use of angles to express trigonometric ratios.
8. Derived a formula for the area of a spheroid from the ratio of elliptic integrals.

Born 1675, Llanfihangel Tre'r Beirdd, Anglesey, Wales. Died 1 July 1749, London, England.
