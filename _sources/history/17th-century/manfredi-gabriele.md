**Gabriele Manfredi** was an Italian mathematician who was an early worker on differential equations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Eustachio started up the Accademia degli Inquiti, which at first was an informal gathering of friends and fellow students, meeting at the Manfredi home from 1690 onwards.
* Gabriele, showing a precocious talent and a marked predilection for scientific study, joined in the meetings as he was growing up.
* Gabriele began to study medicine but the anatomy classes he attended frightened him so he decided to change topics and, for a while, studied history, languages, poetry and geography.
* Towards the end of 1702, Manfredi went to Rome to look for a job.
* Manfredi assisted with the construction which was completed in 1703.
* Through contacts with members of this group, Manfredi was put in touch with Pierre Varignon who was working in Paris on applications of the differential and integral calculus.
* Since 1701 Manfredi had been corresponding with Guido Grandi who had been appointed as professor of philosophy in Pisa in May 1700.
* While Manfredi was in Rome, Grandi published his important work on the differential calculus Quadratura circoli et hyperbolae per infinitas hyperbolas et parabolas quadrabiles geometrice exhibita â“‰(Quadrature  of circles, hyperbolas, infinite hyperbolas and parabolic lunes presented geometrically) (1703).
* Manfredi became a chancellor in the Senate of Bologna in 1708, and continued to hold a position in the Senate until his retirement in 1752.
* Between 1727 and 1761, Manfredi had fifteen memoirs read to the Bologna Institute of the Accademia delle scienze.
* The problem had not been solved up to the time of Eustachio's death and so when Manfredi took over as superintendent of the Bolognese Water Authority he was still faced with this same difficulty.

Born 25 March 1681, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy). Died 5 October 1761, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy).
