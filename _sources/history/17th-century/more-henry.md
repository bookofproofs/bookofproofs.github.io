**Henry More** was an English philosopher of science whose ideas may have influenced Newton.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded "physico-theology" - a science that combined scientific and theological discourses to explain the universe.
2. Put forward the idea of atoms shaping the universe, leading to a new wave of atomism among his contemporaries.
3. Proposed that light was composed of a multitude of small particles.
4. Incorporated geometry and natural philosophy into the realm of empirical science.
5. Coined the term 'irritability' in reference to the behavior of plants.
6. Demonstrated that what was known as Cartesian fluid in Newtonâ€™s optical theory was equivalent to a wave.
7. Assisted in Thomas Willis's groundbreaking work on the anatomy of the brain and nervous system, by providing Willis with mathematical arguments.
8. Pioneered the wave theory of light, as well as an early form of Newton's corpuscular theory.

Born October 1614, Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. Died 1 September 1687, Cambridge, England.
