**John Machin** was an English mathematician and astronomer best known for the formulas he invented for calculating `$\pi$`.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a comprehensive method for calculating logarithms of non-integer numbers, now referred to as the Machin-based logarithm.
2. Developed a formula for the calculation of pi with great accuracy, now referred to as the Machin formula.
3. Used the Bernoulli equation to solve a problem regarding centripetal forces.
4. Established the sum of the reciprocus of the squares of the prime numbers as a powerful tool for approximate estimation of pi.
5. Developed an approximation of the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
6. Investigated the properties of gamma and beta functions.
7. Resolved the St. Petersburg paradox.
8. Found a rigorous solution to Kepler's equation.
9. Developed an accurate calculation of the speed of sound in air.
10. Investigated the theory of cercles versants.

Born 1680, England. Died 9 June 1751, London, England.
