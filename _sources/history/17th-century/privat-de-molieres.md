**Privat de Molières** was a French mathematician who argued against Newton in favour of Descartes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a correspondence with renowned mathematician Pierre de Fermat and mathematical physicist Blaise Pascal.
2. Proposed the term ‘pascaline’ to refer to the precursor to the modern-day digital calculator. 
3. Published Traité des Descriptions Curvilignes et des Surfaces, one of the earliest studies of the evolute of a curve, a branch of mathematical geometry. 
4. Developed the concept of potentiality, which helped in the further development of Calculus and variational methods.
5. Discovered the law of pyramids, the basis for integral calculus. 
6. Published the treatise Vegetationes Physicomathemathicae, the very first treatise on geometry which included calculus methods.

Born 1677, Tarascon, Bouches-du-Rhône, France. Died 12 May1742, Paris, France.
