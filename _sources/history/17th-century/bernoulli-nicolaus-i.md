**Nicolaus Bernoulli** was one of the famous Swiss family of mathematicians. He is most important for his correspondence with other mathematicians including Euler and Leibniz.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the law of large numbers and pioneered the fields of probability and statistics.
2. Introduced the Bernoulli numbers, as well as Bernoulli polynomials and Bernoulli's Principle.
3. He and his brother Jakob were the first to systematize the study of calculus.
4. Introduced the principle of conditional probability and the binomial distribution.
5. Made significant contributions to the theories of calculus of variation and electric fluid dynamics.
6. Authored the treatise Ars conjectandi, which contained questions regarding the law of large numbers and developed the first version of the law of probability.
7. He was the first to fully develop and extend the theorem of limits of vanishing increments and of the quadrature of curves with regard to integration.
8. Was an early developer of the calculus of probability.
9. Made contributions to the field of analytic geometry.
10. Was an early developer of the fundamental theorem of calculus.

Born 21 October 1687, Basel, Switzerland. Died 29 November 1759, Basel, Switzerland.
