**Nicolaus Bernoulli** was one of the famous Swiss family of mathematicians. He is most important for his correspondence with other mathematicians including Euler and Leibniz.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* In fact it was Jacob Bernoulli who supervised Nicolaus's Master's degree at the University of Basel which he was awarded in 1704.
* In 1712 Nicolaus Bernoulli toured Europe visiting Holland, England and France.
* Nicolaus Bernoulli was appointed to Galileo's chair at Padua in 1716 which Hermann had filled immediately prior to Nicolaus's appointment.
* From Montmort's work we can see that Nicolaus formulated certain problems in the theory of probability, in particular the problem which today is known as the St Petersburg problem.
* Nicolaus also corresponded with Leibniz during the years 1712 to 1716.
* Nicolaus also corresponded with Euler.
* Nicolaus Bernoulli assisted in the publication of Jacob Bernoulli's Ars conjectandi â“‰(The art of conjecturing).
* Later Nicolaus edited Jacob Bernoulli's complete works and supplemented it with results taken from Jacob's diary.
* As might be expected Nicolaus supported Leibniz but he did produce some good arguments in his favour such as observing that Newton failed to understand higher derivatives properly which had led him into errors in the problem of inverse central force in a resisting medium.
* Nicolaus (I) Bernoulli received many honours for his work.

Born 21 October 1687, Basel, Switzerland. Died 29 November 1759, Basel, Switzerland.
