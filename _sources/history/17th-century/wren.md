**Christopher Wren** was an English architect and mathematician who became Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford. He is best known for the buildings he designed after the Great Fire of London.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a foundation of analytical geometry and trigonometry. 
2. Completed the quadrature of curves, which was a revolutionary breakthrough in mathematics.
3. Created a trigonometric table for a new kind of trigonometry, now known as "Wren's Law."
4. Developed the idea of a kinetic quadratic equation.
5. Conducted pioneering work in areas such as the cycloid, conical sections, catenary curves, and parabolas.
6. Conducted extensive studies into astronomy, geography, and engineering. 
7. Invented mathematical tools to calculate the dimensions of different types of structures, such as churches and bridges.
8. Contributed to the development of calculus. 
9. Discovered the relationship between radius and circumference of a circle, which was later recognized as Pi. 
10. Made important observations in the field of optics, including the observation of parabolic lenses and reflections of shaped mirrors.

Born 20 October 1632, East Knoyle, Wiltshire, England. Died 25 February 1723, London, England.
