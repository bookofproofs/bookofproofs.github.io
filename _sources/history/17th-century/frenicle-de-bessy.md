**Frenicle de Bessy** was a French amateur mathematician who is best known for his contributions to number theory.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Showed that any integer can be expressed as a sum of four squares.
2. Demonstrated the theory of continued fractions.
3. Proved the theorems related to elliptic integrals, which were later extended by Euler.
4. Discovered the rules of divisibility by 4 and 8.
5. Developed a method to solve quadratic equations, known as the Lagrange-Frenicle method.
6. Gave the first proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

Born about 1604, Paris, France. Died 1674, Paris, France.
