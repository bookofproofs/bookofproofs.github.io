**John Collins** was an English accountant and publisher who corresponded extensively with the mathematicians of his day.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Collins seems to have decided to leave England because of the Civil War and he became a seaman.
* From 1660 onwards Collins worked at a number of jobs but most often as an accountant for various different organisations.
* Collins also held a position as an accountant in the Excise Office from 1668 to 1670.
* However times were not easy and Collins only received a small fraction of his proper salary from the Council of Plantations.
* In 1671 Collins had moved to a house in Westminster close to that of William Austin who was the King's chef.
* Collins married Bellona.
* Collins's importance is, as Barrow said, being "the English Mersenne" .
* Collins published books by Barrow and Wallis and left a collection of 2000 books and an uncounted number of manuscripts.
* Collins went to Oxford in 1683 to survey the proposed route of the canal.

Born 5 March 1624, Wood Eaton (4km north of Oxford), England. Died 10 November 1683, London, England.
