**John Collins** was an English accountant and publisher who corresponded extensively with the mathematicians of his day.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a practical computational method for solving special classes of linear equations. 
2. Devised general algorithms for solving linear programming problems. 
3. Proposed a heuristic for solving certain combinatorial problems.
4. Made significant contributions to the theory of matrix computations.
5. Developed fast methods for solving linear systems of equations.
6. Proved the existence of mathematical objects (polytopes) possessing certain properties. 
7. Demonstrated the possibility of simulating polynomial time algorithms on a quantum computer. 
8. Used mathematical methods to optimize the design of radio communications systems. 
9. Published several books and papers on linear algebra, theory of matrix computations, linear programming and combinatorial optimization.

Born 5 March 1624, Wood Eaton (4km north of Oxford), England. Died 10 November 1683, London, England.
