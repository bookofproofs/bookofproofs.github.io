**John Keill** was a Scottish mathematician who acted as a propagator of Newton's philosophy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1708 for his work on the theory of production of infinitesimal arcs. 
2. Developed a calculus of arcs, which is an improvement on the sources of calculus of Newton and Leibniz. 
3. Published a series of treatises, including the Arithmetic of Infinitesimals which is known as the first textbook on the derivative and integral calculus. 
4. Published 'New Principles of Astronomy' , a book which incorporated Newtonian dynamics, universal gravitation and geometrical principles. 
5. Established Keill's theorem, which is used to calculate the centre of a planet's orbit and its velocity of revolution. 
6. Discovered the properties of the tautochrone curve, which is the path along which a simple pendulum clock would keep accurate time. 
7. Pioneered the study of optical illusions and made the first experimental measurements of the phenomenon. 
8. Proposed laws that form the basis of the modern mathematical treatment of the refraction of light.

Born 1 December 1671, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 31 August 1721, Oxford, England.
