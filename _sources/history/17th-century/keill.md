**John Keill** was a Scottish mathematician who acted as a propagator of Newton's philosophy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* John's father was Robert Keill who was an Edinburgh lawyer.
* James Keill who became a physicist, was John's younger brother born two years later.
* John attended school in Edinburgh, then studied at Edinburgh University under David Gregory obtaining his degree in 1692 with distinction in both mathematics and physics.
* Keill went to Oxford with David Gregory in 1692 and, after obtaining a scholarship to finance his studies, studied at Balliol College.
* Keill was appointed deputy to the Sedleian professor of natural philosophy in 1699, a post he held until 1704.
* Keill was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1701 and remained at Balliol College until his scholarship ran out in 1703 when he transferred to Christ Church.
* Many wished to settle in North America and Keill accompanied a party who sailed to New England.
* In the following year the Savilian Professorship of Astronomy in Oxford became vacant again and this time Keill was appointed taking up the post in 1712.
* Keill acted as a propagator of Newton's philosophy and argued against Whiston and others.
* This did not provoke any reaction from Newton until 1711 when Keill suggested that this could be interpreted as suggesting that Newton's fluxions were a moving version of Leibniz's differentials.
* Keill responded by accusing Leibniz of plagiarizing Newton in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society and Leibniz wrote to the Royal Society asking that he withdraw his accusation.
* Keill maintained his position and Leibniz wrote to Newton asking him to tell Keill to withdraw his accusations.
* Keill did write a reply in the Journal Litéraire which he intended as a defence of national honour.
* Although Keill and Newton seemed very friendly at this time it appeared that Newton grew tired of Keill's stirring up trouble.
* Newton made it up with Johann Bernoulli although Keill never did.
* In 1717 Keill married Mary Clements.
* Perhaps the attraction for Keill was the fact that she was twenty-five years younger.
* Keill's work Euclides elementorum libri priores sex Ⓣ(The first six books of Euclid's 'Elements') published in 1715 studies trigonometry and logarithms.
* Two years before he died, Keill was left a fortune on the death of his brother James.

Born 1 December 1671, Edinburgh, Scotland. Died 31 August 1721, Oxford, England.
