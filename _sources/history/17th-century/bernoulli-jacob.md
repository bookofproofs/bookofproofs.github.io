**Jacob Bernoulli** was a Swiss mathematician who was the first to use the term integral. He studied the catenary, the curve of a suspended string. He was an early user of polar coordinates and discovered the isochrone.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of the calculus of variations and the theory of infinite series
2. Pioneered the development of the field of probability and his work on the law of large numbers
3. Wrote the landmark work on probability theory, Ars Conjectandi
4. Introduced the concept of ‘Bernoulli trials’
5. Developed the notion of attractive and repulsive forces for magnetism and gravitation
6. Propounded the Bernoulli Principle, which states that an increase in velocity of a fluid gives a corresponding decrease in pressure or potential energy
7. Established the ‘rule of convergence’ which is fundamental to the theory of trigonometric series
8. Discovered and demonstrated the probability distribution known as the Bernoulli distribution

Born 6 January 1655, Basel, Switzerland. Died 16 August 1705, Basel, Switzerland.
