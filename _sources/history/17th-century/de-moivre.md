**Abraham De Moivre** was a French-born mathematician who pioneered the development of analytic geometry and the theory of probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the de Moivre-Laplace theorem of probability, which has been used extensively in quantitative finance.
2. Was the first to approximate the normal curve with polynomials, leading to the concept of the normal distribution.
3. Proved the binomial theorem for fractional and negative exponents.
4. Was the first to introduce compound interest as a mathematical concept.
5. Extended Fermat's little theorem to complex exponents.
6. Founded analytic trigonometry with complex numbers.
7. Developed the use of interpolation to calculate tables of trigonometric functions.
8. Advanced the arithmetic-geometric mean and made great progress in approximating logarithmic, exponential, and certain elliptical integrals.
9. Used the probability theory to calculate and approximate the odds in gambling games.
10. Contributed to the theory of annuities and life contingencies, which forms the basis of modern actuarial science.

Born 26 May1667, Vitry-le-Fran√ßois, Champagne, France. Died 27 November 1754, London, England.
