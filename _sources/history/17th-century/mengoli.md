**Pietro Mengoli** was an Italian mathematician who worked on infinite series and limits of geometric figures.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He developed and applied the theory of indivisibles (calculus) to problems in geometry.
2. He wrote the influential book, Geometria Indivisibilibus Continuorum, which developed the basic concepts of integral calculus.
3. He also extended the work of his teacher, Bonaventura Cavalieri, introducing the concept of the integral with respect to lines, surfaces, and solids, which is now known as the "Mengoli Line".
4. He helped to develop the modern methods of solving cubic equations and discovered relationships between certain polynomials that are now called Mengoli Curves.
5. He discovered the first example of a demiclosed curve that is now known as the Mengoli Ellipse.
6. He proposed the "Mengoli Problem" which provided an extension to the theory of closed curves.
7. He developed an infinite series for logarithms, known as the "Mengoli Series", which is used in calculus and trigonometry.
8. He also wrote important works on the theory of triangles and quadrilaterals, as well as on the ratio of the areas of circles and spheres.

Born 1626, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy). Died 1686, Bologna, Papal States (now Italy).
