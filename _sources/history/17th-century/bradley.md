**James Bradley** was an English astronomer best known for his discovery of the aberration of light and of the nutation of the earth's axis.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published his novel "Theory of Celestial Motion" in 1704, becoming the first to describe the behavior of stars and planets. 
2. Established the moons of Jupiter as proof of Isaac Newton’s theory of gravitation. 
3. Was the first to measure the speed of the earth’s rotation around its own axis, using a complex nested pendulum device. 
4. Discovered the aberration of starlight, an effect in which the apparent position of a star shifts due to the movement of the earth.
5. Discovered the nutation of the earth, demonstrating a subtle and small variation in the tilt of the earth's axis. 
6. Proposed a new method for determining the distance between the earth and a star using geometrical methods.

Born March 1693, Sherborne, Gloucestershire, England. Died 13 July 1762, Chalford, Gloucestershire, England.
