**Johannes Hevelius** was a Polish astronomer who published important observations with the help of his wife.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Hevelius computations refined the lunar theory, improving calculations of the Moon's motion by accurately measuring its orbit.
2. Hevelius published a star catalogue cataloging over 1,500 stars and their positional data, as well as a set of star charts.
3. Hevelius was the first to accurately determine the density of the Earth based on gravity measurements.
4. Hevelius used a sextant to accurately measure the positions of the stars, establishing a baseline for modern celestial navigation.
5. Hevelius constructed a small observatory to make his observations, the first large one in Central Europe.
6. Hevelius was one of the first astronomers to draw a diagram of a comet's trajectory.
7. Hevelius was the first to accurately measure the orbital period of a comet, accurately analyzing its orbit.
8. Hevelius compiled an extensive set of tables for navigating the night sky, known as Machina Coelestis.
9. Hevelius identified five new comets with their orbital elements, including the first one to be discovered from a northern latitude.
10. Hevelius established the convention of representing star magnitudes with a numerical system still in use today.

Born 28 January 1611, Danzig, now Gdańsk, Poland. Died 28 January 1687, Danzig, now Gdańsk, Poland.
