**Guido Grandi** was a Camaldolese monk who worked on geometry and hydraulics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the algorithmic framework for the symbolic solution of transcendental equations (Grandi's Method).
2. Used the Grandi's Method to express a solvable differential equation in terms of elementary functions.
3. Developed a mathematical approach to redefine elliptic integrals in terms of hypergeometric functions.
4. Constructed a generalization of Euler's theorem applicable to a wide array of differential equations.
5. Proposed an algebraic system capable of solving systems of linear equations.

Born 1 October 1671, Cremona (now Italy). Died 4 July 1742, Pisa (now Italy).
