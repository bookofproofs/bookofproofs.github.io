**Juan Caramuel** was a Spanish Cistercian who expounded the general principle of numbers to base _n_ pointing out the benefits of some other bases than 10.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established the "concept of 'absurde numbers' by introducing base-dependent arithmetic and developing a theory of congruences.
2. Published three books on mathematics, one of which was dedicated to logic and geometry.
3. Significantly contributed to the development of logarithms and analytic geometry.
4. Founded the "Cartesian School", blending Latin philosophy and mathematics.
5. Pioneered the adoption of fractions and negative numbers into the real number system.
6. Developed a new method to calculate the area of a triangle.
7. Worked on the development of calendrical formulas and the study of canon law.
8. Authored a pioneering book on Optics.
9. Contributed to number theory and developed a theory which combined algebra and geometry.

Born 23 May 1606, Madrid, Spain. Died 7 September 1682, Milan (now Italy).
