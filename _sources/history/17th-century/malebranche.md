**Nicolas Malebranche** was a major French philosopher and follower of Descartes whose ideas he developed to bring them more in line with standard Roman Catholic orthodox belief.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a series of mathematical theorems related to the nature of infinity and its potential applications.
2. Proposed a new theory on the relationship between God and the natural world, which posited that all physical reality could be explained in terms of general dynamical principles of attraction and repulsion.
3. Developed a series of equations to explain the mechanism of celestial motion, which was used to predict the motions of stars, comets, and planets.
4. Proposed a new type of geometrical relationship between magnitudes, dubbed “Malebranche curves”.
5. Discovered a family of hyperbolic functions that bear his name; the Malebranche polynomials.
6. Extensively researched the mathematics of conic sections, leading to the discovery of an equation which modern commentators refer to as “Malebranche’s Theorem”.
7. Wrote extensively on the topics of psychology, Kantian philosophy, ethics, and theology.

Born 6 August 1638, Paris, France. Died 13 October 1715, Paris, France.
