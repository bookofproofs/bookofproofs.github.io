**Giovanni Saccheri** was an Italian Jesuit who did important early work on non-euclidean geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Established a procedure for calculating the focal point of a conic section in 1706.
2. Determined the lower and upper limits of Euclidean parallelism in 1733.
3. Derived the Saccheri-Legendre theorem in 1733.
4. Discovered the first example of non Euclidean geometry in 1733.
5. Devised a formula for the area of hyperbolic triangle in 1753.
6. Proved that the sum of the angles in a triangle is less than two right angles in 1733.
7. Developed a full logical approach to Euclidean proofs in 1733.
8. Made significant contributions to the philosophy of mathematics in his works.

Born 5 September 1667, San Remo, Genoa (now Italy). Died 25 October 1733, Milan (now Italy).
