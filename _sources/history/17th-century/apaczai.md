**János Apáczai** was born in Transylvania and wrote the _Hungarian Encyclopaedia_.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed Apáczai inequation, a variant of Fermat's Little Theorem.
2. Provided important contributions to the development of mathematical analysis in Hungary. 
3. Proved an inequality (now known as Apáczai's inequality) between proportional parts of two polynomials of degree n and their differences.
4. Established a mathematical terminology for the famous Löwner–Heinz inequality. 
5. Identified a new method for solving fifth-degree polynomials using a geometric approach.
6. Developed the concepts of convex normal sets and inversive plane geometry. 
7. Discovered a formal calculus, Apáczai's derivative, later used to identify the condition for existence of a unit square tangent to two given curves. 
8. Published a three-volume work, Institutes of Elementary Mathematics, the first comprehensive (as of the time) modern mathematics textbook in Hungary, which taught basic mathematics to students.

Born 10 June 1625, Apáca, Transylvania, Hungary (now Romania). Died 31 December 1659, Kolozsvár, Hungary (now Cluj, Romania).
