**Jacques Cassini** or **Cassini II** was a French astronomer and surveyor who carried on his father's work in geodesy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method to calculate the figure of the Earth which revealed that the shape of the Earth is oblate spheroid. 
2. Developed the first cartography of France in 1744 which was very detailed and accurate. 
3. Constructed a series of mathematical tables for coordinates of the Moon in 1702. 
4. Published an almanac of the Sun in 1705, which featured detailed calculations for the Sun's rise and fall for every day of the year. 
5. Co-constructed a world map which embraced the modern-day countries. 
6. Published a study on map projections in 1720. 
7. Revised the geographical constants of the solar system in 1740. 
8. Developed the Cassini coordinate system in 1740.
9. Developed the Theory of Elongations in 1740.

Born 8 February 1677, Paris, France. Died 18 April 1756, Thury, France.
