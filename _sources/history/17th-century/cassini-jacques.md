**Jacques Cassini** or **Cassini II** was a French astronomer and surveyor who carried on his father's work in geodesy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* To avoid confusion with other members of the Cassini family (his father, son and grandson), he is sometimes known as Cassini II.
* Jean-Dominique Cassini was head of the Paris Observatory at the time of his marriage to Geneviève in 1674 and, two years previously, had become a French citizen, changing his name from Giovanni Domenico Cassini.
* Jacques, the second of his parents two sons, was born at their home at the Observatory in Paris.
* It was a wealthy family and Jacques received the finest education possible.
* This is where Jacques had his earliest education, after which he studied at the Collège Mazarin in Paris.
* Varignon had been appointed professor of mathematics at the Collège Mazarin in 1688 and he supervised Cassini's thesis on optics.
* In August 1691, at the age of fourteen, Cassini defended his thesis.
* In 1694 Cassini was admitted to the Académie des Sciences and began to undertake scientific work on projects which his father was carrying out.
* The following year he travelled with his father in Italy and they made numerous geodesic observations, as well as visiting Bologna where they repaired the gnomon at the Church of San Petronio which Cassini's father had designed nearly thirty years before.
* Cassini, like his father, was interested in making both astronomical observations and also interested in accurate surveys.
* After the Italian trip, Cassini visited Flanders and then England in around 1698.
* In 1700 Cassini's father undertook a project to measure the meridian from Paris to Perpignan, which is 13 km west of the Mediterranean coast.
* Cassini assisted his father on this project and they obtained results which wrongly suggested that the Earth was elongated at the poles.
* It was unfortunate that Cassini resolutely stuck to this position throughout his life, refusing to acknowledge the flattening despite the scientific evidence which was put forward.
* Whether this was due to a false sense of patriotism, believing that he was supporting the French view against the English view which was a consequence of Newton's gravitational theory (which Cassini never accepted), or whether it was through a false sense of family loyalty supporting his father's views, we shall never know.
* Perhaps indeed both may have contributed without Cassini being fully aware that they were affecting his scientific judgement, or perhaps he was so convinced that the results of the 1700 survey were correct that he could never accept the contrary.
* The real problem with the data from the survey was, as pointed out in 1733 by Giovanni Poleni, that both the elongation proposed by Cassini or the flattening proposed by others, fell within the experimental error of the instruments used.
* Cassini had some legal training but not so much that one would expect him to play a substantial role in this field but, in addition to his scientific work, he did undertake a second parallel career.
* Around 1709 his father's health began to fail and Cassini took on more and more of the duties of head.
* It is worth noting that at this time there was no official post of Director of the Observatory, which was in theory run by the Académie des Sciences, but Cassini like his father before him effectively ran it.
* Cassini continued both his astronomical and surveying work.
* However, those like Maupertuis who believed that the Earth was flattened at the poles argued ever more strongly against Cassini's theory and, in an attempt to gain further evidence to support his case, Cassini organised another project in 1733, this time to measure the perpendicular to the meridian from Saint-Malo to Strasbourg.
* As he had accompanied his father when he was a young man, on this measuring project Cassini had the assistance of his own son César-François Cassini (who appears in this archive under the name Cassini de Thury).
* Although Cassini never deviated from his belief, he began to scale back his scientific work from 1740.
* As to his contributions to astronomy, Cassini published many papers in the journals of the Académie des Sciences and two major treatises in 1740, namely Elements of Astronomy and Astronomical Tables of the Sun, Moon, Planets, Fixed Stars, and Satellites of Jupiter and Saturn.
* Cassini's work was not restricted to that of astronomy and geodesy.
* Although after 1740 his scientific activity decreased, he did assist his son Cassini de Thury in his project to produce an accurate map of France.
* Let us end by stressing that Cassini made an extremely important contribution to the major scientific debates of his time.
* We should in no way consider Cassini's contribution any the less important because he was on the wrong side in the debate.

Born 8 February 1677, Paris, France. Died 18 April 1756, Thury, France.
