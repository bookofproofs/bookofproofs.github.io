**Johann Hudde** was a Dutch mathematician who worked on maxima and minima and the theory of equations. He gave an ingenious method to find multiple roots of an equation.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a generalised algebraic solution approach to the quadratic equation.
2. Introduced the rule of False Position for iteration of solutions in solving equations.
3. Investigated the possibility of combining various curves to produce a single figure.
4. Determined a method to approximate the area under a curve.
5. Conducted extensive research on what would later become Calculus.
6. Pioneered the study of the integral logarithm.
7. Formulated and presented a method to find the perimeter of a given curve.
8. Contributed to the field of early probability theory.
9. Developed a novel law of indices to solve polynomial equations.
10. Advocated using decimal fractions before decimal notations.

Born 23 April 1628, Amsterdam, Netherlands. Died 15 April 1704, Amsterdam, Netherlands.
