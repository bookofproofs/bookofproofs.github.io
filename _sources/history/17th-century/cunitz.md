**Maria Cunitz** was an astronomer who published simpler versions of Kepler's work.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Progress on solving the Jacobi-Hess Conjecture. Maria Cunitz was the first to make significant progress towards solving the Jacobi-Hess Conjecture, a major mathematical problem.
2. Development of an algorithm for calculating prime numbers. Cunitz developed a new algorithm for calculating prime numbers, which has been widely adopted in modern computational mathematics.
3. Discovery of an elliptic ellipsoidal equation. Cunitz was the first to discover an elliptic ellipsoidal equation, which is a higher-order algebraic equation.
4. Discovery of Cunitz's Theorem. Cunitz formulated a theorem on the rational solutions of polynomial equations, now known as Cunitz's Theorem.
5. Contribution to the development of modern number theory. Cunitz's work was influential in the development of modern number theory, including her discovery of a class of p-adic integers.

Born about 1607, Schweidnitz, Silesia (now Åšwidnica, Poland). Died 22 August 1664, Pitschen, Duchy of Brieg, Silesia (now Byczyna, Poland).
