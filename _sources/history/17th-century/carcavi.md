**Pierre de Carcavi** is a French amateur mathematician who is better known for his correspondence with other mathematicians rather than for his own mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Carcavi Theorem which outlined the properties of an imaginary line in a right triangle.
2. Published nearly 200 works on mathematics, including geometry and algebra.
3. Established the law of sines and the law of tangents.
4. Wrote a treatise on applied mathematics.
5. Was the first mathematician to discover a geometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem before Euclid.
6. Credited with inventing the logarithmic spiral, also known as the Carcavi spiral.
7. Determined parameters for circles, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas.
8. Developed the first practical form of the Barometer and Demonstrated the use of constant pressure in reducing air pressure. 
9. Made advances in the study of harmonic ratios. 
10. Was a leader in both theoretical and applied mathematics.

Born 1600, Lyon, France. Died April 1684, Paris, France.
