**Nicolaus Mercator** was a German mathematician best known for his series for log(1 + _x_).

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Mercator Projection, a 5-point mapping projection which is widely used in modern navigation and mapping applications.
2. Founded the Mercator School of Geography at Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands.
3. Published the 1569 world map “Atlas of the World”, which was the first true atlas of cartography.
4. Popularized the use of logarithms as a way to simplify various mathematical calculations.
5. Was the first mathematician to solve equations of the fifth degree.
6. Developed methods for the approximation of curved lines by straight lines, the basis of graphical calculus.
7. Developed methods to mathematically calculate the area and circumference of a circle.
8. Developed the notion of interpolation, where values between two observed points can be accurately determined.

Born 1620, Eutin, Holstein, Holy Roman Empire (now Germany). Died 14 January 1687, Paris, France.
