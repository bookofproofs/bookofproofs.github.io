**Robert Hooke** was an English scientist who made contributions to many different fields including mathematics, optics, mechanics, architecture and astronomy. He had a famous quarrel with Newton.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Experimented with various materials to find the mathematical links between their physical properties, discovering the law of elasticity (i.e. Hooke’s law) as a result.
2. Conducted thorough experiments to determine the relationship between the magnitude of a force and the elongation of a spring – later known as Hooke’s Law.
3. Developed an equation that describes the relationship between force, strain and the elasticity of a material.
4. Suggested that the universe is composed of minute particles, or “atoms”, each connected by some kind of spring-like force.
5. Proposed the wave theory of light, predicting that when light rays pass through a narrow opening, they bend and form concentric circles known as diffraction.
6. Demonstrated the relationship between the force of gravity and the amount of energy required to move a body from one height to another – later known as the Law of Conservation of Energy.
7. Suggested a mathematical explanation for the motion of bodies circling around each other, proposing the first law of motion, which is the basis for Newton’s Laws of Motion.
8. Influenced Isaac Newton to formulate his famous Laws of Motion.
9. Applied mathematics to explain the behavior of pendulums and their use as clocks.
10. Postulated that if a point located outside a circle is connected to two points on the circle, the angles created at the three points must add up to a straight line.

Born 18 July 1635, Freshwater, Isle of Wight, England. Died 3 March 1703, London, England.
