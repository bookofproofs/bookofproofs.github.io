**Jagannatha** was an Indian mathematician who is important as a translator of important Greek works into Sanskrit.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the well-known Jagannatha expansion formula, which enabled astronomers to more accurately predict the position of planets and stars.
2. Developed tables of sin and cosine functions, allowing more precise calculations in astronomy.
3. Developed the sine-table formula and the half-chord formula.
4. Enumerated the prime numbers between 0 and 120.
5. Developed the summation formula by which infinite series can be summed.
6. Developed methods of calculating odd and even perfect numbers.
7. Wrote a book called Ganitakaumudi, which is believed to be the first work to provide comprehensive knowledge on arithmetic and geometry.

Born about 1690, Amber (now Jaipur), India. Died about 1750, India.
