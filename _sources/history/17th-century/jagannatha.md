**Jagannatha** was an Indian mathematician who is important as a translator of important Greek works into Sanskrit.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* His financial success let him finance the scholarly works of people such as Jagannatha.
* Jai Singh ruled Amber throughout the period in which Jagannatha was producing his scientific work.
* So Jai Singh employed Jagannatha to make Sanskrit translations of the important Greek scientific works which at that time were only available in Arabic translations.
* Jagannatha translated Euclid's Elements from the Arabic translation by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi made nearly 500 years earlier.
* Jagannatha translated al-Tusi's Arabic version but he did more than this for he included in the same work, which he called Siddhantasamrat, his own comments on related work of other Arabic mathematical astronomers such as Ulugh Beg and al-Kashi.
* It is clear from Jagannatha's work that he is working as one of a group of mathematicians and astronomers gathered by Jai Singh in his scheme to bring the best in scientific ideas from outside India to reinvigorate the scientific scene in India.

Born about 1690, Amber (now Jaipur), India. Died about 1750, India.
