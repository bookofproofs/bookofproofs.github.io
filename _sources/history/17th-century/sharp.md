**Abraham Sharp** was an English mathematician who worked with Flamsteed. He calculated `$\pi$` to 72 places.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* However, there is good reason from Sharp's own writing to believe that this inscription is wrong and the he was indeed born shortly before he was baptised.
* His parents were John Sharp of Little Horton, and his wife, Mary Clarkson of Bradford.
* John Sharp was quite well off.
* Being fairly wealthy, his parents were able to give Abraham, and all their other sons, a good education.
* The first formal education which Abraham received was in the village school in Little Horton, then he attended Bradford grammar school.
* We know nothing further of Sharp until 1684 by which time he was living in London and using the Hen and Chickens coffee house in the Strand as a mailing address.
* From November 1690 Sharp taught mathematics as the resident mathematician of William Court at the Mariner and Anchor on Little Tower Hill in London.
* After 1702 Sharp corresponded with Flamsteed and almost all of the correspondence has survived.
* Subjects discussed by Sharp in his letters include mathematical and astronomical books, astronomical calculations, the aurora borealis, other observations, instruments, and the printing of Flamsteed's works.
* the ingenious and unwearied Mr Abraham Sharp, with his Table of Logarithms to above fifty figures ...
* Sharp claimed that his paper had been read by Halley who then used his methods and claimed them as his own.
* In 1717 Sharp published Geometry Improved.
* Sharp's papers were lost in a fire so unfortunately further details of his mathematical work will never be known.
* Sharp would have liked to have trained someone to use the collection of instruments which he had built up.
* In Bradford Cathedral there is a tablet commemorating Sharp.

Born 1653, Little Horton, near Bradford, Yorkshire, England. Died 18 July 1742, Little Horton, near Bradford, Yorkshire, England.
