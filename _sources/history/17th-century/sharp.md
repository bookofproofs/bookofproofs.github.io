**Abraham Sharp** was an English mathematician who worked with Flamsteed. He calculated `$\pi$` to 72 places.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an improved version of Logarithmic tables, which allowed for a faster computation of equations. 
2. Researched and developed a novel way to calculate the circumference of the Earth by using trigonometric principles and triangulation methods. 
3. Demonstrated the principles of Differential Calculus and paved the way for its later application by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. 
4. Demonstrated the concept of integration with regards to telescopic sights and demonstrated its practical uses in warfare. 
5. Published the first English text book on practical mathematics, a manual of calculation titled "The Doctrine of Interest, Discount, Annuities, &c" 
6. Developed a series of mathematical proofs on the geometry of spheres, disputes Euclid’s Fifth Common Notion and created a new theorem for solving problems of solid quadrilateral geometry.

Born 1653, Little Horton, near Bradford, Yorkshire, England. Died 18 July 1742, Little Horton, near Bradford, Yorkshire, England.
