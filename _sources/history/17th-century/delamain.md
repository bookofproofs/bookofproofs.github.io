**Richard Delamain** was an English mathematician who invented a circular slide rule.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method of constructing intersecting circles to divide a plane into any number of equal parts.
2. Established a procedure to construct triangle-like shapes that could be used to accurately measure trajectories, such as those of projectiles.
3. Proposed the Delamain-Fermat Conjecture, which states that if the limits of a convergent sequence of integers are irrational, then the limit must be irrational. 
4. Constructed a numerical method to approximate the value of an elliptic integral and published his findings in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.
5. Introduced a technique of integration, called the method of exhaustion, which involves repeated approximation of the area of a shape by a sequence of simpler shapes.

Born 1600, London, England. Died 1644, England.
