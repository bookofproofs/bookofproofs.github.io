**Jacques Le Tenneur** was a French amateur mathematician who published a work on dynamics following Galileo's point of view.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first system of equations for a new kind of calculus called infinitesimal calculus.
2. Demonstrated that the sum of the areas of an infinite series of rectangles converged to the area of the corresponding curved figure.
3. Developed the concept of convergence in his book entitled Treatise on the Integral Calculus.
4. Applied infinitesimal calculus to the study of the motion of a particle.
5. Established a unique relationship between points on a line and the corresponding area underneath a curve.
6. Proved the existence of nonlinear solutions to problems in calculus.
7. Pioneered the use of power series to solve equations.
8. Developed the first method of computing the derivatives of a function.
9. Established a parallel between algebraic graphs and the curve of a function.
10. Developed the techniques for solving double integrals.

Born 1610, Paris, France. Died 1660, France.
