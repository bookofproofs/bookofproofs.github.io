**Jonas Moore** was an English man of science important for his support of mathematics and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Moore was greatly influenced by Oughtred in his mathematical studies.
* However, he found it difficult to find sufficiently many pupils so Moore was happy to be appointed as a surveyor in 1649.
* Moore made a reputation for himself in this job and soon was appointed to other surveying jobs.
* The dedication of the republished work shows that Moore was working hard to find favour with the new regime.
* In 1663 Moore was sent to Tangier to conduct a survey and to report on its fortifications.
* However Moore is not particularly famous for the mathematics which he did: as a mathematician he is best known as the first to use the notation cot.
* Rather Moore is famous for his strong support of mathematics and astronomy which made many other mathematical and astronomical advances possible.
* Moore, together with the famous diary writer Samuel Pepys, founded the Royal Mathematical School within Christ's Hospital.
* Moore became a governor of the school and together with Perkins, a master at the school, he wrote a major mathematical work intended for use at the Royal Mathematical School.
* Moore died however before the work could be published.
* Moore wrote the sections on arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry and cosmography while the sections on algebra, Euclid and navigation were written by Perkins.
* Moore died in 1679 while on a journey from Portsmouth to London.

Born 8 February 1627, Whitelee, Pendle Forest, Lancashire, England. Died 25 August 1679, Godalming, England.
