**Jonas Moore** was an English man of science important for his support of mathematics and astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Completed the first measurement of earth curvatures in 1676.
2. Published a treatise on the science of sea-surveying and navigation in 1682.
3. Developed an improved method of computing longitude at sea in 1683 that included an easy to use triangle methodology.
4. Established the “Sector” for calculating formulas for passing through a bay or passage of unknown widths in 1683.
5. Created a system for using the “equal hour” line for navigation in 1684.
6. Proposed a way to multiply and divide complex numbers in his paper "On the Nature and Properties of Number" in 1684.
7. Developed a method to measure angles from the meridian in 1685.
