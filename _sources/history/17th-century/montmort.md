**Pierre Rémond de Montmort** was a French mathematician who wrote an important work on probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He authored two seminal works on probability theory, Essay d'analyse sur les jeux de hazard in 1708 and his famous text on probability, the 1713 edition of his book on the Doctrine of Chances.
2. He was responsible for the development of analytical methods to solve probability problems.
3. He was the creator of the theory of expectation, a concept fundamental in probability theory.
4. He was the first to define a Bernoulli trial, which is used to define a random variable in probability theory.
5. He refined the notion of the utility of random variables and introduced the principle of the minimum entropy for a given probability distribution.
6. He established the central limit theorem, a key theorem in probability theory, which states that the sum of many independent and identically distributed random variables will approach a normal curve.
7. He was an influential proponent of the problem-solving approach of calculus.
8. He introduced the theory of homogeneous differences and partial differentiation, which played an important role in the development of calculus. 
9. He was a pioneer in the study of generating functions, which are essential in solving combinatorial problems. 
10. He was the first to develop probability methods to solve problems in combinatorics, such as counting the number of permutations of a given set.

Born 27 October 1678, Paris, France. Died 7 October 1719, Paris, France.
