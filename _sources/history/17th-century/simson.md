**Robert Simson** was a Scottish mathematician best known for the _Simson line_ of a triangle, even though he was not the first discoverer of it.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published two books on Euclidâ€™s Elements, one of which served as the standard text for over a century.
2. Discovered a connection between the three- and four-rectangular distances problems, which provides an alternative way of constructing a regular heptagon.
3. Provided the first statements and proofs of Descartes' theorem, Pascal's theorem, and Pfaff's problem in a systematic way.
4. Proved the similitude of any two regular polygons of the same number of sides and the algebraic expression of the square of the difference between the circumferences of two circles of different radii.
5. Proved that all right-angled triangles, inscribed in a given circle, are similar and investigated the properties of the ellipse. 
6. Generalized Menelaus' theorem.
7. Proved the theorems of Pappus and that of homographic transformations of conics into themselves.
8. Described four ways to geometrically square a circle and provided an algebraic proof for it.

Born 14 October 1687, West Kilbride, Ayrshire, Scotland. Died 1 October 1768, Glasgow, Scotland.
