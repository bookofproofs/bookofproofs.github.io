**Isaac Newton** was the greatest English mathematician of his generation. He laid the foundation for differential and integral calculus. His work on optics and gravitation make him one of the greatest scientists the world has known.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the theory of calculus.
2. Formulated a general law of gravitation and explained orbits of planets. 
3. Founded the three laws of motion and helped explain the laws of nature and the universe. 
4. Helped develop the theory of finite differences, and binomial theorem. 
5. Worked on the study of elliptical orbits and developed the theory of infinite series. 
6. Devised the system of fluxions to explain calculus.
7. Discovered that color is composed of light of differing wavelengths. 
8. Pioneered the study of optics and provided an accurate description of the way that light refracts when passing from one medium to another.

Born 4 January 1643, Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. Died 31 March 1727, London, England.
