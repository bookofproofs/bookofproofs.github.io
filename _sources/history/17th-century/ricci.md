**Michelangelo Ricci** was an Italian churchman who made some early applications of induction.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He was a key figure in the development of the Italian school of algebraic geometry and in the founding of the Italian Academy of Sciences.
2. He provided the foundation for the theory of algebraic surfaces, and his fundamental works on the subject are still read to this day.
3. Ricci formulated the “weak conjecture”, which stated that any set of algebraic equations is solvable by radicals, and he proved his conjecture for certain cases.
4. He developed Ricci calculus, a calculus of curvature that is central to modern differential geometry.
5. He was an influential teacher of the famous mathematician and physicist Tullio Levi-Civita, and contributed to the Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Physics.

Born 30 January 1619, Rome (now Italy). Died 12 May1682, Rome (now Italy).
