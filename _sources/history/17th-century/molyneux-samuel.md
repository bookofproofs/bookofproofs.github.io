**Samuel Molyneux** was an English astronomer who produced some new telescope designs.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* The Molyneux family were Protestants and they remained in Chester until James, who had led an army in Ireland, was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
* Samuel never knew his mother for, after she returned to Dublin with him in January 1691, she only lived until May of that year.
* Samuel's father, William Molyneux, began to correspond with the English philosopher John Locke beginning in 1692.
* This, of course, was now a topic of great interest to William Molyneux and he enthusiastically followed Locke's ideas in bringing up Samuel.
* However, William died in 1698 when Samuel was only nine years old, and from that time on he was brought up by his uncle Thomas Molyneux.
* When he was sixteen years old, Samuel Molyneux matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin and there he became friendly with George Berkeley who was four years his elder.
* Berkeley clearly had great respect for Molyneux, both as a man and as a scientist, and dedicated Miscellanea mathematica (1707) to his friend who was still an undergraduate at this time.
* On the death of his father, Molyneux had inherited an estate at Castle Dillon in County Armagh in Ireland which brought in a good income and, after leaving Trinity College, he spent two years making improvements to the estate.
* Molyneux accompanied the new king and his family back to London where he was made secretary to George's son, the Prince of Wales.
* The position of secretary to the Prince of Wales was only one of Molyneux's many roles.
* Before this Molyneux had a comfortable financial position, but now he was wealthy.
* Bradley was, like Molyneux, a fellow of the Royal Society and, after being appointed to the Savilian chair of astronomy at Oxford in 1721, moved from being an amateur astronomer to a professional one.
* Also in 1721, on the death of Lady Capel of Tewkesbury, a relation of Molyneux's wife, the Molyneuxs inherited Kew House.
* Molyneux and Bradley collaborated in innovative designs for reflecting telescopes from 1723 to 1725 and Molyneux set up an observatory at his home in Kew House.
* The main aim, as far as Molyneux was concerned, was to produce a design of telescope which could be made relatively cheaply and so allow a far wider range of people to become astronomical observers.
* It was mounted in November 1725 at Molyneux's home on Kew Green, by boring holes through the ceiling and roof.
* Bradley went on to use the method developed by him and Molyneux to discover the aberration of starlight which he announced in 1728.
* By this time, however, Molyneux had ceased to work with him for he was on the Privy Council having been appointed as one of the lords of the Admiralty on 29 July 1727.
* Molyneux had been returned as a member of the London parliament in 1726 and again in 1727, and also to the Irish parliament in 1727 as representing the University of Dublin.
* Sadly, Molyneux had inherited the disease which had killed his mother and he was struck down by a fit while in the House of Commons in April 1728.
* Robert Smith had been given access to Molyneux's papers and instruments a short time before Molyneux died and he took over the publication of a partially written book by Molyneux on optics.
* This was published as A Compleat System of Opticks (1738), and had chapters written by Molyneux on the grinding and polishing of telescope lenses and mirrors.
* In these chapters he explained the theories of Huygens who had visited the Royal Society in 1685, Molyneux being his host on this occasion.
* Huygens had kept in contact with Molyneux and had sent him his experimental results on lens before his death in 1695.
* Another chapter which was essentially due to Molyneux was entitled Sir Isaac Newton's Reflecting Telescope Made and Described by the Honourable Samuel Molyneux Esquire, and Presented by Him to His Majesty John V King of Portugal: with Other Kinds of Mechanisms for This and for Mr Gregory's Reflecting Telescope.
* On his death Molyneux had around 700 instruments, mostly for astronomical use.
* Some of these had been inherited from his father William Molyneux.

Born 18 July 1689, Chester, Cheshire, England. Died 13 April 1728, Kew, Surrey, England.
