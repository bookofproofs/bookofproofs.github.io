**Christiaan Huygens** was a Dutch mathematician who patented the first pendulum clock, which greatly increased the accuracy of time measurement. He laid the foundations of mechanics and also worked on astronomy and probability.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He advanced the study of cycloid curves and was the first to measure the radius of curvature of their arc. 
2. He was the first to use the surface of the cycloid to design the tautochrone or isochrone curve, which is a graph of the quickest path between two points. 
3. He was the first to develop the concept of a centripetal force, including its mathematical explanation. 
4. He was the first to announce and demonstrate the existence of the law of inertia, or the principle of conservation of momentum on which modern physics is based. 
5. He was the first to analyse a vibrating string mathematically and to assign it a frequency. 
6. He invented the pendulum clock, which revolutionized timekeeping, and was the first to use mathematics to determine the trajectory of a projectile in a vacuum. 
7. He was the first to discover and construct the catenary, or chain, pendulum. 
8. He was the first to calculate the speed of light with the help of a pendulum-based experiment.

Born 14 April 1629, The Hague, Netherlands. Died 8 July 1695, The Hague, Netherlands.
