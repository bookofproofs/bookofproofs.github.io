**Claude Mylon** was a French mathematician important because of his correspondence with the leading mathematicians of the day.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Claude was his parent's third son and he was brought up in a well-off family.
* Mylon is important in the history of mathematics, not for his own achievements, but for his role in the Académie Parisienne, the group of scholars which was a continuation of the group formed in Paris by Mersenne, which was to form the foundation on which the Paris Academy of Sciences was formed.
* Mylon joined Mersenne's mathematical circle in around 1645 when he began to take careful notes of mathematical discussions in the group.
* Mylon took on the role of secretary of the academy.
* After the death of Le Pailleur in 1654, Mylon had access to all the correspondence between members of the Académie Parisienne and the numerous scientist with whom they had corresponded.
* At this stage Mylon carried on the important task of making the discoveries of mathematicians available to other mathematicians.
* Mylon also corresponded with van Schooten about the problems on games of chance, in particular the dice and points problems, that Fermat and Pascal were considering.
* Mylon maintained contact with Pascal after he gave up his mathematical studies and corresponded with Roberval.
* Mylon's attempts to contribute to mathematics were much less successful than he was as a communicator of the results of others.

Born 1618, Paris, France. Died 1660, Paris, France.
