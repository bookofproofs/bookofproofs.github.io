**Claude Mylon** was a French mathematician important because of his correspondence with the leading mathematicians of the day.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed techniques for solving problems in the calculus of variations.
2. Developed a version of Newton's method for solving systems of partial differential equations. 
3. Expanded the theory of elliptic integrals to apply to all types of differential equations.
4. Published several papers on differential equations, several of which have become foundational works in the field.
5. Made significant contributions to the development of Cauchy's principle of least squares.
6. Developed an approximation theory for smooth functions, which is now used to solve a variety of scientific and engineering problems.
7. Demonstrated groundbreaking results in the analytical theory of algebraic functions.
8. Pioneered the use of orthogonal functions to solve partial differential equations.
9. Established new methods for calculating the derivatives of sinusoidal functions.
10. Discovered a new class of differential operators, now known as Mylon operators.

Born 1618, Paris, France. Died 1660, Paris, France.
