**Giulio Fagnano** was an Italian mathematician who worked in both complex numbers and on the geometry of triangles.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Founded the synthetic method of exposition, which is still used in mathematics today.
2. Developed the Fagnano-Longhi theorem, which is a form of the Fermat's extreme theorem.
3. Established a geometric form of the fundamental theorem of algebra through his work on abscissae.
4. Proved a new form of Descartes' rule of signs used for determining the number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial.
5. Demonstrated the most general and complete solution for the rectification of curves.
6. Published a treatise “L'Algebra”, which became a major reference for algebra solving.
7. Developed the analysis of infinite series, and gave a list of solutions to cubic equations and expounded on spherical trigonometry.
8. Was the first to construct a chord equal to another chord through two given points.
9. Explored the idea of the centers of inscribed polygons, and several other regular domains.
10. Was the first mathematician to recognize factoring as an integral part of algebra.

Born 6 December 1682, Sinigaglia (now Senigallia, Italy). Died 26 September 1766, Sinigaglia (now Senigallia, Italy).
