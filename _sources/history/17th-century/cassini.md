**Giovanni Cassini** (Cassini I) was an Italian mathematician and astronomer who studied the curve which is the locus of a point the product of whose distances from two fixed foci is constant.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Introduced the principle of the Cassini oval and developed it mathematically.
2. Developed a method to calculate the orbit of a comet using the principle of parallax.
3. First to propose the idea of a secular acceleration of the Moon's motion, developing a formula to prove its existence.
4. Conducted many observational programs including the "Grand Tour of the Heavens," which provided the first accurate measurements of the longitudes of 48 major cities in Europe.
5. Conceived the idea of "longitude by lunar distances," in which the Moon's positions are used to measure both time and longitude.
6. Produced tables known as "Cassini's Tables" of the Sun, Moon, and Planets, which became the standard for over a hundred years.
7. Devised the catalog "The Catalog of the Stars of the Royal Academy of Sciences," which included an estimated position of over 6,000 stars.
8. Devised a technique to determine the magnitude of planets, known as the "Cassini Magnitude."
9. Discovered four of Saturn's moons, and proposed a theory of Saturn's rings.

Born 8 June 1625, Perinaldo, Republic of Genoa (now Italy). Died 14 September 1712, Paris, France.
