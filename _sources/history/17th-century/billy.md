**Jacques de Billy** was a French Jesuit who corresponded with Fermat and produced a number of results in number theory which have been named after him.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. His most prominent work, the Compendium of Mathematics (1690), remained in use for 200 years.
2. In 1668, he helped establish a chair in geometry at the Jesuit College of Louis-le-Grand. 
3. He also wrote Latin textbooks for [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621] and Horace's Satires.
4. He organized a series of lectures on mathematics, which brought him fame.
5. He was the first to publish a surprisingly accurate estimate of pi to nine decimal places. 
6. He also wrote papers on topics such as the properties of conic sections and the squaring of the circle.
7. He was the first to introduce Stirling's formula into France.
8. He significantly advanced the design of astronomical instruments and made advances in the field of statics.

Born 18 March 1602, Compi√®gne, France. Died 14 January 1679, Dijon, France.
