**Joseph Saurin** was a French mathematician who made contributions to the calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He published a major treatise on algebra in 1636, one of the first works on the subject in the French language.
2. He developed a concept of general equations and equations with multiple unknowns, later called Saurin's curves.
3. He discovered the rule of three, a method of solving proportionality problems using algebraic equations.
4. He developed new techniques to simplify and solve equations of higher-degree polynomials.
5. He did pioneering work on redefining the notion of probability and worked on a method to solve binomial equations.
6. He successfully solved a cyclic equation, which was a form of equations with multiple unknowns.
7. He was appointed by King Louis XIV to teach mathematics to his son, Louis de Bourbon, later known as the Duc de Bourbon.

Born 1 September 1659, Courth√©zon, Vaucluse, France. Died 29 December 1737, Paris, France.
