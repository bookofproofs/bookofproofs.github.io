**Joseph Saurin** was a French mathematician who made contributions to the calculus.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Joseph was the youngest of his parents three children, who were all boys.
* His brother, Élie Saurin, went on to become a famous Protestant theologian.
* Pierre Saurin was the only tutor for all three of his sons and he wanted them all to enter the ministry.
* Saurin entered the Calvinist ministry as a curate in Eure in 1684 but was soon in trouble for his outspoken views which he delivered in sermons from the pulpit.
* Saurin, always someone with strong opinions of his own, did not accept the doctrine of predestination as presented in the Consensus.
* This now put Saurin in a very difficult position, unable to return to France as a Protestant minister.
* Saurin had married a daughter of the noble family de Crouzas in Switzerland; they had at least one son Bernard-Joseph who became a poet and writer of plays.
* Saurin now, however, found himself in difficulties since in October 1688 a French army marched into the Palatinate and a war had begun.
* He appealed to the Académie Royal des Sciences but, although Saurin was correct, they had no wish to come out against Rolle who was a member.
* Perhaps to be diplomatic, Saurin was elected to the Académie Royal des Sciences in 1707.
* Saurin made contributions to the calculus, wrote on Jacob Bernoulli's problem of quickest descent and Huygens' theory of the pendulum.
* It is clear from the biographical details that we have related above that Saurin fell out with many people around him.

Born 1 September 1659, Courthézon, Vaucluse, France. Died 29 December 1737, Paris, France.
