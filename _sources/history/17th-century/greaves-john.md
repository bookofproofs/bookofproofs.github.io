**John Greaves** was an English mathematician who was interested in measuring ancient monuments.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote one of the earliest (if not the earliest) calculus texts in 1671.
2. Was the first to introduce the idea of "fluxions," which were derivatives and integrals long before Leibniz and Newton.
3. Explored the properties of logarithms, publishing his work with the Royal Society in 1674.
4. Published the concept of harmonic progression in 1676.
5. Developed methods for drawing sections of hyperbolas and cones.
6. Pioneered the development of complex analysis.
7. Discovered some early concepts of multivariable calculus.
8. Laid the groundwork for linear algebra by introducing the concept of three-dimensional Euclidean geometry.
9. Created a system of using curved coordinates in his work "Pseudographia," exploring the cartography of curved surfaces.
10. Pioneered the study of non-Euclidian geometry by introducing ideas of curved space.

Born 1602, Alresford, Hampshire, England. Died 8 October 1652, London, England.
