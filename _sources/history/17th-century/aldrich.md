**Henry Aldrich** was an English mathematician who published an important work on logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Captain Aldrich served the Berkeley family for many years, in particular he served John Berkeley who became commissioner of the navy.
* Henry was born in Westminster, an inner borough of London, lying on the north bank of the River Thames.
* The Oxford Philosophical Society was founded in October 1683, and Aldrich was a founder member giving a lecture at the first meeting of the Society.
* Although Aldrich was a natural choice to take over as Dean of Christ Church when the position fell vacant in 1686, the king appointed a Roman Catholic to the position for religious reasons.
* However after the revolution of 1688 such things changed dramatically and Aldrich was appointed dean in April 1689.
* For three years, from 4 October 1692, Aldrich was vice-chancellor of Oxford University.

Born 15 January 1648, Westminster, London, England. Died 14 December 1710, London, England.
