**Henry Aldrich** was an English mathematician who published an important work on logic.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the Aldrich-Gill algorithm for solving linear programming problems.
2. Envisioned the modification and application of matrices to a wide range of mathematical problems.
3. Published a highly influential paper that explicated $ \mathcal O (1) $ and $ \mathcal O (n) $ algorithms.
4. Founded the Mathematical Society of America and promoted mathematics education in the United States.
5. Utilized his Algebraic fractions and his theorem on infinite series of terms to solve linear equations.
6. Refined and developed the methods of mathematical induction and proof.
7. Was a pioneer in the ability to directly apply the techniques of linear algebra to the world of probability.
