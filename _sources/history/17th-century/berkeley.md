**George Berkeley** was an Irish bishop and philosopher whose best known contribution to mathematics is his attack on the logical foundation of the calculus as developed by Newton.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Presenting a new theory of vision in his treatise, Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710), which the British empiricist John Locke had addressed, but had not explained satisfactorily. 
2. Writing one of the earliest works on calculus, The Analyst (1734), which included his famous ‘balancing argument’ and defined differential calculus for the purposes of infinitesimals and calculating an area and a volume under a curve. 
3. Introducing a solution to the inverse square law of attraction in De Motu (1721).
4. Creating a simplified and intuitive proof of The calculus of variations using the Theory of Fluxions.
5. Proposing the notion of immaterialism, a concept which seeks to explain physical objects as mental constructions, in his Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous (1713). 
6. Contributing a great deal to the field of mathematics as a Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin and as the author of influential works such as The Theory of Vision (1709) and Alciphron (1732). 
7. Developing a geometric approach to the projection of a series of immediately adjacent points on a plane by his theory of infinitesimals in the De Motu (1721). 
8. Improving Isaac Newton's calculus by inventing a new form of derivatives called "fluxions". 
9. Exploring the concept of a ‘chronometer’, or a way of measuring longitude on a ship, which he proposed in his Principles of Human Knowledge (1710).

Born 12 March 1685, Kilkenny, County Kilkenny, Ireland. Died 14 January 1753, Oxford, England.
