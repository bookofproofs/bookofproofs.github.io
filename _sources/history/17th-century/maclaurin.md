**Colin Maclaurin** was a Scottish mathematician who published the first systematic exposition of Newton's methods, written as a reply to Berkeley's attack on the calculus for its lack of rigorous foundations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Completed the first volume of Treatise of Algebra in 1748.
2. Developed Maclaurin's Theorem which is used to calculate approximate expressions for sin(x) and cos(x).
3. Used geometrical arguments to prove geometric theorems such as the rectification of the circle, the quoit made by the intersection of two spheres, and the duplication of the cube. 
4. Proposed a universal law of gravity from which he computed the orbits of the planets. 
5. Published an influential book "A Treatise of Fluxions".
6. Explained why logarithmic curves become asymptotic to a line.
7. Determined correct numerical values for the tidal actions of the moon on the oceans. 
8. Constructed approximate solutions to the wave equation. 
9. Contributed to the Newton's method of infinite series used to determine the roots of equations. 
10. Discovered Taylorâ€™s Theorem with infinite series.

Born February 1698, Kilmodan (12, km N of Tighnabruaich), Cowal, Argyllshire, Scotland. Died 14 June 1746, Edinburgh, Scotland.
