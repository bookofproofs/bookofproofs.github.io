**Maria Winckelmann** was a German astronomer who helped her husband with his observations. She was the first woman to discover a comet.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Astronomy was always the subject that fascinated Winckelmann most so she took the opportunity of studying with Christopher Arnold.
* Winckelmann showed her skill as a pupil of Arnold, and soon she was essentially serving an apprenticeship with him.
* Maria was a major player in producing the ephemeredes after their marriage in 1692, but the production ended in 1702 soon after they settled in Berlin.
* Maria Kirch became the first woman known to have discovered a comet in 1702.
* Whatever the reason, he admitted in 1710 that Maria had made the discovery.
* Maria Kirch has a small number of publications to her name.
* Gottfried Leibniz was president of the Academy and he supported Maria Kirch's application for the position.
* The Academy appointed Johann Heinrich Hoffmann who had far less experience than Maria Kirch and very quickly showed that he was not up to the job.

Born 25 February 1670, Panitzsch, near Leipzig, Germany. Died 29 December 1720, Berlin, Germany.
