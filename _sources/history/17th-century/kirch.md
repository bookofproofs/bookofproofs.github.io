**Maria Winckelmann** was a German astronomer who helped her husband with his observations. She was the first woman to discover a comet.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Her father was a Lutheran minister and he educated Maria at home.
* However, he died before her education was complete and from this time one of Maria's uncles took over the role of being her tutor.
* Astronomy was always the subject that fascinated Winckelmann most so she took the opportunity of studying with Christopher Arnold.
* Winckelmann showed her skill as a pupil of Arnold, and soon she was essentially serving an apprenticeship with him.
* Maria and Gottfried fell in love, but Winckelmann's uncle disapproved of marriage between the pair since he wanted Maria to be the wife of a Lutheran minister.
* Eventually he relented and Maria and Gottfried married in 1692.
* Of course Maria's uncle might also have found the age difference between the pair to be an issue for Maria was twenty-two, but her husband was fifty-two.
* Maria and Gottfried Kirch had a son Christfried (born in Guben on 24 December 1694) and three daughters the eldest being Christine (born in 1696, died in Berlin on 6 May 1782).
* It is worth noting that Maria was Gottfried Kirch's second wife and his three children with Maria brought his total number of children to fourteen.
* Gottfried made a living from producing calendars, which he had done from 1667, and ephemeredes so it was natural for him to teach his wife Maria to assist him in these tasks.
* The two worked as a team and, although they were probably equally skilled as astronomers, the social status of women at this time required that Maria Kirch acted as her husband's assistant rather than partner.
* Von Krosigk was an amateur astronomer and family friend who helped support Maria and Gottfried Kirch financially.
* In fact the Kirchs published a calendar each year from 1685 to 1728, beginning before Maria became involved, continuing through a period when both were working on the calendars, continuing largely due to Maria after the death of her husband in 1710 until her own death in 1720 when their son Christfried took over.
* Maria was a major player in producing the ephemeredes after their marriage in 1692, but the production ended in 1702 soon after they settled in Berlin.
* Maria Kirch became the first woman known to have discovered a comet in 1702.
* Whatever the reason, he admitted in 1710 that Maria had made the discovery.
* Maria Kirch has a small number of publications to her name.
* At this point Maria asked the Royal Berlin Academy of Sciences if she could fill her husband's position as Royal Astronomer.
* Gottfried Leibniz was president of the Academy and he supported Maria Kirch's application for the position.
* In fact the Academy appointed Johann Heinrich Hoffmann who had far less experience than Maria Kirch and very quickly showed that he was not up to the job.
* At first Maria and her daughters acted as Christfried's assistants but her health deteriorated and she had to give up her astronomical work.

Born 25 February 1670, Panitzsch, near Leipzig, Germany. Died 29 December 1720, Berlin, Germany.
