**Florimond de Beaune** was a French jurist and amateur mathematician who produced the first important introduction to Descartes' cartesian geometry.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an early form of the binary system of positional notation.
2. Produced new methods for solving higher-order polynomial equations.
3. Created a system of four-dimensional coordinates.
4. Developed the theory of division of angle by constructing new figures such as the eight-pointed star.
5. Introduced new ways of calculating the sides and angles of a triangle.
6. Advanced the field of spherical trigonometry by calculating the area of a spherical triangle.
7. Devised methods for determining the areas of figures with irregular boundaries.
8. Constructed a differentiable curve by joining several line segments (now called de Beaune curves).

Born 7 October 1601, Blois, France. Died 18 August 1652, Blois, France.
