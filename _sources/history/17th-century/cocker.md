**Edward Cocker** was an English scholar who was the author of an influential arithmetic text which ran to more than 100 editions.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first arithmetic book for children called 'Cocker's Arithmetick'.
2. Proved the product of two even numbers is always even. 
3. Showed that the product of three numbers is equal to the sum of three numbers with each number multiplied by the sum of the other two numbers. 
4. Published 'Arithmetica' in 1678, which was the first trigonometry book. 
5. Invented the Cocker Rule of Three for proportions.
6. Showed that the product of two odd numbers is always odd. 
7. Established an efficient way to calculate square roots. 
8. Contributed to the advancement of algebra with discoveries of series and progressions.
9. Developed a new way of calculating logarithms. 
10. Proposed the "Rule of False Position" in algebra, which helped simplify equations.
