**Elisabetha Koopman** was the wife of the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius and helped him with his observations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* After giving precise details of the cost of the silk and the making of the dress, he requests Elisabetha to send him three copies of Hevelius's books to cover the cost.
* In March 1680, Elisabetha Hevelius wrote a letter in Latin, almost certainly to Halley, asking for the name of a doctor whom he had recommended, when living in their home, as knowing of a diet that would cure arthritis.
* After the death of Hevelius in January 1687, Elisabetha Hevelius went about the task of preparing three of his partly finished books for publication.
* The first of the three works, Stellarum Fixarum, which one assumes only required minimal editing, was published by Elisabetha in 1687.

Born 17 January 1647, Danzig, now Gdańsk, Poland. Died 22 December 1693, Danzig, now Gdańsk, Poland.
