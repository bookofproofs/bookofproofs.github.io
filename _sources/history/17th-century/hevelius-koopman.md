**Elisabetha Koopman** was the wife of the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius and helped him with his observations.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* It was in this city, largely German speaking but a part of Poland at the time, that their daughter Elisabetha was born.
* It was a fascination for astronomy which led Elisabetha, when still only a child, to approach Hevelius, an astronomer of international repute who had a complex of three houses in Danzig which contained the best observatory in the world.
* Hevelius's wife died in March 1662 and some time after this Elisabetha, now aged fifteen, again approached Hevelius and reminded him that he promised to show her the heavens from his observatory when she was older - and now she was fifteen.
* Hevelius wrote Latin, but one has to say that Elisabetha writes with more style than her husband.
* Elisabetha and Johannes Hevelius married in St Catherine's Church, Danzig, on 3 February 1663.
* The eldest of the three daughters was named Catherina Elisabetha (after her mother) and baptised in St Catherine's Church, Danzig, on 14 February 1666.
* After giving precise details of the cost of the silk and the making of the dress, he requests Elisabetha to send him three copies of Hevelius's books to cover the cost.
* In March 1680, Elisabetha Hevelius wrote a letter in Latin, almost certainly to Halley, asking for the name of a doctor whom he had recommended, when living in their home, as knowing of a diet that would cure arthritis.
* After the death of Hevelius in January 1687, Elisabetha Hevelius went about the task of preparing three of his partly finished books for publication.
* The first of the three works, Stellarum Fixarum, which one assumes only required minimal editing, was published by Elisabetha in 1687.
* Elisabetha Hevelius died in December 1693 and was buried in the same tomb as her husband.
