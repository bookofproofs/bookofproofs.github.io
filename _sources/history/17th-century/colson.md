**John Colson** was an English clergyman and mathematician who translated several of Newton's books into Engish.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Pioneered the field of indefinite binary quadratic forms and developed its theory.
2. Discovered the class number one problem for real quadratic fields.
3. Developed groundbreaking work on the study of elliptic functions and theta functions.
4. Established methods to calculate lenghts of arcs of an ellipse and of an hyperbola. 
5. Contributed to the understanding of polynomials of degrees three and four.
6. Conceived formulae for calculating the angles between curves in plane, including hyperbolas and ellipses.

Born 1680, Lichfield, Staffordshire, England. Died 20 January 1760, Cambridge, England.
