**Johann Rahn** was a Swiss mathematician who was the first to use the symbol ÷ for division.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Rahn solved the cubic root problem without the use of negative numbers and discovered the numerical solution for a fourth-degree equation (the bi-quadratic equation).
2. Rahn formulated findings of earlier mathematicians in a concise and usable form and developed a general method for trigonometric calculations of arbitrary angles. 
3. Rahn was the first mathematician to recognize the significance of infinite series and continued the development of calculus initiated by Newton and Leibniz.
4. He worked on the theory of equations and the expansion of analytical equality, eventually leading to the development of modern algebra.
5. Rahn created the theory of quadratures, which is still relevant in geometry today.
6. He was influential in unifying numerical and algebraic approaches to mathematics. 
7. Rahn also produced books on logarithms, trigonometry and other mathematical topics. 
8. He worked to improve navigation computations by introducing a new way to calculate the variation of the compass.

Born 10 March 1622, Zürich, Switzerland. Died 25 May 1676, Zürich, Switzerland.
