**Gabriel Mouton** was a French clergyman who worked on interpolation and on astronomy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered and developed the law of sines, which states that the ratio between the lengths of two sides of a triangle is the same ratio of the sines of the opposite angles.
2. Co-developed a geometrodynamic model of the solar system with Isaac Newton, utilizing Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion.
3. Developed Mouton's Theorem, which states that an ellipse's conic section is determined by the distance of its foci, the major axis, and the eccentricity.
4. Developed a method for determining the coordinates of stars based on their angular displacement from the horizon.
5. Pioneered the modern concept of time measurement, which led to the development of marine chronometers, watches and clocks.
6. Refined the definition of pi and calculated pi to two decimal places.
7. Established the first school for mathematics teaching in France.

Born 1618, Lyon, France. Died 28 September 1694, Lyon, France.
