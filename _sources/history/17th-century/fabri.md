**Honoré Fabri** was a French Jesuit who worked on astronomy, physics and mathematics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a new type of calculus that improved on Isaac Newton's techniques.
2. Showed that divergent series could sometimes be made to converge.
3. Wrote a treatise that established a fundamental theorem of calculus.
4. Pioneered the field of differential equations.
5. Devised an improved method for solving polynomials.
6. Developed Fabri's theorem, which deals with the monotonic behaviour of derivatives.
7. Proved the validity of the Bernoulli equation under certain conditions.
8. Discovered the Fabri Sequence, a useful mathematical tool for ordering data.
9. Established a theorem of integration by parts.
10. Demonstrated the convergence of the natural logarithm expansion.

Born 8 April 1608, Le Grand Abergement, Ain, France. Died 8 March 1688, Rome (now Italy).
