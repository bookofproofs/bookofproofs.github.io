**John Flamsteed** was an English astronomer who published accurate astronomical observations and was the first Astronomer Royal.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Compiled a catalog of more than 3,000 stars and established modern stellar coordinates, including right ascension and declination.
2. Compiled a detailed catalog of the positions of the Moon, Sun and planets with unprecedented accuracy for the period 1683 to 1705.
3. Designed and constructed an observatory from 1675 to 1676 at Greenwich, England, equipped with a mural quadrant.
4. Proposed an improved method for calculating longitude at sea by measuring the time difference between two fixed points.
5. Derived new tables for the motion of the Moon which enabled the calculation of eclipses and transits of the Sun and planets.
6. Precisely measured the distance of Mars from the Earth in 1678, making it the first precisely measured interplanetary distance.
7. Published astronomical observations in the first edition of Historia Coelestis Brittanica in 1712.

Born 19 August 1646, Denby (near Derby), Derbyshire, England. Died 31 December 1719, Greenwich, London, England.
