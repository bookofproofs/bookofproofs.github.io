**Seth Ward** was an English mathematician and astronomer and a founder-member of the Royal Society.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Discovered the inverse-tangent law of refraction in 1656.
2. Formulated the theories of light refraction and reflection in 1657.
3. Pioneered in resolving cubic equations and conic sections.
4. Proposed mathematics to explain Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
5. Discovered mathematical methods to calculate logarithms and trigonometric functions.
6. Solved the problem of circular arc quadrature in 1657.
7. Developed a method for finding analytic solutions for biquadratic equations.
8. Established a law for obtaining quadratic equations from observed results.
9. Successfully derived a general formula for the area of a triangle in 1672.
