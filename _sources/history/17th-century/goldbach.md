**Christian Goldbach** was a Prussian mathematician best known for the conjecture he made in a letter to Euler that every even integer > 2 is a sum of two primes.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Proposed the Goldbach Conjecture in a 1742 letter to Leonhard Euler, which states that all even integers larger than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
2. Demonstrated the infinitude of primes with the help of Euler and worked on the summation of whole numbers.
3. Investigated the sums of consecutive squares and solved the Euler brachystochrone.
4. Developed the Goldbach-Euler Theorem, which states that every even number greater than four can be expressed as the sum of three prime numbers.
5. Studied the logarithmic mean and analyzed the number of unit fractions in an Egyptian fraction.
6. Collaborated with Euler and Nicolaus Bernoulli on the three-body problem and discovered number-theoretic functions.
7. Worked on the concept of a perfect number and expressed the Euler-Mascheroni constant as a product.

Born 18 March 1690, KÃ¶nigsberg, Brandenburg-Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Died 20 November 1764, Moscow, Russia.
