**Giovanni Alfonso Borelli ** was an Italian Italian physiologist and physicist who was the first to explain muscular movement and other body functions according to the laws of statics and dynamics.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first systematic treatise on mechanics that incorporated mathematics and a scientific approach to understanding physical phenomena.
2. Established the law of virtual velocities, which states that a system of forces can be replaced by a single virtual force whose magnitude is equal to the sum of the virtual velocities caused by the system of forces.
3. Wrote one of the earliest treatises on probability and the first book on hydrodynamics.
4. Developed the theory of equilibrium, which explains how forces acting on an object affect its motion.
5. Proposed the concept of inertia and acknowledged the centrifugal force of a rotating planet.
6. Proposed the concept of kinetic energy and demonstrated the principle of conservation of energy.
7. Proposed the heliocentric (solar system) model of the universe.
8. Developed the geometric theory of partial differential equations.
9. Recognized the importance of mathematical methods to explain physical phenomena and established the field of physical mathematics.
10. Proposed the theory of capillary action which explains the effect surface tension has on liquid movement.

Born 28 January 1608, Naples, Kingdom of Naples (now Italy). Died 31 December 1679, Rome, Papal States (now Italy).
