**Johann Doppelmayr** was a German mathematician who wrote on astronomy, spherical trigonometry, sundials and mathematical instruments.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed methods for determining the properties of conic sections, particularly parabolas and ellipses.
2. Established exact relationships between the various parameters of planetary motion. 
3. Discovered improved methods of calculating the mean positions of stars in the sky. 
4. Produced a new model of celestial mechanics that provided an exact description of satellite motion. 
5. Discovered two theorems related to the motion of the Moon, including that it is always in an elliptical orbit around the Earth. 
6. Proved the law of conservation of energy.
7. Constructed numerous star catalogs and diagrams of the celestial sphere. 
8. Devised a system for calculating the area of any region in the sky. 
9. Revolutionized the understanding of planetary orbits, particularly those of the five known planets. 
10. Authored the first comprehensive historical account of mathematics and astronomy: Historia Mathematica Universalis (1721).

Born 27 September 1677, Nuremberg, Germany. Died 1 December 1750, Nuremberg, Germany.
