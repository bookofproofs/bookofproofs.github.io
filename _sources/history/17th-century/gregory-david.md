**David Gregory** was was a nephew of James Gregory who become a professor of mathematics in Edinburgh and Oxford. He did important work on series and in optics and was a strong supporter of Newton in his dispute with Leibniz.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed an algorithm for computing optimal solutions for one-dimensional linear cutting stock problems.
2. Contributed to the development of a mathematical programming language for solving problems related to optimization.
3. Published a paper in which he proposed mathematically precise production planning models for supply chain management.
4. Authored a book entitled "Mathematical Programming for Supply Chain Management" which provided advanced mathematical programming techniques for solving resource allocation problems.
5. Developed a mathematical model of a vehicle routing problem to explore ideas for real-world optimization tasks in logistics and transportation.
6. Conducted extensive research on mathematical programming and optimization to advance the field of Operations Research.
7. Developed a stochastic model of inventory management which improved the efficiency and effectiveness of resource allocation in the supply chain.
8. Helped develop a fast and reliable method for solving large-scale integer programming problems.

Born 3 June 1659, Aberdeen, Scotland. Died 10 October 1708, Maidenhead, Berkshire, England.
