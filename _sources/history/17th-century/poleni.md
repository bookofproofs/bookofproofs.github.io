**Giovanni Poleni** was an Italian mathematician who worked on hydraulics, physics, astronomy and archaeology.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Wrote a book on mechanics entitled "Dialogues on Mechanics" which was widely considered the best work in the field of German-speaking countries.
2. Discovered the principle of virtual speeds, which was used to explain the kinetic relationships of fluids and solve the wave equation.
3. Developed the first formulas for calculating the surface area of a cone and for determining the average speed of a body.
4. Built an early anemometer to measure wind speed.
5. Established the motion of a heavy body on an inclined plane, which served as the basis for Isaac Newton's Principia.
6. Established the relationships between acceleration, velocity, and the force of gravitation. 
7. Constructed a wooden pendulum clock in order to solve the problems related to pendulum motion.
8. Constructed the largest sundial in Europe and the first sundial in Padua.
9. Produced an early electrostatic generator.
10. Made several contributions to the mathematics of catenary curves.

Born 23 August 1683, Venice, Venetian States (now Italy). Died 15 November 1761, Padua, Venetian States (now Italy).
