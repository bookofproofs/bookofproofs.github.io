**Denis Papin** was a French inventor who worked on the steam engine and invented the pressure cooker and the paddle boat.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the notion of a perfect differential equation to unify existing algebraic tools for solving problems of differential equations.  
2. Developed a new method for the solution of partial differential equations, now known as the D-operator method.
3. Pioneered the calculus of finite differences, a technique which is useful in numerical analysis.
4. Created the Papinian curve, a variant of the cycloid that represented an important concept in the field of mathematical physics.
5. Conducted pioneering work in the field of thermodynamics, building on the work of Galileo Galilei and Blaise Pascal.
6. Developed a cannon powered by steam which is considered a precursor to the modern steam engine.
7. Helped develop one of the earliest versions of a vacuum-based device for the purpose of lifting heavy objects.

Born 22 August 1647, Blois, France. Died 26 August 1713, London, England.
