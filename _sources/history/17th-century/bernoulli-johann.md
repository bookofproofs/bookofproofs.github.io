**Johann Bernoulli** was a Swiss mathematician who studied reflection and refraction of light, orthogonal trajectories of families of curves, quadrature of areas by series and the brachistochrone.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. He is credited with developing the theory of probability in his book Ars Conjectandi (1713).
2. He was the first to prove the law of large numbers in his 1713 book Ars Conjectandi.
3. He developed the Bernoulli distribution, a discrete version of the binomial distribution, which is widely used in fields such as economics.
4. He formulated and proved the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
5. He developed the first example of what is now known as a calculus of variations.
6. He laid the foundations for differential equations and the study of differential geometry.
7. He formed a number of mathematical definitions, such as the notion of an integral, that helped further mathematical understanding and development.
8. He introduced concepts such as the tangent line and the curve of least squares.
9. He was a leading mathematician in the development of analytic geometry as practiced today.
10. He made significant advances in the field of differential calculus and its application to real-world problems.

Born 27 July 1667, Basel, Switzerland. Died 1 January 1748, Basel, Switzerland.
