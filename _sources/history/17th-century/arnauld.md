**Antoine Arnauld** was a French supporter of Jansen who published some important works on logic and philosphy.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the concept of a logical calculus, pioneering the branch of equations, syllogisms and the process of deduction, including the notion of a "conditional proof". 
2. Introduced modern terminology for logical part of speech (e.g., "relatives", "subjunctives").
3. Demonstrated that logic can be applied to mathematics, particularly in his work on indeterminate equations and indeterminate multiplications.
4. Published the first complete text in projective geometry, "Des Maniéres de signifier en géométrie", which included an original contribution that generalized existing notions.
5. Developed the concept of infinitesimal quantities and paved the way for the development of the concept of limits in calculus.
6. Expanded on the problem of whether or not a given set of numbers is discrete.
7. Researched and established conditions for the closure of a given set of points in Euclidean space.
8. Proved theorems on the uniqueness of solutions to certain types of rational equations.

Born 6 February 1612, Paris, France. Died 6 August 1694, Brussels, Spanish Netherlands (now Belgium).
