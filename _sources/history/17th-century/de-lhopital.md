**De L'H么pital** was a French mathematician who wrote the first textbook on calculus, which consisted of the lectures of his teacher Johann Bernoulli.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Published the book titled Analyse des Infiniment Petites pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes in 1696 which laid the foundation for differential calculus and revolutionized mathematics.
2. Developed the notions of the limit of a function and the derivative, unifying the concept of differential calculus.
3. Focused on the study of algebraic equations and the development of a theory of rational functions.
4. He also worked on singular solutions and originated the notions of implicit differentiations.
5. Researched the subject of ordinary differential equations, with particular regards to the speed of a falling body and tangent equations.
6. Discovered the integral rule of calculating the area of a section of a parabolic arch.

Born 1661, Paris, France. Died 2 February 1704, Paris, France.
