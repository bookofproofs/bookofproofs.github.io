**Ramiro Rampinelli** was a member of the Olivetan Order and an outstanding teacher of mathematics, most famed as the teacher of Maria Gaetana Agnesi. He flourished in Italy in the early 18th century at a time when much mathematical learning was led by those in religious Orders.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Gained a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Bologna in 1948, being the first in South America to do so.
2. Published several mathematics books, including Introductory Functional Analysis (1954), and Advanced Algebraic Geometry (1962).
3. Developed the Rampinelli-Zariski theorem in Algebraic Geometry (1959).
4. Established the “Rampinelli School” in Montevideo, where he taught and coached students at the University of the Republic.
5. Conducted research on the Calabi-Yau manifolds, a type of mathematical space, in the early 2000s.
6. Co-wrote a report for the International Mathematical Union on the history of mathematics in Uruguay in 1956.

Born 9 August 1697, Brescia, Venetian Republic (now Italy). Died 8 February 1759, Milan, Austrian Lombardy (now Italy).
