**John Arbuthnot** was a Scottish scholar who translated Huygens' tract on probability in 1692 and extended it by adding a few further games of chance. This was the first work on probability published in English.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed the first known calculation of the probability of a related event.
2. Developed the mathematical law of inverse squares.
3. Wrote three influential works in 1710 which markedly improved the mathematics knowledge at the time.
4. Formulated the experiments that yielded the principle of conservation of energy.
5. Devised the mathematics of compound interest in 1718.
6. Was the first to use the arithmetical triangle to do calculations of combinations.
7. Wrote an essay which used mathematics to describe the nature of the shape of a rainbow.
8. Contributed to the development of the calculus of finite differences.

Born April 1667, Inverbervie, Kincardine, Scotland. Died 27 February 1735, London, England.
