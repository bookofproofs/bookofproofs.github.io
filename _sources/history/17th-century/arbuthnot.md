**John Arbuthnot** was a Scottish scholar who translated Huygens' tract on probability in 1692 and extended it by adding a few further games of chance. This was the first work on probability published in English.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
* Both his parents were associated with the Church, with his father being the minister of Arbuthnott and his mother being the daughter of the minister of Farnell and dean of Brechin.
* Alexander Arbuthnott was well educated having studied at Marischal College, Aberdeen.
* He probably gave his son John a good grounding in Latin and Greek.
* John was the oldest of his parents seven surviving children.
* After Alexander Arbuthnott's wife Margaret died, he remarried Catherine Ochterlony and they had one son George born in 1688 (when John was 21 years old).
* Arbuthnot entered Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1681 where he studied the standard arts course taken by all students at this time.
* Arbuthnot graduated in 1685 and there is no record of what he did in the next six years.
* In fact the next few years were dramatic ones in Scotland, and in particular for the Arbuthnot family.
* Robert Arbuthnot, who like his brother John was a graduate of Marischal College, joined Bonnie Dundee's army and fought against General Hugh Mackay at the Battle of Killiecrankie.
* In August the Scottish resistance was crushed at the Battle of Dunkeld and Robert Arbuthnot fled to France.
* Certainly John did not take part in the military campaign and there is some evidence that he was in Edinburgh studying mathematics with David Gregory.
* In 1690, because of the unrest in Scotland, David Gregory left Edinburgh and went to Oxford and Arbuthnot may have spent time in Oxford.
* In September 1689 Arbuthnot's father, Alexander, refused to sigh an oath to the rulers William and Mary who had been victorious over the Jacobites, and he was dismissed from his parish.
* After he died in 1691 his sons were required to return the session book which John Arbuthnot did in order that his father might be buried.
* However John's request to erect a headstone at his father's grave was only granted with strict conditions as what might be inscribed on the stone and in the circumstances no stone was put up.
* After settling his father's affairs, Arbuthnot went to London where he earned his living giving lessons in mathematics.
* Arbuthnot then became a private tutor to Jeffrey Jeffreys, the son of an important London man.
* They went together to Oxford where once more Arbuthnot was with his friend David Gregory.
* At Oxford Arbuthnot studied medicine privately during 1694-96, then took a medical degree at the University of St Andrews defending his theses on the day that he enrolled on 11 September 1696.
* In 1695 William Woodward published Essay towards a natural history of the Earth and Arbuthnot responded with publishing An examination of Dr Woodward's account two years later.
* After Queen Anne came to the throne on 1702, Arbuthnot gained favour being employed in his capacity as a medic at Court.
* A detailed treaty was proposed in the summer of 1706 and Arbuthnot published a pamphlet A sermon preach'd to the people at the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh on the subject of the union which made clear that its author was a Scot who believed in the economic benefits of a union.
* Arbuthnot continued his scientific work submitting a paper to the Royal Society in 1710 discussing the slight excess of male births over female births in the years from 1629 to 1710.
* In this paper Arbuthnot claims to demonstrate that divine providence, not chance, governs the sex ratio at birth.
* Arbuthnot's main fame, however, rests on his reputation as a wit and on his satirical writings.
* The character in these pamphlets, John Bull, became a symbol of the English character.
* With Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, John Gay and Thomas Parnell he founded the Scriblerus Club in 1713, whose purpose was to satirise bad poetry and pedantry.
* After Queen Anne died on 1 August 1714, despite Arbuthnot attending her in her final illness, he went to France for a while.
* A sign on the A90 in Angus pointing to Arbuthnot's birthplace as well as the village after which the family is named.

Born April 1667, Inverbervie, Kincardine, Scotland. Died 27 February 1735, London, England.
