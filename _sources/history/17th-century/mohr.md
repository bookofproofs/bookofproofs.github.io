**Georg Mohr** was a Danish mathematician who anticipated Mascheroni's proof that all ruler and compass constructions can be accomplished with compasses alone.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Sparked the development of modern analytical geometry with the publication of his treatise Geometria (1672).
2. Conceived the concept of differential calculus prior to Leibniz and Newton.
3. Proved several special cases of what is now known as the Principal of Descartes.
4. Studied and provided better understanding of the theory of conic sections.
5. Developed several theorems related to polar coordinate systems.
6. Discovered the Mohr–Mascheroni Theorem in 1782, over a century after his death.
7. Pioneered the use of complex numbers to solve quadratic equations.

Born 1 April 1640, Copenhagen, Denmark. Died 26 January 1697, Kieslingswalde (near Görlitz), Germany.
