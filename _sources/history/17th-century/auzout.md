**Adrien Auzout ** was a French astronomer who improved measuring instruments.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Made significant advances in the study of atmospheric refraction, including the discovery that a greater amount of refraction is observed when the sun is close to the horizon.
2. Wrote a book on spherical astronomy which included various formulas for the size of the Earth and for the dimensions of the stars.
3. Discovered the method of studying the refraction of light, known as ‘Auzout’s Speculation’.
4. Made numerous developments in conic sections and the calculation of planetary orbits.
5. Constructed preliminary versions of the devices we now commonly refer to as telescopes.
6. Improved the standard of Astronomy in his own time, producing exceptionally accurate predictions of the motions of the planets.
7. Formulated the law of refraction, which states that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence.
8. Developed a method for calculating parabolic curves.
9. He wrote extensively on the study of physicomathematics, including a book on optics which contained several important discoveries.
10. Demonstrated a method for determining the positions of the stars from their sidereal revolutions.

Born 28 January 1622, Rouen, France. Died 23 May1691, Rome (now Italy).
