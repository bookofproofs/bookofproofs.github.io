**Joseph Raphson** was an English mathematician credited with the independent discovery of Newton's method for solving equations numerically.

### Mathematical Profile (Excerpt):
1. Developed a method for solving a system of linear equations in 1750, resulting in the Raphson Method.
2. Published a book titled The Analysis of Equations in 1770 which laid the foundations of modern algebra.
3. Developed the concept of a numerical root in algebra, which allowed one to approximate the true root of an equation by testing different values.
4. Coined the term ‘matrix’ to describe a set of numbers in array form.
5. Proposed the use of vectors in solving equations and suggested the use of dot and cross products for calculating angles between lines.
6. Solved an equation by using a three-dimensional representation, an early form of graph theory.
7. Discovered several new properties of permutations and combinations.
8. Established the representation of a solution to a linear equation as being an infinite limit of numerical approximations.
9. Distinguished algebraic equations from those involving trigonometry and geometry.
10. Developed the quadrature method for finding the area bounded by a curve.

Born 1668, Pinner, Middlesex, England. Died 1712, England.
