The proposition follows immediately from the other [characterization of independent events][bookofproofs$1804], according to which given an event `\(B\)` with `\(0 < p(B) < 1\)`, the event `\(A\)` is independent from `\(B\)` if and only if

`\[p(A)=p(A|B).\]`

By definition of [conditional probability][bookofproofs$428], it follows

`\[p(A)=p(A|B)=\frac{p(A\cap B)}{p(B)}, \]`
which is equivalent to
`\[p(A)\cdot p(B)=p(A\cap B).\]`

Assuming that `\(A\)` is independent from `\(B\)`, like shown above, and in addition assuming `\(0 < p(A) < 1\)`, we can conclude that `\(B\)` is independent from `\(A\)`, for symmetry reasons.
