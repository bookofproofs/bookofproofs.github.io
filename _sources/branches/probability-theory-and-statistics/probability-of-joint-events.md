For any two [events][bookofproofs$857] `\(A\)` and `\(B\)`, the [probability][bookofproofs$858] of the **joint event** `\(A\cap B\)` (i.e. the events `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` happening concurrently), can be calculated by the product of the [conditional probability][bookofproofs$428] `\(p(A|B)\)` and the probability of `\(B\)`. Alternatively, we can calculate it as the product of the conditional probability `\(p(B|A)\)` and the probability of `\(A\)`. Altogether, the following formulas hold: 

`\[p(A\cap B)= p(A|B) \cdot  p(B)=p(B|A)\cdot p(A).\]`
