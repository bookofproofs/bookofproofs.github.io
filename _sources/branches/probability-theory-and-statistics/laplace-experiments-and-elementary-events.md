A **Laplace experiment** is a [random experiment][bookofproofs$857], with the following properties:

* The probability space `\(\Omega=\{\omega_1,\omega_2,\ldots,\omega_n\}\)` is finite. 
* The events `\(\omega_i\)` are **elementary**, which means that they do not consist of other events, i.e. `\(\omega_i\in\Omega\)`, but not `\(\omega_i\subseteq\Omega\)` for all `\(i=1,\ldots, n\)`.
* Each element of has `\(\Omega\)` the same [probability][bookofproofs$858], i.e `\(p(\omega_i)=p=const.\)` for all `\(\omega_i\in\Omega\)`. 

Note, that elementary events are always [mutually exclusive][bookofproofs$859].
