Let `\(B\)` be an [event][bookofproofs$857] with the [probability][bookofproofs$858] `\(0 < p(B) < 1\)`. We call the event `\(A\)` **independent** from `\(B\)`, if the [conditional probability][bookofproofs$428] of `\(A\)` given `\(B\)` and the conditional probability of `\(A\)` given the [complement event][bookofproofs$861] `\(\overline{B}\)` are equal each other:

`\[p(A|B)=p(A|\overline{B}).\]`

Loosely speaking, the frequency of occurrence of `\(A\)` does not depend on whether  `\(B\)` happened, or not.
