The [events][bookofproofs$857] `\(A_i\subseteq \Omega\)` are said to be **mutually exclusive**, if any two of them cannot occur at once, i.e. if `\(A_i\cap A_j\)` is the [impossible event][bookofproofs$183], formally `\[A_i\cap A_j=\emptyset,~~~~~~~~~~( A_i,A_j\subseteq\Omega, i\neq j).\]`

The [events][bookofproofs$857] `\(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\)` are said to be **collectively exhaustive**, if at least one of them must occur, i.e. if the occurrence of any of these events is the [certain event][bookofproofs$183], formally

`\[\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i=\Omega~~~~~~~~~~(I\text{ being a set of indices of all events in }\Omega).\]`

In an experiment with mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive events, exactly one event `\(A_i\)` will occur.
