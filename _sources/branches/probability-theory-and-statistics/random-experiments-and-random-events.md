A **random experiment** is an experiment with the following properties:

* It is known, which outcomes it has, before it takes place, but 
* is is generally unknown, which outcome it will have, until the experiment took place, and
* it is possible to find out, which outcome the experiment had after it took place.

The [set][bookofproofs$550] of all outcomes is called **probability space** and denoted by `\(\Omega\)`.

Any [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(F\subseteq \Omega\)` of outcomes is called a **random event** or just **event**. We denote events, using Latin capital letters `\(A,B,C,\ldots\)`.
