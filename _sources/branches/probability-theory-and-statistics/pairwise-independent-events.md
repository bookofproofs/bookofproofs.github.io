By extending the [characterization of independent events][bookofproofs$1806] from two to `\(n\)` [events][bookofproofs$857] `\(A_1,...,A_n\)`, we call  them **pairwise independent**, if for any pair if indices `\(i,j\in \{1,\ldots,n\}\)`, `\(i\neq j\)`, the [probability of joint event][bookofproofs$1802].
`\[A_i\cap A_j\]`
equals the product of all individual probabilities:

`\[p(A_i\cap A_j)=p(A_i)\cdot p(A_j).\]`
