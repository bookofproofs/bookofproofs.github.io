We first note that

`\[A=(A\cap B)\cup (A\cap \overline B)=(A\cap B)\cup (A\setminus B).\]`

Because the events `\((A\cap B)\)` and `\((A\setminus B)\)` are [mutually exclusive][bookofproofs$859], it follows from the [definition of probability][bookofproofs$858] that 

`\[p(A)=p(A\cap B)+p(A\setminus B),\]`

which gives us the required equation

`\[p(A\setminus B)=p(A)-p(A\cap B).\]`
