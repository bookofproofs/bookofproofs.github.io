Let `\(B\)` be an [event][bookofproofs$857] with the [probability][bookofproofs$858] `\(0 < p(B) < 1\)`. Another event `\(A\)` is independent from `\(B\)`, if any only if the [probability of the joint event][bookofproofs$1802] `\(A\cap B\)` equals the product of the [probabilities][bookofproofs$858] of `\(A\)` and `\(B\)`:

`\[p(A\cap B)=p(A)p(B).\]`

If in addition, `\(0 < p(A) < 1\)`, then `\(B\)` is independent from `\(A\)`.
