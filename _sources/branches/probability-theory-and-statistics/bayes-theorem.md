Given [mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive events][bookofproofs$859] `\(A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n\)` with the probabilities `\(p(A_i) > 0\)` for `\(i=1,2,\ldots,n\)`, and any event `\(B\)` with the probability `\(p(B) > 0\)`, the probabilities of the events `\(A_i\)` given `\(B\)` can be calculated by the formula 

`\[p(A_i|B)=\frac{p(B|A_i)p(A_i)}{p(B)}=\frac{p(B|A_i)p(A_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^np(B|A_i)p(A_i)},\quad\quad i=1,2,\ldots,n.\]`
