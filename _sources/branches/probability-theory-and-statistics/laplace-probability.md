Laplace (1749-1827) used a simple definition of probability, for which the probability `\(p(A)\)` of an event is given by the following formula:

`\[p(A)=\frac rm=\frac{\text{number of cases favorable for }A}{\text{number of all cases}}.\]`

This (classical) definition of probability can only by applied, if we study random experiments fulfilling the following properties:

* The number of possible outcomes of the experiment is finite. 
* Each outcome has the same probability.

This chapter is dedicated to Laplace experiments, i.e. experiments fulfilling these two prerequisites. It turns out that in this special case, probability theory is strongly interconnected to combinatorial properties of finite sets.
