By extending the [characterization of independent events][bookofproofs$1806] from two to `\(n\)` [events][bookofproofs$857] `\(A_1,...,A_n\)`, we call  them **mutually independent**, if for any subset of indices `\(I\subset \{1,\ldots,n\}\)`, the [probability of joint event][bookofproofs$1802].
`\[A_I:=\bigcap_{i\in I} A_i\]`
equals the product of all individual probabilities:

`\[p(A_I)=\prod_{i\in I}p(A_i).\]`
