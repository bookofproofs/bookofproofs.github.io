Given [mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive events][bookofproofs$859] `\(A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n\)` with the probabilities `\(p(A_i) > 0\)` for `\(i=1,2,\ldots,n\)`, the probability of any event `\(B\)` can be calculated by the formula 

`\[p(B)=\sum_{i=1}^np(B|A_i)p(A_i)=p(B|A_1)p(A_1) + p(B|A_2)p(A_2) + \ldots + p(B|A_n)p(A_n).\]`

This formula is called the **law of total probability**.
