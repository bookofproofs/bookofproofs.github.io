Let `\(B\)` be an [event][bookofproofs$857] with the [probability][bookofproofs$858] `\(p(B) > 0\)` and let `\(A\)` be another event. The *conditional probability of `\(A\)` given `\(B\)`* is defined as the quotient of the probability of the events `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` occurring concurrently, and the probability of `\(B\)`, symbolically:
`\[p(A|B) = \frac{p(A \cap B)}{p(B)}\]`
