A **random variable** a [function][bookofproofs$592], which maps every outcome of a [given random experiment][bookofproofs$857] to the [set of real numbers][bookofproofs$1105], formally 
`\[X:\cases{\Omega\mapsto\mathbb R\\A\mapsto X(A)}\]`


If we have an experiment, in which the random variable `\(X\)` took the real value `\(x\)`, then we call `\(x\)` the **realization** of `\(X\)`.

The entirety of all possible realizations of `\(X\)` in the given experiment (formally the image of the function `\(X(\Omega)\)`) is called the **population** of `\(X\)`. A population can be finite, or infinite, depending on whether the `\(\Omega\)` is [finite or infinite][bookofproofs$985].
A **sample** is a finite number of realizations of `\(X\)`. If the number of such realizations is `\(n\)`, we say that we have a **sample of size** `\(n\)`.
