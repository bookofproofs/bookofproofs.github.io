A well-known example of a Laplace experiment is rolling a six-sided dice, for which each rolling a number `\(\omega\in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\)` has the probability of `\(\frac 16\)`.

For the event `\(A\)`="the number of rolled dots is even" we have then `\(p(A)=\frac 36=\frac 12\)`, because there are `\(3\)` even numbers (favorable elementary events) in relation to `\(6\)` events in total.

For the event `\(B\)`="the number of rolled dots is smaller then 5" we have then `\(p(B)=\frac 46=\frac 23\)`, because there are `\(4\)` numbers smaller then `\(5\)` (favorable elementary events) in relation to `\(6\)` events in total.
