Every [probability distribution][bookofproofs$1815] is [monotonically increasing][bookofproofs$282], i.e. for a given [random variable][bookofproofs$1813] `\(X\)` and some real numbers `\(x,y\)` with `\(x < y\)` it follows that the probability of `\(X\)` taking a realization smaller or equal `\(x\)` is smaller or equal to the probability of `\(X\)` taking a realization smaller or equal `\(y\)`, formally:

`\[x < y\Longrightarrow p(X \le x)\le p(X\le y).\]`

Moreover, the limits of the probability distribution, as `\(x\)` [tends to infinity][bookofproofs$1345], are

`\[\lim_{x\to-\infty}p(X\le x)=0\quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad\lim_{x\to+\infty}p(X\le x)=1.\]`
