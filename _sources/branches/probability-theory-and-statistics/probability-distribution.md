Let `\(X\)` be a [random variable][bookofproofs$1813] of a [given random experiment][bookofproofs$857]. Assume, we have a random experiment, for which the [probability of the event][bookofproofs$858].
> "`$X$` has a [realization][bookofproofs$1813] [less or equal][bookofproofs$1107] a given real number `\(x\)`", 

i.e. the probability `$p(X \le x)$` exists for all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$x\in\mathbb R.$` Then we call the [function][bookofproofs$592].
`$$f:=\cases{\mathbb R\mapsto[0,1]\\x\mapsto p(X\le x)}\quad\quad\text{for all }x\in\mathbb R$$`

the **probability distribution** of the random variable `$X.$`
