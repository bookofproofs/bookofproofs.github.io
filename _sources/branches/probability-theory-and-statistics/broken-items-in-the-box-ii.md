There are `\(10\)` items in a box. `\(4\)` out of the `\(10\)` items are broken. Assume that drawing the items from the box is a [Laplace experiment][bookofproofs$973].
What is the probability that after drawing `\(2\)` items from the box without replacement, we will have drawn `\(0\)`, `\(1\)` or `\(2\)` broken items?
