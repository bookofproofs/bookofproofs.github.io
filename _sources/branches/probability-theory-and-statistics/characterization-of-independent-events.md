Let `\(B\)` be an [event][bookofproofs$857] with the [probability][bookofproofs$858] `\(0 < p(B) < 1\)`. Another event `\(A\)` is independent from `\(B\)`, if any only if the [probability][bookofproofs$858] of `\(A\)` equals the [conditional probability][bookofproofs$428] of `\(A\)` given `\(B\)`:

`\[p(A)=p(A|B).\]`

Loosely speaking, the frequency of occurrence of `\(A\)` does not change, if `\(B\)` also happened.
