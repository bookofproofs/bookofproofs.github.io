Let `\(X\)` be a [random variable][bookofproofs$1813] of a [given random experiment][bookofproofs$857]. Assume, we have a random experiment, for which the [probability of the event][bookofproofs$858].
> [`\(X\)` has a "realization][bookofproofs$1813] [equal][bookofproofs$1107] a given real number `\(x\)`", 

i.e. the probability `\(p(X = x)\)` exists for all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`. 

Then we call the [function][bookofproofs$592].
`\[f:=\cases{\mathbb R\mapsto[0,1]\\x\mapsto p(X=x)}\quad\quad\text{for all }x\in\mathbb R\]`

the **probability mass function** (or  **pmf**) of the random variable `\(X\)`.
