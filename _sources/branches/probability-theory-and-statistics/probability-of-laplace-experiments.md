Let `\(\Omega=\{\omega_1,\omega_2,\ldots,\omega_n\}\)` be the finite probability space of a given [Laplace experiment][bookofproofs$973]. Then 

`\[p(\omega_i)=\frac 1n~~~~~~~~~~~~(i=1,\ldots n).\]`

For any event `\(A\subseteq\Omega\)`, we have

`\[p(A)=\frac{\text{# possible outcomes of }A}{\text{# possible outcomes of }\Omega}=\frac {|A|}{|\Omega|}.\]`
