A **probability** is a [function][bookofproofs$592] of the [probability space][bookofproofs$857] to [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] (i.e. `\(p:\Omega\mapsto \mathbb R\)`), fulfilling the following axioms:

> (1)  For all `\(A\subseteq \Omega\)`, the [probability of any event is a non-negative real number][bookofproofs$872]: 
`\[p(A)\ge 0.\]` 

> (2)  The [probability of the certain event][bookofproofs$871] (i.e. the event that any event from the considered probability space occurs) equals `\(1\)`.
`\[p(\Omega)=1\]`

> (3)  The probability of the union event (i.e. the event that any individual event occurs) of [countably many][bookofproofs$772] events `\(A_1,A_2,\ldots\in\Omega \)`, which are [mutually exclusive][bookofproofs$859], equals [the sum of their individual probabilities][bookofproofs$873]: `\[p(A_1\cup \ldots\cup A_n\cup\ldots)=p(A_1)+\ldots +p(A_n)+\ldots\]`.
