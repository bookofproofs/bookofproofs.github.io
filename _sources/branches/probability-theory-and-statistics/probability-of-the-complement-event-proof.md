Because the [events][bookofproofs$857] `\(A\)` and `\(\overline A\)` are [collectively exhaustive][bookofproofs$859], we have `\(\Omega=A\cup \overline A\)`. Because they are also [mutually exclusive][bookofproofs$859], (i.e. `\(A\cap \overline A=\emptyset\)`), it follows from the [definition of probability][bookofproofs$858] that

`\[1=p(\Omega)=p(A\cup \overline A)=p(A)+p(\overline A),\]`
which is equivalent to
`\[p(\overline A)=1-p(A).\]`
