A **Bernoulli experiment** has the following properties:

* The [experiment][bookofproofs$857] is repeated `\(n\)` times. 
* In each of the `\(n\)` experiments, either the event `\(A\)` occurs, or not (i.e. its complement `\(\overline A\)` occurs).
* There is a constant probability `\(p\)` for the event `\(A_i\)` to have in the `\(i\)`-th experiment the outcome `\(A\)`, i.e. `\(p(A_i)=p(A)=const\)` for all `\(i\)`
* The experiments `\(A_1,\ldots, A_n\)` are [mutually independent][bookofproofs$1808].
