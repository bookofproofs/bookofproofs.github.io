A [random experiment][bookofproofs$857], in which the event `\(A\)` can occur, is repeated `\(n\ge 1\)` times. 

> The **absolute frequency** (sometimes called **cumulative frequency**) of `\(A\)` is the [number][bookofproofs$718] `\(f_n(A)\)` of times we observed the event `\(A\)` while the experiment was repeated `\(n\ge 1\)` times. Note that `\(0\le f_n(A)\le n\)`.  

> The [rational number][bookofproofs$1033] `\(F_n(A):=f_n(A)/n\)` is called the **relative frequency** of `\(A\)`.
