The **average velocity** is the ratio between the displacement of an object in [space][bookofproofs$1206] `\(\mathbb R^n\)` (e.g. for `\(n=3\)`), given by the difference of the departure and destination point `\(\Delta x:=x_2-x_1\)`, and the duration of its movement, given by the difference of the departure and destination time `\(\Delta t:=t_2-t_1\)`: 
`\[\bar {v}=\frac{\text{destination point}-\text{departure point}}{\text{destination time}-\text{departure time}}=\frac {\Delta x}{\Delta t}.\]`

For a [time interval][bookofproofs$1153] `\(I\subset \mathbb R\)`, it is convenient to model the position of the object in space `\(x\)` as a function of time `\(t\)`: `\[t:\cases{I\to\mathbb R^n\\t\to x(t),}\]` called a [curve][bookofproofs$1208] (or the **trajectory function**) of the object in space. At the departure time `\(t\in I\)`, the object is located at the "departure" position `\(x(t)\)`. After the time period `\(h > 0\)` with `\(t+h\in I\)`, the object will move to the position `\(x(t+h)\)`. In this case, the average velocity of the object is given by  

`\[\bar {v}=\frac {x(t+h)-x(t)}{h}.\]`
