Let `\(I\subset \mathbb R\)` be a [time interval][bookofproofs$1153], `\(\mathbb R^n\)` (e.g. for `\(n=3\)`) be the [`\(n\)`-dimensional real vector space][bookofproofs$1206] and let `\(x:I\to \mathbb R^n\)` by [trajectory function][bookofproofs$6309] of some object in this space, which is [differentiable][bookofproofs$6247] at a given point in time `\(t\in I\)`. Then the derivative
`\[v(t):=\operatorname {lim} _{h\rightarrow 0}\,{\frac {x(t+h)-x(t)}{h}}=\dot x(t)\]`
is called the **instantaneous velocity** of the object at the time `\(t\)`.
