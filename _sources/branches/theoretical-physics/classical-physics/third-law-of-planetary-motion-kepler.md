According to the [first law][bookofproofs$6304], the planets `\(P_1, P_2,\ldots\)` have orbits being [ellipses][bookofproofs$6300]. Let `\(a_1,a_2,\ldots\)` denote the major axes of the respective ellipses and let `\(t_1,t_2,\ldots\)` denote the time intervals each planet needs to complete its orbit (orbital periods). Then the the following ratios are equal to a constant `\(C\)`, called the **Keplerian constant**:

`\[\frac{a_1^3}{t_1^2}=\frac{a_2^3}{t_2^2}=\ldots=C\]`
