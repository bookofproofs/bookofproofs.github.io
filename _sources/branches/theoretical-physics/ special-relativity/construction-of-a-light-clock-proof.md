We will prove that the construction of a light clock is (theoretically) possible in any inertial reference frame.

Let `\(\mathcal I\)` be a given [inertial reference frame][bookofproofs$6295].
By the [principle of relativity][bookofproofs$6273], the time unit of one [second][bookofproofs$6273] `\(s\)` is well-defined in `\(\mathcal I\)`.

By the [principle of the constancy of light speed][bookofproofs$6272], the speed of light in vacuum in `\(\mathcal I\)` is constant. Let this constant be denoted by `\(c\)`. 

By the definition of `\(s\)`, and making use of the principle of the constancy of light speed once again, the definition of a distance unit of one [meter][bookofproofs$6274] `\(m\)` is also well-defined in `\(\mathcal I\)`, from which it follows that 
 `\[c=299\,792\,458\frac ms.\]` 
 

Since `\(\mathcal I\)` has a metric `\(||~||\)` induced by the [`\(3\)`-dimensional normed vector space][bookofproofs$846] `\((V_{\mathbb R},||~||)\)` over the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$6194] `\(\mathbb R\)`, let `\(d\)` be the number of meters (i.e. the [distance][bookofproofs$847]), at which we position two mirrors apart in `\(\mathcal I\)`. Since any light particle would bounce in `\(\mathcal I\)` between these to mirrors at a constant speed `\(c\)`, it follows that the "tick duration" of such a **light clock** in `\(\mathcal I\)` equals

`\[\operatorname{tick duration}:=\frac dc.\]`
