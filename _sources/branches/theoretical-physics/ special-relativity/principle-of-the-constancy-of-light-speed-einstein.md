Motivated by the result of the [Michelson-Morley experiment][bookofproofs$6270], "Albert Einstein":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/albert-einstein/ formulated the following **principle of the constancy of light speed**:

> Any ray of light moves in the “stationary” system of co-ordinates with the determined velocity `\(c\)`, whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a moving body.

A more common formulation of this principle is the following:

> The speed of light is constant in vacuum in all [inertial reference frames][bookofproofs$6295] (i.e. it is independent from the movement of the inertial reference frame or the observer in it).
