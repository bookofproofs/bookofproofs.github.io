Let `\(\mathcal R=(\mathbb R,V_{\mathbb R},v)\)` be the [`\(3\)`-dimensional][bookofproofs$6281] [affine space][bookofproofs$6277] with the associated [normed vector space][bookofproofs$846] `\((V_{\mathbb R},||~||)\)` over the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$6194] `\(\mathbb R\)`. Let a [frame of reference][bookofproofs$6294] `\(\mathcal I\subset \mathcal R\)` contain a massive body `\(B\)` and let the measurement of its **mass** be `\(m_0\)`. The frame of reference `\(\mathcal I\)` is called 

* **inertial**, if consecutive measurements `\(i=1,2,\ldots\)` of the mass of `\(B\)` will produce a sequence of measurement values `\((m_i)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` deviating from `\(m_0\)` by less than a fixed (and for the observer negligible error) `\(\epsilon > 0\)`:
`\[|m_0-m_i| < \epsilon\quad i=1,2,\ldots,\]`
* otherwise `\(I\)` is called *non-inertial*, i.e. at least one measurement value `\(m_j\)` will deviate from the error 
`\[\exists j \ge 1~:~|m_0-m_j|\ge \epsilon.\]`
