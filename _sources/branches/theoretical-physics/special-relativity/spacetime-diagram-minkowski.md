The **spacetime diagram** provides an illustration of the properties of space and time in the special relativity. For simplification in spacetime diagram, usually only events in a universe of one space dimension (horizontal axis, showing the distance) and one time dimension (vertical axis, showing the time difference) are considered. 
It was developed by [Hermann Minkowski](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Minkowski/) (1864 - 1909).
