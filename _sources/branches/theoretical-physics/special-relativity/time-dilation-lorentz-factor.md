Let `\(\mathcal I_1\)` and `\(\mathcal I_2\)` be two [inertial frames of reference][bookofproofs$6295] moving relatively to each other with the constant speed `\(v\)` obeying the inequation `\(0\le v < c\)`, where `\(c\)` denotes the [constant][bookofproofs$6272] speed of light[^1]. If an observer inside the reference frame `\(\mathcal I_1\)` measures the time `\(t_1\)` elapsed in `\(\mathcal I_1\)` and compares it to the time `\(t_2\)` elapsed he observes in the inertial frame of reference `\(\mathcal I_2\)`, then both times elapsed will show a difference called **time dilation**, which is given by the formula

`\[t_1=t_2\cdot \gamma.\]`

The factor  `\[\gamma:=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}},\quad\quad (0\le v < c)\]`

is called the **Lorentz factor**[^2].

[^1]: If both inertial frames of reference are in a vacuum, this speed equals `\(c=299\,792\,458~m/s.\)`

[^2]: Named so after <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lorentz/">Hendrik Antoon Lorentz</a> (1853 - 1928).
