Let `\(\mathcal R=(\mathbb R,V_{\mathbb R},v)\)` be the [`\(3\)`-dimensional][bookofproofs$6281] [affine space][bookofproofs$6277] with the associated [normed vector space][bookofproofs$846] `\((V_{\mathbb R},||~||)\)` over the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$6194] `\(\mathbb R\)`. Any non-empty [affine bounded subset][bookofproofs$6293] `\(\mathcal I\subset\mathcal R\)` is also called a **frame of reference**.

### Practical Consequences from this Definition

Please note that any frame of reference `\(\mathcal I\)` has a norm `\(||~||\)` induced by the associated vector space, i.e. we can measure the distance between any two points `\(P,Q\in\mathcal I\)` by measuring the norm of the corresponding vector 
`\[||\overrightarrow{PQ}||\ge 0\in\mathbb R.\]`

Please also note that the boundedness of `\(\mathcal I\)` is chosen in the definition for technical reasons to avoid the necessity to deal with infinite (unbounded) frames of reference to model the physics of real world.

### Examples

Frames of reference can be:

* `\(0\)` dimensional (e.g. a particle)
* `\(1\)` dimensional (e.g. being a gravitational model of a binary star system)
* `\(2\)` dimensional (e.g. a (bounded) surface of the Earth small enough to ignore the Earths curvature)
* `\(3\)` dimensional (e.g. a vehicle, a spaceship, a [light clock][bookofproofs$6275], etc.)
