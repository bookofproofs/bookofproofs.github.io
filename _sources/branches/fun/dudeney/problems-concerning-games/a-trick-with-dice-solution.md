All you have to do is to deduct `$250$` from the result given, and the three figures in the answer will be the three points thrown with the dice. Thus, in the throw we gave, the number given would be `$386;$` and when we deduct `$250$` we get `$136,$` from which we know that the throws were `$1,$` `$3,$` and `$6.$`

The process merely consists in giving `$100a + 10b + c + 250,$` where `$a, b,$` and `$c$` represent the three throws. The result is obvious.
