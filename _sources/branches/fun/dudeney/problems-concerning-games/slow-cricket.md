In the recent county match between Wessex and Nincomshire, the former team was at the wickets all day, the last man being put out a few minutes before the time for drawing stumps. The play was so slow that most of the spectators were fast asleep, and, on being awakened by one of the officials clearing the ground, we learnt that two men had been put out leg-before-wicket for a combined score of 19 runs; four men were caught for a combined score or `$17$` runs; one man was run out for a duck's egg; and the others were all bowled for `$3$` runs each. There were no extras. We were not told which of the men was the captain, but he made exactly `$15$` more than the average of his team. What was the captain's score?
