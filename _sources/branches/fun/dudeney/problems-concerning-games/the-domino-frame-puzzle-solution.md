The illustration is a solution. It will be found that all four sides of the frame add up `$44.$` The sum of the pips on all the dominoes is `$168,$` and if we wish to make the sides sum to `$44,$` we must take care that the four corners sum to `$8,$` because these corners are counted twice, and `$168$` added to `$8$` will equal `$4$` times `$44,$` which is necessary. There are many different solutions. Even in the example given certain interchanges are possible to produce different arrangements. For example, on the left-hand side the string of dominoes from `$2—2$` down to `$3—2$` may be reversed, or from `$2—6$` to `$3—2,$` or from `$3—0$` to `$5—3.$` Also, on the right-hand side, we may reverse from `$4—3$` to `$1—4.$` These changes will not affect the correctness of the solution.
