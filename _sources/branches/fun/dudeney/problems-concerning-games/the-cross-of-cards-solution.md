There are eighteen fundamental arrangements, as follows, where I only give the numbers in the horizontal bar, since the remainder must naturally fall into their places.
`$$\begin{array}{ccccc}
5&6& 1 &7& 4\\
3&5& 1 &6& 8\\
3&4& 1 &7& 8\\
2&5& 1 &7& 8\\
2&5& 3 &6& 8\\
1&5& 3 &7& 8\\
2&4& 3 &7& 8\\
1&4& 5 &7& 8\\
2&3& 5 &7& 8\\
2&4& 5 &6& 8\\
3&4& 5 &6& 7\\
1&4& 7 &6& 8\\
2 &3& 7 &6& 8\\
2&4& 7 &5& 8\\
3&4& 9 &5& 6\\
2&4& 9 &5& 7\\
1&4&9 &6& 7\\
2 &3&9 &6&7\\
\end{array}$$`
It will be noticed that there must always be an odd number in the center, that there are four ways each of adding up `$23,$` `$25,$` and `$27,$` but only three ways each of summing to `$24$` and `$26.$`
