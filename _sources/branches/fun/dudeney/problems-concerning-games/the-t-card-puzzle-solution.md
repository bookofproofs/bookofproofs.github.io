If we remove the ace, the remaining cards may be divided into two groups (each adding up alike) in four ways; if we remove `$3,$` there are three ways; if `$5,$` there are four ways; if `$7,$` there are three ways; and if we remove `$9,$` there are four ways of making two equal groups. There are thus eighteen different ways of grouping, and if we take any one of these and keep the odd card (that I have called "removed") at the head of the column, then one set of numbers can be varied in order in twenty-four ways in the column and the other four twenty-four ways in the horizontal, or together they may be varied in `$24 \times 24 = 576$` ways. And as there are eighteen such cases, we multiply this number by `$18$` and get `$10,368,$` the correct number of ways of placing the cards. As this number includes the reflections, we must divide by `$2,$` but we have also to remember that every horizontal row can change places with a vertical row, necessitating our multiplying by `$2;$` so one operation cancels the other.
