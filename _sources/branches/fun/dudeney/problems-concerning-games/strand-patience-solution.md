The reader may find a solution quite easy in a little over `$200$` moves, but, surprising as it may at first appear, not more than `$62$` moves are required. Here is the play: By "4 C up" I mean a transfer of the `$4$` of clubs with all the cards that rest on it. 

* `$1 D$` on space, 
* `$2 S$` on space, 
* `$3 D$` on space, 
* `$2 S$` on `$3 D,$` 
* `$1 H$` on `$2 S,$`
* `$2 C$` on space, 
* `$1 D$` on `$2 C,$` 
* `$4 S$` on space, 
* `$3 H$` on `$4 S$` ($9$ moves so far), 
* `$2 S$` up on `$3 H$` ($3$ moves), 
* `$5 H$` and `$5 D$` exchanged, and 
* `$4 C$` on `$5 D$` ($6$ moves), 
* `$3 D$` on `$4 C$` `$(1),$`
* `$6 S$` (with `$5 H$`) on space `$(3),$` 
* `$4 C$` up on `$5 H$` `$(3),$` 
* `$2 C$` up on `$3 D$` `$(3),$` 
* `$7 D$` on space `$(1),$` 
* `$6 C$` up on `$7 D$` `$(3),$` 
* `$8 S$` on space `$(1),$` 
* `$7 H$` on `$8 S$` `$(1),$`
* `$8 C$` on `$9 D$` `$(1),$` 
* `$7 H$` on `$8 C$` `$(1),$` 
* `$8 S$` on `$9 H$` `$(1),$` 
* `$7 H$` on `$8 S$` `$(1),$` 
* `$7 D$` up on `$8 C$` `$(5),$` 
* `$4 C$` up on `$5 D$` `$(9),$` 
* `$6 S$` up on `$7 H$` `$(3),$` 
* `$4 S$` up on `$5 H (7) = 62$` moves in all. 

This is my record; perhaps the reader can beat it.
