Here is a neat little trick with three dice. I ask you to throw the dice without my seeing them. Then I tell you to multiply the points of the first die by `$2$` and add `$5;$` then multiply the result by `$5$` and add the points of the second die; then multiply the result by `$10$` and add the points of the third die. You then give me the total, and I can at once tell you the points thrown with the three dice. How do I do it? As an example, if you threw `$1, 3,$` and `$6,$` as in the illustration, the result you would give me would be `$386,$` from which I could at once say what you had thrown.
