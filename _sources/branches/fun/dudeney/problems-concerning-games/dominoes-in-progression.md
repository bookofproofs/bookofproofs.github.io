It will be seen that I have played six dominoes, in the illustration, in accordance with the ordinary rules of the game, `$4$` against `$4,$` `$1$` against `$1,$` and so on, and yet the sum of the spots on the successive dominoes, `$4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,$` are in arithmetical progression; that is, the numbers taken in order have a common difference of `$1.$` In how many different ways may we play six dominoes, from an ordinary box of twenty-eight, so that the numbers on them may lie in arithmetical progression? We must always play from left to right, and numbers in decreasing arithmetical progression (such as `$9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4)$` are not admissible.
