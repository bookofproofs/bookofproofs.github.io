The captain must have been "not out" and scored `$21.$` Thus:—


`$2$` men (each lbw) | `$19$`
:------------- |:-------------
 `$4$` men (each caught)| `$17$`
 `$1$` man (run out)| `$0$`
 `$3$` men (each bowled)| `$9$`
 `$1$` man (captain — not out)| `$21$`
 Total `$11$`| Total `$66$`

The captain thus scored exactly `$15$` more than the average of the team. The "others" who were bowled could only refer to three men, as the eleventh man would be "not out." The reader can discover for himself why the captain must have been that eleventh man. It would not necessarily follow with any figures.
