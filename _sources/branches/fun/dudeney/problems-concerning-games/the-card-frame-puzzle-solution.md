The sum of all the pips on the ten cards is `$55.$` Suppose we are trying to get `$14$` pips on every side. Then `$4$` times `$14$` is `$56.$` But each of the four corner cards is added in twice so that `$55$` deducted from `$56,$` or `$1,$` must represent the sum of the four corner cards. This is clearly impossible; therefore `$14$` is also impossible. But suppose we came to trying `$18.$` Then `$4$` times `$18$` is `$72,$` and if we deduct `$55$` we get `$17$` as the sum of the corners. We need then only try different arrangements with the four corners always summing to `$17,$` and we soon discover the following solution:—

The final trials are very limited in number, and must with a little judgment either bring us to a correct solution or satisfy us that a solution is impossible under the conditions we are attempting. The two center cards on the upright sides can, of course, always be interchanged, but I do not call these different solutions. If you reflect in a mirror you get another arrangement, which also is not considered different. In the answer given, however, we may exchange the `$5$` with the `$8$` and the `$4$` with the `$1.$` This is a different solution. There are two solutions with `$18,$` four with `$19,$` two with `$20,$` and two with `$22$` — ten arrangements in all. Readers may like to find all these for themselves.
