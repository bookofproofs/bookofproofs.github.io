It will be seen in the illustration that the full set of twenty-eight dominoes is arranged in the form of a square frame, with `$6$` against `$6,$` `$2$` against `$2,$` blank against blank, and so on, as in the game. It will be found that the pips in the top row and left-hand column both add up `$44.$` The pips in the other two sides sum to `$59$` and `$32$` respectively. The puzzle is to rearrange the dominoes in the same form so that all of the four sides shall sum to `$44.$` Remember that the dominoes must be correctly placed one against another as in the game.
