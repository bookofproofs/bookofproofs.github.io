In the illustration eighteen matches are shown arranged so that they enclose two spaces, one just twice as large as the other. Can you rearrange them 

1. so as to enclose two four-sided spaces, one exactly three times as large as the other, and 
1. so as to enclose two five-sided spaces, one exactly three times as large as the other? 

All the eighteen matches must be fairly used in each case; the two spaces must be quite detached, and there must be no loose ends or duplicated matches.
