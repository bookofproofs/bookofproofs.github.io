There are some curious facts concerning the movements of wheels that are apt to perplex the novice. For example: when a railway train is traveling from London to Crewe certain parts of the train at any given moment are actually moving from Crewe towards London. Can you indicate those parts? It seems absurd that parts of the same train can at any time travel in opposite directions, but such is the case.

In the accompanying illustration, we have two wheels. The lower one is supposed to be fixed and the upper one running around it in the direction of the arrows. Now, how many times does the upper wheel turn on its own axis in making a complete revolution of the other wheel? Do not be in a hurry with your answer, or you are almost certain to be wrong. Experiment with two pennies on the table and the correct answer will surprise you when you succeed in seeing it.
