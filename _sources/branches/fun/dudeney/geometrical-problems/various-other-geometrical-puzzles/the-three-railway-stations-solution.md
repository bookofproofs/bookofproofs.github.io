The three stations form a triangle, with sides `$13,$` `$14,$` and `$15$` miles. Make the `$14$` side the base; then the height of the triangle is `$12$` and the area `$84.$` Multiply the three sides together and divide by four times the area. The result is eight miles and one-eighth, the distance required.
