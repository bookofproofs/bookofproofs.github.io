1. The easiest way is to arrange the eighteen matches as in Diagrams `$1$` and `$2,$` making the length of the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] `$AB$` equal to a match and a half. Then, if the matches are an inch in length, Fig. `$1$` contains two square inches and Fig. `$2$` contains six square inches â€” `$4 \times 1\frac 12.$` 
1. The second case is a little more difficult to solve. The solution is given in Figs. `$3$` and `$4.$` For the purpose of construction, place matches temporarily on the dotted lines. Then it will be seen that as `$3$` contains five equal equilateral triangles and `$4$` contains fifteen similar triangles, one figure is three times as large as the other, and exactly eighteen matches are used.
