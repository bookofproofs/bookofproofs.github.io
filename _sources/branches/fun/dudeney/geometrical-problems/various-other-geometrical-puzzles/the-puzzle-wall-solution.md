The answer given in all the old books is that shown in Fig. `$1,$` where the curved wall shuts out the cottages from access to the lake. But in seeking the direction for the "shortest possible" wall most readers to-day, remembering that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, will adopt the method shown in Fig. `$2.$` This is certainly an improvement, yet the correct answer is really that indicated in Fig. `$3.$` A measurement of the lines will show that there is a considerable saving of length in this wall.
