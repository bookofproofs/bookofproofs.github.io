Draw a straight line, as shown in the diagram, from the milking-stool perpendicular to the near bank of the river, and continue it to the point `$A,$` which is the same distance from that bank as the stool. If you now draw the straight line from `$A$` to the door of the dairy, it will cut the river at `$B.$` Then the shortest route will be from the stool to `$B$` and thence to the door. Obviously, the shortest distance from `$A$` to the door is the straight line, and as the distance from the stool to any point of the river is the same as from `$A$` to that point, the correctness of the solution will probably appeal to every reader without any acquaintance with geometry.
