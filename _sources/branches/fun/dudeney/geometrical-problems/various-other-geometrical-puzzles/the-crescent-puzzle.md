Here is an easy geometrical puzzle. The crescent is formed by two circles, and `$C$` is the center of the larger [circle][bookofproofs$690] The width of the crescent between `$B$` and `$D$` is `$9$` inches and between `$E$` and `$F$` `$5$` inches. What are the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of the two circles?
