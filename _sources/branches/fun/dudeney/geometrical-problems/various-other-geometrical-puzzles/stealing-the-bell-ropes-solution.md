Whenever we have one side `$a$` of a [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431], and know the difference between the second side and the hypotenuse (which difference we will call `$b$`), then the length of the hypotenuse will be

`$$\frac{a^2}{2b} + \frac b2.$$`

In the case of our puzzle, this will be

`$$\left(\frac{48 \times 48}6  + 1 \frac 12\right)\text{ in. } = 32 \text{ ft. } 1\frac 12 \text{ in. },$$`

which is the length of the rope.
