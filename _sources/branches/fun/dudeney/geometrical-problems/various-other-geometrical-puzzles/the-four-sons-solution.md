The diagram shows the most equitable division of the land possible, "so that each son shall receive land of exactly the same area and exactly similar in shape," and so that each shall have access to the well in the center without trespass on another's land. The conditions do not require that each son's land shall be in one piece, but it is necessary that the two portions assigned to an individual should be kept apart, or two adjoining portions might be held to be one piece, in which case the condition as to shape would have to be broken. At present, there is only one shape for each piece of land â€” half a square divided diagonally. And  `$A, B, C,$` and `$D$` can each reach their land from the outside, and have each equal access to the well in the center.
