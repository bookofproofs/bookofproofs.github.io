This problem is quite simple if properly attacked. Let us suppose the triangle `$ABC$` to represent our half-acre field, and the shaded portion to be the quarter-acre over which the goat will graze when tethered to the corner `$C.$` Now, as six equal [equilateral triangles][bookofproofs$688] placed together will form a regular [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448], as shown, it is evident that the shaded pasture is just one-sixth of the complete area of a circle. Therefore all we require is the [radius][bookofproofs$690] ($CD$) of a circle containing six quarter-acres or `$1\frac 12$` acres, which is equal to `$9,408,960$` square inches. As we only want our answer "to the nearest inch," it is sufficiently exact for our purpose if we assume that as `$1$` is to `$3.1416,$` so is the diameter of a circle to its circumference. If therefore, we divide the last number I gave by `$3.1416,$` and extract the square root, we find that `$1,731$` inches, or `$48$` yards `$3$` inches, is the required length of the tether "to the nearest inch."
