Referring to the original diagram, let `$AC$` be `$x,$` let `$CD$` be `$x - 9,$` and let `$EC$` be `$x - 5.$` Then `$x - 5$` is a [mean proportional][bookofproofs$1999] between `$x - 9$` and `$x,$` from which we find that `$x$` equals `$25.$` Therefore the diameters are `$50$` in. and `$41$` in. respectively.
