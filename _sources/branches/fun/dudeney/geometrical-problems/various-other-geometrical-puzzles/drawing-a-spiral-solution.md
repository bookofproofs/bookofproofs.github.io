Make a fold in the paper, as shown by the dotted line in the illustration. Then, taking any two points, as `$A$` and `$B,$` describe semicircles on the line alternately from the centers `$B$` and `$A,$` being careful to make the ends join, and the thing is done. Of course, this is not a true spiral, but the puzzle was to produce the particular spiral that was shown, and that was drawn in this simple manner.
