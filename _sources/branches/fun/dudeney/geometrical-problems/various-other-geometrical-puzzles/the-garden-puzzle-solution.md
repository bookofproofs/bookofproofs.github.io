Half the sum of the four sides is `$144.$` From this deduct in turn the four sides, and we get `$64,$` `$99,$` `$44,$` and `$81.$` Multiply these together, and we have as the result the square of `$4,752.$` Therefore the garden contained `$4,752$` square yards. Of course the tree being equidistant from the four corners shows that the garden is a quadrilateral that may be inscribed in a circle.
