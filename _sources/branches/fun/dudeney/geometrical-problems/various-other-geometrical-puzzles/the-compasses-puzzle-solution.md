Let `$AB$` in the following diagram be the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] With the centers `$A$` and `$B$` and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$` describe the two circles. Mark off `$DE$` and `$EF$` equal to `$AD.$` With the centers `$A$` and `$F$` and radius `$DF$` describe arcs intersecting at `$G.$` With the centers `$A$` and `$B$` and distance `$BG$` describe arcs `$GHK$` and `$N.$` Make `$HK$` equal to `$AB$` and `$HL$` equal to `$HB.$` Then with centres `$K$` and `$L$` and radius `$AB$` describe arcs intersecting at `$I.$` Make `$BM$` equal to `$BI$`. Finally, with the center `$M$` and radius `$MB$` cut the line in `$C,$` and the point `$C$` is the required middle of the line `$AB.$` For greater exactitude you can mark off `$R$` from `$A$` (as you did `$M$` from `$B$`), and from `$R$` describe another arc at `$C.$` This also solves the problem, to find a point midway between two given points without the straight line.

I will put the young geometer in the way of a rigid proof. First prove that twice the square of the line `$AB$` equals the square of the distance BG, from which it follows that `$HABN$` are the four corners of a square. To prove that `$I$` is the center of this square, draw a line from `$H$` to `$P$` through `$QIB$` and continue the arc `$HK$` to `$P.$` Then, conceiving the necessary lines to be drawn, the angle `$HKP,$` being in a semicircle, is a right angle. Let fall the perpendicular `$KQ,$` and by similar triangles, and from the fact that `$HKI$` is an isosceles triangle by the construction, it can be proved that `$HI$` is half of `$HB.$` We can similarly prove that `$C$` is the center of the square of which `$AIB$` are three corners.

I am aware that this is not the simplest possible solution.
