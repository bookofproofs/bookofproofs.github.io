As the flag measures `$4$` ft. by `$3$` ft., the length of the diagonal (from corner to corner) is `$5$` ft. All you need do is to deduct half the length of this diagonal ($2\frac 12$ ft.) from a quarter of the distance all around the edge of the flag ($3\frac 12$ ft.) â€” a quarter of `$14$` ft. The difference ($1$ ft.) is the required width of the arm of the red cross. The area of the cross will then be the same as that of the white ground.
