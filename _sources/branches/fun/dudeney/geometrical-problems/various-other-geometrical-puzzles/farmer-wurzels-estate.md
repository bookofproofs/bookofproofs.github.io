I will now present another land problem. The demonstration of the answer that I shall give will, I think, be found both interesting and easy of comprehension.

![q190](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/dudeney/q190.png?raw=true)

Farmer Wurzel owned the three square fields shown in the annexed plan, containing respectively `$18,$` `$20,$` and `$26$` acres. In order to get a ring-fence around his property, he bought the four intervening triangular fields. The puzzle is to discover what was then the whole area of his estate.
