I was on a visit to one of the large towns of Yorkshire. While walking to the railway station on the day of my departure a man thrust a hand-bill upon me, and I took this into the railway carriage and read it at my leisure. It informed me that three Yorkshire neighboring estates were to be offered for sale. Each estate was square in shape, and they joined one another at their corners, just as shown in the diagram. Estate `$A$` contains exactly `$370$` acres, `$B$` contains `$116$` acres, and `$C$` `$74$` acres.

Now, the little triangular bit of land enclosed by the three square estates was not offered for sale, and, for no reason, in particular, I became curious as to the area of that piece. How many acres did it contain?
