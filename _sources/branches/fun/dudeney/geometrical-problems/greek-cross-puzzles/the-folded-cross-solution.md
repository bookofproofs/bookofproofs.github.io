First, fold the cross along the dotted line `$A B$` in Fig. `$1.$` You then have it in the form shown in Fig. `$2.$`

Next, fold it along the dotted line `$C D$` (where `$D$` is, of course, the center of the cross), and you get the form shown in Fig. `$3.$` Now take your scissors and cut from `$G$` to `$F,$` and the four pieces, all of the same size and shape, will fit together and form a square, as shown in Fig. `$4.$`
