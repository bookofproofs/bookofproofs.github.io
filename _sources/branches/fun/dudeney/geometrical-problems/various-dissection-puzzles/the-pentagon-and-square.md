I wonder how many of my readers, amongst those who have not given any close attention to the elements of geometry, could draw a regular [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447], or five-sided figure, if they suddenly required to do so. A regular [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448], or six-sided figure, is easy enough, for everybody knows that all you have to do is to describe a [circle][bookofproofs$690] and then, taking the radius as the length of one of the sides, mark off the six points round the [circumference][bookofproofs$690]. But a pentagon is quite another matter. 

So, as my puzzle has to do with the cutting up of a regular pentagon, it will perhaps be well if I first show my less experienced readers how this figure is to be correctly drawn. Describe a circle and draw the two lines `$H B$` and `$D G$`, in the diagram, through the center at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] Now find the point `$A,$` midway between `$C$` and `$B.$`[^1]  Next place the point of your compasses at `$A$` and with the distance `$A D$` describe the arc cutting `$H B$` at `$E.$` Then place the point of your compasses at `$D$` and with the distance `$D E$` describe the arc cutting the circumference at `$F.$` Now, `$D F$` is one of the sides of your pentagon, and you have simply to mark off the other sides round the circle. Quite simple when you know how, but otherwise somewhat of a poser.

Having formed your pentagon, the puzzle is to cut it into the fewest possible pieces that will fit together and form a perfect [square][bookofproofs$909]
