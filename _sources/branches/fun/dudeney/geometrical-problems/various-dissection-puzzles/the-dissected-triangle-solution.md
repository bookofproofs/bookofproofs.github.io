Diagram `$A$` is our original triangle. We will say it measures `$5$` inches (or `$5$` feet) on each side. If we take off a slice at the bottom of an [equilateral triangle][bookofproofs$688] by a cut parallel with the base, the portion that remains will always be an equilateral triangle; so we first cut off piece `$1$` and get a triangle `$3$` inches on every side. The manner of finding directions of the other cuts in `$A$` is obvious from the diagram.

Now, if we want two triangles, `$1$` will be one of them, and `$2,$` `$3,$` `$4,$` and `$5$` will fit together, as in `$B,$` to form the other. If we want three equilateral triangles, `$1$` will be one, `$4$` and `$5$` will form the second, as in `$C,$` and `$2$` and `$3$` will form the third, as in `$D.$` In `$B$` and `$C$` the piece `$5$` is turned over; but there can be no objection to this, as it is not forbidden, and is in no way opposed to the nature of the puzzle.
