Fold the circular piece of paper in half along the dotted line shown in Fig. `$1,$` and divide the upper half into five equal parts as indicated. Now fold the paper along the lines, and it will have the appearance shown in Fig. `$2.$` If you want a star like Fig. `$3,$` cut from `$A$` to `$B;$` if you wish one like Fig. `$4,$` cut from `$A$` to `$C.$` Thus, the nearer you cut to the point at the bottom the longer will be the points of the star, and the farther off from the point that you cut the shorter will be the points of the star.
