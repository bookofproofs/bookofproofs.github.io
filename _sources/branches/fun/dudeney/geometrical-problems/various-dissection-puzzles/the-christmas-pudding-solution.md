The illustration shows how the pudding may be cut into two parts of exactly the same size and shape. The lines must necessarily pass through the points `$A, B, C, D,$` and `$E.$` But, subject to this condition, they may be varied in an infinite number of ways. For example, at a point midway between `$A$` and the edge, the line may be completed in an unlimited number of ways (straight or crooked), provided it be exactly reflected from `$E$` to the opposite edge. And similar variations may be introduced at other places.
