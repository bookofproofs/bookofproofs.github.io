The secret of the bun puzzle lies in the fact that, with the relative dimensions of the circles as given, the three diameters will form a right-angled triangle, as shown by `$A, B, C.$` It follows that the two smaller buns are exactly equal to the large bun. Therefore, if we give David and Edgar the two halves marked `$D$` and `$E,$` they will have their fair shares — one quarter of the confectionery each. Then if we place the small bun, `$H,$` on the top of the remaining one and trace its circumference in the manner shown, Fred's piece, `$F,$` will exactly equal Harry's small bun, `$H,$` with the addition of the piece marked `$G$` — half the rim of the other. Thus each boy gets an exactly equal share, and there are only five pieces necessary.
