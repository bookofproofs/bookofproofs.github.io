The figure that is perplexing the carpenter in the illustration represents a mitre. It will be seen that its proportions are those of a square with one quarter removed. The puzzle is to cut it into five pieces that will fit together and form a perfect square. I show an attempt, published in America, to perform the feat in four pieces, based on what is known as the "step principle," but it is a fallacy.

![q150b](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/dudeney/q150b.png?raw=true)

We are told first to cut oft the pieces `$1$` and `$2$` and pack them into the triangular space marked off by the dotted line, and so form a rectangle.

So far, so good. Now, we are directed to apply the old step principle, as shown, and, by moving down the piece `$4$` one step, form the required square. But, unfortunately, it does __not__ produce a [square][bookofproofs$909]: only an oblong. Call the three long sides of the mitre `$84$` in. each. Then, before cutting the steps, our rectangle in three pieces will be `$84\times63.$` The steps must be `$10\frac 12$` in. in height and `$12$` in. in breadth. Therefore, by moving down a step we reduce by `$12$` in. the side `$84$` in. and increase by `$10\frac 12$` in. the side `$63$` in. Hence our final rectangle must be `$72$` in. `$\times 73\frac 12$` in., which certainly is not a square! The fact is, the step principle can only be applied to rectangles with sides of particular relative lengths. For example, if the shorter side, in this case, were `$61 \frac57$` (instead of `$63$`), then the step method would apply. For the steps would then be `$10\frac 27$` in. in height and `$12$` in. in breadth. Note that `$61 \frac 57 \times 84=72^2.$` 

At present, no solution has been found in four pieces, and I do not believe one possible.
