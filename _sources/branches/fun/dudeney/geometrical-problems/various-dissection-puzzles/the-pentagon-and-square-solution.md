A regular pentagon may be cut into as few as six pieces that will fit together without any turning over and form a square, as I shall show below. Hitherto the best answer has been in seven pieces — the solution produced some years ago by a foreign mathematician, Paul Busschop. We first form a parallelogram, and from that the square. The process will be seen in the diagram on the next page.

The pentagon is `$ABCDE.$` By the cut `$AC$` and the cut `$FM$` ($F$ being the middle point between `$A$` and `$C,$` and `$M$` being the same distance from `$A$` as `$F$`) we get two pieces that may be placed in position at `$GHEA$` and form the parallelogram `$GHDC.$` We then find the mean proportional between the length `$HD$` and the height of the parallelogram. This distance we mark off from `$C$` at `$K,$` then draw `$CK,$` and from `$G$` drop the line `$GL,$` perpendicular to `$KC.$` The rest is easy and rather obvious. It will be seen that the six pieces will form either the pentagon or the square.

I have received what purported to be a solution in five pieces, but the method was based on the rather subtle fallacy that half the diagonal plus half the side of a pentagon equals the side of a square of the same area. I say subtle, because it is an extremely close approximation that will deceive the eye, and is quite difficult to prove inexact. I am not aware that attention has before been drawn to this curious approximation.

Another correspondent made the side of his square `$1\frac 14$` of the side of the pentagon. As a matter of fact, the ratio is irrational. I calculate that if the side of the pentagon is `$1$` — inch, foot, or anything else — the side of the square of equal area is `$1.3117$` nearly, or say roughly `$1\frac{3}{10}$`. So we can only hope to solve the puzzle by geometrical methods.
