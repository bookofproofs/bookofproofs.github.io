The below illustration shows how to cut the four pieces and form with them a square. First, find the side of the square (the mean proportional between the length and height of the rectangle), and the method is obvious. If our strip is exactly in the proportions `$9\times1,$` or `$16x\times1,$` or `$25\times1,$` we can clearly cut it in `$3,$` `$4,$` or `$5$` rectangular pieces respectively to form a square. Excluding these special cases, the general law is that for a strip in length more than `$n^2$` times the breadth, and not more than `$(n+1)^2$` times the breadth, it may be cut in `$n+2$` pieces to form a square, and there will be `$n-1$` rectangular pieces like piece `$4$` in the diagram.

Thus, for example, with a strip `$24\times1,$` the length is more than `$16$` and less than `$25$` times the breadth. Therefore it can be done in `$6$` pieces ($n$ here being `$4$`), `$3$` of which will be rectangular. In the case where `$n$` equals `$1,$` the rectangle disappears and we get a solution in three pieces. Within these limits, of course, the sides need not be rational: the solution is purely geometrical.
