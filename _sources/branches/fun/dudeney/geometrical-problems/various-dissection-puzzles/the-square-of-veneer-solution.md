Any square number may be expressed as the sum of two squares in an infinite number of different ways. The solution of the present puzzle forms a simple demonstration of this rule. It is a condition that we give actual dimensions.

In this puzzle, I ignore the known dimensions of our square and work on the assumption that it is `$13n$` by `$13n.$` The value of n we can afterwards determine. Divide the square as shown (where the dotted lines indicate the original markings) into `$169$` squares. As `$169$` is the sum of the two squares `$144$` and `$25,$` we will proceed to divide the veneer into two squares, measuring respectively `$12\times12$` and `$5\times5;$` and as we know that two squares may be formed from one square by dissection in four pieces, we seek a solution in this number. The dark lines in the diagram show where the cuts are to be made. The square `$5\times5$` is cut out whole, and the larger square is formed from the remaining three pieces, `$B, C,$` and `$D,$` which the reader can easily fit together.

Now, `$n$` is clearly `$\frac{5}{13}$` of an inch. Consequently, our larger square must be `$\frac{60}{13} \times \frac{60}{13}$` in., and our smaller square `$\frac{25}{13} \times \frac{25}{13}$` in. The square of `$\frac{60}{13}$` added to the square of `$\frac{25}{13}$` is 25. The square is thus divided into as few as four pieces that form two squares of known dimensions, and all the sixteen nails are avoided.

Here is a general formula for finding two squares whose sum shall equal a given square, say `$a^2.$` In the case of the solution of our puzzle `$p = 3,$` `$q = 2,$` and `$a = 5$`:

`$$\frac{2pqa}{p^2+q^2}=x,\quad\quad\frac{\sqrt{a^2( p^2 + q^2)^2 - (2pqa)^2}}{p^2 + q^2} =y.$$`

Here `$x^2 + y^2 = a^2.$`
