Nothing could be easier than the solution to this puzzle — when you know how to do it. And yet it is apt to perplex the novice a good deal if he wants to do it in the fewest possible pieces — three. All you have to do is to find the point `$A,$` midway between `$B$` and `$C,$` and then cut from `$A$` to `$D$` and from `$A$` to `$E.$` The three pieces then form a square in the manner shown. Of course, the proportions of the original figure must be correct; thus the triangle `$BEF$` is just a quarter of the square `$BCDF.$` Draw lines from `$B$` to `$D$` and from `$C$` to `$F$` and this will be clear.
