A lady was presented, by two of her girlfriends, with the pretty pieces of silk patchwork shown in our illustration. It will be seen that both pieces are made up of squares all of the same size—one `$12\times12$` and the other `$5\times5.$` She proposes to join them together and make one square patchwork quilt, `$13\times13,$` but, of course, she will not cut any of the material — merely cut the stitches where necessary and join together again. What perplexes her is this. A friend assures her that there need be no more than four pieces in all to join up for the new quilt. Could you show her how this little needlework puzzle is to be solved in so few pieces?
