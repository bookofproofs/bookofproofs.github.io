There is only one solution that will enable us to retain the larger of the two pieces with as little as possible cut from it. Fig. `$1$` in the following diagram shows how the smaller piece is to be cut, and Fig. `$2$` how we should dissect the larger piece, while in Fig. `$3$` we have the new square `$10 \times 10$` formed by the four pieces with all the chequers properly matched. It will be seen that the piece `$D$` contains fifty-two chequers, and this is the largest piece that it is possible to preserve under the conditions.
