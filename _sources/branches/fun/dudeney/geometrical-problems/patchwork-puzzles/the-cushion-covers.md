The above represents a square of brocade. A lady wishes to cut it into four pieces so that two pieces will form one perfectly square cushion top and the remaining two pieces another square cushion top. How is she to do it? Of course, she can only cut along the lines that divide the twenty-five squares, and the pattern must "match" properly without any irregularity whatever in the design of the material. There is only one way of doing it. Can you find it?
