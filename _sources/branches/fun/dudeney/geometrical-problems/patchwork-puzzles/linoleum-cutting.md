![q176](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/dudeney/q176.png?raw=true)

The diagram herewith represents two separate pieces of linoleum. The chequered pattern is not repeated at the back so that the pieces cannot be turned over. The puzzle is to cut the two squares into four pieces so that they shall fit together and form one perfect square `$10\times 10,$` so that the pattern shall properly match, and so that the larger piece shall have as small a portion as possible cut from it.
