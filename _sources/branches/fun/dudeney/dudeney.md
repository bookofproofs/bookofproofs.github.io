### Amusements in Mathematics

> In Mathematicks he was greater
Than Tycho Brahe or Erra Pater: dd
For he, by geometrick scale,
Could take the size of pots of ale;
Resolve, by sines and tangents, straight,
If bread or butter wanted weight;
And wisely tell what hour o' th' day
The clock does strike by algebra.

> BUTLER'S __Hudibras__, 

> 1917.
