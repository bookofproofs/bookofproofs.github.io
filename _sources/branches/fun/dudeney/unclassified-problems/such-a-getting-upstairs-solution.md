Number the treads in regular order upwards, `$1$` to `$8.$` Then proceed as follows: `$1$` (step back to floor), `$1,$` `$2,$` `$3$` `$(2),$` `$3,$` `$4,$` `$5$` `$(4),$` `$5,$` `$6,$` `$7$` `$(6),$` `$7,$` `$8,$` landing `$(8),$` landing. The steps in brackets are taken in a backward direction. It will thus be seen that by returning to the floor after the first step, and then always going three steps forward for one step backward, we perform the required feat in nineteen steps.
