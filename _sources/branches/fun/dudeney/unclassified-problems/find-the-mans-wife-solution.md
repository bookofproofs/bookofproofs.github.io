There is no guessing required in this puzzle. It is all a question of elimination. If we can pair off any five of the ladies with their respective husbands, other than husband No. `$10,$` then the remaining lady must be No. `$10$`'s wife.

I will show how this may be done. No. `$8$` is seen carrying a lady's parasol in the same hand with his walking-stick. But every lady is provided with a parasol, except No. `$3;$`, therefore, No. `$3$` may be safely said to be the wife of No. `$8.$` Then No. `$12$` is holding a bicycle, and the dress-guard and make disclose the fact that it is a lady's bicycle. The only lady in a cycling skirt is No. `$5;$`, therefore, we conclude that No. `$5$` is No. `$12$`'s wife. Next, the man No. `$6$` has a dog, and lady No. `$11$` is seen carrying a dog chain. So we may safely pair No. `$6$` with No. `$11.$` Then we see that man No. `$2$` is paying a newsboy for a paper. But we do not pay for newspapers in this way before receiving them, and the gentleman has apparently not taken one from the boy. But lady No. `$9$` is seen reading a paper. The inference is obvious — that she has sent the boy to her husband for a penny. We, therefore, pair No. `$2$` with No. `$9.$` We have now disposed of all the ladies except Nos. `$1$` and `$7,$` and of all the men except Nos. `$4$` and `$10.$` On looking at No. `$4$` we find that he is carrying a coat over his arm and that the buttons are on the left side;—not on the right, as a man wears them. So it is a lady's coat. But the coat clearly does not belong to No. `$1,$` as she is seen to be wearing a coat already, while No. `$7$` lady is very lightly clad. We, therefore, pair No. `$7$` lady with man No. `$4.$` Now the only lady left is No. `$1,$` and we are consequently forced to the conclusion that she is the wife of No. `$10.$` This is, therefore, the correct answer.
