First lay three of the pennies in the way shown in Fig. 1. Now hold the remaining two pennies in the position shown in Fig. `$2,$` so that they touch one another at the top, and at the base are in contact with the three horizontally placed coins. Then the five pennies will be equidistant, for every penny will touch every other penny.
