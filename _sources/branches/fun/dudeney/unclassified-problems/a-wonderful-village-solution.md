When the sun is in the horizon of any place (whether in Japan or elsewhere), he is the length of half the earth's diameter more distant from that place than in his meridian at noon. As the earth's semi-diameter is nearly `$4,000$` miles, the sun must be considerably more than `$3,000$` miles nearer at noon than at his rising, there being no valley even the hundredth part of `$1,000$` miles deep.
