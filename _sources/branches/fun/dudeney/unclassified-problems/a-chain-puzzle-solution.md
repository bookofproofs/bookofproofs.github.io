To open and rejoin a link costs threepence. Therefore to join the nine pieces into an endless chain would cost `$2$`s. `$3$`d., whereas a new chain, would cost `$2$`s. `$2$`d. But if we break up the piece of eight links, these eight will join together the remaining eight pieces at a cost of `$2$`s. But there is a subtle way of even improving on this. Break up the two pieces containing three and four links respectively, and these seven will join together the remaining seven pieces at a cost of only `$1$`s. `$9$`d.
