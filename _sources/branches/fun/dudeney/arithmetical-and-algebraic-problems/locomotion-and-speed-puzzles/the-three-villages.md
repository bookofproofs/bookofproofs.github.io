I set out the other day to ride in a motor-car from Acrefield to Butterford, but by mistake, I took the road going via Cheesebury, which is nearer Acrefield than Butterford and is twelve miles to the left of the direct road I should have traveled. After arriving at Butterford I found that I had gone thirty-five miles. What are the three distances between these villages, each being a whole number of miles? I may mention that the three roads are quite straight.
