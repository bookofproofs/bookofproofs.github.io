The average speed is twelve miles an hour, not twelve and a half, as most people will hastily declare. Take any distance you like, say sixty miles. This would have taken six hours going and four hours returning. The double journey of `$120$` miles would thus take ten hours, and the average speed is clearly twelve miles an hour.
