Multiply together the number of potatoes, the number less one, and twice the number less one, then divide by `$3.$` Thus `$50,$` `$49,$` and `$99$` multiplied together make `$242,550,$` which, divided by `$3,$` gives us `$80,850$` yards as the correct answer. The boy would thus have to travel `$45$` miles and fifteen-sixteenths â€” a nice little recreation after a day's work.
