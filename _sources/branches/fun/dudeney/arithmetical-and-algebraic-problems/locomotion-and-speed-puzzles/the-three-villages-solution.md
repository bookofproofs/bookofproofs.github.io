Calling the three villages by their initial letters, it is clear that the three roads form a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], `$A,$` `$B,$` `$C,$` with a [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653], measuring twelve miles, dropped from `$C$` to the base `$A, B.$` This divides our triangle into two right-angled triangles with a twelve-mile side in common. It is then found that the distance from `$A$` to `$C$` is `$15$` miles, from `$C$` to `$B$` `$20$` miles, and from `$A$` to `$B$` `$25$` (that is `$9$` and `$16$`) miles. These figures are easily proved, for the square of `$12$` added to the square of `$9$` equals the square of `$15,$` and the square of `$12$` added to the square of `$16$` equals the [square][bookofproofs$2326] of `$20.$`
