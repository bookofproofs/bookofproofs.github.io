A certain family party consisted of `$1$` grandfather, `$1$` grandmother, `$2$` fathers, `$2$` mothers, `$4$` children, `$3$` grandchildren, `$1$` brother, `$2$` sisters, `$2$` sons, `$2$` daughters, `$1$` father-in-law, `$1$` mother-in-law, and `$1$` daughter-in-law. Twenty-three people, you will say. No; there were only seven persons present. Can you show how this might be?
