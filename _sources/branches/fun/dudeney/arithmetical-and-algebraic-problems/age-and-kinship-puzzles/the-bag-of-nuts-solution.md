It will be found that when Herbert takes twelve, Robert and Christopher will take nine and fourteen respectively and that they will have together taken thirty-five nuts. As `$35$` is contained in `$770$` twenty-two times, we have merely to multiply `$12, 9,$` and `$14$` by `$22$` to discover that Herbert's share was `$264,$` Robert's `$198,$` and Christopher's `$308.$` Then, as the total of their ages is `$17\frac 12$` years or half the sum of `$12, 9,$` and `$14,$` their respective ages must be `$6,$` `$4\frac 12,$` and `$7$` years.
