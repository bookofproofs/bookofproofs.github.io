The age of Mamma must have been `$29$` years `$2$` months; that of Papa, `$35$` years; and that of the child, Tommy, `$5$` years `$10$` months. Added together, these make seventy years. The father is six times the age of the son, and, after `$23$` years `$4$` months have elapsed, their united ages will amount to `$140$` years, and Tommy will be just half the age of his father.
