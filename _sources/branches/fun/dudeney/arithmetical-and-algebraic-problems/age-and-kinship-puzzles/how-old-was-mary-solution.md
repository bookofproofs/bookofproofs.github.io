The age of Mary to that of Ann must be as `$5$` to `$3.$` And as the sum of their ages was `$44,$` Mary was `$27\frac 12$` and Ann `$16\frac 12.$` One is exactly `$11$` years older than the other. I will now insert in brackets in the original statement the various ages specified: "Mary is `$(27\frac 12)$` twice as old as Ann was `$(13\frac 34)$` when Mary was half as old `$(24\frac 34)$` as Ann will be `$(49\frac 12)$` when Ann is three times as old `$(49\frac 12)$` as Mary was `$(16\frac 12)$` when Mary was `$(16\frac 12)$` three times as old as Ann `$(5\frac 12)$`."

Now, check this backwards.

When Mary was three times as old as Ann, Mary was `$16\frac 12$` and Ann `$5\frac 12$` ($11$ years younger). Then we get `$49\frac 12$` for the age Ann will be when she is three times as old as Mary was then. When Mary was half this she was `$24\frac 34.$` And at that time Ann must have been `$13\frac 34$` `$(11$` years younger$).$ Therefore Mary is now twice as old — `$27\frac 12,$` and Ann `$11$` years younger — `$16\frac 12.$`
