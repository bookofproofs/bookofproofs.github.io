The correct and only answer is that `$11,616$` ladies made proposals for marriage. Here are all the details, which the reader can check for himself with the original statements. Of `$10,164$` spinsters, `$8,085$` married bachelors, `$627$` married widowers, `$1,221$` were declined by bachelors, and `$231$` declined by widowers. Of the `$1,452$` widows, `$1,155$` married bachelors, and `$297$` married widowers. No widows were declined. The problem is not difficult, by algebra, when once we have succeeded in correctly stating it.
