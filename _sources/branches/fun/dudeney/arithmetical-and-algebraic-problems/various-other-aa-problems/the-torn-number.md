I had the other day in my possession a label bearing the number `$3025$` in large figures. This got accidentally torn in half, so that `$30$` was on one piece and `$25$` on the other, as shown in the illustration.

On looking at these pieces I began to make a calculation, scarcely conscious of what I was doing when I discovered this little peculiarity. If we add the `$3$` and the `$25$` together and square the sum we get as the result the complete original number on the label! Thus, `$30$` added to `$25$` is `$55,$` and `$55$` multiplied by `$55$` is `$3025.$` Curious, is it not? Now, the puzzle is to find another number, composed of four figures, all different, which may be divided in the middle and produce the same result.
