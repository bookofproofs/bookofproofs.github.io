The puzzle amounts to this. Find the smallest square number that may be expressed as the sum of more than three consecutive cubes, the cube `$1$` being barred. As more than three heaps were to be supplied, this condition shuts out the otherwise smallest answer, `$23^3 + 24^3 + 25^3 = 204^2.$` But it admits the answer, `$25^3 + 26^3 + 27^3 + 28^3+ 29^3 = 315^2.$` The correct answer, however, requires more heaps, but a smaller aggregate number of blocks. Here it is: `$143 + 153 + \ldots$` up to `$253$` inclusive, or twelve heaps in all, which, added together, make `$97,344$` blocks of stone that may be laid out to form a square `$312 \times 312.$` I will just remark that one key to the solution lies in what are called triangular numbers.
