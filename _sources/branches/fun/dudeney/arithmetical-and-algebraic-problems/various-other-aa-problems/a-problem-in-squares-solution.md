The sides of the three boards measure `$31$` in., `$41$` in., and `$49$` in. The common difference of area is exactly five square feet. Three numbers whose squares are in A.P., with a common difference of `$7,$` are `$\frac{113}{120}$`, `$\frac{337}{120}$`, `$\frac{463}{120}$`; and with a common difference of `$13$` are `$\frac{80929}{19380}$`, `$\frac{106921}{19380}$`, and `$\frac{127729}{19380}$`. In the case of whole [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326] the common difference will always be divisible by `$24,$` so it is obvious that our squares must be fractional. Readers should now try to solve the case where the common difference is `$23.$` It is rather a hard nut.
