In a certain article, a printer had to set up the figures `$54\times23$`, which, of course, means that the fourth power of `$5$` ($625$) is to be multiplied by the cube of `$2$` ($8$), the product of which is `$5,000.$` But he printed `$54\times23$` as `$5423,$` which is not correct. Can you place four digits in the manner shown, so that it will be equally correct if the printer sets it up aright or makes the same blunder?
