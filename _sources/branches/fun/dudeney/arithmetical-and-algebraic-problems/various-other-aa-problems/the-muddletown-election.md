At the last Parliamentary election at Muddletown `$5,473$` votes were polled. The Liberal was elected by a majority of `$18$` over the Conservative, by `$146$` over the Independent, and by `$575$` over the Socialist. Can you give a simple rule for figuring out how many votes were polled for each candidate?
