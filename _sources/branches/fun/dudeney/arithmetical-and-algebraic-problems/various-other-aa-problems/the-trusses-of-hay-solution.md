Add together the ten weights and divide by `$4,$` and we get `$289$` lbs. as the weight of the five trusses together. If we call the five trusses in the order of weight `$A,$` `$B,$` `$C,$` `$D,$` and `$E,$` the lightest being `$A$` and the heaviest `$E,$` then the lightest, no lbs., must be the weight of `$A$` and `$B;$` and the next lightest, `$112$` lbs., must be the weight of `$A$` and `$C.$` Then the two heaviest, `$D$` and `$E,$` must weigh `$121$` lbs., and `$C$` and `$E$` must weigh `$120$` lbs. We thus know that `$A, B, D,$` and `$E$` weigh together `$231$` lbs., which, deducted from `$289$` lbs. (the weight of the five trusses), gives us the weight of `$C$` as `$58$` lbs. Now, by mere subtraction, we find the weight of each of the five trusses â€” `$54$` lbs., `$56$` lbs., `$58$` lbs., `$59$` lbs., and `$62$` lbs. respectively.
