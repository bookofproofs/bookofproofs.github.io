As every person's purchase was of the value of an exact number of shillings, and as the party possessed when they started out forty shilling coins altogether, there was no necessity for any lady to have any smaller change, or any evidence that they actually had such change.

It will now be found that there would be exactly eight shillings left, which may be divided equally among the eight persons in coin without any change being required.
