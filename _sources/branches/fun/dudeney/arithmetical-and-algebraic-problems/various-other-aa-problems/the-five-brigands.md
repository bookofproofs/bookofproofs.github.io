The five Spanish brigands, Alfonso, Benito, Carlos, Diego, and Esteban, were counting their spoils after a raid when it was found that they had captured altogether exactly `$200$` doubloons. One of the band pointed out that if Alfonso had twelve times as much, Benito three times as much, Carlos the same amount, Diego half as much, and Esteban one-third as much, they would still have altogether just `$200$` doubloons. How many doubloons had each?

There are a good many equally correct answers to this question. Here is one of them:

`\[\begin{array}{rrcrcr}
A&6&\times&12&=&72\\
B&12&\times&3&=&36\\
C&17&\times&1&=&17\\
D&120&\times&\frac 12&=&60\\
E&45&\times&\frac 13&=&15\\
&200&&&&200
\end{array}\]`

The puzzle is to discover exactly how many different answers there are, it is understood that every man had something and that there is to be no fractional moneyâ€”only doubloons in every case.

This problem, worded somewhat differently, was propounded by <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Tartaglia/">Tartaglia</a> (died 1557), and he flattered himself that he had found one solution; but a French mathematician of note (M.A. Labosne), in a recent work, says that his readers will be astonished when he assures them that there are `$6,639$` different correct answers to the question. Is this so? How many answers are there?
