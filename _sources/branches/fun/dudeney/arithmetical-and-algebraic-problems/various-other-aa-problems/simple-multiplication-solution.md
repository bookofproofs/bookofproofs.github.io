The number required is `$3,529,411,764,705,882,$` which may be multiplied by `$3$` and divided by `$2,$` by the simple expedient of removing the `$3$` from one end of the row to the other. If you want a longer number, you can increase this one to any extent by repeating the sixteen figures in the same order.
