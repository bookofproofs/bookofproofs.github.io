The smallest [primes][bookofproofs$704] of the form `$4n + 1$` are `$5,$` `$13,$` `$17,$` `$29,$` and `$37,$` and the smallest of the form `$4n - 1$` are `$3,$` `$7,$` `$11,$` `$19,$` and `$23.$` Now, primes of the first form can always be expressed as the sum of two squares, and in only one way. Thus, `$5 = 4+ 1;$` `$13 = 9 + 4;$` `$17 = 16 + 1;$` `$29 = 25 + 4;$` `$37 = 36 + 1.$` But primes of the second form can never be expressed as the sum of two squares in any way whatever.

In order that a number may be expressed as the sum of two squares in several different ways, it is necessary that it shall be a composite number containing a certain number of primes of our first form. Thus, `$5$` or `$13$` alone can only be so expressed in one way; but `$65,$` `$(5 \times 13),$` can be expressed in two ways, `$1,105,$` `$(5 \times 13 \times 17)$`, in four ways, `$32,045,$` `$(5 \times 13 \times 17 \times 29)$`, in eight ways. We thus get double as many ways for every new factor of this form that we introduce. Note, however, that I say new factor, for the repetition of factors is subject to another law. We cannot express `$25,$` `$(5 \times 5),$` in two ways, but only in one; yet `$125,$` `$(5 \times 5 \times 5),$` can be given in two ways, and so can `$625,$` `$(5 \times 5 \times  5 \times 5);$` while if we take in yet another `$5$` we can express the number as the sum of two squares in three different ways.

If a prime of the second form gets into your composite number, then that number cannot be the sum of two squares. Thus `$15,$` `$(3 \times 5),$` will not work, nor will `$135,$` `$(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5);$` but if we take in an even number of `$3$`'s it will work, because these `$3$`'s will themselves form a square number, but you will only get one solution. Thus, `$45,$` `$(3 \times 3 \times 5,$` or `$9 \times 5) = 36 + 9.$` Similarly, the factor `$2$` may always occur, or any power of `$2,$` such as `$4, 8, 16, 32;$` but its introduction or omission will never affect the number of your solutions, except in such a case as `$50,$` where it doubles a square and therefore gives you the two answers, `$49 + 1$` and `$25+ 25.$` 

Now, directly a number is decomposed into its prime factors, it is possible to tell at a glance whether or not it can be split into two squares; and if it can be, the process of discovery in how many ways is so simple that it can be done in the head without any effort. The number I gave was `$ 130.$`  I at once saw that this was `$2 \times 5 \times 13,$` and consequently that, as `$65$` can be expressed in two ways `$(64 + 1$` and `$49 + 16),$` `$130$` can also be expressed in two ways, the factor `$2$` not affecting the question.

The smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two squares in twelve different ways is `$160,225,$` and this is, therefore, the smallest army that would answer the Sultan's purpose. The number is composed of the factors `$5 \times 5 \times 13 \times 17 \times 29,$` each of which is of the required form. If they were all different factors, there would be sixteen ways; but as one of the factors is repeated, there are just twelve ways. Here are the sides of the twelve pairs of squares: `$(400, 15),$` `$(399,  32),$` `$(393, 76),$` `$(392, 81),$` `$(384, 113),$` `$(375, 140),$` `$(360, 175),$` `$(356, 183),$` `$(337, 216),$` `$(329, 228),$` `$(311, 252),$` `$(265, 300).$` Square the two numbers in each pair, add them together, and their sum will in every case be `$160,225.$`
