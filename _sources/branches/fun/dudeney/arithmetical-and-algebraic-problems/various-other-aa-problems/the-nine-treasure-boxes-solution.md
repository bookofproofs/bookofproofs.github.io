Here is the answer that fulfils the conditions:â€”
 `$A = 4$`, `$B = 3,364$`, `$C = 6,724$`, `$D = 2,116$`,  `$E = 5,476$`,  `$F = 8,836$`, `$G = 9,409$`,  `$H = 12,769$`, `$I = 16,129$`.

Each of these is a square number, the roots, taken in alphabetical order, being `$2,$` `$58,$` `$82,$` `$46,$` `$74,$` `$94,$` `$97,$` `$113,$` and `$127,$` while the required difference between `$A$` and `$B,$` `$B$` and `$C,$` `$D$` and `$E.$` etc., is in every case `$3,360.$`
