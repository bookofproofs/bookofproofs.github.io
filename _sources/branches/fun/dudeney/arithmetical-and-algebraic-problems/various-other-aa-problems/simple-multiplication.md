If we number six cards `$1,$` `$2,$` `$4,$` `$5,$` `$7,$` and `$8,$` and arrange them on the table in this order:â€”

> `$1$`    `$4$`    `$2$`    `$8$`    `$5$`    `$7$`,

we can demonstrate that in order to multiply by `$3$` all that is necessary is to remove the `$1$` to the other end of the row, and the thing is done. The answer is `$428571.$` 

Can you find a number that, when multiplied by `$3$` and divided by `$2,$` the answer will be the same as if we removed the first card (which in this case is to be a `$3$`) From the beginning of the row to the end?
