The ordinary schoolboy would correctly treat this as a quadratic equation. Here is the actual arithmetic. Double the product of the two distances from the walls. This gives us `$144,$` which is the square of `$12.$` The sum of the two distances is `$17.$` If we add these two numbers, `$12$` and `$17,$` together, and also subtract one from the other, we get the two answers that `$29$` or `$5$` was the radius, or half-diameter, of the table. Consequently, the full diameter was `$58$` in. or `$10$` in. But a table of the latter dimensions would be absurd, and not at all in accordance with the illustration. Therefore the table must have been `$58$` in. in diameter. In this case, the spot was on the edge nearest to the corner of the room â€” to which the boy was pointing. If the other answer were admissible, the spot would be on the edge farthest from the corner of the room.
