This puzzle closely resembles the [last one][bookofproofs$7054], my remarks on the solution of which the reader may like to apply in another case. It was recently submitted to a Sydney evening newspaper that indulges in "intellect sharpeners," but was rejected with the remark that it is childish and that they only published problems capable of solution! 

Five ladies, accompanied by their daughters, bought cloth at the same shop. Each of the ten paid as many farthings per foot as she bought feet, and each mother spent `$8$`s. `$5\frac 14$`d. more than her daughter. Mrs. Robinson spent 6s. more than Mrs. Evans, who spent about a quarter as much as Mrs. Jones. Mrs. Smith spent most of all. Mrs. Brown bought 21 yards more than Bessie—one of the girls. Annie bought `$16$` yards more than Mary and spent £$3$, `$0$`s. `$8$`d. more than Emily. The Christian name of the other girl was Ada. Now, what was her surname?
