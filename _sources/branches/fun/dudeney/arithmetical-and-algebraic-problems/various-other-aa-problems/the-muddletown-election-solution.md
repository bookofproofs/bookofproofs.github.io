The numbers of votes polled respectively by the Liberal, the Conservative, the Independent, and the Socialist were `$1,553,$` `$1,535,$` `$1,407,$` and `$978$` All that was necessary was to add the sum of the three majorities ($739$) to the total poll of `$5,473$` (making `$6,212$`) and divide by `$4,$` which gives us `$1,553$` as the poll of the Liberal. Then the polls of the other three candidates can, of course, be found by deducting the successive majorities from the last-mentioned number.
