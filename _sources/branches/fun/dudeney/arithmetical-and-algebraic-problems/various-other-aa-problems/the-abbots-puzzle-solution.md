The only answer is that there were `$5$` men, `$25$` women, and `$70$` children. There were thus `$100$` persons in all, `$5$` times as many women as men, and as the men would together receive `$15$` bushels, the women `$50$` bushels, and the children `$35$` bushels, exactly `$100$` bushels would be distributed.
