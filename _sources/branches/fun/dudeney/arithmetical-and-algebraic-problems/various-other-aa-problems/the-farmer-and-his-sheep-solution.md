The farmer had one sheep only! If he divided this sheep (which is best done by weight) into two parts, making one part two-thirds and the other part one-third, then the difference between these two numbers is the same as the difference between their squares â€” that is, one-third. Any two fractions will do if the [denominator][bookofproofs$1033] equals the sum of the two numerators.
