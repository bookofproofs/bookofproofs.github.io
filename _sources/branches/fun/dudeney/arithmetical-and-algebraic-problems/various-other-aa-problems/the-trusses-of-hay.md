Farmer Tompkins had five trusses of hay, which he told his man Hodge to weigh before delivering them to a customer. The stupid fellow weighed them two at a time in all possible ways and informed his master that the weights in pounds were `$110,$` `$112,$` `$113,$` `$114,$` `$115,$` `$116,$` `$117,$` `$118,$` `$120,$` and `$121.$` Now, how was Farmer Tompkins to find out from these figures how much every one of the five trusses weighed singly? The reader may at first think that he ought to be told "which pair is which pair," or something of that sort, but it is quite unnecessary. Can you give the five correct weights?
