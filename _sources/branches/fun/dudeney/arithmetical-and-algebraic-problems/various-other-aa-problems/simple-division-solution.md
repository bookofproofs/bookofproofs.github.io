Subtract every number in turn from every other number, and we get `$358$` (twice), `$716,$` `$1,611,$` `$1,253,$` and `$895.$` Now, we see at a glance that, as `$358$` equals `$2 \times 179,$` the only number that can divide in every case without a remainder will be `$179.$` On trial, we find that this is such a divisor. Therefore, `$179$` is the divisor we want, which always leaves a [remainder][bookofproofs$818] `$164$` in the case of the original numbers given.
