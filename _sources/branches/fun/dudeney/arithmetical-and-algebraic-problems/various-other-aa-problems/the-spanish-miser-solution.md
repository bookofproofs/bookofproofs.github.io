There must have been `$386$` doubloons in one box, `$8,450$` in another, and `$16,514$` in the third because `$386$` is the smallest number that can occur. If I had asked for the smallest aggregate number of coins, the answer would have been `$482,$` `$3,362,$` and `$6,242.$` It will be found in either case that if the contents of any two of the three boxes be combined, they form a square number of coins. It is a curious coincidence (nothing more, for it will not always happen) that in the first solution the digits of the three numbers add to `$17$` in every case, and in the second solution to `$14.$` It should be noted that the middle one of the three numbers will always be half a square.
