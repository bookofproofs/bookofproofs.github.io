Sometimes a very simple question in elementary arithmetic will cause a good deal of perplexity. For example, I want to divide the four numbers, `$701,$` `$1,059,$` `$1,417,$` and `$2,312,$` by the largest number possible that will leave the same remainder in every case. How am I to set to work? 

Of course, by a laborious system of trial one can in time discover the answer, but there is quite a simple method of doing it if you can only find it.
