Nineteen shillings and ninepence may be paid in `$458,908,622$` different ways.

I do not propose to give my method of solution. Any such explanation would occupy an amount of space out of proportion to its interest or value. If I could give within reasonable limits a general solution for all money payments, I would strain a point to find room; but such a solution would be extremely complex and cumbersome, and I do not consider it worth the labor of working out.

Just to give an idea of what such a solution would involve, I will merely say that I find that dealing only with those sums of money that are multiples of threepence, if we only use bronze coins any sum can be paid in `$(n+1)^2$` ways where n always represents the number of pence. If threepenny-pieces are admitted, there are
`$$\frac{2n^3+15n^2+33n}{18}	 + 1$$`

ways. If sixpences are also used there are
`$$\frac{n^4+22n^3+159n^2+414n+216}{216}$$`

ways, when the sum is a multiple of sixpence, and the constant, 216, changes to 324 when the money is not such a multiple. And so the formulas increase in complexity in an accelerating ratio as we go on to the other coins.

I will, however, add an interesting little table of the possible ways of changing our current coins which I believe has never been given in a book before. Change may be given for a
* Farthing in `$0$` way.
* Halfpenny in `$1$` way.
* Penny in `$3$` ways.
* Threepenny-piece in `$16$` ways.
* Sixpence in `$66$` ways.
* Shilling in `$402$` ways.
* Florin in `$3,818$` ways.
* Half-crown in `$8,709$` ways.
* Double florin in `$60,239$` ways.
* Crown in `$166,651$` ways.
* Half-sovereign in `$6,261,622$` ways.
* Sovereign in `$500,291,833$` ways.

It is a little surprising to find that a sovereign may be changed in over five hundred million different ways. But I have no doubt as to the correctness of my figures.
