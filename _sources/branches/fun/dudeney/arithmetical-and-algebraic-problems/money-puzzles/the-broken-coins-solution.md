If the three broken coins when perfect were worth `$253$` pence, and are now in their broken condition worth `$240$` pence, it should be obvious that `$\frac {13}{253}$` of the original value has been lost. And as the same fraction of each coin has been broken away, each coin has lost `$\frac {13}{253}$`  of its original bulk.
