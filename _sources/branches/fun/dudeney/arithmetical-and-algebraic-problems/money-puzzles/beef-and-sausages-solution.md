The lady bought `$48$` lbs. of beef at `$2$`s., and the same quantity of sausages at `$1$`s. `$6$`d., thus spending £$8, 8$s. Had she bought `$42$` lbs. of beef and `$56$` lbs. of sausages she would have spent £$4, 4$s. on each, and have obtained `$98$` lbs. instead of `$96$` lbs.— a gain in weight of `$2$` lbs.
