Although Snoggs's reason for wishing to take his rise at £$2, 10$s. half-yearly did not concern our puzzle, the fact that he was duping his employer into paying him more than was intended did concern it. Many readers will be surprised to find that, although Moggs only received £$350$ in five years, the artful Snoggs actually obtained £$362, 10$s. in the same time. The rest is simplicity itself. It is evident that if Moggs saved £$87, 10$s. and Snoggs £$181, 5$s., the latter would be saving twice as great a proportion of his salary as the former (namely, one-half as against one-quarter), and the two sums added together make £$268, 15$s.
