The price received was in every case `$105$` farthings. Therefore the greatest number of women is eight, as the goods could only be sold at the following rates: `$105$` lbs. at `$1$` farthing, `$35$` at `$3,$` `$21$` at `$5,$` `$15$` at `$7,$` `$7$` at `$15,$` `$5$` at `$21,$` `$3$` at `$35,$` and `$1$` lb. at `$105$` farthings.
