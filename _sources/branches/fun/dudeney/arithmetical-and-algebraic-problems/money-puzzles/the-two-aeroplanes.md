A man recently bought two aeroplanes, but afterward found that they would not answer the purpose for which he wanted them. So he sold them for Â£$600$ each, making a loss of `$20$` percent, on one machine and a profit of `$20$` percent, on the other. Did he make a profit on the whole transaction or a loss? And how much?
