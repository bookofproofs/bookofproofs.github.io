Puzzles of this class are generally solved in the old books by the tedious process of "working backwards." But a simple general solution is as follows: If there are `$n$` players, the amount held by every player at the end will be `$m(2^n),$` the last winner must have held `$m(n+1)$` at the start, the next `$m(2n+1),$` the next `$m(4n+1),$` the next `$m(8n+1),$` and so on to the first player, who must have held `$m(2^{n-1}n+1).$`

Thus, in this case, n = 7, and the amount held by every player at the end was `$27$` farthings. Therefore `$m = 1,$` and `$G$` started with `$8$` farthings, `$F$` with `$15,$` `$E$` with `$29,$` `$D$` with `$57,$` `$C$` with `$113,$` `$B$` with `$225,$` and `$A$` with `$449$` farthings.
