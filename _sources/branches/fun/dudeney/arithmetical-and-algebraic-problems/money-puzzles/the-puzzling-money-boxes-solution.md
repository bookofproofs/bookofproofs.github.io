The correct answer to this puzzle is as follows: John put into his money-box two double florins ($8$s.), William a half-sovereign and a florin ($12$s.), Charles a crown ($5$s.), and Thomas a sovereign ($20$s.). There are six coins in all, of a total value of `$45$`s. If John had `$2$`s. more, William `$2$`s. less, Charles twice as much, and Thomas half as much as they really possessed, they would each have had exactly `$10$`s.
