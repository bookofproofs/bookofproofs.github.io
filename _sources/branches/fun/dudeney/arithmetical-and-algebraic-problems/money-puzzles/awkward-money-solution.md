As a ching-chang is worth twopence and four-fifteenths of a ching-chang, the remaining eleven-fifteenths of a ching-chang must be worth twopence. Therefore eleven ching-changs are worth exactly thirty pence, or half a crown. Now, the exchange must be made with seven round-holed coins and one square-holed coin. Thus it will be seen that `$7$` round-holed coins are worth seven-elevenths of `$15$` ching-changs, and `$1$` square-holed coin is worth one-eleventh of `$16$` ching-changs â€” that is, `$77$` rounds equal `$105$` ching-changs and `$11$` squares equal `$16$` ching-changs. Therefore `$77$` rounds added to `$11$` squares equal `$121$` ching-changs; or `$7$` rounds and `$1$` square equal `$11$` ching-changs, or its equivalent, half a crown. This is more simple in practice than it looks here.
