Most people know that if you take any sum of money in pounds, shillings, and pence, in which the number of pounds (less than £$12$) exceeds that of the pence, reverse it (calling the pounds pence and the pence pounds), find the difference, then reverse and add this difference, the result is always £$12$, `$18$`s. `$11$`d. But if we omit the condition, "less than £$12,$" and allow naught to represent shillings or pence—

#{list-style-type:upper-roman;}   What is the lowest amount to which the rule will not apply?
1. What is the highest amount to which it will apply?

Of course, when reversing such a sum as £$14,$ `$15$`s. `$3$`d. it may be written £$3,$ `$16$`s. `$2$`d., which is the same as £$3,$ `$15$`s. `$14$`d.
