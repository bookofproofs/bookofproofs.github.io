As there were five droves with an equal number of animals in each drove, the number must be divisible by `$5;$` and as every one of the eight dealers bought the same number of animals, the number must be divisible by `$8.$` Therefore the number must be a multiple of `$40.$` The highest possible multiple of `$40$` that will work will be found to be `$120,$` and this number could be made up in one of two ways â€” `$1$` ox, `$23$` pigs, and `$96$` sheep, or `$3$` oxen, `$8$` pigs, and `$109$` sheep. But the first is excluded from the statement that the animals consisted of "oxen, pigs, and sheep," because a single ox is not oxen. Therefore the second grouping is the correct answer.
