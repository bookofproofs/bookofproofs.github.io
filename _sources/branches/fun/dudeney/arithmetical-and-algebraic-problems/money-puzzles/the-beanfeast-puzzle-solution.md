The cobblers spent `$35$`s., the tailors spent also `$35$`s., the hatters spent `$42$`s., and the glovers spent `$21$`s. Thus, they spent altogether Â£$6,13$s., while it will be found that the five cobblers spent as much as four tailors, twelve tailors as much as nine hatters, and six hatters as much as eight glovers.
