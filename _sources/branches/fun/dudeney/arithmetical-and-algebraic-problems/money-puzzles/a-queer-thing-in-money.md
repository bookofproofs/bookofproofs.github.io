It will be found that Â£$66,$ `$6$`s. `$6$`d. equals `$15,918$` pence. Now, the four `$6$`'s added together make `$24$`, and the figures in `$15,918$` also add to `$24.$` It is a curious fact that there is only one other sum of money, in pounds, shillings, and pence (all similarly repetitions of one figure), of which the digits shall add up the same as the digits of the amount in pence. What is the other sum of money?
