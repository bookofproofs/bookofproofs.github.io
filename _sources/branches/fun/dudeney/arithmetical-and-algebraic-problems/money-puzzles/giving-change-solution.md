The way to help the American tradesman out of his dilemma is this. Describing the coins by the number of cents that they represent, the tradesman puts on the counter `$50$` and `$25;$` the buyer puts down `$100, 3,$` and `$2;$` the stranger adds his `$10, 10, 5, 2,$` and `$1.$` Now, considering that the cost of the purchase amounted to `$34$` cents, it is clear that out of this pooled money the tradesman has to receive `$109,$` the buyer `$71,$` and the stranger his `$28$` cents. Therefore it is obvious at a glance that the `$100$`-piece must go to the tradesman, and it then follows that the `$50$`-piece must go to the buyer, and then the `$25$`-piece can only go to the stranger. Another glance will now make it clear that the two `$10$`-cent pieces must go to the buyer because the tradesman now only wants `$9$` and the stranger `$3.$` Then it becomes obvious that the buyer must take the `$1$` cent, that the stranger must take the `$3$` cents, and the tradesman the `$5, 2,$` and `$2.$` To sum up, the tradesman takes `$100, 5, 2,$` and `$2;$` the buyer, `$50, 10, 10,$` and `$1;$` the stranger, `$25$` and `$3.$` It will be seen that not one of the three persons retains any one of his own coins.
