The way to write four sevens with simple arithmetical signs so that they represent `$100$` is as follows:â€”
`$$\frac{7}{.7}\times\frac{7}{.7} = 100.$$`

Of course, the fraction, `$7$` over decimal `$7,$` equals `$7$` divided by `$\frac{7}{10}$`, which is the same as `$70$` divided by `$7,$` or `$10.$` Then `$10$` multiplied by `$10$` is `$100,$` and there you are! It will be seen that this solution applies equally to any number whatever that you may substitute for `$7.$`
