If I multiply `$51,249,876$` by `$3$` (thus using all the nine digits once, and once only), I get `$153,749,628$` (which again contains all the nine digits once). Similarly, if I multiply `$16,583,742$` by `$9,$` the result is `$149,253,678,$` wherein each case all the nine digits are used. Now, take `$6$` as your multiplier and try to arrange the remaining eight digits so as to produce by multiplication a number containing all nine once, and once only. You will find it far from easy, but it can be done.
