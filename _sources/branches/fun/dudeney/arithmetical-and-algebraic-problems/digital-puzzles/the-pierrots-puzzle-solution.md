There are just six different solutions to this puzzle, as follows: â€”
* `$8\times 473=3784$`
* `$9\times 351=3159$`
* `$15\times 93=1395$`
* `$21\times 87=1287$`
* `$27\times 81=2187$`
* `$35\times 41=1435$`

It will be seen that in every case the two multipliers contain exactly the same figures as the product.
