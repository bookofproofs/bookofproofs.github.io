It is another good puzzle so to arrange the nine digits (the nought excluded) into two groups so that one group, when divided by the other, produces a given number without remainder. For example, `$13458$` divided by `$6729$` gives `$2.$` Can the reader find similar arrangements producing `$3,$` `$4,$` `$5,$` `$6,$` `$7$`, `$8,$` and `$9$` respectively? Also, can he find the pairs of smallest possible numbers in each case? Thus, `$14658$` divided by `$7329$` is just as correct for `$2$` as the other example we have given, but the numbers are higher.
