The [odd][bookofproofs$2318] digits, `$1,$` `$3,$` `$5,$` `$7,$` and `$9,$` add up `$25,$` while the [even][bookofproofs$2317] figures, `$2,$` `$4,$` `$6,$` and `$8,$` only add up `$20.$` Arrange these figures so that the odd ones and the even ones add up alike. Complex and improper fractions and recurring decimals are not allowed.
