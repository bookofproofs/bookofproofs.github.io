So far as I know, there are no published tables of square numbers that go sufficiently high to be available for the purposes of this puzzle. The lowest [square number][bookofproofs$2326] containing all the nine digits once, and once only, is `$139,854,276,$` the square of `$11,826.$` The highest square number under the same conditions is, `$923,187,456,$` the square of `$30,384.$`
