It is convenient to consider the digits as arranged to form fractions of the respective values, one-half, one-third, one-fourth, one-fifth, one-sixth, one-seventh, one-eighth, and one-ninth. I will first give the eight answers, as follows: —

* `$\frac{6729}{13458} = \frac 12$`
* `$\frac{5823}{17469} = \frac 13$`
* `$\frac{3942}{15768} = \frac 14$`
* `$\frac{2697}{13485} =  \frac 15$`
* `$\frac{2943}{17658} =  \frac 16$`
* `$\frac{2394}{16758} =  \frac 17$`
* `$\frac{3187}{25496} =  \frac 18$`
* `$\frac{6381}{57429} =  \frac 19$`

The sum of the numerator digits and the denominator digits will, of course, always be `$45,$` and the "digital root" is `$9.$` Now, if we separate the nine digits into any two groups, the sum of the two digital roots will always be `$9.$` In fact, the two digital roots must be either `$9—9,$` `$8—1,$` `$7—2,$` `$6—3,$` or `$5—4.$` In the first case, the actual sum is `$18,$` but then the digital root of this number is itself `$9.$` The solutions in the cases of one-third, one-fourth, one-sixth, one-seventh, and one-ninth must be of the form `$9—9;$` that is to say, the digital roots of both numerator and denominator will be `$9.$` In the cases of one-half and one-fifth, however, the digital roots are `$6—3,$` but of course the higher root may occur either in the numerator or in the denominator; thus `$\frac{2697}{13485}$`, `$\frac{2769}{13845}$`, `$\frac{2973}{14865}$`, `$\frac{3729}{18645}$`, where, in the first two arrangements, the roots of the numerator and denominator are respectively `$6—3,$` and in the last two `$3—6.$` The most curious case of all is, perhaps, one-eighth, for here the digital roots may be of any one of the five forms given above.

The denominators of the fractions being regarded as the numerators multiplied by `$2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,$` and `$9$` respectively, we must pay attention to the "carryings over." In order to get five figures in the product there will, of course, always be a carry-over after multiplying the last figure to the left, and in every case higher than `$4$` we must carry over at least three times. Consequently in cases from one-fifth to one-ninth we cannot produce different solutions by a mere change of position of pairs of figures, as, for example, we may with `$\frac{5832}{17496}$` and `$\frac{5823}{17469}$`, where the `$\frac{2}{6}$` and `$\frac{3}{9}$` change places. It is true that the same figures may often be differently arranged, as shown in the two pairs of values for one-fifth that I have given in the last paragraph, but here it will be found there is a general readjustment of figures and not a simple changing of the positions of pairs. There are other little points that would occur to every solver — such as that the figure `$5$` cannot ever appear to the extreme right of the numerator, as this would result in our getting either a naught or a second `$5$` in the denominator. Similarly `$1$` cannot ever appear in the same position, nor `$6$` in the fraction one-sixth, nor an even figure in the fraction one-fifth, and so on. The preliminary consideration of such points as I have touched upon will not only prevent our wasting a lot of time in trying to produce impossible forms, but will lead us more or less directly to the desired solutions.
