The solution that gives the smallest possible sum of digits in the common product is `$23 \times 174 = 58 \times 69 = 4,002,$` and the solution that gives the largest possible sum of digits, `$9 \times 654 = 18 \times 327 = 5,886.$` In the first case, the digits sum to `$6$` and in the second case to `$27.$` There is no way of obtaining the solution but by actual trial.
