If I write the sum of money, Â£$987,$ `$5$`s. `$4\frac 12$`d., and add up the digits, they sum to `$36.$` No digit has thus been used a second time in the amount of addition. This is the largest amount possible under the conditions. Now find the smallest possible amount, pounds, shillings, pence, and farthings being all represented. You need not use more of the nine digits than you choose, but no digit may be repeated throughout. The naught is not allowed.
