Can you also find the smallest possible number produced in the same way that is divisible by `$11$`? Here is an example, where the digit `$5$` has been omitted: `$896743012.$` This number contains nine of the digits and is divisible by `$11,$` but it is neither the largest nor the smallest number that will work.
