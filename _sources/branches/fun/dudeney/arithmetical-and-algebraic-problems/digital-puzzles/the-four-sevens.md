In the illustration, Professor Rackbrane is seen demonstrating one of the little posers with which he is accustomed to entertaining his class. He believes that by taking his pupils off the beaten tracks he is the better able to secure their attention and to induce original and ingenious methods of thought. 

He has, it will be seen, just shown how four `$5$`s may be written with simple arithmetical signs so as to represent `$100.$` Every juvenile reader will see at a glance that his example is quite correct. Now, what he wants you to do is this: Arrange four `$7$`s (neither more nor less) with arithmetical signs so that they shall represent `$100.$` If he had said we were to use four `$9$`s we might at once have written `$99\frac 99,$` but the four `$7$`'s call for rather more ingenuity. Can you discover the little trick?
