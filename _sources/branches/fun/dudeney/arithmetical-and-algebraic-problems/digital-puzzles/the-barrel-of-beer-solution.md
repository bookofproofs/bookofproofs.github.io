Here the digital roots of the six numbers are `$6, 4, 1, 2, 7, 9,$` which together sum to `$29,$` whose digital root is `$2.$` As the contents of the barrels sold must be a number divisible by `$3,$` if one buyer purchased twice as much as the other, we must find a barrel with root `$2, 5,$` or `$8$` to set on one side. There is only one barrel, that containing `$20$` gallons, that fulfills these conditions. So the man must have kept these `$20$` gallons of beer for his own use and sold one man `$33$` gallons (the `$18$`-gallon and `$15$`-gallon barrels) and sold the other man `$66$` gallons (the `$16,$` `$19,$` and `$31$` gallon barrels).
