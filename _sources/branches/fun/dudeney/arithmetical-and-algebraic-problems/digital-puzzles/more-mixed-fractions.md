When I first published my solution to the last puzzle, I was led to attempt the expression of all numbers in turn up to `$100$` by a mixed fraction containing all the nine digits. Here are twelve numbers for the reader to try his hand at: `$13,$` `$14,$` `$15,$` `$16,$` `$18,$` `$20,$` `$27,$` `$36,$` `$40,$` `$69,$` `$72,$` `$94.$` Use every one of the nine digits once, and only once, in every case.
