There appeared in __Nouvelles Annales de Math√©matiques__ the following puzzle as a modification of one of my __Canterbury Puzzles.__ 

Arrange the nine digits in three groups of two, three, and four digits, so that the first two numbers when multiplied together make the third. Thus, `$12 \times 483 = 5,796.$` I now also propose to include the cases where there are one, four, and four digits, such as `$4 \times 1,738 = 6,952.$` Can you find all the possible solutions in both cases?
