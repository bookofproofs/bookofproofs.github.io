The time indicated on the watch was `$5\frac{5}{11}$` min. past `$9,$` when the second hand would be at `$27\frac{3}{11}$` sec. The next time the hands would be similar distances apart would be `$54\frac{6}{11}$` min. past `$2,$` when the second hand would be at `$32\frac{8}{11}$` sec. But you need only hold the watch (or our previous illustration of it) in front of a mirror, when you will see the second time reflected in it! Of course, when reflected, you will read XI as I, X as II, and so on.
