The positions of the hands shown in the illustration could only indicate that the clock stopped at `$44$` min. `$51\frac{1143}{1427}$` sec. after eleven o'clock. The second hand would next be "exactly midway between the other two hands" at `$45$` min. `$52\frac{496}{1427}$` sec. after eleven o'clock. If we had been dealing with the points on the circle to which the three hands are directed, the answer would be `$45$` min. `$22\frac{106}{1427}$` sec. after eleven; but the question applied to the hands, and the second hand would not be between the others at that time, but outside them.
