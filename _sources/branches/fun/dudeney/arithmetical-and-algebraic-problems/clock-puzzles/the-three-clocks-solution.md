As a mere arithmetical problem, this question presents no difficulty. In order that the hands shall all point to twelve o'clock at the same time, it is necessary that `$B$` shall gain at least twelve hours and that `$C$` shall lose twelve hours. As `$B$` gains a minute in a day of twenty-four hours, and `$C$` loses a minute in precisely the same time, it is evident that one will have gained `$720$` minutes (just twelve hours) in `$720$` days, and the other will have lost `$720$` minutes in `$720$` days. Clock `$A$` keeping perfect time, all three clocks must indicate twelve o'clock simultaneously at noon on the `$720$`th day from April `$1, 1898.$` What day of the month will that be?

I published this little puzzle in `$1898$` to see how many people were aware of the fact that `$1900$` would not be a leap year. It was surprising how many were then ignorant on the point. Every year that can be divided by four without a remainder is bissextile or leap year, with the exception that one leap year is cut off in the century. `$1800$` was not a leap year, nor was `$1900.$` On the other hand, however, to make the calendar more nearly agree with the sun's course, every fourth hundred year is still considered bissextile. Consequently, `$2000,$` `$2400,$` `$2800,$` `$3200,$` etc., will all be leap years. May my readers live to see them. We, therefore, find that `$720$` days from noon of April `$1, 1898,$` brings us to noon on March `$22, 1900.$`
