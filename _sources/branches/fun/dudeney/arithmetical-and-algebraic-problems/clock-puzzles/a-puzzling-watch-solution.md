If the `$65$` minutes be counted on the face of the same watch, then the problem would be impossible: for the hands must coincide every `$65\frac{5}{11}$` minutes as shown by its face, and it matters not whether it runs fast or slow; but if it is measured by true time, it gains `$\frac{5}{11}$` of a minute in `$65$` minutes, or `$\frac{60}{143}$` of a minute per hour.
