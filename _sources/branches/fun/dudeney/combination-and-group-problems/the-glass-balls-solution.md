There are, in all, sixteen balls to be broken, or sixteen places in the order of breaking. Call the four strings `$A, B, C,$` and `$D$` — order is here of no importance. The breaking of the balls on `$A$` may occupy any `$4$` out of these `$16$` places — that is, the combinations of `$16$` things, taken `$4$` together, will be

`$$\frac{13 \times 14 \times 15 \times 16}{1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4}	 = 1,820$$`

ways for `$A.$` In every one of these cases `$B$` may occupy any `$4$` out of the remaining `$12$` places, making
`$$\frac{9 \times 10 \times 11 \times 12}{1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4} = 495$$`
ways. Thus `$1,820 \times 495 = 900,900$` different placings are open to `$A$` and `$B.$` But for every one of these cases `$C$` may occupy

`$$\frac{5 \times 6 \times 7 \times 8}{1 \times 2\times 3 \times 4}	 = 70$$`

different places; so that `$900,900 \times 70 = 63,063,000$` different placings are open to `$A, B,$` and `$C.$` In every one of these cases, `$D$` has no choice but to take the four places that remain. Therefore the correct answer is that the balls may be broken in `$63,063,000$` different ways under the conditions. Readers should compare this problem with [The Two Pawns][bookofproofs$7330], which they will then know how to solve for cases where there are three, four, or more pawns on the board.
