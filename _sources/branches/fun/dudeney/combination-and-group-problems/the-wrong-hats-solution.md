The number of different ways in which eight persons, with eight hats, can each take the wrong hat, is `$14,833.$`

Here are the successive solutions for any number of persons from one to eight:â€”
 `$1 = 0$` `$2 = 1$` `$3 = 2$` `$4 = 9$` `$5 = 44$` `$6 = 265$` `$7 = 1,854$` `$8 = 14,833$`

To get these numbers, multiply successively by `$2,$` `$3,$` `$4,$` `$5,$` etc. When the multiplier is even, add `$1;$` when odd, deduct `$1.$` Thus, `$3 \times 1- 1 = 2,$` `$4 \times 2 + 1 = 9;$` `$5 \times 9- 1 = 44;$` and so on. Or you can multiply the sum of the number of ways for `$n-1$` and `$n-2$` persons by `$n-1,$` and so get the solution for `$n$` persons. Thus, `$4(2 + 9) = 44;$` `$5(9 + 44) = 265;$` and so on.
