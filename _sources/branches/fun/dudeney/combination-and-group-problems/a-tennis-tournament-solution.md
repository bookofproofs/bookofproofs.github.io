Call the men `$A, B, D, E,$` and their wives `$a, b, d, e.$` Then they may play as follows without any person ever playing twice with or against any other person:—


Day | First Court | Second Court
:------------- |:------------- |:-------------
 1st Day| `$A d$` against `$B e$`| `$D a$` against `$E b$`
 2nd Day| `$A e$` against `$D b$`| `$E a$` against `$B d$`
 3rd Day| `$A b$` against `$E d$`| `$B a$` against `$D e$`

It will be seen that no man ever plays with or against his own wife — an ideal arrangement. If the reader wants a hard puzzle, let him try to arrange eight married couples (in four courts on seven days) under exactly similar conditions. It can be done, but I leave the reader, in this case, the pleasure of seeking the answer and the general solution.
