Twenty-one different squares may be selected. Of these nine will be of the size shown by the four `$A$`'s in the diagram, four of the size shown by the `$B$`'s, four of the size shown by the `$C$`'s, two of the size shown by the `$D$`'s, and two of the size indicated by the upper single `$A,$` the upper single `$E,$` the lower single `$C,$` and the `$EB.$` It is an interesting fact that you cannot form any one of these twenty-one squares without using at least one of the six circles marked `$E.$`
