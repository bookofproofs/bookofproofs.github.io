I possess a [tetrahedron][bookofproofs$2221], or triangular pyramid, formed of six sticks glued together, as shown in the illustration. Can you count correctly the number of different ways in which these six sticks might have been stuck together so as to form the pyramid?

![q280](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/dudeney/q280.png?raw=true)

Some friends worked at it together one evening, each person providing himself with six lucifer matches to aid his thoughts, but it was found that no two results were the same. You see, if we remove one of the sticks and turn it around the other way, that will be a different pyramid. If we make two of the sticks change places the result will again be different. But remember that every pyramid may be made to stand on either of its four sides without being a different one. How many ways are there altogether?
