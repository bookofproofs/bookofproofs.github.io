There are twenty-six letters in the alphabet, giving `$325$` different pairs. Every one of these pairs may be reversed, making `$650$` ways. But every initial letter may be repeated as the final, producing `$26$` other ways. The total is therefore `$676$` different pairs. In other words, the answer is the square of the number of letters in the alphabet.
