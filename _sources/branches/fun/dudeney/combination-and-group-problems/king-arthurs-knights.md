King Arthur sat at the Round Table on three successive evenings with his knights — Beleobus, Caradoc, Driam, Eric, Floll, and Galahad—but on no occasion did any person have as his neighbor one who had before sat next to him. On the first evening, they sat in alphabetical order around the table. But afterwards King Arthur arranged the two next sittings so that he might have Beleobus as near to him as possible and Galahad as far away from him as could be managed. How did he seat the knights to the best advantage, remembering that rule that no knight may have the same neighbor twice?
