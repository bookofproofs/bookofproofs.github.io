The history of this problem will be found in __The Canterbury Puzzles__ (No. 90). Since the publication of that book in 1907, so far as I know, nobody has succeeded in solving the case for that unlucky number of persons, `$13,$` seated at a table on `$66$` occasions. A solution is possible for any number of persons, and I have recorded schedules for every number up to `$25$` persons inclusive and for `$33.$` But as I know a good many mathematicians are still considering the case of `$13,$` I will not at this stage rob them of the pleasure of solving it by showing the answer. But I will now display the solutions for all the cases up to `$12$` persons inclusive. Some of these solutions are now published for the first time, and they may afford useful clues to investigators.

The solution for the case of `$3$` persons seated on `$1$` occasion needs no remark.

A solution for the case of `$4$` persons on `$3$` occasions is as follows:—

`$$\begin{array}{cccc}
1&2& 3& 4\\
1&3& 4 &2\\
1&4& 2 &3\\
\end{array}$$`

Each line represents the order for a sitting, and the person represented by the last number in a line must, of course, be regarded as sitting next to the first person in the same line, when placed at the round table.

The case of `$5$` persons on `$6$` occasions may be solved as follows:—

`$$\begin{array}{ccccc}
1 &2& 3 &4& 5\\
1 &2& 4 &5& 3\\
1 &2& 5 &3& 4\\
1 &3& 2 &5& 4\\
1 &4& 2 &3& 5\\
1 &5& 2 &4& 3\\
\end{array}$$`

The case for `$6$` persons on `$10$` occasions is solved thus:—

`$$\begin{array}{cccccc}
1 &2& 3 &6& 4& 5\\
1 &3& 4 &2& 5 &6\\
1 &4& 5 &3& 6 &2\\
1 &5& 6 &4& 2 &3\\
1 &6& 2 &5& 3 &4\\
1 &2& 4 &5& 6 &3\\
1 &3& 5 &6& 2 &4\\
1 &4& 6 &2& 3 &5\\
1 &5& 2 &3& 4 &6\\
1 &6&3 &4& 5 &2\\
\end{array}$$`

It will now no longer be necessary to give the solutions in full, for reasons that I will explain. It will be seen in the examples above that the `$1$` (and, in the case of `$5$` persons, also the `$2$`) is repeated down the column. Such a number I call a "repeater." The other numbers descend in cyclical order. Thus, for `$6$` persons we get the cycle, `$2,$` `$3,$` `$4,$` `$5,$` `$6,$` `$2,$` and so on, in every column. So it is only necessary to give the two lines `$1$` `$2$` `$3$` `$6$` `$4$` `$5$` and `$1$` `$2$` `$4$` `$5$` `$6$` `$3,$` and denote the cycle and repeaters, to enable any one to write out the full solution straight away. The reader may wonder why I do not start the last solution with the numbers in their natural order, `$1$` `$2$` `$3$` `$4$` `$5$` `$6.$` If I did so the numbers in the descending cycle would not be in their natural order, and it is more convenient to have a regular cycle than to consider the order in the first line.

The difficult case of `$7$` persons on `$15$` occasions is solved as follows, and was given by me in The Canterbury Puzzles:—

`$$\begin{array}{ccccccc}
1 &2& 3 &4& 5 &7& 6\\
1 &6& 2 &7& 5 &3& 4\\
1 &3& 5 &2& 6 &7& 4\\
1 &5& 7 &4& 3 &6& 2\\
1 &5& 2 &7& 3 &4& 6\\
\end{array}$$`

In this case the `$1$` is a repeater, and there are two separate cycles, `$2,$` `$3,$` `$4,$` `$2,$` and `$5,$` `$6,$` `$7,$` `$5.$` We thus get five groups of three lines each, for a fourth line in any group will merely repeat the first line.

A solution for `$8$` persons on `$21$` occasions is as follows:—
`$$\begin{array}{cccccccc}
1 &8&6 &3& 4 &5& 2& 7\\
1 &8& 4 &5& 7 &2& 3& 6\\
1 &8& 2 &7& 3 &6& 4& 5\\
\end{array}$$`

The `$1$` is here a repeater, and the cycle `$2,$` `$3,$` `$4,$` `$5,$` `$6,$` `$7, 8.$` Every one of the `$3$` groups will give `$7$` lines.

Here is my solution for `$9$` persons on `$28$` occasions:—
`$$\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
2 &1& 9 &7& 4 &5& 6 &3& 8\\
2 &9& 5 &1& 6 &8& 3 &4& 7\\
2 &9& 3 &1& 8 &4& 7 &5& 6\\
2 &9& 1 &5& 6 &4& 7 &8& 3\\
\end{array}$$`

There are here two repeaters, `$1$` and `$2,$` and the cycle is `$3,$` `$4,$` `$5,$` `$6,$` `$7,$` `$8, 9.$` We thus get `$4$` groups of `$7$` lines each.

The case of `$10$` persons on `$36$` occasions is solved as follows:—
`$$\begin{array}{cccccccccc}
1 &10& 8 &3& 6 &5& 4 &7&2& 9\\
1 &10& 6 &5& 2 &9& 7 &4& 3 &8\\
1 &10& 2 &9& 3 &8& 6 &5& 7 &4\\
1 &10& 7 &4& 8 &3& 2 &9& 5 &6\\
\end{array}$$`

The repeater is `$1,$` and the cycle, `$2,$` `$3,$` `$4,$` `$5,$` `$6,$` `$7,$` `$8,$` `$9, 10.$` We here have `$4$` groups of `$9$` lines each.

My solution for `$11$` persons on `$45$` occasions is as follows:—
`$$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
2&11&	9	&4&	7&	6&	5	&1&	8	&3&	10\\
2&	1&	11&	7&	6&	3&	10	&8	&5	&4&	9\\
2&	11&	10&	3&	9&	4&	8	&5	&1	&7&	6\\
2&	11	&5&	8&	1&	3&	10	&6	&7	&9&	4\\
2&	11	&1&	10&	3&	4&	9	&6	&7&	5&	8\\
\end{array}$$`

There are two repeaters, `$1$` and `$2,$` and the cycle is, `$3, 4, 5,\ldots , 11.$` We thus get `$5$` groups of `$9$` lines each.

The case of `$12$` persons on `$55$` occasions is solved thus:—
`$$\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
1&	2&	3&	12&	4&	11&	5&	10&	6	&9&	7&	8\\
1&	2&	4&	11&	6&	9&	8&	7&	10&	5&	12&	3\\
1&	2&	5&	10&	8&	7&	11&	4&	3	&12&	6&	9\\
1&	2&	6&	9&	10&	5&	3&	12&	7&	8&	11&	4\\
1&	2&	7&	8	&12	&3	&6&	9&	11&	4&	5&	10\\
\end{array}$$`

Here `$1$` is a repeater, and the cycle is `$2,$` `$ 3,$`  `$4,$` `$ 5, \ldots ,12.$` We thus get `$5$` groups of `$11$` lines each.
