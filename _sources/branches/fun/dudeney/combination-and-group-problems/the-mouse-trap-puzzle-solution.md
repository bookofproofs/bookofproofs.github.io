If we interchange cards `$6$` and `$13$` and begin our count at `$14,$` we may take up all the twenty-one cards — that is, make twenty-one "catches" — in the following order: `$6,$` `$8,$` `$13,$` `$2,$` `$10,$` `$1,$` `$11,$` `$4,$` `$14,$` `$3,$` `$5,$` `$7,$` `$21,$` `$12,$` `$15,$` `$20,$` `$9,$` `$16,$` `$18,$` `$17,$` `$19.$` We may also exchange `$10$` and `$14$` and start at `$16,$` or exchange `$6$` and `$8$` and start at `$19.$`
