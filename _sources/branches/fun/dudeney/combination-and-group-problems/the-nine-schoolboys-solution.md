The boys can walk out as follows:â€”


1st Day | 2nd Day | 3rd Day | 4th Day | 5th Day | 6th Day
:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:-------------
 A B C| B F H| F A G| A D H| G B I| D C A
 D E F| E I A| I D B| B E G| C F D| E H B
 G H I| C G D| H C E| F I C| H A E| I G F

Every boy will then have walked by the side of every other boy once and once only.

Dealing with the problem generally, `$12n + 9$` boys may walk out in triplets under the conditions on `$9n + 6$` days, where n may be naught or any integer. Every possible pair will occur once. Call the number of boys `$m.$` Then every boy will pair `$m-1$` times, of which `$(m- 1)/4$` times he will be in the middle of a triplet and `$(m- 1)/2$` times on the outside. Thus, if we refer to the solution above, we find that every boy is in the middle twice (making `$4$` pairs) and four times on the outside (making the remaining `$4$` pairs of his `$8$`). The reader may now like to try his hand at solving the two next cases of `$21$` boys on `$15$` days, and `$33$` boys on `$24$` days. It is, perhaps, interesting to note that a school of `$489$` boys could thus walk out daily in one leap year, but it would take `$731$` girls (referred to in the solution to [Three Men in a Boat][bookofproofs$7195]) to perform their particular feat by a daily walk in a year of `$365$` days.
