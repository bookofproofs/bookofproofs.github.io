On the second evening King Arthur arranged the knights and himself in the following order around the table: `$A, F, B, D, G, E, C.$` On the third evening they sat thus, `$A, E, B, G, C, F, D.$` He thus had `$B$` next but one to him on both occasions (the nearest possible), and G was the third from him at both sittings (the furthest position possible). No other way of sitting the knights would have been so satisfactory.
