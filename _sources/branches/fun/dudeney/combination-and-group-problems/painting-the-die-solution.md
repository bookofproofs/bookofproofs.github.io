The `$1$` can be marked on any one of six different sides. For every side occupied by `$1$` we have a selection of four sides for the `$2.$` For every situation of the `$2$` we have two places for the `$3.$` (The `$6, 5,$` and `$4$` need not be considered, as their positions are determined by the `$1, 2,$` and `$3.$`) Therefore `$6, 4,$` and `$2$` multiplied together make `$48$` different ways â€” the correct answer.
