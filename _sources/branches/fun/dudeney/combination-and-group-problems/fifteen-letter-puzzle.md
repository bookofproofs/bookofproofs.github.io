The above is the solution of a puzzle I gave in __Tit-bits__ in the summer of 1896. It was required to take the letters, `$A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N,$` and `$O,$` and with them form thirty-five groups of three letters so that the combinations should include the greatest number possible of common English words. No two letters may appear together in a group more than once. Thus, `$A$` and `$L$` having been together in `$A L E,$` must never be found together again; nor may `$A$` appear again in a group with `$E,$` nor `$L$`with `$E.$` These conditions will be found complied with in the above solution, and the number of words formed is twenty-one. Many persons have since tried hard to beat this number, but so far have not succeeded.

More than thirty-five combinations of the fifteen letters cannot be formed within the conditions. Theoretically, there cannot possibly be more than twenty-three words formed, because only this number of combinations is possible with a vowel or vowels in each. And as no English word can be formed from three of the given vowels `$(A, E, I,$` and `$O)$`, we must reduce the number of possible words to twenty-two. This is correct theoretically, but practically that twenty-second word cannot be got in. If `$J E K,$` shown above, were a word it would be all right; but it is not, and no amount of juggling with the other letters has resulted in a better answer than the one shown. I should say that proper nouns and abbreviations, such as Joe, Jim, Alf, Hal, Flo, Ike, etc., are disallowed.

Now, the present puzzle is a variation of the above. It is simply this: Instead of using the fifteen letters given, the reader is allowed to select any fifteen different letters of the alphabet that he may prefer. Then construct thirty-five groups in accordance with the conditions, and show as many good English words as possible.
