The bells should be rung as follows:â€”

`$$\begin{array}{cccc}1&2&3&4\\
2&1&4 &3\\
2&4&1 &3\\
4&2&3 &1\\
4&3& 2 &1\\
3&4& 1 &2\\
3&1& 4 &2\\
1&3& 2 &4\\
3&1& 2 &4\\
1&3& 4 &2\\
1&4& 3 &2\\
4&1& 2 &3\\
4&2&1 &3\\
2&4&3 &1\\
2&3& 4 &1\\
3&2&1 &4\\
2&3&1& 4\\
3&2&4 &1\\
3&4& 2 &1\\
4&3& 1 &2\\
4&1&3 &2\\
1&4&2 &3\\
1&2&4 &3\\
2 &1&3 &4\\
\end{array}$$`

I have constructed peals for five and six bells respectively, and a solution is possible for any number of bells under the conditions previously stated.
