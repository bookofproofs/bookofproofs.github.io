Here is a solution in nineteen moves; the moves enclosed in brackets count as one move only: `$19-17,$` `$16-18,$` `$(29-17,$` `$17-19),$` `$30-18,$` `$27-25,$` `$(22-24,$` `$24-26),$` `$31-23,$` `$(4-16,$` `$16-28),$` `$7-9,$` `$10-8,$` `$12-10,$` `$3-11,$` `$18-6,$` `$(1-3,$` `$3-11),$` `$(13-27,$` `$27-25),$` `$(21-7,$` `$7-9),$` `$(33-31,$` `$31-23),$` `$(10-8,$` `$8-22,$` `$22-24,$` `$24-26,$` `$26-12,$` `$12-10),$` `$5-17.$` All the counters are now removed except one, which is left in the central hole. The solution needs judgment, as one is tempted to make several jumps in one move, where it would be the reverse of good play. For example, after playing the first `$3-11$` above, one is inclined to increase the length of the move by continuing with `$11-25,$` `$25-27,$` or with `$11-9,$` `$9-7.$`

I do not think the number of moves can be reduced.
