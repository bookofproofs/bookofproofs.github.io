In order to place words round the circle under the conditions, it is necessary to select words in which letters are repeated in certain relative positions. Thus, the word that solves our puzzle is "Swansea," in which the first and fifth letters are the same, and the third and seventh the same. We make out jumps as follows, taking the letters of the word in their proper order: `$2-5,$` `$7-2,$` `$4-7,$` `$1-4,$` `$6-1,$` `$3-6,$` `$8 -3.$` Or we could place a word like "Tarapur" (in which the second and fourth letters, and the third and seventh, are alike) with these moves: `$6-1,$` `$7-4,$` `$2-7,$` `$5-2,$` `$8-5,$` `$3-6,$` `$8-3.$` But "Swansea" is the only word, apparently, that will fulfill the conditions of the puzzle.

This puzzle should be compared with Sharp's Puzzle, referred to in my solution to [The Four Frogs][bookofproofs$7322] The condition "touch and jump over two" is identical with "touch and move along a line."
