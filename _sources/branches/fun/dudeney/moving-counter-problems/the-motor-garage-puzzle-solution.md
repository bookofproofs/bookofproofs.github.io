The exchange of cars can be made in forty-three moves, as follows: `$6-G,$` `$2-B,$` `$1-E,$` `$3-H,$` `$4-I,$` `$3-L,$` `$6-K,$` `$4-G,$` `$1-I,$` `$2-J,$` `$5-H,$` `$4-A,$` `$7-F,$` `$8-E,$` `$4-D,$` `$8-C,$` `$7-A,$` `$8-G,$` `$5-C,$` `$2-B,$` `$1-E,$` `$8-I,$` `$1-G,$` `$2-J,$` `$7-H,$` `$1-A,$` `$7-G,$` `$2-B,$` `$6-E,$` `$3-H,$` `$8-L,$` `$3-I,$` `$7-K,$` `$3-G,$` `$6-I,$` `$2-J,$` `$5-H,$` `$3-C,$` `$5-G,$` `$2-B,$` `$6-E,$` `$5-I,$` `$6-J.$` Of course, "`$6-G$`" means that the car numbered "`$6$`" moves to the point "`$G.$`" There are other ways in forty-three moves.
