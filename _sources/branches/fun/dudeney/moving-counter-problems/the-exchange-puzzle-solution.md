Make the following exchanges of pairs: `$H-K, H-E,$` `$H-C, H-A,$` `$I-L, I-F,$` `$I-D, K-L,$` `$G-J, J-A,$` `$F-K, L-E,$` `$D-K, E-F,$` `$E-D, E-B,$` `$B-K.$` It will be found that, although the white counters can be moved to their proper places in `$11$` moves if we omit all consideration of exchanges, yet the black cannot be so moved in fewer than `$17$` moves. So we have to introduce waste moves with the white counters to equal the minimum required by the black. Thus fewer than `$17$` moves must be impossible. Some of the moves are, of course, interchangeable.
