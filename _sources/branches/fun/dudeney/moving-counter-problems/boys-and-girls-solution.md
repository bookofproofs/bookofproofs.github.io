There are a good many different solutions to this puzzle. Any contiguous pair, except `$7-8,$` may be moved first, and after the first move, there are variations. The following solution shows the position from the start right through each successive move to the end:â€”

`$$\begin{array}{cccccccccc}
.&.&1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8\\
4&3&1&2&.&.&5&6&7&8\\
4&3&1&2&7&6&5&.&.&8\\
4&3&1&2&7&.&.&5&6&8\\
4&.&.&2&7&1&3&5&6&8\\
4&8&6&2&7&1&3&5&.&.
\end{array}$$`
