Move the frogs in the following order: `$2,$` `$4,$` `$6,$` `$5,$` `$3,$` `$1$` (repeat these moves in the same order twice more), `$2,$` `$4,$` `$6.$` This is a solution in twenty-one moves — the fewest possible.

If `$n,$` the number of frogs, be [even][bookofproofs$2317], we require `$\frac{n^2+n}2$` moves, of which `$\frac{n^2-n}2$` will be leaps and `$n$` simple moves. If `$n$` be [odd][bookofproofs$2318], we shall need `$\frac{n^2+3n}2-4$` moves, of which  `$\frac{n^2-n}2$`  will be leaps and `$2n-4$` simple moves.

In the even cases write, for the moves, all the even numbers in ascending order and the odd numbers in descending order. This series must be repeated `$\frac n2$` times and followed by the even numbers in ascending order once only. Thus the solution for `$14$` frogs will be `$(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1)$` repeated `$7$` times and followed by `$2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 = 105$` moves.

In the odd cases, write the even numbers in ascending order and the odd numbers in descending order, repeat this series `$\frac {n-1}2$` times, follow with the even numbers in ascending order (omitting `$n-1$`), the odd numbers in descending order (omitting `$1$`), and conclude with all the numbers (odd and even) in their natural order (omitting `$1$` and `$n$`). Thus for `$11$` frogs: `$(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1)$` repeated `$5$` times, `$2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3,$` and `$2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 = 73$` moves.
