Two of the pots, `$13$` and `$19,$` were in their proper places. As every interchange may result in a pot being put in its place, it is clear that twenty-two interchanges will get them all in order. But this number of moves is not the fewest possible, the correct answer being seventeen. Exchange the following pairs: `$(3-1, 2-3),$` `$(15-4, 16-15),$` `$(17-7, 20-17),$` `$(24-10, 11-24, 12-11),$` `$(8-5, 6-8, 21-6, 23-21,$` `$22-23, 14-22, 9-14,$` `$18-9).$` When you have made the interchanges within any pair of brackets, all numbers within those brackets are in their places. There are five pairs of brackets, and `$5$` from `$22$` gives the number of changes required â€” `$17.$`
