To leave the three piles at the extreme ends of the rows, the cheeses may be moved as follows â€” the numbers refer to the cheeses and not to their positions in the row: `$7-2,$` `$8-7,$` `$9-8,$` `$10-15,$` `$6-10,$` `$5-6,$` `$14-16,$` `$13-14,$` `$12-13,$` `$3-1,$` `$4-3,$` `$11-4.$` This is probably the easiest solution of all to find. To get three of the piles on cheeses `$13,$` 14, and `$15,$` play thus: `$9-4,$` `$10-9,$` `$11-10,$` `$6-14,$` `$5-6,$` `$12-15,$` `$8-12,$` `$7-8,$` `$16-5,$` `$3-13,$` `$2-3,$` `$1-2.$` To leave the piles on cheeses `$3,$` `$5,$` `$12,$` and `$14,$` play thus: `$8-3,$` `$9-14,$` `$16-12,$` `$1-5,$` `$10-9,$` `$7-10,$` `$11-8,$` `$2-1,$` `$4-16,$` `$13-2,$` `$6-11,$` `$15-4.$`
