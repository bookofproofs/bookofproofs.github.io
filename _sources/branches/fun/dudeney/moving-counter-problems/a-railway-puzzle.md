Make a diagram, on a large sheet of paper, like the illustration, and have three counters marked `$A,$` three marked `$B,$` and three marked `$C.$` 

![q222](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/dudeney/q222.png?raw=true)

It will be seen that at the intersection of lines there are nine stopping-places, and a tenth stopping-place is attached to the outer circle like the tail of a `$Q.$` Place the three counters or engines marked `$A,$` the three marked `$B,$` and the three marked `$C$` at the places indicated. 

The puzzle is to move the engines, one at a time, along the lines, from stopping-place to stopping-place, until you succeed in getting an `$A,$` a `$B,$` and a `$C$` on each circle, and also `$A,$` `$B,$` and `$C$` on each straight line. You are required to do this in as few moves as possible. How many moves do you need?
