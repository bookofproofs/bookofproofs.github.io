This little puzzle may be solved in as few as nine moves. Play the engines as follows: From `$9$` to `$10,$` from `$6$` to `$9,$` from `$5$` to `$6,$` from `$2$` to `$5,$` from `$1$` to `$2,$` from `$7$` to `$1,$` from `$8$` to `$7,$` from `$9$` to `$8,$` and from `$10$` to 9. You will then have engines `$A, B,$` and `$C$` on each of the three circles and on each of the three straight lines. This is the shortest solution that is possible.
