Our six educated frogs have learned a new and pretty feat. When placed on glass tumblers, as shown in the illustration, they change sides so that the three black ones are to the left and the white frogs to the right, with the unoccupied tumbler at the opposite end â€” No. 7. They can jump to the next tumbler (if unoccupied), or over one, or two, frogs to an unoccupied tumbler. The jumps can be made in either direction, and a frog may jump over his own or the opposite color, or both colors. Four successive specimen jumps will make everything quite plain: `$4$` to `$1,$` `$5$` to `$4,$` `$3$` to `$5,$` `$6$` to `$3.$` Can you show how they do it in ten jumps?
