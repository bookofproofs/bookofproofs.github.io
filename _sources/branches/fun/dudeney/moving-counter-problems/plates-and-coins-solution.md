Number the plates from `$1$` to `$12$` in the order that the boy is seen to be going in the illustration. Starting from `$1,$` proceed as follows, where "`$1$` to `$4$`" means that you take the coin from plate No. `$1$` and transfer it to plate No. `$4$`: `$1$` to `$4,$` `$5$` to `$8,$` `$9$` to `$12,$` `$3$` to `$6,$` `$7$` to `$10,$` `$11$` to `$2,$` and complete the last revolution to `$1,$` making three revolutions in all. Or you can proceed this way: `$4$` to `$7,$` `$8$` to `$11,$` `$12$` to `$3,$` `$2$` to `$5,$` `$6$` to `$9,$` `$10$` to `$1.$` It is easy to solve in four revolutions, but the solutions in three are more difficult to discover.

This is "The Riddle of the Fishpond" (No. `$41,$` __Canterbury Puzzles__) in a different dress.
