In solving this puzzle there were two things to be achieved: first, so to manipulate the counters that the word VICTORIA should read round the cross in the same direction, only with the `$V$` on one of the dark arms; and secondly, to perform the feat in the fewest possible moves. Now, as a matter of fact, it would be impossible to perform the first part in any way whatever if all the letters of the word were different; but as there are two `$I$`'s, it can be done by making these letters change places — that is, the first `$I$` changes from the 2nd place to the 7th, and the second `$I$` from the 7th place to the 2nd. But the point `$I$` referred to, when introducing the puzzle, as a little remarkable is this: that a solution in twenty-two moves is obtainable by moving the letters in the order of the following words: "A VICTOR! A VICTOR! A VICTOR I!"

There are, however, just six solutions in eighteen moves, and the following is one of them: `$I (1),$` `$V, A,$` `$I (2),$` `$R, O,$` `$T, I$` `$(1), I$` `$(2),$` `$A, V,$` `$I (2),$` `$I (1),$` `$C, I$` `$(2), V,$` `$A, I (1).$` The first and second I in the word are distinguished by the numbers `$1$` and `$2.$`

It will be noticed that in the first solution given above one of the `$I$`'s never moves, though the movements of the other letters cause it to change its relative position. There is another peculiarity I may point out — that there is a solution in twenty-eight moves requiring no letter to move to the central division except the `$I$`'s. I may also mention that, in each of the solutions in eighteen moves, the letters `$C, T, O, R$` move once only, while the second `$I$` always moves four times, the `$V$` always being transferred to the right arm of the cross.
