This puzzle may be solved in as few as four moves, in the following manner: Move `$5$` over `$8,$` `$9,$` `$3,$` `$1.$` Move `$7$` over `$4.$` Move `$6$` over `$2$` and `$7.$` Move `$5$` over `$6,$` and all the counters are removed except `$5,$` which is left in the central square that it originally occupied.
