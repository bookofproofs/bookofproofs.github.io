Only six reversals are necessary. The white train (from `$A$` to `$D$`) is divided into three sections, engine and `$7$` wagons, `$8$` wagons, and `$1$` wagon. The black train ($D$ to `$A$`) never uncouples anything throughout. Fig. `$1$` is the original position with `$8$` and `$1$` uncoupled. The black train proceeds to the position in Fig. `$2$` (no reversal). The engine and `$7$` proceed towards `$D,$` and black train backs, leaves `$8$` on loop and takes up position in Fig. `$3$` (first reversal). The black train goes to the position in Fig. `$4$` to fetch single wagon (second reversal). Black train pushes `$8$` off the loop and leaves single wagon there, proceeding on its journey, as in Fig. `$5$` (third and fourth reversals). White train now backs on to loop to pick up a single car and goes right away to `$D$` (fifth and sixth reversals).
