Number the plates `$(1, 2, 3, 4),$` `$(5, 6, 7, 8),$` `$(9, 10, 11, 12),$` `$(13, 14, 15, 16)$` in successive rows from the top to the bottom. Then transfer the apple from `$8$` to `$10$` and play as follows, always removing the apple jumped over: `$9-11,$` `$1-9,$` `$13-5,$` `$16-8,$` `$4-12,$` `$12-10,$` `$3-1,$` `$1-9,$` `$9-11.$`
