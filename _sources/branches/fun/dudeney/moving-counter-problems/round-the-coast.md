Here is a puzzle that will, I think, be found as amusing as instructive. We are given a ring of eight circles. Leaving circle `$8$` blank, we are required to write in the name of a seven-lettered port in the United Kingdom in this manner. 

![q226](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/dudeney/q226.png?raw=true)

Touch a blank circle with your pencil, then jump over two circles in either direction around the ring, and write down the first letter. Then touch another vacant circle, jump over two circles, and write down your second letter. Proceed similarly with the other letters in their proper order until you have completed the word. Thus, suppose we select "Glasgow," and proceed as follows: `$6—1,$` `$7—2,$` `$8—3,$` `$7—4,$` `$8—5,$` which means that we touch `$6,$` jump over `$7$` and write down "G" on `$1;$` then touch `$7,$` jump over `$8$` and `$1,$` and write down "l" on `$2;$` and so on. It will be found that after we have written down the first five letters—"Glasg"—as above, we cannot go any further. Either there is something wrong with "Glasgow," or we have not managed our jumps properly. Can you get to the bottom of the mystery?
