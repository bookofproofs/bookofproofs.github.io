The solution to the Eight Engines Puzzle is as follows: The engine that has had its fire drawn and therefore cannot move is No. 5. Move the other engines in the following order: `$7,$` `$6,$` `$3,$` `$7,$` `$6,$` `$1,$` `$2,$` `$4,$` `$1,$` `$3,$` `$8,$` `$1,$` `$3,$` `$2,$` `$4,$` `$3,$` `$2,$` seventeen moves in all, leaving the eight engines in the required order.

There are two other slightly different solutions.
