There are `$252$` different ways. The general formula is that, for words of n letters (not palindromes, as in the case of the next puzzle), when grouped in this manner, there are always `$2^{(n+1)} - 4$` different readings. This does not allow diagonal readings, such as you would get if you used instead such a word as `$DIGGING,$` where it would be possible to pass from one `$G$` to another `$G$` by a diagonal step.
