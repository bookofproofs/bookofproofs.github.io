According to the conditions, in the strict sense in which one at first understands them, there is no possible solution to this puzzle. In such a dilemma one always has to look for some verbal quibble or trick. If the owner of house `$A$` will allow the water company to run their pipe for house `$C$` through his property (and we are not bound to assume that he would object), then the difficulty is got over, as shown in our illustration. It will be seen that the dotted line from `$W$` to `$C$` passes through house `$A,$` but no pipe ever crosses another pipe.
