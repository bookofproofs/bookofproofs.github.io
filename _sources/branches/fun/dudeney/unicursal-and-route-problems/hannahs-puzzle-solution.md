Starting from any one of the `$N$`'s, there are `$17$` different readings of `$NAH,$` or `$68$` ($4\times 17$) for the `$4$` `$N$`'s. Therefore there are also `$68$` ways of spelling `$HAN.$` If we were allowed to use the same `$N$` twice in a spelling, the answer would be `$68\times 68,$` or `$4,624$` ways. But the conditions were, "always passing from one letter to another." Therefore, for every one of the `$17$` ways of spelling `$HAN$` with a particular `$N,$` there would be `$51$` ways ($3\times 17$) of completing the `$NAH,$` or `$867$` ($17\times 51$) ways for the complete word. Hence, as there are four `$N$`'s to use in `$HAN,$` the correct solution of the puzzle is `$3,468$` ($4\times 867$) different ways.
