It can be done in twelve continuous strokes, thus: Start at `$A$` in the illustration, and eight strokes, forming the star, will bring you back to `$A;$` then one stroke around the circle to `$B,$` one stroke to `$C,$` one round the circle to `$D,$` and one final stroke to `$E$` â€” twelve in all. Of course, in practice the second circular stroke will be over the first one; it is separated in the diagram, and the points of the star not joined to the circle, to make the solution clear to the eye.
