This is a simple counting puzzle. In how many different ways can you spell out the word LEVEL by placing the point of your pencil on an `$L$` and then passing along the lines from letter to letter. You may go in any direction, backwards or forwards. Of course you are not allowed to miss letters â€” that is to say, if you come to a letter you must use it.
