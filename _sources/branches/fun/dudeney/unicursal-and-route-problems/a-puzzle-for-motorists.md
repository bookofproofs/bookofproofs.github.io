Eight motorists drove to church one morning. Their respective houses and churches, together with the only roads available (the dotted lines), are shown. One went from his house `$A$` to his church `$A,$` another from his house `$B$` to his church `$B,$` another from `$C$` to `$C,$` and so on, but it was afterwards found that no driver ever crossed the track of another car. Take your pencil and try to trace out their various routes.
