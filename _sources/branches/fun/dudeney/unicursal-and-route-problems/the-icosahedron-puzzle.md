The [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] is another of the five regular, or [Platonic][bookofproofs$1862], bodies having all their sides, angles, and planes similar and equal. It is bounded by twenty similar [equilateral][bookofproofs$688] triangles. If you cut out a piece of cardboard of the form shown in the smaller diagram and cut halfway through along the dotted lines, it will fold up and form a perfect icosahedron.

Now, a Platonic body does not mean a heavenly body; but it will suit the purpose of our puzzle if we suppose there to be a habitable planet of this shape. We will also suppose that owing to a superfluity of water, the only dry land is along the edges, and that the inhabitants have no knowledge of navigation. If every one of those edges is 10,000 miles long and a solitary traveler is placed at the North Pole (the highest point shown), how far will he have to travel before he will have visited every habitable part of the planetâ€”that is, have traversed every one of the edges?
