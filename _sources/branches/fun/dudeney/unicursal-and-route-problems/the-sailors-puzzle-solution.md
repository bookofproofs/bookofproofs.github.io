There are only four different routes (or eight, if we count the reverse ways) by which the sailor can start at the island marked `$A,$` visit all the islands once, and once only, and return again to `$A.$` Here they are:â€”

`$$\begin{array}{c}
A I P T L O E H R Q D C F U G N\\
S K M B A A I P T S N G L O E U\\
F C D K M B Q R H A A B M K S N\\
 G L T P I O E U F C D Q R H A A I\\
 P T L O E U G N S K M B Q D C F\\ R H A\end{array}$$`

Now, if the sailor takes the first route he will make `$C$` his 12th island (counting `$A$` as `$1$`); by the second route he will make `$C$` his 13th island; by the third route, his 16th island; and by the fourth route, his 17th island. If he goes the reverse way, `$C$` will be respectively his 10th, 9th, 6th, and 5th island. As these are the only possible routes, it is evident that if the sailor puts off his visit to `$C$` as long as possible, he must take the last route reading from left to right. This route I show by the dark lines in the diagram, and it is the correct answer to the puzzle.

The map may be greatly simplified by the [buttons and string" method, explained in the solution to "The Four Frogs][bookofproofs$7322]
