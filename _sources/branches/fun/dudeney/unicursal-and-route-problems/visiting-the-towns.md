![q243](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/dudeney/q243.png?raw=true)

A traveler, starting from town No. `$1,$` wishes to visit every one of the towns once, and once only, going only by roads indicated by straight lines. How many different routes are there from which he can select? Of course, he must end his journey at No. `$1,$` from which he started, and must take no notice of crossroads, but go straight from town to town. This is an absurdly easy puzzle if you go the right way to work.
