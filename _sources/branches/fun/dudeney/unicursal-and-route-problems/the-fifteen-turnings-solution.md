It will be seen from the illustration (where the roads not used are omitted) that the traveler can go as far as seventy miles in fifteen turnings. The turnings are all numbered in the order in which they are taken. It will be seen that he never visits nineteen of the towns. He might visit them all in fifteen turnings, never entering any town twice, and end at the black town from which he starts (see [The Rook's Tour][bookofproofs$7280]), but such a tour would only take him sixty-four miles.
