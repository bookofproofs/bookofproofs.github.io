The inspector need only travel nineteen miles if he starts at `$B$` and takes the following route: `$B A D$` `$G D E$` `$F I F$` `$C B E$` `$H K L$` `$I H G$` `$J K.$` Thus the only portions of line travelled over twice are the two sections `$D$` to `$G$` and `$F$` to `$I.$` Of course, the route may be varied, but it cannot be shortened.
