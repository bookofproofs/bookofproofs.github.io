The problem of the Bridges may be reduced to the simple diagram shown in the illustration. The point `$M$` represents the Monk, the point `$I$` the Island, and the point `$Y$` the Monastery. Now, the only direct ways from `$M$` to `$I$` are by the bridges `$a$` and `$b;$` the only direct ways from `$I$` to `$Y$` are by the bridges `$c$` and `$d;$` and there is a direct way from `$M$` to `$Y$` by the bridge `$e.$` Now, what we have to do is to count all the routes that will lead from `$M$` to `$Y,$` passing over all the bridges, `$a, b, c, d,$` and `$e$` once and once only. With the simple diagram under the eye it is quite easy, without any elaborate rule, to count these routes methodically.

Thus, starting from `$a, b,$` we find there are only two ways of completing the route; with `$a, c,$` there are only two routes; with `$a, d,$` only two routes; and so on. It will be found that there are sixteen such routes in all, as in the following list:â€”
`$$\begin{array}{c}a b e c d\\
a b e d c\\
a c d b e\\
a c e b d\\
a d e b c\\
a d c b e\\
b a e c d\\
b a e d c\\
b c d a e\\
b c e a d\\
b d c a e\\
b d e a c\\
e c a b d\\
e c b a d\\
e d a b c\\
e d b a c\\
\end{array}$$`

If the reader will transfer the letters indicating the bridges from the diagram to the corresponding bridges in the original illustration, everything will be quite obvious.
