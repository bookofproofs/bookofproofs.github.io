Note that there are six towns, from which only two roads issue. Thus `$1$` must lie between `$9$` and `$12$` in the circular route. Mark these two roads as settled. Similarly mark `$9,$` `$5,$` `$14,$` and `$4,$` `$8,$` `$14,$` and `$10,$` `$6,$` `$15,$` and `$10,$` `$2,$` `$13,$` and `$3,$` `$7,$` `$13.$` All these roads must be taken. Then you will find that he must go from `$4$` to `$15,$` as `$13$` is closed, and that he is compelled to take `$3,$` `$11,$` `$16,$` and also `$16,$` `$12.$` Thus, there is only one route, as follows: `$1,$` `$9,$` `$5,$` `$14,$` `$8,$` `$4,$` `$15,$` `$6,$` `$10,$` `$2,$` `$13,$` `$7,$` `$3,$` `$11,$` `$16,$` `$12,$` `$1,$` or its reverse â€” reading the line the other way. Seven roads are not used.
