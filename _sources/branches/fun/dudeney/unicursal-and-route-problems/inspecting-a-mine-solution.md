Starting from `$A,$` the inspector need only travel `$36$` furlongs if he takes the following route: `$A$` to `$B,$` `$G,$` `$H,$` `$C, D,$` `$I, H,$` `$M, N,$` `$I, J,$` `$O, N,$` `$S, R,$` `$M, L,$` `$G, F,$` `$K, L,$` `$Q, R,$` `$S, T,$` `$O, J,$` `$E, D,$` `$C, B,$` `$A, F,$` `$K, P, Q.$` He thus passes between `$A$` and `$B$` twice, between `$C$` and `$D$` twice, between `$F$` and `$K$` twice, between `$J$` and `$O$` twice, and between `$R$` and `$S$` twice â€” five repetitions. Therefore `$31$` passages plus `$5$` repeated equal `$36$` furlongs. The little pitfall in this puzzle lies in the fact that we start from an even node. Otherwise, we need only travel `$35$` furlongs.
