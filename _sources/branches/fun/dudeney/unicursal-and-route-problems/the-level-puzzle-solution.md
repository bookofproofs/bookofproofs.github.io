Let us confine our attention to the `$L$` in the top left-hand corner. Suppose we go by way of the `$E$` on the right: we must then go straight on to the `$V,$` from which letter the word may be completed in four ways, for there are four `$E$`'s available through which we may reach an `$L.$` There are therefore four ways of reading through the right-hand `$E.$` It is also clear that there must be the same number of ways through the `$E$` that is immediately below our starting point. That makes eight. If, however, we take the third route through the `$E$` on the diagonal, we then have the option of any one of the three `$V$`'s, by means of each of which we may complete the word in four ways. We can, therefore, spell `$LEVEL$` in twelve ways through the diagonal `$E.$` Twelve added to eight gives twenty readings, all emanating from the `$L$` in the top left-hand corner; and as the four corners are equal, the answer must be four times twenty, or eighty different ways.
