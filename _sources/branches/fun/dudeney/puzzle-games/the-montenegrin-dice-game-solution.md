The players should select the pairs `$5$` and `$9,$` and `$13$` and `$15,$` if the chances of winning are to be quite equal. There are `$216$` different ways in which the three dice may fall. They may add up `$5$` in `$6$` different ways and `$9$` in `$25$` different ways, making `$31$` chances out of `$216$` for the player who selects these numbers. Also, the dice may add up `$13$` in `$21$` different ways, and `$15$` in `$10$` different ways, thus giving the other player also `$31$` chances in `$216.$`
