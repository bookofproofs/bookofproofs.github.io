No matter whether he plays first or second, the player `$A,$` who starts the game at `$55,$` must win. Assuming that `$B$` adopts the very best lines of play in order to prolong as much as possible his existence, `$A,$` if he has the first move, can always on his `$12$`th move capture `$B;$` and if he has the second move, `$A$` can always on his `$14$`th move make the capture. His point is always to get diagonally in line with his opponent, and by going to `$33,$` if he has the first move, he prevents `$B$` getting diagonally in line with himself. Here are two good games. The number in front of the hyphen is always `$A$`'s move; that after the hyphen is `$B$`'s:â€”
 `$33-8,$` `$32-15,$` `$31-22,$` `$30-21,$` `$29-14,$` `$22-7,$` `$15-6,$` `$14-2,$` `$7-3,$` `$6-4,$` `$11-,$` and `$A$` must capture on his next ($12$th) move, `$-13,$` `$54-20,$` `$53-27,$` `$52-34,$` `$51-41,$` `$50-34,$` `$42-27,$` `$35-20,$` `$28-13,$` `$21-6,$` `$14-2,$` `$7-3,$` `$6-4,$` `$11-,$` and `$A$` must capture on his next ($14$th) move.
