Here is a little game that is childishly simple in its conditions. But it is worth investigation.

Mr. Stubbs pulled a small table between himself and his friend, Mr. Wilson, and took a box of matches, from which he counted out thirty.

"Here are thirty matches," he said. "I divide them into three unequal heaps. Let me see. We have `$14,$` `$11,$` and `$5,$` as it happens. Now, the two players draw alternately any number from anyone heap, and he who draws the last match loses the game. That's all! I will play with you, Wilson. I have formed the heaps, so you have the first draw."

"As I can draw any number," Mr. Wilson said, "suppose I exhibit my usual moderation and take all the `$14$` heap."

"That is the worst you could do, for it loses right away. I take `$6$` from the `$11,$` leaving two equal heaps of `$5,$` and to leave two equal heaps is a certain win (with the single exception of `$1,$` `$1),$` because whatever you do in one heap I can repeat in the other. If you leave `$4$` in one heap, I leave `$4$` in the other. If you then leave `$2$` in one heap, I leave `$2$` in the other. If you leave only `$1$` in one heap, then I take all the other heap. If you take all one heap, I take all but one in the other. No, you must never leave two heaps, unless they are equal heaps and more than `$1, 1.$` Let's begin again."

"Very well, then," said Mr. Wilson. "I will take `$6$` from the `$14,$` and leave you `$8, 11, 5.$`"

Mr. Stubbs then left `$8, 11, 3;$` Mr. Wilson `$8, 5, 3;$` Mr. Stubbs `$6, 5, 3;$` Mr. Wilson `$4, 5, 3;$` Mr. Stubbs `$4, 5, 1;$` Mr. Wilson `$4, 3, 1;$` Mr. Stubbs `$2, 3, 1;$` Mr. Wilson  `$2, 1, 1;$` which Mr. Stubbs reduced to `$1, 1, 1.$`

"It is now quite clear that I must win," said Mr. Stubbs, because you must take `$1,$` and then I take `$1,$` leaving you the last match. You never had a chance. There are just thirteen different ways in which the matches may be grouped at the start for a certain win. In fact, the groups selected, `$14, 11, 5,$` are a certain win, because for whatever your opponent may play there is another winning group you can secure, and so on and on down to the last match."
