The annexed diagram shows a second way of performing the Queen's Tour. If you break the line at the point `$J$` and erase the shorter portion of that line, you will have the required path solution for any `$J$` square. If you break the line at `$I,$` you will have a non-re-entrant solution starting from any `$I$` square. And if you break the line at `$G,$` you will have a solution for any `$G$` square. The Queen's Tour previously given may be similarly broken at three different places, but I seized the opportunity of exhibiting a second tour.
