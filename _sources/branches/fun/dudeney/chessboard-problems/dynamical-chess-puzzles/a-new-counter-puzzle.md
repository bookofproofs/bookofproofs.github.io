Here is a new puzzle with moving counters, or coins, that at first glance looks as if it must be absurdly simple. But it will be found quite a little perplexity. I give it in this place for a reason that I will explain when we come to the next puzzle. Copy the simple diagram, enlarged, on a sheet of paper; then place two white counters on the points `$1$` and `$2,$` and two red counters on `$9$` and `$10.$` 

The puzzle is to make the red and white change places. 

You may move the counters one at a time in any order you like, along the lines from point to point, with the only restriction that a red and a white counter may never stand at once on the same straight line. Thus the first move can only be from `$1$` or `$2$` to `$3,$` or from `$9$` or `$10$` to `$7.$`
