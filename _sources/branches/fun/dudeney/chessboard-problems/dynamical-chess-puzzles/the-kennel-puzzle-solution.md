The first point is to make a choice of the most promising knight's string and then consider the question of reaching the arrangement in the fewest moves. I am strongly of opinion that the best string is the one represented in the following diagram, in which it will be seen that each successive number is a knight's move from the preceding one and that five of the dogs `$(1, 5, 10, 15,$` and `$20)$` never leave their original kennels.

This position may be arrived at in as few as forty-six moves, as follows: `$16—21,$` `$16—22,$` `$16—23,$` `$17—16,$` `$12—17,$` `$12—22,$` `$12—21,$` `$7—12,$` `$7—17,$` `$7—22,$` `$11—12,$` `$11—17,$` `$2—7,$` `$2—12,$` `$6—11,$` `$8—7,$` `$8—6,$` `$13—8,$` `$18—13,$` `$11—18,$` `$2—17,$` `$18—12,$` `$18—7,$` `$18—2,$` `$13—7,$` `$3—8,$` `$3—13,$` `$4—3,$` `$4—8,$` `$9—4,$` `$9—3,$` `$14—9,$` `$14—4,$` `$19—14,$` `$19—9,$` `$3—14,$` `$3—19,$` `$6—12,$` `$6—13,$` `$6—14,$` `$17—11,$` `$12—16,$` `$2—12,$` `$7—17,$` `$11—13,$` `$16—18 = 46$` moves. I am, of course, not able to say positively that a solution cannot be discovered in fewer moves, but I believe it will be found a very hard task to reduce the number.
