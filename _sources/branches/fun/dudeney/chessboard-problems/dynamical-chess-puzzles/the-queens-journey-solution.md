The correct solution to this puzzle is shown in the diagram by the dark line. The five moves indicated will take the queen the greatest distance that it is possible for her to go in five moves, within the conditions. The dotted line shows the route that most people suggest, but it is not quite so long as the other. Let us assume that the distance from the center of any square to the center of the next in the same horizontal or vertical line is `$2$` inches and that the queen travels from the center of her original square to the center of the one at which she rests. Then the first route will be found to exceed `$67.9$` inches, while the dotted route is less than `$67.8$` inches. The difference is small, but it is sufficient to settle the point as to the longer route. All other routes are shorter still than these two.
