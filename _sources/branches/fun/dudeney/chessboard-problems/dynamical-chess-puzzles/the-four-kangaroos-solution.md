A pretty symmetrical solution to this puzzle is shown in the diagram. Each of the four kangaroos makes his little excursion and returns to his corner, without ever entering a square that has been visited by another kangaroo and without crossing the central line.

It will at once occur to the reader, as a possible improvement of the puzzle, to divide the board by a central vertical line and make the condition that this also shall not be crossed. This would mean that each kangaroo had to confine himself to a square `$4$` by `$4,$` but it would be quite impossible, as I shall explain in the next two puzzles.
