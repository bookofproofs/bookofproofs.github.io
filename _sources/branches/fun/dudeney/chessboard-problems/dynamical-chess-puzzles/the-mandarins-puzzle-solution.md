The rather perplexing point that the solver has to decide for himself in attacking this puzzle is whether the shaded numbers (those that are shown in their right places) are mere dummies or not. Ninety-nine persons out of a hundred might form the opinion that there can be no advantage in moving any of them, but if so they would be wrong.

The shortest solution without moving any shaded number is in thirty-two moves. But the puzzle can be solved in thirty moves. The trick lies in moving the `$6,$` or the `$15,$` on the second move and replacing it on the nineteenth move. Here is the solution: `$2, 6, 13, 4, 1, 21, 4, 1, 10, 2, 21, 10, 2, 5, 22, 16, 1, 13, 6, 19, 11, 2, 5, 22, 16, 5, 13, 4, 10, 21.$` Thirty moves.
