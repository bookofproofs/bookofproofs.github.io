Call one pawn `$A$` and the other `$B.$` Now, owing to that optional first move, either pawn may make either `$5$` or `$6$` moves in reaching the eighth square. There are, therefore, four cases to be considered:

1. `$A$` `$6$` moves and `$B$` `$6$` moves;
1. `$A$` `$6$` moves and `$B$` `$5$` moves;
1. `$A$` `$5$` moves and `$B$` `$6$` moves;
1. `$A$` `$5$` moves and `$B$` `$5$` moves.

In case (1) there are `$12$` moves, and we may select any `$6$` of these for `$A.$` Therefore `$7 \times 8 \times 9 \times 10 \times 11 \times 12$` divided by `$1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 6$` gives us the number of variations for this case â€” that is, `$924.$`

Similarly for case (2), `$6$` selections out of `$11$` will be `$462$`:

In case (3), `$5$` selections out of `$11$` will also be `$462.$`

And in case (4), `$5$` selections out of `$10$` will be `$252.$`

Add these four numbers together and we get `$2,100,$` which is the correct number of different ways in which the pawns may advance under the conditions. (See [The Glass Balls][bookofproofs$7196])
