Working independently, the same position was arrived at by Messrs. S. Loyd, E.N. Frankenstein, W.H. Thompson, and myself. So the following may be accepted as the best solution possible to this curious problem :â€”

1. d2-d4 e7-e5
1. Qd1-d3 Qd8-h4
1. Qd3-g3 Bf8-b4
1. Nb1-d2 a7-a5
1. a2-24 d7-d6
1. h2-h3 Bc8-e6
1. Ra1-a3 f7-f5
1. Qg3-h2 c7-c5
1. Ra3-g3 Be6-b3
1. c2-c4 f5-f4
1. f2-f3 e5-e4
1. d4-d5 e4-e3 (draw!)

And White is stalemated. We give a diagram of the curious position arrived at. It will be seen that not one of White's pieces may be moved.
