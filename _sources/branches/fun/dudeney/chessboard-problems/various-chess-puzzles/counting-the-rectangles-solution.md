There are `$1,296$` different rectangles in all, `$204$` of which are squares, counting the square board itself as one, and `$1,092$` rectangles that are not squares. The general formula is that a board of `$n^2$` squares contains `$$\frac{(n^2+n)^2 }{4}$$` rectangles, of which `$$\frac{2n^3 + 3n^2 + n}6$$` are squares and `$$\frac{3n^4 + 2n^3 - 3n^2 - 2n}{12}$$` are rectangles that are not squares. It is curious and interesting that the total number of rectangles is always the square of the triangular number whose side is `$n.$`
