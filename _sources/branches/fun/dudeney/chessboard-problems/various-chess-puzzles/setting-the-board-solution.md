The White pawns may be arranged in `$40,320$` ways, the White rooks in `$2$` ways, the bishops in `$2$` ways, and the knights in `$2$` ways. Multiply these numbers together, and we find that the White pieces may be placed in `$322,560$` different ways. The Black pieces may, of course, be placed in the same number of ways. Therefore the men may be set up in `$322,560 \times 322,560 = 104,044,953,600$` ways. But the point that nearly everybody overlooks is that the board may be placed in two different ways for every arrangement. Therefore the answer is doubled and is `$208,089,907,200$` different ways.
