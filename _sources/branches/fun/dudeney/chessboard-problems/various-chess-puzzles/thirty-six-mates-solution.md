Place the remaining eight White pieces thus: K at KB 4th, Q at QKt 6th, R at Q 6th, R at KKt 7th, B at Q 5th, B at KR 8th, Kt at QR 5th, and Kt at QB 5th. The following mates can then be given:â€”

By discovery from Q | 8
:------------- |:-------------
 By discovery from R at Q 6th| 13
 By discovery from B at R 8th| 11
 Given by Kt at R 5th	| 2
 Given by pawns	| 2
_>. Total	|_>. 36
