In how many different ways may I place six pawns on the chessboard so that there shall be an [even][bookofproofs$2317] number of unoccupied squares in every row and every column? We are not here considering the diagonals at all, and every different six squares occupied makes a different solution, so we have not to exclude reversals or reflections.
