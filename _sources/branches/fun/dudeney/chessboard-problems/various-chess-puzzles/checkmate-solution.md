Remove the White pawn from B 6th to K 4th and place a Black pawn on Black's KB 2nd. Now, White plays P to K 5th, check, and Black must play P to B 4th. Then White plays P takes P en passant, checkmate. This was, therefore, White's last move and leaves the position given. It is the only possible solution.
