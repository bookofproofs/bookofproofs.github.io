Place two pawns in the middle of the chessboard, one at `$Q 4$` and the other at `$K 5.$` Now, place the remaining fourteen pawns (sixteen in all) so that no three shall be in a straight line in any possible direction.

Note that I purposely do not say queens, because by the words "any possible direction" I go beyond attacks on diagonals. The pawns must be regarded as mere points in space â€” at the centers of the squares. See dotted lines in the case of [The Eight Queens][bookofproofs$7232]
