Here is the solution. Only `$8$` queens or `$8$` rooks can be placed on the board without attack, while the greatest number of bishops is `$14,$` and of knights `$32.$` But as all these knights must be placed on squares of the same color, while the queens occupy four of each color and the bishops `$7$` of each color, it follows that only `$21$` knights can be placed on the same color in this puzzle. More than `$21$` knights can be placed alone on the board if we use both colors, but I have not succeeded in placing more than `$21$` on the "crowded chessboard." I believe the above solution contains the maximum number of pieces, but possibly some ingenious reader may succeed in getting in another knight.
