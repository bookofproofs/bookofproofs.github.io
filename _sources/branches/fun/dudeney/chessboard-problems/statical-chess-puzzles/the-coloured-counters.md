The diagram represents twenty-five colored counters, Red, Blue, Yellow, Orange, and Green (indicated by their initials), and there are five of each color, numbered `$1, 2, 3, 4,$` and `$5.$` The problem is so to place them in a square that neither color nor number shall be found repeated in any one of the five rows, five columns, and two diagonals. Can you so rearrange them?
