The moves will be made quite clear by a reference to the diagrams, which show the position on the board after each of the four moves. The darts indicate the successive removals that have been made. It will be seen that at every stage all the squares are either attacked or occupied and that after the fourth move no queen attacks any other. In the case of the last move, the queen in the top row might also have been moved one square farther to the left. This is, I believe, the only solution to the puzzle.
