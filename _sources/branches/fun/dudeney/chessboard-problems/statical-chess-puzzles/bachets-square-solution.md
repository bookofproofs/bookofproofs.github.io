Let us use the letters `$A, K, Q, J,$` to denote ace, king, queen, jack; and `$D, S, H, C,$` to denote diamonds, spades, hearts, clubs. In Diagrams `$1$` and `$2$`, we have the two available ways of arranging either group of letters so that no two similar letters shall be in line â€” although a quarter-turn of `$1$` will give us the arrangement in `$2.$`

If we superimpose or combine these two squares, we get the arrangement of Diagram `$3,$` which is one solution. But in each square, we may put the letters in the top line in twenty-four different ways without altering the scheme of arrangement.

Thus, in Diagram `$4$` the `$S$`'s are similarly placed to the `$D$`'s in `$2,$` the `$H$`'s to the `$S$`'s, the `$C$`'s to the `$H$`'s, and the `$D$`'s to the `$C$`'s. It clearly follows that there must be `$24 \times 24 = 576$` ways of combining the two primitive arrangements. But the error that Labosne fell into was that of assuming that the `$A, K, Q, J$` must be arranged in the form `$1,$` and the `$D, S, H, C$` in the form `$2.$` He thus included reflections and half-turns, but not quarter-turns. They may obviously be interchanged. So that the correct answer is `$2 \times 576 = 1,152,$` counting reflections and reversals as different. Put in another manner, the pairs in the top row may be written in `$16 \times 9 \times 4 \times 1 = 576$` different ways, and the square then completed in `$2$` ways, making `$1,152$` ways in all.
