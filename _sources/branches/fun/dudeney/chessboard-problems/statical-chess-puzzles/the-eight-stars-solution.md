The solution of this puzzle is shown in the first diagram. It is the only possible solution within the conditions stated. But if one of the eight stars had not already been placed as shown, there would then have been eight ways of arranging the stars according to this scheme, if we count reversals and reflections as different. If you turn this page around so that each side is in turn at the bottom, you will get the four reversals; and if you reflect each of these in a mirror, you will get the four reflections. These are, therefore, merely eight aspects of one "fundamental solution." But without that first star being so placed, there is another fundamental solution, as shown in the second diagram. But this arrangement being in a way symmetrical only produces four different aspects by reversal and reflection.
