The following arrangement shows how sixteen stamps may be stuck on the card, under the conditions, of a total value of fifty pence, or `$4$`s. `$2$`d.:â€”

If, after placing the four `$5$`d. stamps, the reader is tempted to place four `$4$`d. stamps also, he can afterward only place two of each of the three other denominations, thus losing two spaces and counting no more than forty-eight pence, or `$4$`s. This is the pitfall that was hinted at. (Compare with No. `$43,$` __Canterbury Puzzles.__)
