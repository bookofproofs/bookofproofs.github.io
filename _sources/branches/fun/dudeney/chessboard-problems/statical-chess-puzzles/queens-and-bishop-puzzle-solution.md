The bishop is on the square originally occupied by the rook, and the four queens are so placed that every square is either occupied or attacked by a piece. (Fig. `$1.$`)

I pointed out in 1899 that if four queens are placed as shown in the diagram (Fig. `$2$`), then the fifth queen may be placed on any one of the twelve squares marked `$a, b, c, d,$` and `$e;$` or a rook on the two squares, `$c;$` or a bishop on the eight squares, `$a, b,$` and `$e;$` or a pawn on the square `$b;$` or a king on the four squares, `$b, c,$` and `$e.$`

The only known arrangement for four queens and a knight is that given by Mr. J. Wallis in The Strand Magazine for August 1908, here reproduced. (Fig. `$3.$`)

I have recorded a large number of solutions with four queens and a rook, or bishop, but the only arrangement, I believe, with three queens and two rooks in which all the pieces are guarded is that of which I give an illustration (Fig. `$4$`), first published by Dr. C. Planck.

But I have since found the accompanying solution with three queens, a rook, and a bishop, though the pieces do not protect one another. (Fig. `$5.$`)
