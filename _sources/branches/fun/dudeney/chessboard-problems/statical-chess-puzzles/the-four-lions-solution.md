There are only seven different ways under the conditions. They are as follows: `$1 2 3 4,$` `$1 2 4 3,$` `$1 3 2 4,$` `$1 3 4 2,$` `$1 4 3 2,$` `$2 1 4 3,$` `$2 4 1 3.$` Taking the last example, this notation means that we place a lion in the second square of the first row, fourth square of the second row, first square of the third row, and third square of the fourth row. The first example is, of course, the one we gave when setting the puzzle.
