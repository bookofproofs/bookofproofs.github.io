The illustration represents a box containing thirty-six letter-blocks. The puzzle is to rearrange these blocks so that no `$A$` shall be in a line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally with another `$A,$` no `$B$` with another `$B,$` no `$C$` with another `$C,$` and so on. You will find it impossible to get all the letters into the box under these conditions, but the point is to place as many as possible. Of course, no letters other than those shown may be used.
