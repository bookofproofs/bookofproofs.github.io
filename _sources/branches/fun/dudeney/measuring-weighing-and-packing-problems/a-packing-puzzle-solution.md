On the side of the box, `$14$` by `$22 \frac 45,$` we can arrange `$13$` rows containing alternately `$7$` and `$6$` balls, or `$85$` in all. Above this, we can place another layer consisting of `$12$` rows of `$7$` and `$6$` alternately, or a total of `$78.$` In the length of `$24\frac{9}{10}$` inches `$15$` such layers may be packed, the alternate layers containing `$85$` and `$78$` balls. Thus `$8$` times `$85$` added to `$7$` times `$78$` gives us `$1,226$` for the full contents of the box.
