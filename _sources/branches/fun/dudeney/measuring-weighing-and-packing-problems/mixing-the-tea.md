"Mrs. Spooner called this morning," said the honest grocer to his assistant. "She wants twenty pounds of tea at `$2$`s. `$4.5$`d. per lb. Of course, we have a good `$2$`s. `$6$`d. tea, a slightly inferior at `$2$`s. `$3$`d., and a cheap Indian at `$1$`s. `$9$`d., but she is very particular always about her prices."

"What do you propose to do?" asked the innocent assistant.

"Do?" exclaimed the grocer. "Why, just mix up the three teas in different proportions so that the twenty pounds will work out fairly at the lady's price. Only don't put in more of the best tea than you can help, as we make less profit on that, and of course, you will use only our complete pound packets. Don't do any weighing."

How was the poor fellow to mix the three teas? Could you have shown him how to do it?
