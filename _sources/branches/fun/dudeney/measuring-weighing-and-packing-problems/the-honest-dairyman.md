An honest dairyman in preparing his milk for public consumption employed a can marked `$B,$` containing milk, and a can marked A, containing water. From can `$A$` he poured enough to double the contents of can `$B.$` Then he poured from can `$B$` into can `$A$` enough to double its contents. Then he finally poured from can `$A$` into can `$B$` until their contents were exactly equal.

After these operations, he would send the can `$A$` to London, and the puzzle is to discover what are the relative proportions of milk and water that he provides for the Londoners' breakfast-tables. Do they get equal proportions of milk and water — or two parts of milk and one of water — or what? It is an interesting question, though, curiously enough, we are not told how much milk or water he puts into the cans at the start of his operations.
