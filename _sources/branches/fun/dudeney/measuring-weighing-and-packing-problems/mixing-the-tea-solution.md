There are three ways of mixing the teas. Taking them in the order of quality, `$2$`s. `$6$`d., `$2$`s. `$3$`d., `$1$`s. `$9$`p., mix `$16$` lbs., `$1$` lb., `$3$` lbs.; or `$14$` lbs., `$4$` lbs., `$2$` lbs.; or `$12$` lbs., `$7$` lbs., `$1$` lb. In every case, the twenty pounds mixture should be worth `$2$`s. `$4.5$`d. per pound; but the last case requires the smallest quantity of the best tea, therefore it is the correct answer.
