The box should be `$100$` inches by `$100$` inches by `$11$` inches deep, internal dimensions. We can lay flat at the bottom a row of eight slabs, lengthways, end to end, which will just fill one side, and nine of these rows will dispose of seventy-two slabs (all on the bottom), with a space left over on the bottom measuring `$100$` inches by `$1$` inch by `$1$` inch. Now make eleven depths of such seventy-two slabs, and we have packed `$792,$` and have a space of `$100$` inches by `$1$` inch by `$11$` inches deep. In this, we may exactly pack the remaining eight slabs on edge, end to end.
