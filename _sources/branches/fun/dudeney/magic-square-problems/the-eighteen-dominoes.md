The illustration shows eighteen dominoes arranged in the form of a square so that the pips in every one of the six columns, six rows, and two long diagonals add up `$13.$` This is the smallest summation possible with any selection of dominoes from an ordinary box of twenty-eight. The greatest possible summation is `$23,$` and a solution for this number may be easily obtained by substituting for every number its complement to `$6.$` Thus for every blank substitute a `$6,$` for every `$1$` a `$5,$` for every `$2$` a `$4,$` for `$3$` a `$3,$` for `$4$` a `$2,$` for `$5$` a `$1,$` and for `$6$` a blank. But the puzzle is to make a selection of eighteen dominoes and arrange them (in exactly the form shown below) so that the summations shall be `$18$` in all the fourteen directions mentioned.
