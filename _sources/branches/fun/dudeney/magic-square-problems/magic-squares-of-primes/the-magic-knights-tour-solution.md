Here each successive number (in numerical order) is a knight's move from the preceding number, and as `$64$` is a knight's move from `$1,$` the tour is "re-entrant." All the columns and rows add up `$260.$` Unfortunately, it is not a perfect magic square, because the diagonals are incorrect, one adding up `$264$` and the other `$256$` â€” requiring only the transfer of `$4$` from one diagonal to the other. I think this is the best result that has ever been obtained (either re-entrant or not), and nobody can yet say whether a perfect solution is possible or impossible.
