There are many different ways of arranging the numbers, and either the `$2$` or the `$3$` may be omitted from the "T" enclosure. The arrangement that I give is a "nasik" square. Out of the total of `$28,800$` nasik squares of the fifth order this is the only one (with its one reflection) that fulfils the "T" condition. This puzzle was suggested to me by Dr. C. Planck.
