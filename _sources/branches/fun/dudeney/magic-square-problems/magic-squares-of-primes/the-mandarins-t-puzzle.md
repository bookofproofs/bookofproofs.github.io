Before Mr. Beauchamp Cholmondely Marjoribanks set out on his tour in the Far East, he prided himself on his knowledge of magic squares, a subject that he had made his special hobby; but he soon discovered that he had never really touched more than the fringe of the subject and that the wily Chinee could beat him easily. I present a little problem that one learned mandarin propounded to our traveller, as depicted on the last page.

The Chinaman, after remarking that the construction of the ordinary magic square of twenty-five cells is "too velly muchee easy," asked our countryman so to place the numbers `$1$` to `$25$` in the square that every column, every row, and each of the two diagonals should add up `$65,$` with only prime numbers on the shaded "T." Of course, the prime numbers available are `$1, 2, 3, 5,$` `$7, 11, 13, 17,$` `$19,$` and `$23,$` so you are at liberty to select any nine of these that will serve your purpose. Can you construct this curious little magic square?
