Arrange the cards as follows for the three new squares:—
`$$\begin{array}{ccc}
3&2&4\\
4&3&2\\
2&4&3\\
\\
6&5&7\\
7&6&5\\
5&7&6\\
\\
9&8&10\\
10&9&8\\
8&10&9\\
\end{array}$$`

Three aces and one ten are not used. The summations of the four squares are thus: `$9,$` `$15,$` `$18,$` and `$27$` — all different, as required.
