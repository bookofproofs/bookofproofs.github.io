You can use your mentalist power to impress people by guessing the number they have thought:

* Ask somebody to think a number between `\(1\)` and `\(100\)`.
(e.g. `\(41\)`)
* Ask your partner to double the number.
(e.g. `\(41\cdot 2=82\)`)
* Next, she/he should add `\(5\)` to the result.
(e.g. `\(82 + 5=87\)`)
* Next, she/he should multiply the result by `\(10\)` and tell you the result.
(e.g. `\(87\cdot 10=870\)`)

### Finding out the number thought by your partner

Now, pretend to use your "mentalist powers" and without explaining, what you are doing, perform the following calculations:

* Calculate the half the result mentally.
(e.g. `\(870 / 2=435\)`)
* Cancel the last digit 
(e.g. `\(43\not 5=43\)`)
* Subtract `\(2\)` and tell the result 
(e.g. `\(43 - 2=41\)`)

Think about, why this trick always works. If you have a solution, edit this article correspondingly, or provide a comment.
