A sociologist, a physicist and a mathematician have a trip by train and sit together in one compartment. They look out of the window and see a black sheep.

Sociologist says: "There are black sheep here."

Physicists comments: "Wrong, there is at least one sheep here."

Mathematician comments: "Wrong, there is at least one sheep here, which has at least one black side".
