The [$T_2$ separation property][bookofproofs$6199] of [topological spaces][bookofproofs$6189] can be inherited as follows:

1. The `$T_2$` property is [hereditary][bookofproofs$8592], i.e. every [topological subspace][bookofproofs$8566] of a `$T_2$` space is a `$T_2$` space.
1. Every [topological sum][bookofproofs$8568] of `$T_2$` spaces is a `$T_2$` space.
1. Every [topological sum][bookofproofs$8568] of `$T_2$` spaces is a `$T_2$` space.
