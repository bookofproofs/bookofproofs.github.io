Let `$(X,\mathcal O)$` be a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189].
* The set `$V$` of all [limit points][bookofproofs$8573] of a  [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$U\subset X$` is called **derived** of `$U$`.
* If `$U$` contains no [isolated points][bookofproofs$8573], it is called *dense-in-itself*.
* A [closed][bookofproofs$853] dense-in-itself set `$U$` is called *perfect.*

### Notes

* Generally, derived sets contain some points of `$U$` and some points of the complement `$U^C$`.
* By definition, dense-in-itself and perfect sets contain no isolated points.
* But this is also the case for derived sets: Any isolated point of `$U$` is necessarily not in a derived set of `$U,$` otherwise there would be open sets in `$U$` containing both, the isolated point and a distinct limit of `$U.$`
