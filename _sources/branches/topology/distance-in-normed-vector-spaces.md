Let `\((V,\|~\|)\)` be a [normed vector space][bookofproofs$846]. Then `\[d(x,y):=\|x-y\|,~~~~~~~(x,y\in V)\]` defines a [distance][bookofproofs$614] on `\(V\)`[^1]. 


[^1]: We also may use the notation `\(\|x,y\|\)` instead of `\(\|x-y\|\)`, since `\(\|x-y\|=\|y-x\|\)` and it does not matter if we express the distance as `\(\|x-y\|\)` or `\(\|y-x\|\)`.
