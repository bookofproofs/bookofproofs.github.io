It is easily verified from the axioms of a [topology][bookofproofs$6189] that every  [set][bookofproofs$550] `$X$` together has two particular topologies:

* its [power set][bookofproofs$6831] `$\mathcal P(X)$` (containing _all_ possible subsets of `$X$`), called the **discrete topology** of `$X,$` and
* the set `$\{X,\emptyset\},$` (containing the greatest and the smallest subset of `$X$`), called the **indiscrete topology** of `$X.$`
