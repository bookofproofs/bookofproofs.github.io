Let `\(U\subseteq M\)` be a an [open][bookofproofs$852] [subset][bookofproofs$552] of a [manifold][bookofproofs$6200] `\(M\)` a let `\(V\subseteq\mathbb R^{n}\)` be an open subset of the [`\(n\)`-dimensional metric space or real numbers][bookofproofs$1206] `\(\mathbb {R} ^{n}\)`.

Every [homeomorphism][bookofproofs$6197] `\(\varphi \colon U\longrightarrow V\)` is called a *(topological) chart* of `\(M\)`.
