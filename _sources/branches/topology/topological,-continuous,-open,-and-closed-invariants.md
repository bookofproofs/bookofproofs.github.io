A property of a topological space `$(X,\mathcal O_X)$` is called

* a **topological invariant**, if any other space `$(Y,\mathcal O_Y)$` possesses the same property, whenever there is a [homeomorphism][bookofproofs$6197] `$f:X\to Y,$`
* a **continuous invariant**, if the [image][bookofproofs$592] `$f[X]$` of a [continuous function][bookofproofs$8583] `$f:X\to Y$` possesses the same property in `$(Y,\mathcal O_Y),$`
* an **open invariant**, if the [image][bookofproofs$592] `$f[X]$` of an [open function][bookofproofs$8586] `$f:X\to Y$` possesses the same property in `$(Y,\mathcal O_Y),$`
* a **closed invariant**, if the [image][bookofproofs$592] `$f[X]$` of a [closed function][bookofproofs$8586] `$f:X\to Y$` possesses the same property in `$(Y,\mathcal O_Y).$`

Instead of using the term "invariant", we may also use the terms **topological property**, **continuous property**, **open property**, and **closed property**.
