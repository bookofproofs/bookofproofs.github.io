The arguments are as follows:

* `\(X\)` is open, because it [is the neighborhood][bookofproofs$852] of any of its points.
* If `\(X\)` is open, then [by definition][bookofproofs$853], its complement `\(X\setminus X=\emptyset\)` is closed. 
* It is [vacuously true][bookofproofs$781] that the empty set `\(\emptyset\)` is open, because there is no `\(x\in\emptyset\)`, for which `\(\emptyset\)` could (or could not) be the neighborhood.
* If `\(\emptyset\)` is open, then by definition, its complement `\(X\setminus \emptyset=X\)` is closed. 

Therefore, `\(X\)` and `\(\emptyset\)` are [clopen][bookofproofs$853].
