Let `\((X,d_x)\)` and `\((Y,d_y)\)` be [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617] and let `\(f:X\to Y\)` be a [continuous function][bookofproofs$1254] on `$X$`. 

The [modulus of continuity][bookofproofs$6704] `$\omega_f$` is [subadditive][bookofproofs$6705], i.e. for all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$\delta\ge 0$`, `$\delta'\ge 0$`, we have `$\omega_f(\delta + \delta')\le \omega_f(\delta )+\omega_f(\delta').$`
