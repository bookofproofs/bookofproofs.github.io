The following proposition provides a means to construct a topology by hand, just by providing a [subbasis][bookofproofs$8570].
---

Let `$X$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] and let `$S$` be an arbitrary set of its [subsets][bookofproofs$552]. Then there is exactly one [topology][bookofproofs$6189] `$\mathcal O(S)$`, for which the set `$S$` is a [subbasis][bookofproofs$8570] `$\mathcal O(S)$` it is called the **topology generated by the subbasis** `$S.$`
