Let `$(X,\mathcal{O})$` be a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189]. Every element of the [topology][bookofproofs$6189] `$\mathcal O$` is called **open**. A [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$U\subseteq X$` is called **closed**, if its [set complement][bookofproofs$6829] `$U^C$` is open, i.e. an element of the topology `$\mathcal O.$`

A subset of `$X$`, which is both, open and closed, is called **clopen**.

### Notes

* By definition of topology, it is clear that clopen sets exist. Depending on the specific collection of subsets of `$X$` in the topology `$\mathcal O$`, there might be subsets of `$X$` that are both, closed (since their complement is open) and open (since they are themselves elements of `$\mathcal O$`).
* Moreover, there might be subsets of `$X$` which are neither open (since they are not elements of the topology `$\mathcal O$`), nor closed (since their complement is neither an element of this topology).
