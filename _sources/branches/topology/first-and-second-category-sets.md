Let `$(X,\mathcal O)$` be a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189]. A subset `$U\subset X$` is called:
* **first category** (or **meager**) in `$X$` if it is the [union][bookofproofs$6827] of a [countably many][bookofproofs$772]  [nowhere dense][bookofproofs$8581] subsets of `$X,$`
* **second category** in `$X$`, if it is not first category in `$X.$`
