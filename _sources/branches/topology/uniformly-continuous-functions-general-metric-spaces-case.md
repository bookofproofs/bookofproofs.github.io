Let `$(X,d_X)$` and `$(Y,d_Y)$` be [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617]. A [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f:X\mapsto Y$` is called **uniformly continuous**, if and only if for every `$\epsilon > 0$` there is a `$\delta > 0$` such that 
`$$d_Y(f(x),f(y)) < \epsilon$$`
for all `$x,y\in X$` with `$$d_X(x,y) < \delta.$$`
