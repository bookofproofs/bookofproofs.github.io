Let `$(X,\mathcal O)$` be a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189]. If `$B$` is a [non-empty][bookofproofs$550] set of [subsets][bookofproofs$552] `$O\subseteq X$` that does not contain the [empty set][bookofproofs$550] `$\emptyset,$` then the set `$F$` of all subsets of `$X$` that contain some element of `$B$` is a [filter][bookofproofs$8594] if and only if the [intersection][bookofproofs$6828] of any two sets of `$B$` contains a set in `$B.$` 

In this case, the set `$B$` is called a **filter base** of `$F$` and `$F$` is said to be **generated by** `$B.$`
