Let `\(A\)` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of a [metric space][bookofproofs$846] `$(X,d)$`. The **diameter** `$\operatorname{diam} (A)$` is defined as the [supremum][bookofproofs$1754] of all [distances][bookofproofs$614] of any two points `\(x,y\in A\)`, formally
`\[\operatorname{diam} (A):=\sup\{d(x,y):~x,y\in A\}.\]`
