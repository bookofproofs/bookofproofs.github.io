Let `$(X,\mathcal O)$` be a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189], `$A\in X$` be a point and `$\mathcal N(A)$` be the [set of all neighborhoods][bookofproofs$8563] of `$A.$` Then `$\mathcal N(A)$` has the following properties:

1. `$\mathcal N(A)\neq \emptyset$` (it is not [empty][bookofproofs$550]).
1. `$\emptyset\not\in\mathcal N(A)$` (the [empty set][bookofproofs$550] is not a neighbourhood of `$A$`).
1. `$U,W\in\mathcal N(A)\Rightarrow U\cap W\in\mathcal N(A)$` (the [intersection][bookofproofs$6828] any two neighborhoods of `$A$` is also a neighborhood of `$A$`).
1. `$U,W\in\mathcal N(A)\Rightarrow U\cap W\in\mathcal N(A)$` (the [intersection][bookofproofs$6828] any two neighborhoods of `$A$` is also a neighborhood of `$A$`).
