Let `$a < b,$` `$[a,b]$` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] and let `$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$` be a [Riemann-integrable function][bookofproofs$1763]. Then 

`$$||f||_p:=\left(\int_a^b|f(x)|^p dx\right)^{1/p}$$`

defines a [norm][bookofproofs$846] on the vector space of all Riemann-integrable functions defined on the interval `$[a,b].$`
