Let `\((X,d)\)` be a [metric space][bookofproofs$617], and `\(c\in X\)` a point, and `\(r > 0\)`. The set 
`\[B(c,r):=\{x\in X:d(c,x) < r \}\]`
is called the **open ball** with center `\(c\)` and radius `\(r\)` with respect to the metric `\(d\)`.

Given a point `\(c\in X\)`, any subset `\(N\subset X\)` with the following properties:

> (1) `\(c\in N\)` and

> (2) There exists an `\(\epsilon > 0\)` with `\(B(c,\epsilon)\subset N\)` 

is called the **neighborhood** of `\(c\)`. In particular, the open ball `\(B(c,\epsilon)\)` itself is a neighborhood of `\(c\)`. It is called the *`\(\epsilon\)`-neighborhood* of `\(c\)`.
