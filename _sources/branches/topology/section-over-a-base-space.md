Let `\((B,d),(E,d)\)` be [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617]. A *section of `\(E\)` over the base space `\(B\)`*  is a [continuous][bookofproofs$1205] [right inverse][bookofproofs$6325] `\(\sigma :B\to E\)` of a [surjective function][bookofproofs$770] `\(\pi :E\to B\)`, i.e. a function `\(\sigma\)` such that
`\[\pi (\sigma (x))=x\]`
for all `\(x\in B\)`.
