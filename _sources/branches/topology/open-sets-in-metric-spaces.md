Let `\((X,d)\)` be a [metric space][bookofproofs$617]. A subset `\(U\subseteq X\)` is **open**, if for each `\(x\in U\)` there exists `\(\epsilon > 0\)` such that the [open ball][bookofproofs$849] is contained in `\(U\)`:
`\[B(x,\epsilon)\subset U,\]`
i.e. if `\(U\)` it is the [neighborhood][bookofproofs$849] of any of its points. Please note that, by definition, every open ball `\(B(x, r)\)` is open.
