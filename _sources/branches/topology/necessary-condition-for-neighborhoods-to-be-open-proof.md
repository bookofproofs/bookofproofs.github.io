* By hypothesis, `$B$` is a [neighborhood][bookofproofs$8563] of all of its points in a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189] `$(X,\mathcal O).$`
* Then, by definition of neighborhood, for _every_ `$A_i\in B$` there is an [open set][bookofproofs$853] `$O_i\in\mathcal O$` with `$A_i\in O_i\subseteq B$` ($i\in I$, `$I$` being an appropriate [index set][bookofproofs$6198]).
* Therefore, `$B$` can be expressed as the [set union][bookofproofs$6827] of all these open sets. `$B=\bigcup_{i\in I} O_i.$`
* By the third axiom of [topology][bookofproofs$6189], `$B$` is open.
