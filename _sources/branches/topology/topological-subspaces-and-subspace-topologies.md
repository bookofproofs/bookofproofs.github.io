A **subspace** (or **induced**, or **relative**) **topology** `$\mathcal O_S$` a [topology][bookofproofs$6189] induced by a given [topological space][bookofproofs$6189] `$(X,\mathcal O)$` to all its subsets `$S\subset X$`, formally, the [ordered pair][bookofproofs$747] defined by 

`$$(S,\mathcal O_S):=\begin{cases}S\subseteq X,\\\mathcal O_S=\{U\cap S\mid U\in\mathcal O\}\end{cases}$$`

is the **topological subspace** of `$(X,\mathcal O)$` induced by the topology `$\mathcal O.$`
