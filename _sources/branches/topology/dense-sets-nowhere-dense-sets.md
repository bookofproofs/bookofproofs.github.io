Let `$(X,\mathcal O)$` be a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189]. A subset `$U\subset X$` is called:
* *dense in `$X$`* if every point of `$X$` is a point or a [limit point][bookofproofs$8573] of `$U,$` i.e. if `$X$` equals the [closure][bookofproofs$1202] of `$U$`, formally `$X=U^-,$`
* *nowhere dense in `$X$`* if no [non-empty][bookofproofs$550] [open][bookofproofs$853] subset of `$X$` is contained in `$U^-.$`

### Notes

* From the above and the respective related definitions, it follows immediately that the closure `$U^-$` of a nowhere dense set `$U$` has an empty interior.
* The rational numbers `$\mathbb Q$` are dense in real numbers `$\mathbb R.$`
