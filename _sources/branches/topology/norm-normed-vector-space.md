The most important metric spaces are _normed vector spaces_, which we want to introduce now.

Let `\(V\)` be a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over the field of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `\(\mathbb R\)`. A **norm** is a [map][bookofproofs$592].
`\[\|~\|:
\begin{cases}
V&\mapsto \mathbb R\\
x&\mapsto \|x\|\\
\end{cases}\]`
with the following properties:

> (1) `\(\|x\|=0\)` if and only if `\(x=0\)`.

> (2) `\(\|\lambda x\|=|\lambda|\cdot\|x\|\)` for all `\(\lambda\in\mathbb R\)`.

> (3) `\(\|x+y\|\le \|x\|+\|y\|\)` for all `\(x,y\in V\)`.

If such a map exists, the pair `\((V,\|~\|)\)` is called a **normed vector space**.
