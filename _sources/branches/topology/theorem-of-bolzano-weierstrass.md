Let `$X$` be a [metric space][bookofproofs$617] and let `\(A\subset X\)` be a [compact][bookofproofs$6575] [subset][bookofproofs$552]. Let `$(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` be a [sequence][bookofproofs$874] of points `\(x_n\in A\)`. Then `$(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` contains a [subsequence][bookofproofs$1151] `$(x_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb N}$`, which [converges][bookofproofs$148] against some point `\(a\in A\)`.

### Notes

* This theorem is a generalization of the corresponding theorem for [real sequences][bookofproofs$1152].
* The theorem is named after [Bernard Bolzano][bookofproofs$Bolzano] and [Karl-Theodor Weierstrass][bookofproofs$Weierstrass].
