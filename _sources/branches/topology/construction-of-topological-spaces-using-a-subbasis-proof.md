* By hypotheisis, `$X$` is a [set][bookofproofs$550] and `$S$` is an arbitrary set of its [subsets][bookofproofs$552].
* We define `$\mathcal O(S)$` as the [set union][bookofproofs$6827] of all possible [finite][bookofproofs$985] [intersections][bookofproofs$6828] of elements of `$S.$`
* Obviously, `$\mathcal O(S)$` is a [topology][bookofproofs$6189]: 
   * Verifying the first axiom: `$\emptyset\in \mathcal O(S)$`, since, by convention the empty union equals `$\emptyset,$` and `$X\in \mathcal O(S),$` since the empty intersection equals `$X.$` 
   * Verifying the second axiom: By construction, every finite intersection of elements of `$S$` is in `$\mathcal O(S).$`
   * Verifying the third axiom: By construction, every union of finite intersections of elements of `$S$` is in `$\mathcal O(S).$`
* Moreover, by construction, `$S$` plays exactly the role of a [subbasis][bookofproofs$8570] of `$\mathcal O(S).$`
