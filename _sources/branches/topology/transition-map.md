Let `\(M\)` be a [manifold][bookofproofs$6200] and let `\(U_{\alpha},U_{\beta}\subseteq M\)` be its [open][bookofproofs$852] [subsets][bookofproofs$552]. Furthermore, let `\(V_\alpha,V_\beta\subseteq\mathbb R^{n}\)` be open subsets of the [`\(n\)`-dimensional metric space or real numbers][bookofproofs$1206] `\(\mathbb {R} ^{n}\)`.
 
Consider two [topological charts][bookofproofs$6201] `\(\varphi_{\alpha}\colon U_{\alpha}\rightarrow V_{\alpha}\)` and `\(\varphi_{\beta}\colon U_{\beta}\rightarrow V_{\beta}\)`. Then we call a [composition][bookofproofs$1314] of the [homeomorphisms][bookofproofs$6197].
`\[\tau_{\alpha,\beta}:=\varphi_{\beta}\circ \varphi_{\alpha}^{-1}=V_{\alpha}\cap \varphi_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta})\longrightarrow V_{\beta}\cap \varphi_{\beta}(U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta})
\]`

the **transition map** of the topological charts.


Note that since `\(\varphi _{\alpha }\)` and `\(\varphi _{\beta }\)` are both homeomorphisms, the transition map `\(\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }\)` is also a homeomorphism.
