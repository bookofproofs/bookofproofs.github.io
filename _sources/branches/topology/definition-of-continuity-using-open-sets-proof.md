* By hypothesis, `$(X,\mathcal O_X),$` `$(Y,\mathcal O_Y),$` `$(Z,\mathcal O_Z)$` are [topological spaces][bookofproofs$6189], and `$f:X\to Y$` and `$g:Y\to Z$` are [continuous functions][bookofproofs$8583].
* By definition, the [inverse image][bookofproofs$592] under `$g$` of an open set in `$Z$` is an open set in `$Y.$`
* Again, the [inverse image][bookofproofs$592] under `$f$` of this open set in `$Y$` is an open set in `$X.$`
* Thus, the [composition][bookofproofs$1314] `$g\circ f:X\to Z$` is continuous.
