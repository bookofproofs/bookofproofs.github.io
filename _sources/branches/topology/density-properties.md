The discoveries of [Georg Cantor][bookofproofs$Cantor] (1845 - 1918) regarding [cardinal numbers][bookofproofs$185] and the comparison of the cardinalities of the infinite sets of the [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718]":[bookofproofs$718] `$\mathbb N$`, the "rational numbers":[bookofproofs$1033] `$\mathbb Q,$` and the [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$\mathbb R$` motivate defining the concepts related to [density][bookofproofs$6666] in more general, topological terms, which we will do in this chapter.
