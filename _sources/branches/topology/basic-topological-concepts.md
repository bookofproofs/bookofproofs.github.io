We start with some basic concepts of topology. Please note that the term _topology_ has double meaning. The first meaning of this term is mathematical discipline "topology" itself. But "topology" also means - in its second meaning - one of the key concepts in this discipline.  We will use the term sometimes in the first and sometimes in the second meaning, and it will be clear from the context, which meaning is meant.
