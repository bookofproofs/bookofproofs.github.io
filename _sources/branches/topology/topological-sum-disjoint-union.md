Let `$(X,\mathcal O_X)$` and `$(Y,\mathcal O_Y)$` be two [topological spaces][bookofproofs$6189]. The **disjoint union** of `$X$` and `$Y$` is defined by
`$$X+Y:=X\times \{1\}\cup Y\times \{2\}.$$`

The **topological sum** `$(Z,\mathcal O_Z)$` of `$X$` and `$Y$` is defined by `$$(Z,\mathcal O_Z):=(X+Y,\mathcal O_X\cup\mathcal O_Y).$$`


### Notes

* The disjoint union is a formal trick ensuring that the [set union][bookofproofs$6827] `$\cup$` does not get rid of duplicate common elements of `$X$` and `$Y$`. In particular, `$X+X$` is not the same as `$X\cup X=X.$`
