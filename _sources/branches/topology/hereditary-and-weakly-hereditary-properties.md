If every [subspace][bookofproofs$8566] of a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189] `$(X,\mathcal O)$` has a property of `$X$`, this property is said to be **hereditary**.

A property of `$X$` is said to be **weakly hereditary**, if every [closed][bookofproofs$853] [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$U\subseteq X,$` considered as a subspace of `$X$` has this property.
