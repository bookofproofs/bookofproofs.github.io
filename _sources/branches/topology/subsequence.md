Let `\((X,d)\)` be a [metric space][bookofproofs$617], `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be a  [sequence][bookofproofs$874] of points `\(a_n\in X\)` and let 
`\[n_0 < n_1 < n_2 < \ldots\]`
be an ascending sequence of [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `\(n_k\in\mathbb N\)`. Then the sequence 

`\[(a_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb N}\]`
is called the **subsequence** of `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`.
