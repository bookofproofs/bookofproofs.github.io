### Example 1

In any space `$X$` with the [discrete topology][bookofproofs$8557] `$(X,\mathcal P(X))$` only those sequences `$(x_n)_{n\in X}$` are [convergent][bookofproofs$306] to a point `$x\in X$` which are [constant][bookofproofs$6342] `$x_n=x$` for all indices `$n\ge N$` and some first index `$N\in\mathbb N.$` This is because the [singleton][bookofproofs$8034] `$\{x\}$` is an [open set][bookofproofs$853] containing `$x.$` Therefore `$x_n\to x$` if and only if `$x_n\in \{x\}$` for all but finitely many `$n\in\mathbb N.$`

### Example 2

In any space `$X$` with the [indiscrete topology][bookofproofs$8557] `$(X,\{\emptyset,X\})$` all sequences `$(x_n)_{n\in X}$` are [convergent][bookofproofs$306] to every point `$x\in X.$` This is becaus `$X$` is the only [open set][bookofproofs$853] containing every point `$x$` in this topology. `$X$` contains also all sequence members.
