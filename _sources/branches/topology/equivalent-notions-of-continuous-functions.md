Let `$(X,\mathcal O_X)$` and `$(Y,\mathcal O_Y)$` be [topological spaces][bookofproofs$6189].
The following definitions of a [continuous function][bookofproofs$8583] `$f:X\to Y$` are equivalent:

1. The [inverse image][bookofproofs$592] `$f^{-1}[B]$` of every [open set][bookofproofs$853] `$B$` in `$Y$` is open in `$X.$`
1. The [inverse image][bookofproofs$592] `$f^{-1}[B]$` of every [closed set][bookofproofs$853] `$B$` in `$Y$` is closed in `$X.$`
1. The [image][bookofproofs$592] of the [closure][bookofproofs$1202] of a [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$A\subset X$` is contained in the closure of the image of this subset, formally `$f[A^-]\subseteq f[A]^-.$`
1. For each `$x\in X$` and each [neighborhood][bookofproofs$8563] `$N_{f(x)}$` of `$f(x)$` there exists a neighborhood `$N_x$` of `$x$` such that `$f[N_x]\subseteq N_{f(x)}.$`

### Notes

* If the 4th condition is fulfilled for a particular point `$x,$` `$f$` is said to be *continuous at the point `$x.$`*
