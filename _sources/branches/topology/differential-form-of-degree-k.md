Let `\(M\)` be a [differentiable manifold][bookofproofs$6207]. A *differential form of degree `\(k\)`* is a [section][bookofproofs$6334] of the [`\(n\)`-th alternating product][bookofproofs$6333] of its [cotangent bundle][bookofproofs$6332], i.e. it is a function 

`\[\omega \colon \cases{M\longrightarrow \bigwedge ^{k}T^{ * }M,\\x\longmapsto \omega (x),}\]`

with `\(\omega (x)\in \bigwedge ^{k}T_{x}^{ * }M\)`.
