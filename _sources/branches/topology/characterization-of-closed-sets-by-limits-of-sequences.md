Let `$X$` be a [metric space][bookofproofs$617]. A [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(A\subset X\)` is [closed][bookofproofs$852] if and only if with any [convergent sequence][bookofproofs$148] of points `$(x_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}$` contained in `$A$` also its limit is contained in `$A$`, formally
`$$A\text{ is closed }\Longleftrightarrow\text{ for all }  (x_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}:~\text{ if }x_k\in A \text{ for }k\in\mathbb N~\text{ then }\lim_{k\to\infty} x_k=x\in A.$$`

### Notes

This is the generalization of the theorem, [how convergence of real sequences preserves upper and lower bounds for sequence members][bookofproofs$1145].
