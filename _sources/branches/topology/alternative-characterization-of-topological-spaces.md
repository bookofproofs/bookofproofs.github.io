Let `$X$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550]. A set `$\mathcal C$` of [closed][bookofproofs$853] [subsets][bookofproofs$552] of `$X$` defines a [topology][bookofproofs$6189] on `$X$`, if `$\mathcal C$` fulfills the following properties:

1. The empty set `\(\emptyset\)` and the whole set `\(X\)` are closed (i.e. `\({\emptyset\in\mathcal {C}}\)` and `\({X\in\mathcal {C}}\)` ).
1. The [union][bookofproofs$6827] of [finitely][bookofproofs$985] many closed sets is also closed, i.e. if `\(U_{1},\ldots ,U_{n}\in {\mathcal {C}}\)`, then also `\(U_{1}\cup \ldots \cup U_{n}\in {\mathcal {C}}\)`.
1. The [intersection][bookofproofs$6828] of arbitrarily many closed sets is again closed, i.e. with `\(U_{i}\in {\mathcal {O}}\)` for each `\(i\in I\)` (for an arbitrary [index set][bookofproofs$6198] `\(I\)`) we have also `\(\bigcap _{i\in I}U_{i}\in {\mathcal {C}}.\)`

In other words, the [ordered pair][bookofproofs$747] `$(X,\mathcal C)$` is a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189].
