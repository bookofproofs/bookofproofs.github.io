Let `$(X,\mathcal O)$` be a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189].
* A **basis** of `$(X,\mathcal O)$` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$B\subseteq\mathcal O$` such that every element `$O\in\mathcal O$` equals some [set union][bookofproofs$6827] of the elements of `$B.$` 
* A **subbasis** of `$(X,\mathcal O)$` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$S\subseteq\mathcal O$` such that every element `$O\in\mathcal O$` equals some [set intersection][bookofproofs$6828] of [finitely many][bookofproofs$985] elements of `$S.$`

### Notes 

* By convention, the empty union is the [empty set][bookofproofs$550] and the empty intersection is the whole set `$X$`. Thus `$X$` can be generated by every basis (also just because `$X\in\mathcal O$`), and `$\emptyset$` can be generated by every subbasis.
* The difference between the basis and the subbasis is this: While the basis can generate the whole topology `$\mathcal O$`, a subbasis, in general, can only generate som subsets of it.
* Since `$S\subseteq\mathcal O$`, by the second axiom of [topology][bookofproofs$6189], every [intersection][bookofproofs$6828] `$$\bigcap_{\substack{O_i\in S\\\ i\in I\text{ finite}}} O_i$$` is also an element of the topology `$\mathcal O.$`

### Examples

* The [open boxes][bookofproofs$8569] form a basis of the [product topology][bookofproofs$8569].
* The open intervals of real numbers `$\mathbb R$` with real mid points form a basis of the topological space.
