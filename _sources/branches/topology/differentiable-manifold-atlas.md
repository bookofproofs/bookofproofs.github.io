Let `\(n, k \in \mathbb {N} \)` be [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] with `\(k\ge 1\)`. A [topological][bookofproofs$6189] [Hausdorff space][bookofproofs$6199] `\(M\)`, together with an [open cover][bookofproofs$150] `\(M=\bigcup _{i\in I}U_{i}\)` and the [charts][bookofproofs$6201].
`\[\alpha _{i}\colon U_{i}\longrightarrow V_{i}\,\]`

with `\(V_{i}\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}\)` being [open][bookofproofs$852] [subsets][bookofproofs$552] of the 
 [`\(n\)`-dimensional metric space of real numbers][bookofproofs$1206] such that the [transition maps][bookofproofs$6202].
`\[\alpha _{j}\circ (\alpha _{i})^{-1}\colon V_{i}\cap \alpha _{i}(U_{i}\cap U_{j})\longrightarrow V_{j}\cap \alpha _{j}(U_{i}\cap U_{j})\,\]`

are [`\(C^{k}\)`-diffeomorphisms][bookofproofs$6206] for all `\(i,j\in I\)`, is called a *`\(C^{k}\)`-manifold* or *`\(k\)` times differentiable manifold* of the dimension `\(n\)`. 

The [set][bookofproofs$550] of the charts `\((U_{i},\alpha _{i})\)`, `\(i\in I\)`, is called the *`\(C^{k}\)`-atlas* of the manifold.
