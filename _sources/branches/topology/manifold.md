A [topological][bookofproofs$6189] [Hausdorff space][bookofproofs$6199] `\(M\)` is called an  `\(n\)`-dimensional *(topological) manifold*, if there exist an [open cover][bookofproofs$150] `\[M=\bigcup _{i\in I}U_{i}\]` with the property that each `\(U_{i}\)` is [homeomorphic][bookofproofs$6197] to an [open subset][bookofproofs$6189] of the [`\(n\)`-dimensional metric space or real numbers][bookofproofs$1206] `\(\mathbb {R} ^{n}\)`.
