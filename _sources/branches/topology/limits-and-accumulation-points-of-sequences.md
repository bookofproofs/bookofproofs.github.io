Let `$(X,\mathcal O)$` be a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189] and let  `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb Z}$` be a [sequence][bookofproofs$874] with `$a_n\in X$` for all `$n\in\mathbb Z$`, and let `$x\in X.$`

If every [open set][bookofproofs$853] `$O\in\mathcal O$` containing `$x$` contains

* ... all but [finitely many][bookofproofs$985] terms of the sequence[^1], then `$x$` is called a **limit point** of the sequence `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb Z},$` and we say that `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb Z}$` **converges to** `$x,$` 
* ... [infinitely many][bookofproofs$985] terms of the sequence `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$`, then `$x$` is called an **accumulation point** of the sequence.

### Notes

* A sequence converges against `$x$` if only finitely many sequence members are located outside any given neighborhood of `$x.$` 
* A sequence can be associated with its [carrier set][bookofproofs$6658]. Therefore, these definitions are specializations of the more general definitions of [limits][bookofproofs$8573] and [$\omega$-accumulation points][bookofproofs$8573] for sets. 
* Sequences do not have [condensation points][bookofproofs$8573], since they do not have uncountable many members, by definition.

[^1]: This is equivalent to saying the for every open set `$O\in\mathcal O$` containing `$x$` there exists an index `$N\in\mathbb N$` such that `$O$` contains all sequence members `$a_n$` for all `$n>N.$`
