Let `$(X,\mathcal O_X)$` and `$(Y,\mathcal O_Y)$` be [topological spaces][bookofproofs$6189] and let `$f:X\to Y$` be [bijective][bookofproofs$771].
The following definitions of a [homeomorphisms][bookofproofs$6197]:
1. `$f$` is a [homeomorphism][bookofproofs$6197], i.e. `$f$` and its [inverse function][bookofproofs$407] `$f^{-1}$`  are both [continuous][bookofproofs$8583].
1. `$f$` is both, continuous and an [open function][bookofproofs$8586].
