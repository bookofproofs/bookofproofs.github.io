Let `\((X,d_x)\)` and `\((Y,d_y)\)` be [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617] and let `\(f:X\to Y\)` be a [function][bookofproofs$592] `\(f\)` is [continuous at a point `\(a\in X\)` ][bookofproofs$1205], if and only if for every `\(\epsilon > 0\)` there is a `\(\delta > 0\)` such that
`\[d_y(f(x),f(a)) < \epsilon\]`
for all `\(x\in X\)` with 
`\[d_x(x,a) < \delta.\]`

The function `\(f\)` is called **continuous** if it is continuous at every point `\(a\in X\)`.
