Let `\((X,d_X)\)` and `\((Y,d_Y)\)` be [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617] and let 

`\[f:X\mapsto Y\]`

be a [total map][bookofproofs$592] `\(f\)` is called an **isometry**, if it preserves the distances, i.e. if 

`\[d_Y(f(a),f(b))=d_X(a,b)\quad\quad\text{for all }a,b\in X.\]`

If such an isometry `\(f\)` exists, the metric spaces `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` are called **isometric**.
