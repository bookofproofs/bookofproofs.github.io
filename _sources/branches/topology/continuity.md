_Functions_ on [topological spaces][bookofproofs$6189] help to study their properties and to construct new spaces from previously existing ones. The most important type of functions in topology are _continuous functions_. Not surprisingly, they can be defined for general topological spaces, without making use of a whatsoever "distance" concept. This chapter demonstrates how. Also, the important concept of _homeomorphism_ is introduced.
