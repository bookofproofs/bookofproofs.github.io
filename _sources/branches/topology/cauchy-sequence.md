Let `\((X,|~|)\)` be a [mectric space][bookofproofs$617] and let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be a [sequence][bookofproofs$874] of points in `\(X\)`. The sequence `\((a_n)\)` is called **Cauchy sequence**, if for all `\(\epsilon > 0\)` there exists an `\(N(\epsilon)\in\mathbb N\)` with
`\[|a_i-a_j| < \epsilon\quad\quad\text{ for all }i,j\ge N(\epsilon).\]`

`\(N(\epsilon)\)` means that the natural number `\(N\)` depends only on `\(\epsilon\)`.
