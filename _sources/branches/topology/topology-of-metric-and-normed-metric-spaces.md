The so-called _metric spaces_ play in the topology a prominent role. An underlying concept of these spaces is the concept of a _distance_ or _metric_. It is more intuitive than concepts [set-theoretic topology][bookofproofs$69], however, it is not as general and therefore, not always applicable. A typical example of a metric space is the multidimensional space of real numbers `$\mathbb R^n.$` Even more specialized metric spaces are _normed metric spaces_ especially suitable to describe [vector spaces][bookofproofs$276].
