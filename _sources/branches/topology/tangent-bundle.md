Let `\(M\)` be a [differentiable manifold][bookofproofs$6207]. The [set][bookofproofs$550].
`\[TM=\biguplus _{x\in M}T_{x}M,\]`

together with the projection function

`\[\pi \colon TM\longrightarrow M,\,(x,v)\longmapsto x\,,\]`

is called the **tangent bundle** of `\(M\)`. So, an element of `\(TM\)` can be thought of as a pair `\((x,v)\)`, where `\(x\)` is a point in `\(M\)` and `\(v\)` is a tangent vector to `\(M\)` at `\(x\)`.
