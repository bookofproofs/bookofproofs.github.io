Let `$(a_n)_{n\in \mathbb N}$` be the [sequence][bookofproofs$874] of points in a [set][bookofproofs$550] `$X$`. The [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$M\subset X$` with `$M:=\{a_n\in X:~n\in\mathbb N\}$` is called the **carrier set** (or the **underlying set**) of the sequence `$(a_n)_{n\in \mathbb N}$`.
