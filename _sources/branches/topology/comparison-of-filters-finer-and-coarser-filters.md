If `$F$` and `$G$` are [filters][bookofproofs$8594] defined on the same [set][bookofproofs$550] `$X.$` Using the [subset][bookofproofs$552] and [proper subset][bookofproofs$552] relation, we say
* `$F$` is **coarser** than `$G,$` if `$F\subseteq G,$`
* `$F$` is **strictly coarser** than `$G,$` if `$F\subset G.$`
* `$F$` is **finer** than `$G,$` if `$F\supseteq G,$`
* `$F$` is **strictly finer** than `$G,$` if `$F\supset G,$`

If one filter is finer than the other, we say that the filters are **comparable**, otherwise *non-comparable*.
