Let `\(k \ge 1\)` be a [natural number][bookofproofs$718], `\(L\)` and `\(M\)` be [`\(k\)` times differentiable manifolds][bookofproofs$6207] with the [`\(C^k\)`-atlases][bookofproofs$6207] `\((U_{i},\alpha _{i})\)`, `\(i\in I\)` and `\((V_{j},\beta _{j})\)`, `\(j\in J\)` and let `\(1\leq \ell \leq k\)`. A [continuous function][bookofproofs$6195] `\[\varphi \colon L\longrightarrow M\,\]` is called a *`\(C^{\ell }\)`-differentiable function*, if the functions `\[\beta _{j}\circ \varphi \circ (\alpha _{i})^{-1}\colon \alpha _{i}(\varphi ^{-1}(V_{j})\cap U_{i})\longrightarrow V_{j}'\,\]`

are [`\(l\)` times continuously differentiable][bookofproofs$6205] for all `\(i\in I\)` and all `\(j\in J\)`.
