The properties of a [distance][bookofproofs$614] follow immediately from the definition of the [norm][bookofproofs$846]:

1. `\(\|x-y\|=0\)` if and only if `\(x=y\)`.
1. **Symmetry**: `\(\|x-y\|=\|-1(y-x)\|=|-1|\cdot\|y-x\|=\|y-x\|\)` for all `\(x,y\in (V,\|~\|)\)`.
1. **Symmetry**: `\(\|x-y\|=\|-1(y-x)\|=|-1|\cdot\|y-x\|=\|y-x\|\)` for all `\(x,y\in (V,\|~\|)\)`.
