Let `\(X\)` be a [set][bookofproofs$550]. A [function][bookofproofs$592] mapping the [Cartesian product][bookofproofs$748] `$X\times X$` to the [set of real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$\mathbb R$`, i.e. the function `\(d:X\times X\mapsto \mathbb R, (x,y)\mapsto d(x,y)\)` is called a **metric** or a **distance** on `\(X\)`, if it fulfills the following properties:

1. `\(d(x,y)=0\)` if and only if `\(x=y\)`.
1. **Symmetry**: `\(d(x,y)=d(y,x)\)` for all `\(x,y\in X\)`.
1. **Symmetry**: `\(d(x,y)=d(y,x)\)` for all `\(x,y\in X\)`.
