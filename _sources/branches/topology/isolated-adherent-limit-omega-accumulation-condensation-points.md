Let `$(X,\mathcal O)$` be a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189], let `$U\subseteq X$` be its [subset][bookofproofs$552] and let `$x\in U.$`

If every [open set][bookofproofs$853] `$O\in\mathcal O$` containing `$x$` contains

* ... no other point of `$U$`, `$x$` is called an **isolated point** of `$U,$`
* ... at least one point of `$U$`, it is called an **adherent point** of `$U,$`
* ... at least one point of `$U$` distinct from `$x,$` it is called a **limit point** of `$U,$`
* ... [infinitely many][bookofproofs$985] points of `$U$` distinct from `$x,$`  it is called an *$\omega$-accumulation point* of `$U,$`
* ... [uncountably many][bookofproofs$772] points of `$U$` distinct from `$x,$` it is called a **condensation point** of `$U.$`

### Notes

* An adherent point is an umbrella term for isolated and limit points.
