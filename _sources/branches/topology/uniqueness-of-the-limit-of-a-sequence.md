Let `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be a sequence in the [metric space][bookofproofs$617]  `\((X,d)\)`, which is [convergent][bookofproofs$148] against the limits `\(x\)` and `\(x'\)`:

`\[\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} x_n=x\quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} x_n=x'.\]`

Then both limits are identical, or `\(x=x'\)`[^1].

[^1]: This proposition makes the notation `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} x_n=x\)` meaningful.
