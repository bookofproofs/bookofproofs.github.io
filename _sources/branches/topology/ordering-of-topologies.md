For any two [topologies][bookofproofs$6189] `$\mathcal O_1$` and `$\mathcal O_2$` defined on a set `$X$`, we can define a [partial order][bookofproofs$576] using the [subset][bookofproofs$552] relation:

`$$\mathcal O_1\le \mathcal O_2\Longleftrightarrow \mathcal O_1\subseteq \mathcal O_2.$$`

If `$\mathcal O_1\le \mathcal O_2$`, then we say

* `$\mathcal O_1$` is **smaller** (or **weaker** or **coarser**) and
* `$\mathcal O_2$` is **larger** (or **stronger** or **finer**).

### Notes:

* The ordering `$\le$` is only a partial order, since two topologies might be not comparable (i.e. if we choose the sets `$\mathcal O_1$` and `$\mathcal O_2$` in such a way that neither `$\mathcal O_1\subseteq \mathcal O_2$`, nor vice versa).
* For every set `$X$`, the largest topology (finest) topology is the [discrete topology][bookofproofs$8557], the smallest (coarsest) the [indiscrete topology][bookofproofs$8557].
