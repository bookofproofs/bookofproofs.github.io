Let `\(X\)` be a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189] and let `\(U\subseteq X\)` be an [open set][bookofproofs$852]. We call the [family][bookofproofs$6198] of open sets `\(U_{i}\)`, `\(i\in I\)` an **open cover** of `\(U\)` if 

`\[U=\bigcup _{i\in I}U_{i},\]`

i.e. if `\(U\)` equals the [union][bookofproofs$552] of all `\(U_{i}\)`.
