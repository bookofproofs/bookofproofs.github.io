Let `$A$` be an element of a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189] `$(X,\mathcal O)$` ($A$ might be a single point of a set of points). A **neighborhood** `$N_A$` is any subset of `$X$` containing an [open set][bookofproofs$853] containing `$A$`, formally `$$N_A\in \{U\subseteq X\mid \exists O\in\mathcal O, A\in O\subseteq U\}.$$`

The **set of all neighborhoods** of `$A$` is denoted by `$\mathcal N(A).$`

### Notes

* `$X$` is a neighborhood of all of its points.
* Any open set `$O\in\mathcal O$` is a neighborhood of all of its points.
* A neighborhood itself does not have to be open (e.g. it is closed but contains an open subset containing `$A$`, or it is neither open nor closed but contains a subset containing `$A$`).
