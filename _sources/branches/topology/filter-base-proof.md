* By hypothesis, `$(X,\mathcal O)$` is a "topological space":https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/topological-spce-topology/ and `$B$` is a [non-empty][bookofproofs$550] set of [subsets][bookofproofs$552] `$O\subseteq X$` that does not contain the [empty set][bookofproofs$550] `$\emptyset.$` 
* Let `$F$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] of all [subsets][bookofproofs$552] of `$X$` that contain some element of `$B.$` 

### "`$\Rightarrow$`"

* Assume `$F$` is a [filter][bookofproofs$8594].
* Since `$F$` is a filter, it contains the [intersection][bookofproofs$6828] of any two of its elements.
* By hypothesis, `$F$` contains _all_ subsets of `$X$` containing some elements of `$B$`.
* Thus, the [intersection][bookofproofs$6828] of any two sets of `$B$` contains a set in `$B$` as an element.

### "`$\Leftarrow$`"

* Assume, the [intersection][bookofproofs$6828] of any two sets of `$B$` contains a set in `$B.$`
* Since `$F$` contains all of the subsets of `$X$` containing an element of `$B$`, `$F$` contains the [intersection][bookofproofs$6828] of any two of its elements.
* Moreover, since `$B$` does not contain the empty set, so does not `$F.$`
* Finally, all [supersets][bookofproofs$552] of the elements of `$B$` are contained in `$F$`
* It follows that `$F$` is a [filter][bookofproofs$8594].
