Let `$p$` be a [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `$\ge 1$`. Let `$x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots x_n)$` be a [vector][bookofproofs$560] of a vector space `\(V\)` over the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$1638] `\(\mathbb R\)` or the [field of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690] `\(\mathbb C\)`.

The [maximum norm][bookofproofs$6789].
> `$||x||_\infty:=\max(|x_1|,|x_2|,\ldots,|x_n|)$` 

is the [limit][bookofproofs$6683] of a [p-norm][bookofproofs$6789] for `$p\to\infty,$` formally

 `$$||x||_\infty=\lim_{p\to\infty}||x||_p.$$`
