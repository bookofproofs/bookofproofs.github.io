Let `\((X,d_X)\)` and `\((Y,d_Y)\)` be [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617] and let `\(a,b\in X\)` with `\(a\neq b\)`. Becasue `\(d_X\)` is a [metric][bookofproofs$614], we have `\(d_X(a,b)\neq 0\)`. Since `\(f:X\mapsto Y\)` is an [isometry][bookofproofs$2778] by hypothesis, we have `\[d_Y(f(a),f(b))=d_X(a,b)\neq 0\]`
for some `\(f(a),f(b)\in Y\)`. Because also `\(d_Y\)` is a metric, we must have `\(f(a)\neq f(b)\)`. We have shown
`\[a\neq b\Longrightarrow f(a)\neq f(b).\]`
Thus, `\(f\)` is [injective][bookofproofs$769].
