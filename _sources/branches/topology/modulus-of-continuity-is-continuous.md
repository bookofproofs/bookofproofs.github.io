Let `\((X,d_x)\)` and `\((Y,d_y)\)` be [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617] and let `\(f:X\to Y\)` be a [continuous function][bookofproofs$1254] on `$X$`. 

The [modulus of continuity][bookofproofs$6704] `$\omega_f:\mathbb R_+\to\mathbb R_+$` is [continuous][bookofproofs$1260] on the set [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `$\mathbb R_+$`, in particular, the [limit of `$\omega_f$` at `$0$` from above][bookofproofs$6683] is `$$\lim_{\delta\searrow  0} \omega_f(\delta)=0.$$`
