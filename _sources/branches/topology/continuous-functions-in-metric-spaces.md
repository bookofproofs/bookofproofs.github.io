Let `\((X,d)\)` and `\((Y,d)\)` be two [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617] and `\(f:X\to Y\)` be a [function][bookofproofs$592] `\(f\)` is **continuous at a point** `\(a\in X\)`, if  

`\[\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=f(a),\]`
i.e. if for each [convergent sequence][bookofproofs$148] `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` of points `\(x_n\in X\)` with `\(\lim x_n=a\)` we have `\(\lim f(x_n)=f(a)\)`.

The function `\(f\)` is called **continuous on** `\(X\)`, if `\(f\)` is continuous in every point `\(a\in X\)`.
