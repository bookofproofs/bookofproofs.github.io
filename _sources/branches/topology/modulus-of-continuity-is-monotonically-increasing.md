Let `\((X,d_x)\)` and `\((Y,d_y)\)` be [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617] and let `\(f:X\to Y\)` be a [continuous function][bookofproofs$1254] on `$X$`. 

The [modulus of continuity][bookofproofs$6704] `$\omega_f$` is [monotonically increasing][bookofproofs$282], i.e. if `$0 \le \delta\le \delta'$` holds for some [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$\delta,\delta'$`, then `$0 \le \omega_f(\delta)\le \omega_f(\delta').$`
