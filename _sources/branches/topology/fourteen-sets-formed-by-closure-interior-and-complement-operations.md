If `$A$` is a [set][bookofproofs$550], we can create at most fourteen sets by successive application of the [closure][bookofproofs$1103] `$A^-$`, [interior][bookofproofs$1202] `$A^\circ$` and [complement][bookofproofs$6829] `$A^C$` operations. These fourteen sets are:

1. `$A$`
1. `$A^C$`
1. `$A^\circ=A^{- C -}$`
1. `$A^-$`
1. `$A^{\circ C}$`
1. `$A^{C-}$`
1. `$A^{\circ-}$`
1. `$A^{-\circ}$`
1. `$A^{\circ-\circ}$`
1. `$A^{\circ C\circ}$`
1. `$A^{C\circ-}$`
1. `$A^{-\circ -}$`
1. `$A^{-\circ C\circ}$`
1. `$A^{\circ -\circ C}$`

It is left to the reader as an exercise to build these 14 sets from this example subset of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$\mathbb R$`.

`$$A:=\{\frac 1n\mid n=1,2,3\ldots\}\cup (2,3)\cup (3,4)\cup\left\{4 \frac 12\right\}\cup [6,7] \cup \{x\in \mathbb Q\mid 8\le x < 9\}$$`

The example set is chosen in such a way that indeed all 14 sets are different. `$(a,b)$` and `$[a,b]$` denote open and closed [real intervals][bookofproofs$1153].
