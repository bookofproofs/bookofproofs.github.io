_Set-theoretic topology_ introduces many mathematical concepts simplifying the concepts from other mathematical disciplines, including [analysis][bookofproofs$47], [graph theory][bookofproofs$68], [knot theory][bookofproofs$108], and [geometry][bookofproofs$75]. The simplification results from liberating parts of the terminology of these other disciplines (including terms such as _point_, _closed intervals_, _similarity_, _continuity_) from specific terms that seem to exist only in these disciplines on their own. 

The notion of a _continuous function_ `$f,$` as an example, is explained in the _analysis_ using the [epsilon-delta][bookofproofs$219] definition. Basically, it states that two points `$f(x),f(a)$` get arbitrarily "close" to each other, if `$x,a$` are sufficiently close to each other. 
If the concept of "closeness" is not available, continuity can also be explained using so-called _open sets_. For instance, in the set of real numbers, [open intervals][bookofproofs$1153] (which are another example of a term from another discipline, which can is simplified in the set-theoretic topology) are open sets from a set-theoretic topological point of view. Thus, open sets can be defined for any other kinds of sets, not only real numbers. 

In this part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>, we will deal with _topological spaces_, i.e. sets with open subsets. The general topological spaces get new useful properties if we require them to have additional properties. One such interesting property will be the _Hausdorff_ property: We will require that any two distinct points in the space can be put into disjoint open sets containing them respectively.

A continuous function `$f$` that has a continuous inverse `$f^{-1}$` is known as _homeomorphism_. Two topological spaces `$X$` and `$Y$`, between which there is a homomorphism, then one can be deformed into another smoothly enough to consider them equivalent. An interesting topological problem is to classify of spaces which can be deformed into each other smoothly using a homeomorphism.

Another useful feature of topological spaces is their basis `$\mathcal B$`, which is subset of its open sets such that all other open sets can be described as a union of the basis elements.
