Let `\(M\)` be a [differentiable manifold][bookofproofs$6207]. The **cotangent bundle**  of `\(M\)` is a [set][bookofproofs$550] denoted by 

`\[T^{ * }M=\biguplus _{x\in M}T_{x}^{ * }M\,,\]`

with the following properties:

* `\(T^{ * }\)` has an associated projection function
`\[\pi \colon T^{ * }M\longrightarrow M,\,(x,u)\longmapsto x\,,\]`
* `\(T^{ * }\)` has an associated [topology][bookofproofs$6189], in which each [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(W\subseteq T^{ * }M\)` is open if and only if for each [topological chart][bookofproofs$6201] `\(\alpha \colon U\longrightarrow V\,\)` the set `\((T^{ * }(\alpha ))^{-1}\left(W\cap \pi ^{-1}(U)\right)\)` is open in `\(V\times (\mathbb {R} ^{n})^{ * }\)`.
