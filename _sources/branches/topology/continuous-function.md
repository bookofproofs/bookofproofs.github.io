Let `$(X,\mathcal O_X)$` and `$(Y,\mathcal O_Y)$` be [topological spaces][bookofproofs$6189]. A [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f:X\to Y$` is **continuous** if the [inverse image][bookofproofs$592] `$f^{-1}(B)$` of every [open set][bookofproofs$853] `$B$` in `$Y$` is open in `$X$`, formally `$$B\in\mathcal O_Y\Rightarrow f^{-1}(B)\in\mathcal O_X.$$`
