Let `$(X,\mathcal O)$` be a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189] and let `$B\subset X$`. 

* A point `$A\in X$` is called a **boundary point** of `$B$` if every [neighborhood][bookofproofs$8563] `$N_A$` has points in common with `\(B\)` and also with the [set complement][bookofproofs$6829] `$B^C=X\setminus B.$`


![boundary](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/boundary.png?raw=true)


* The set of all boundary points of `\(B\)` is called the **boundary** of the set `$B$` and denoted by `\(\delta B\)`.
* The **closure** `$B^-$` of `$B$` is the [set union][bookofproofs$6827] of `$B$` with its boundary `$B\cup \delta B.$` 
* The **interior** `$B^\circ$` of `$B$` is the [set difference][bookofproofs$6830] of `$B$` without its boundary `$B\setminus \delta B.$`
* The **exterior** `$B^e$` of `$B$` is the [set complement][bookofproofs$6829] of the closure of `$B.$`
