Let `\(V_{1}\)` and `\(V_{2}\)` be [finitely dimensional][bookofproofs$1041] [real vector spaces][bookofproofs$560] and `\(U_{1}\subseteq V_{1}\)` and `\(U_{2}\subseteq V_{2}\)` [open][bookofproofs$852] [subsets][bookofproofs$552]. A [function][bookofproofs$592].
`\[\varphi \colon U_{1}\longrightarrow U_{2}\,\]`

is called a *`\(C^{n}\)`-diffeomorphism* if `\(\varphi \)` is [bijective][bookofproofs$771] and `\(n\)` times [continuously differentiable][bookofproofs$6205], and if the [inverse function][bookofproofs$407].
`\[\varphi ^{-1}\colon U_{2}\longrightarrow U_{1}\,\]`

is also `\(n\)` times continuously differentiable.
