Let `\(X\)` und `\(Y\)` be [topological spaces][bookofproofs$6189]. A [continuous function][bookofproofs$6195] `\(f:X\longrightarrow Y\,\)` is called:

* **open**, if the [images][bookofproofs$592] `\(f(A)\)` of [open][bookofproofs$852] [subsets][bookofproofs$552] `\(A\subseteq X\)` are open subsets `\(f(A)\subseteq Y\)`.
* **closed**, if the [images][bookofproofs$592] `\(f(A)\)` of [closed][bookofproofs$852] [subsets][bookofproofs$552] `\(A\subseteq X\)` are closed subsets `\(f(A)\subseteq Y\)`.
