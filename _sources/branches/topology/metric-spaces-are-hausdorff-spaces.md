Let `\((X,d)\)` be a [metric space][bookofproofs$617]. Then any two distinct points `\(x,y\in X\)` with `\(x\neq y\)` have also distinct [neighborhoods][bookofproofs$849] `\(U,V\)`, i.e. `\(U\cap V=\emptyset\)`.


![hausdorff](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/hausdorff.jpg?raw=true)


`\((X,d)\)` is then called a **Hausdorff space**.
