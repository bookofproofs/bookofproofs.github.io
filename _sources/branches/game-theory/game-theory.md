__Game theory__ is a theory dealing with the construction of rigorous models capable to describe situations of conflict and cooperation between rational decision makers. Traditionally, it serves as a foundation for decision-making in various disciplines, including economics, political campaigning, jury voting, auctions, procurement, negotiations. It points to actions that maximize some sort of payoff, subject to some constraints to be taken into account.

### Theoretical minimum (in a nutshell)

To start reading this part, you should be already acquainted with the following areas of mathematics:

* [Sums][bookofproofs$261], and their manipulation methods,
* Basic [probability theory][bookofproofs$73],
* [Trees][bookofproofs$96], which we will be using to model the outcomes of many games,
* Basic notions of [combinatorics][bookofproofs$82],
* Basic notions of real analysis, in particular, [derivatives of functions][bookofproofs$347].


### Concepts you will learn in this part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>

* What are the basic ideas of the _rational choice paradigm_?
* Types of _games_ and their characteristics, including _static_ and _dynamic_ games of _complete_ and _incomplete_ information.
* Notions of _dominated_ and _dominant_ strategies and the _Nash equilibrium_ to tackle with static games of complete and incomplete information
* How to tackle games that unfold over time (dynamic games), in the case you have complete or incomplete information, including _bargaining games_ and extended _Bayesian games_.
