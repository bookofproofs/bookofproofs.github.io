The choice of the right data structure is almost as (if not most) important then the decision about the algorithm to solve a problem. Usually, the implementation of an algorithm can be significantly simplified by selecting an appropriate data structures. Also, data structures influence significantly the execution time and memory needed to perform the algorithm.

This part is dedicated to **data structures**. It describes each data structure separately, provides information on how to implement and handle them and how data structures interact with different algorithms.
