Searching is a basic operation used in many calculation problems, wherever an element or information has to be found in a big number of items stored before. In general, searching involves **datasets**, each having a **key**. The goal of a search operation is to find a dataset having a specific key. 

The most common data structures used in searching are:
* tables,
* [trees][bookofproofs$154] and
* [files][bookofproofs$386].
The obvious application of a search operation is to be used with some different other operations like:

> __initialize__ (the dataset)
__insert__
__delete__
__read__
__update__
