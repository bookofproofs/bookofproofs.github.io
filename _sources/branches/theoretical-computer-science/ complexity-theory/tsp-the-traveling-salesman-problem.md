The **Traveling Salesman Problem** is the following problem 

* *Domain:* `\(T S P\)`
* *Instance:* [Integer][bookofproofs$844] `\(n\ge 3\)` and a [symmetric matrix][bookofproofs$1779] `\(C=(c_{ij})\)` with [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(c_{ij}  > 0\)`.
* *Question:* Which cyclic [permutation][bookofproofs$188] `\(\pi\)` of the real numbers `\(1\)` to `\(n\)` minimizes the sum `\(\sum_{i=1}^n c_{i\pi(i)}\)`?
