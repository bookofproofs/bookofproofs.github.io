* By hypothesis, `\(a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\)` are [positive integers][bookofproofs$1075].
* The [existence of solutions of an LDE with two variables][bookofproofs$8179] ensures the existence of a solution.
* In the algorithm, the [greatest common divisor (python)][bookofproofs$503] algorithm has been extended by auxiliary variables `$x,y,u,v$` are used for calculating the coefficients `$a,b$` by backward substitution.
* The runtime is the same as in the original algorithm.
