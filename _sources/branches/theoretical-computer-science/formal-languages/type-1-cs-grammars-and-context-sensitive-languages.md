A *type-1* (or **cs**) grammar is a [grammar][bookofproofs$709] `$G=(V,T,R,S)$` in which every rule `$P\to Q\in R$` has the following properties:

* Either `$|P|\le|Q|$` (the length of the [conclusion][bookofproofs$709] `$Q$` has at least the length of the [premise][bookofproofs$709] `$P$`, or
* `$P\to Q$` is the rule `$S\to\epsilon$` (the [empty word][bookofproofs$708] replacing the [starting symbol][bookofproofs$709]). 
* If the rule `$S\to\epsilon$` is included, then the starting symbol `$S$` is not allowed to be part of the conclusion of any other rule of the grammar.

We can state this definition more formally as follows: 
* Every rule `$P\to Q\in R$` has the form `$$P\to Q=\begin{cases}S\to\epsilon&\text{or}\\\exists u,v,\alpha\in (V\cup T)^*,\exists A\in V:P=uAv\wedge Q=u\alpha v,|\alpha|\ge 1\end{cases}$$`
* `$S\not\in Q$` for all `$P\to Q\in R.$`

[Formal languages][bookofproofs$94] generated by type-1 grammars are called *context-sensitive*.

### Notes

* The characteristics of type-1 grammars is that they replace a variable `$A$` by a word `$\alpha$` of the length of at least `$|\alpha|\ge 1$`.
* However, the variable `$A$` can be only replaced if it occurs _in the context_ between the words `$u$` (left-side) and `$w$` (right-side). 
* The notation `$(T\cup V)^*$` denotes the [Kleene star][bookofproofs$8493] of any combination of terminal symbols or variables.
