A [grammar][bookofproofs$709] `$G$` is called **ambiguous** if there is a string `$\omega$` in the [language generated from the grammar][bookofproofs$94] `$L(G)$` such that it has at least two different [abstract syntax trees][bookofproofs$8484] `$\operatorname{AST}_G(\omega)\neq \operatorname{AST}^\prime_G(\omega).$`

If for all `$\omega\in L(G)$` there are unique [abstract syntax trees][bookofproofs$8484] `$\operatorname{AST}_G(\omega),$` the grammar is called **unambiguous**.
