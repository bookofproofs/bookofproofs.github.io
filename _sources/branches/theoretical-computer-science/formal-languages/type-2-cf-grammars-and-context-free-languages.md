A *type-2* (or **cf**) grammar is a [grammar][bookofproofs$709] `$G=(V,T,R,S)$` in which every rule `$P\to Q\in R$` allows the replacement of _only one_ [variable][bookofproofs$709] and its production rules can contain any number of variables and/or terminals. 

We can state this definition more formally as follows: All grammar rules `$P\to Q\in R$` consist of `$P\in V$` (the [premise][bookofproofs$709] `$P$` is a [variable][bookofproofs$709]) and `$Q\in (V\cup T)^*$` (the [conclusion][bookofproofs$709] `$Q$` is either the [empty string][bookofproofs$708] `$\epsilon$` or it is a [concatenation][bookofproofs$8492] of variables and/or [terminals][bookofproofs$709]).


[Formal languages][bookofproofs$94] generated by type-2 grammars are called *context-free*.

### Notes

* The characteristics of type-2 grammars is that they always replace a single variable by the empty word or a concatenation of any number of terminal and/or variables.
* The notation `$(T\cup V)^*$` denotes the [Kleene star][bookofproofs$8493] of any combination of terminal symbols or variables.
