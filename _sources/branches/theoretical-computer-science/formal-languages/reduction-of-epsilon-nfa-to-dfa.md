For every [epsilon non-deterministic finite automaton][bookofproofs$8531] `$\epsilon$`-NFA there is a [deterministic finite automaton][bookofproofs$8499]. DFA accepting the same [language][bookofproofs$7842].
In other words, the class `$\mathcal L(\epsilon-\operatorname{NFA})$` of all languages accepted by any `$\epsilon$`-NFA equals the class `$\mathcal L(\operatorname{DFA})$` of all languages accepted by any DFA, formally

`$$\mathcal L(\epsilon-\operatorname{NFA})=\mathcal L(\operatorname{DFA}).$$`
