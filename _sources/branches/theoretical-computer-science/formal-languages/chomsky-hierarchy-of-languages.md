The definitions of the previously introduced types of grammars get (from [type-3][bookofproofs$8494], over [type-2][bookofproofs$8495] and [type-1][bookofproofs$8496], to [type-0][bookofproofs$8497]) more and more general. This structure became known as the **Chomsky hierarchy**[^1].

The question arises, whether or not these generalizations induce proper inclusions of the language classes generated by the grammars, i.e. if `$$\mathcal L_3\subseteq\mathcal L_2\subseteq\mathcal L_1\subseteq\mathcal L_0,$$` or if  `$$\mathcal L_3\subset\mathcal L_2\subset\mathcal L_1\subset\mathcal L_0.$$`

The following examples demonstrate that the inclusions are, indeed, proper. For instance, all regular languages are context-free languages but not vice-versa.

### Example of a Regular Language ($\in\mathcal L_3\subset\mathcal L_2\subset\mathcal L_1\subset\mathcal L_0$) 

* The grammar `$G=(\{S,B,C\},\{a,b\},R,S)$` with the rules `$R$`: `$$\begin{array}{rcl}
S&\to&aB,\\
B&\to&bC,\\
C&\to&\epsilon \mid aB
\end{array}$$` is regular since it allows the replacement of only one variable and every rule ends with a single variable. 
* Example generation of `$ababab$`: `$$\begin{array}{rcl}
S&\to&aB\\
&\to&abC\\
&\to&abaB\\
&\to&ababC\\
&\to&ababaB\\
&\to&abababC\\
&\to&ababab\\
\end{array}$$`
* The grammar [generates the language][bookofproofs$94] `$$L(G)=\{(ab)^n\mid n\ge 1, n\in\mathbb N\}=\{ab,abab,ababab,abababab,\ldots\}.$$`
* The generated language `$L(G)$` is (trivially and by definitions of the grammars) is also a context-free, a context-sensitive and a phrase-structure one.

### Example of a Context-Free, Not Regular Language ($\not\in\mathcal L_3$ and `$\in\mathcal L_2\subset\mathcal L_1\subset\mathcal L_0$`) 

* The grammar `$G=(\{S\},\{a,b\},R,S)$` with the rules `$R$`: `$$\begin{array}{rcl}
S&\to&aSb\mid ab,\\
\end{array}$$` is context-free since it allows the replacement of only one variable. In contrast to the first example, every rule can involve more variables. 
* Example generation of `$aaabbb$`: `$$\begin{array}{rcl}
S&\to&aSb\\
&\to&aaSbb\\
&\to&aaabbb
\end{array}$$`
* The grammar generates the language `$$L(G)=\{a^nb^n\mid n\ge 1, n\in\mathbb N\}=\{ab,aabb,aaabbb,\ldots\}.$$`
* Apparently, the language is not regular. It is not hard to see why it cannot be regular.  The reason for this is the order of the symbols `$a$` and `$b$`. If we wanted to generate the language `$\{a^nb^n\}$` by a [type-3 grammar][bookofproofs$8494], it would be necessary to "remember" the number `$n$` of `$a$`'s we have generated first, before we can generate the same number of `$b$`'s. Because the value `$n$` is not [bounded from above][bookofproofs$1136], a type-3 language would have to allow an unlimited number of variables. This is not possible, a [grammar][bookofproofs$709] cannot have an infinite number of variables, by definition. 
* The generated language `$L(G)$` is (trivially and by definitions of the grammars) is context-sensitive and a phrase-structure one, but not regular. 

### Example of a Context-sensitive, Not Context-free Language ($\not\in\mathcal L_3,\not\in\mathcal L_2,$ and `$\in\mathcal L_1\subset\mathcal L_0$`) 

* The grammar `$G=(\{S,B,C,D,E\},\{a,b,c\},R,S)$` with the rules `$R$`: `$$\begin{array}{rcl}
S&\to&aBC\mid aSBC,\\
CB&\to&CE,\\
CE&\to&DE,\\
DE&\to&DC,\\
DC&\to&BC,\\
aB&\to&ab,\\
bB&\to&bb,\\
bC&\to&bc,\\
cC&\to&cc,\\
\end{array}$$` is context-sensitive, since any rule `$P\to Q\in R$` fulfills the property `$|P|\le|Q|.$` Since `$S\to\epsilon$` is not included, `$S$` may be part of a some `$Q$` of rule (as is the case in the first rule of this example). Apparently, the language is not context-free.
* Example generation of `$aabbcc$`: `$$\begin{array}{rcl}
S&\to&aSBC\\
&\to&aaBCBC\\
&\to&aaBCEC\\
&\to&aaBDEC\\
&\to&aaBDCC\\
&\to&aaBBCC\\
&\to&aabBCC\\
&\to&aabbCC\\
&\to&aabbcC\\
&\to&aabbcc\\
\end{array}$$`
* The grammar generates the language `$$L(G)=\{a^nb^nc^n\mid n\ge 1, n\in\mathbb N\}=\{abc,aabbcc,aaabbbccc,\ldots\}.$$`
* It is not hard to see why it cannot be context-free. The symbol `$c$` can only be generated, _after_ some of the symbols `$a,$` and _then after_ some of the symbols `$b$` have already been generated (only in this context). It is neither possible to start with a `$c$` nor to continue with a `$c$` after having generated only `$a$`'s. 

### Example of a Recursively-Enumarable, Not Context-Sensitive Language ($\not\in\mathcal L_3,\not\in\mathcal L_2,\not\in\mathcal L_1,$ and `$\in\mathcal L_0$`) 

An example can be a language, the words of which code a _terminating_ [Turing machine][bookofproofs$297]. We will see later what it is and why this language is not context-sensitive.
