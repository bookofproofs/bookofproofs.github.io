*Theoretical computer science* is a discipline dealing with systematic ways to process information, especially using computers. Key original concepts of theoretical computer science include:

* development of methods for problem-solving  **theory of algorithms**),
* theoretical models to construct computers, i.e. machines able to apply algorithms  **automata theory**),
* a foundation of **computability theory** itself, i.e. exploring which problems are tractable by applying automata performing algorithms.

### Theoretical minimum (in a nutshell)

You should be acquainted with:

* the [basic concepts of logic][bookofproofs$26], especially the concepts of [language][bookofproofs$7842], [formal language][bookofproofs$94], [syntax][bookofproofs$709], and [semantics][bookofproofs$7881],
* [Syntax][bookofproofs$1307] and [semantics][bookofproofs$7871] of propositional logic,
* Basic [set operations][bookofproofs$7986] and basics about [functions][bookofproofs$64].
* Basics about [algebraic structures][bookofproofs$85].
