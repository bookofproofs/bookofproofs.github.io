Every [WHILE program][bookofproofs$1181] can be simulated using a [GOTO program][bookofproofs$1182], and vice versa. In other words, the set of all [WHILE-computable functions][bookofproofs$1184] is equivalent to the set of all [GOTO-computable functions][bookofproofs$1197], formally

`\[W H I L E^{part} = G O T O^{part}\]`

and 

`\[W H I L E = G O T O.\]`
