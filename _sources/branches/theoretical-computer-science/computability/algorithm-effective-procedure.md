An **algorithm** `$\mathcal A$` (sometimes also called an **effective procedure**) is a step-by-step procedure for solving a [problem][bookofproofs$1776] fulfilling the following properties:

* `$\mathcal A$` consists of a [finite][bookofproofs$985] number of instructions (each instruction is being an expression of a [formal language][bookofproofs$709]).
* `$\mathcal A,$` if carried out without error, always produces the desired solution to the problem in a finite number of steps. 
* `$\mathcal A$` can be carried out purely mechanically, without any insight or ingenuity.
