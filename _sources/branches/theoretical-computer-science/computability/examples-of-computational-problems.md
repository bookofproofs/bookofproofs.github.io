The formal definition of [problems][bookofproofs$1776] can be better explained by some of the following examples:

### Example 1

* Domain: [Trees][bookofproofs$96].
* Instance: A given tree `$T$`
* Question: What is the length of the longest [path][bookofproofs$1164] contained in `$T$`?  
* Types of answers: [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `$\mathbb N$`.

### Example of a decision problem

* Domain: [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `$\mathbb N.$` 
* Instance: `$n\in N$`
* Question: Is `$n$` an [odd number][bookofproofs$8130].
* Types of answers: set of [truth values][bookofproofs$707] `$\mathbb B.$`
