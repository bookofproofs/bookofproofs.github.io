[Formal languages][bookofproofs$94] are [languages][bookofproofs$7842] with a [grammar][bookofproofs$709]. There are only two limitations for grammars: A [grammar][bookofproofs$709] can, by definition, have only finitely many rules, and every [premise][bookofproofs$709] must contain at least one [variable][bookofproofs$709].
We will see in this chapter that by restricting grammars even more we can generate different types of languages. In other words, different types of grammars will allow us to classify formal languages.
