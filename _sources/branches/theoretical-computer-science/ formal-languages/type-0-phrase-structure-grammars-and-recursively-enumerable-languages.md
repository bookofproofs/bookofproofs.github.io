Every grammar `$G=(V,T,R,S)$` with no restrictions whatsoever besides the restrictions given[^1] in the [definition of a grammar][bookofproofs$709] is a *type-0*, or *phrase-structure* grammar. [Formal languages][bookofproofs$94] generated by type-0 grammars are called **recursively enumerable**.[^2]  

[^1]: A [grammar][bookofproofs$709] has only finitely many rules, and every [premise][bookofproofs$709] of a rule contains at least one [variable][bookofproofs$709].

[^2]: We will see later (when we will be talking about automata) that such languages are recognized/accepted by [Turing Machines][bookofproofs$297], therefore, they are also called *Turing-acceptable* or *Turing-recognizable*.
