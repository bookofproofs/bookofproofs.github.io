There are functions `\(f : \mathbb N^k \to \mathbb N\)`, which are [partially WHILE-computable][bookofproofs$1184], but are not [WHILE-computable][bookofproofs$1184]. In particular, the set of all WHILE-computable functions is a proper subset of the set of all partially WHILE-computable functions:

`\[W H I L E\subset W H I L E^{part}.\]`

*Note*: This corollary actually makes sure that partially WHILE-computable functions are well-defined.
