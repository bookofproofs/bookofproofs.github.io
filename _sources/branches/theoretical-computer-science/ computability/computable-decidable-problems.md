Let `$\mathcal P$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] of [algorithms][bookofproofs$1777]. A [problem][bookofproofs$1776] `$P$` (respectively [decision problem][bookofproofs$1776]) is called *$\mathcal P$-computable*, (respectively *$\mathcal P$-decidable*) if there is an algorithm `$\mathcal A \in \mathcal P$` such that `$P$` can be computed (respectively decided), using `$\mathcal A.$`
