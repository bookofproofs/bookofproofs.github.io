Every [LOOP program][bookofproofs$1180] can be simulated using a [WHILE program][bookofproofs$1181]. In other words, the set of all [LOOP-computable functions][bookofproofs$1183] is a subset[^1] of all [WHILE-computable functions][bookofproofs$1184]:

`\[L O O P \subseteq W H I L E.\]`

[^1]: Please note that the conversion is not true. One reason for this is because [all LOOP-computable functions are total][bookofproofs$1185], but there are also [partially WHILE-computable functions][bookofproofs$1196] (which are not total).
