Let `\(F\)` be a [field][bookofproofs$557] and let `\(L/F\)` be its [field extension][bookofproofs$6213] Let `\(\alpha\in L\)` be [algebraic][bookofproofs$6255] over `\(F\)`. Then the [monic polynomial][bookofproofs$487] `\(p\in F[X]\)` with `\(p(\alpha)=0\)` of [minimal degree][bookofproofs$487] is called the **minimal polynomial** of `\(\alpha\)`.
