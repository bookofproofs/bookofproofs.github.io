Let `\(A\subset V\)` be a subset of a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] `\(V\)` over a [field][bookofproofs$557]  `\(F\)` and let `\(U\subset V\)` be a [subspace][bookofproofs$562] of `\(V\)`. Then `\(A\)` is called the **generating system** of `\(U\)` if and only its [linear span][bookofproofs$1037] equals `\(U\)`:
`\[A\text{ is generating system of }U\Longleftrightarrow \operatorname{Span}(A)=U.\]`

This is equivalent to the property that each vector `\(x\in U\)` can be represented as a linear combination of a given finitely many vectors in `\(v_i\in A\)`, i.e. 

`\[x=\sum _{j\in J}s_{j}v_{j}\]`

for all `\(x\in U\)` with `\(J\)` being a [finite][bookofproofs$985] index set, all `\(v_i\in A\)` and with `\(s_{j}\in F\)`.


If `\(A\)` is a generating system of `\(U\)` (like defined above), the subspace `\(U\)` is said to be **generated by** the vectors in `\(A\)`.
