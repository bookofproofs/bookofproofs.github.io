Let `$(R,\cdot,+)$` be an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] with the [multiplicative neutral element][bookofproofs$661] `$1,$` and let `$a,b\in R.$`

We call `$a$` a **divisor** of `$b$` (denoted by `$a\mid b$`), if and only if there exists an element `$c\in R$` such that `$ac=b.$` If `$a\mid b,$` then we call `$b$` a **multiple** of `$a.$`

### Notes

* This definition corresponds to the special case of a [divisor][bookofproofs$700], if `$R=\mathbb Z.$`

### Examples

* `$15\in\mathbb Z$` is a multiple of `$-5,$` since `$15=(-3)\cdot(-5),$` and `$-3\in\mathbb Z.$`
* `$\frac 12 x^2+\frac 1{12} x-1\in\mathbb Q[X]$` is a multiple of `$\frac 34{x}-1$` since `$\frac 12x^2+\frac 1{12} x-1=\left(\frac 23{x}+1\right)\left(\frac 34{x}-1\right),$` and `$\frac 23{x}+1\in\mathbb Q[X].$`
