An [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] `$(R,\cdot,+)$` is called an **Euclidean ring**, if there is a [function][bookofproofs$592], called the **Euclidean function**, mapping its non-zero elements to the set `$\mathbb N$` of [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `$f:R\setminus\{0\}\to\mathbb N$` such that for any two elements `$a,b\in R$` we have `$$a=qb+r$$`
with either `$r=0$` ($0\in R$) or `$f( r) < f(b).$`

### Notes

* This is a generalization of the [division with quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$818] of integers.
