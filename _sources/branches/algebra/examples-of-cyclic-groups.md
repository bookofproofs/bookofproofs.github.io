The following are examples of [cyclic groups][bookofproofs$807]:

* The integers under addition `$(\mathbb Z, + )$` form a cyclic group with the generator `$1$` and the generator `$-1$`. There are no other generators. 
* Given a positive integer `$n$`, the `$n$`-th roots of unity in the complex numbers form a cyclic group of order `$n$`, i.e. the complex exponential function `$\exp(2\pi i/n)$` is a generator of this group. Also, if `$r$` is relatively prime to `$n$`, then `$\exp(2\pi ir/n)$` is a generator of this group.
