Let `$(R,\cdot,+)$` be an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] with the [multiplicative neutral element][bookofproofs$661] `$1.$` And element `$a\in R$` is called a **unit** of `$R,$` if `$$a\mid 1\,$$` i.e. `$a$` is a [divisor][bookofproofs$8257] of `$1$`.

### Notes

* Unfolding the definition of a divisor in a ring, this means that there exists `\(b\in R\)` with `\(a\cdot b=1\)`.
* In other words, units in `\(R\)` are exactly those of its elements, which have [inverse elements][bookofproofs$670] with respect to the operation "`\(\cdot\)`".

### Examples

* `$1,-1$` are the only units of `$\mathbb Z.$`
* The units of the [polynomial ring][bookofproofs$6323] `$\mathbb Q[X]$` are the (obviously) all non-zero [constant polynomials][bookofproofs$487], i.e. the [rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033] `$q\in \mathbb Q$` having a [multiplicative inverse][bookofproofs$670].
