A _module_ is an [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342] generalizing the [vector space][bookofproofs$560]. Instead of combining the [Abelian group][bookofproofs$553] of _vectors_ with a [field][bookofproofs$557], it is combined with a [unit ring][bookofproofs$683]. When doing this, the _scalar multiplication_ becomes more general. For instance, depending on whether the ring is [commutative][bookofproofs$672] or not, it suddenly makes a difference if a vector is multiplied by a scalar from the left or the right side. For this reason, there is a difference between _left modules_ and _right modules_. Moreover, not all scalars have an [inverse][bookofproofs$670] counterpart. Therefore, when a vector is, for instance, "stretched" when multiplied by a scalar, there might be no scalar in the ring, which would reverse this stretching operation.

This chapter provides a formal definition of modules.
