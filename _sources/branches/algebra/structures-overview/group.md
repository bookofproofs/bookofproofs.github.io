A **group** `$(G,\ast)$` is a [monoid][bookofproofs$659], in which an [inverse element][bookofproofs$670] exists for each element, i.e. for all `$x\in G$` there is an `$x^{-1}\in G$` with `$x\ast x^{-1} =x^{-1}\ast x=e,$` where `$e\in G$` is the [neutral element][bookofproofs$661].

Please note that `$e\in X$` is [unique][bookofproofs$669] in `$G$` and `$x^{-1}$` is [unique][bookofproofs$359] for all `$x\in G.$`
