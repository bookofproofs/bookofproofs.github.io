Unfolding all definitions, a [group][bookofproofs$671] `$(G,\ast)$` fulfills the following properties:

---

1. [closure][bookofproofs$1103]: `$x \ast y\in G$` for all  `$x,y\in G$`.
2. [associativity][bookofproofs$668]: `\((x\ast y)\ast z=x\ast (y\ast z)\,\)`.
3. [existence of neutral element][bookofproofs$661]: There is an element `$e\in G$` with `$e\ast x=x\ast e=x$` for all `$x\in G$`.
4. [existence of inverse][bookofproofs$670]: For all `$x\in G$` there exists an `$x^{-1}\in G$` with `$x\ast x^{-1} =x^{-1}\ast x=e$`.


### Notes

* For technical reasons, these axioms are not minimal. 
* It is also possible to define a group if we require only the existence of a [left-neutral][bookofproofs$661] (respectively a [right-neutral][bookofproofs$661]), and the existence of [left-inverse][bookofproofs$670] (respectively a  [right-inverse][bookofproofs$670]) elements. 
* The reader might encounter this approach in some sources.
