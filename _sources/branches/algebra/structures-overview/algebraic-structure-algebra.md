Please note that the concept of a [binary operation][bookofproofs$6188] can be derived from the [set theory][bookofproofs$27]. It is a [function][bookofproofs$592], which is a special type of a [relation][bookofproofs$571]. On the other hand, a relation is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of the [Cartesian product][bookofproofs$748] `$X\times X.$`  In the following, we define _algebraic structures_ and also derive this concept directly from the set theory:

Let `$X$` be a [set][bookofproofs$6198], and let `$\ast_1,\ast_2,\ldots,\ast_n$` be [binary operations][bookofproofs$6188] defined on it. Since latter are also sets, by definition, we can build an [ordered `$n$`-tuple][bookofproofs$747] `$(X,\ast_1,\ast_2,\ldots,\ast_n).$` Thus, this tuple is a set, called the **algebraic structure** (or **algebra**) of `$X$` under the binary operations `$\ast_1,\ast_2,\ldots,\ast_n.$`
