*Linear algebra* is the study of [vector spaces][bookofproofs$560], that we have already introduced as a special kind of algebraical structure, and [linear maps][bookofproofs$403] between those vector spaces. We will introduce the theory step by step, starting with systems of linear equations emphasizing Euclidean spaces and matrices, and moving on to abstract spaces and linear maps.
