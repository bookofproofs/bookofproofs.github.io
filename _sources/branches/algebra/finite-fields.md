This part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong> deals with _finite fields_. The study of finite fields reveals that one can get an overview their general [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342]: it is possible to characterize and classify _all existing_ finite fields. It will turn out that the structure of finite fields is strongly connected to [prime numbers][bookofproofs$473]
