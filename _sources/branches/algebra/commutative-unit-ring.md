A **commutative ring** is a [ring][bookofproofs$683] `\((R, +,\cdot)\)`, in which the [binary operation][bookofproofs$6188] "`\(\cdot\)`" is commutative.

A **commutative unit ring**  [ring][bookofproofs$683] is a commutative ring `\((R, +,\cdot)\)` with a [neutral element][bookofproofs$661] of the operation "`\(\cdot\)`".

"Unfolding" all definitions, a _commutative ring_ fulfills the following axioms:

* Associativity of `$"+"$`: `$x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z$` for all `$x,y,z\in R.$`
* Commutativity of `$"+"$`: `$x+y=y+x$` for all `$x,y\in R.$`
* Neutral Element of `$"+"$`: There is an element `$0\in R$` with `$0+x=x+0=x$` for all `$x\in R.$`
* Inverse elements of `$"+"$`: For all `$x\in R$` there exists an `$-x\in G$` with `$x+(-x)=(-x)+x=0.$`
* Associativity of `$"\cdot"$`: `$x\cdot(y\cdot z)=(x\cdot y)\cdot z$` for all `$x,y,z\in R.$`
* Commutativity of `$"\cdot"$`: `$x\cdot y=y\cdot x$` for all `$x,y\in R.$`
* Neutral Element of `$"\cdot"$` (only when `$R$` is a unit ring!): There is an element `$1\in R$` with `$1\cdot x=x\cdot 1=x$` for all `$x\in R.$`
* Distributivity laws: `$(x+y)\cdot z=x\cdot z + y\cdot z$` and `$x\cdot (y+z)=x\cdot y + x\cdot z$` for all `$x,y,z\in R.$`
