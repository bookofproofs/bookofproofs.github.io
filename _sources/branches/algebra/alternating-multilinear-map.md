Let `\(F\)` be a [field][bookofproofs$557] and let `\(V_{1},\ldots ,V_{n}\)` and `\(W\)` be [vector spaces][bookofproofs$560] over `\(F\)`. A [multilinear map][bookofproofs$6319]

`\[\Phi \colon V^{n}=\underbrace {V\times \cdots \times V} _{n-{\text{times}}}\longrightarrow W\,\]`

is said to be **alternating**, if `\(\Phi (v)=0,\)` whenever in the tuple `\(v=(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{n})\)` to different entries are equal, i.e. `\(v_{i}=v_{j}\)` for a pair `\(i\neq j\)`.
