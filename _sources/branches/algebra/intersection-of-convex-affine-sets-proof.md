Let `\(\mathcal C\)` be a [family][bookofproofs$6198] of  [convex][bookofproofs$6287] [subsets][bookofproofs$552] `\(C\)` of an [`\(n\)`-dimensional][bookofproofs$6281] [affine space][bookofproofs$6277] `\(\mathcal A=(A,V_A,v)\)` with `\(V_A\)` as the associated [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over the field `\(\mathbb R\)` of [real numbers][bookofproofs$6194].
Take two points `\(P,Q\)` from the [intersection][bookofproofs$552] `\(\bigcap\mathcal C\)`.

By definition of set intersection, for all `\(C\in\mathcal C\)` we have that `\(P,Q\in C\)`.

The convexity of each C yields that the straight line `\(\lambda P+(1-\lambda)Q\)` is contained in each `\(C\)`.

Therefore, these elements are also in the intersection `\(\bigcap\mathcal C\)`, by definition of set intersection.

Hence  `\(\bigcap\mathcal C\)` is also convex.
