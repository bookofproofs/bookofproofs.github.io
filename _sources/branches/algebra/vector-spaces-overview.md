_Vector spaces_ are even more complex [algebraic structures][bookofproofs$85] than [fields][bookofproofs$265] In fact, they consist of two algebraic structures combined together, an [Abelian group][bookofproofs$553] of elements called _vectors_ and a [field][bookofproofs$557], the elements of which are used to manipulate the vectors in an operation called the _scalar multiplication_. The scalar multiplication adds special, additional properties to the vector space, which are not available in its components - neither in the field nor in the Abelian group. A vivid description of such properties is that vectors can be "stretched" or "compressed" when multiplied by a scalar from the field.

This chapter provides a definition of vector spaces, explains what _subspaces_ of vector spaces are, and provides some examples and basic conclusions from those definitions.
