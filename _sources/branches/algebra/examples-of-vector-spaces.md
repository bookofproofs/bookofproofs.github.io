### Example `$\mathbb R^1$`

The [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$6194] can be considered as a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over itself. We can add its vectors (adding real numbers) and we multiply them by a scalar (another real number).

From a geometrical point of view, the vector space `$\mathbb R^1$` can be imagined as a **number line**. the following figure shows the number line vector space and a vector in it (here the number `$3.5$`):

The number line has a designated vector, the zero vector `$(0)$`, and each point on the number line can be identified with the vector "pointing" to the real number `$x$`, which we can write as `$(x)$`.

### Example `$\mathbb R^2$`

<a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Descartes/">Ren√© Descartes</a> was the first to identify the points of a [plane][bookofproofs$647] with pairs of two real numbers. As in the case of a number line, this requires the choice of a special vector, which is the zero vector `$(0,0)$`. Then, each point in the plane with the coordinates `$x$` and `$y$` can be identified with a vector pointing to the point, which has the same coordinates, i.e. the vector `$(x,y).$`
