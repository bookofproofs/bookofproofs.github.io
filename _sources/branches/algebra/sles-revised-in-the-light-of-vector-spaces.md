Note that the [elementary Gaussian operations][bookofproofs$7952] `$I$` and `$II$` correspond to the [scalar multiplication][bookofproofs$560] and the [vector addition][bookofproofs$560], followed by a scalar multiplication. Moreover, if we consider a system of linear equations (SLE) in a vector space `$V$`, then the following can be said about its solutions:

If the vector `$u$` is a solution [inhomogeneous system of linear equations][bookofproofs$1044] `$Ax=b,$` then all of its solutions are given by the vectors `$y:=u\pm h,$` where `$h$` is the solution of the [homogeneous system of linear equations][bookofproofs$1044] `$Ah=0.$`

In fact, the above statement reformulates in a much shorter notation a theorem stating the [relationship between the solutions of homogeneous and inhomogeneous SLEs][bookofproofs$7957], which was proved above.
