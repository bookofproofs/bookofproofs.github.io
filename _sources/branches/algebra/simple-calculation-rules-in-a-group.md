In a [group][bookofproofs$671] `\((G,\ast)\)`, the following calculation rules follow immediately from the definition:

1. The inverse element of `\(e\)` is `\(e\)` itself, symbolically `\(e^{-1}=e\)`.
1. The equation `\((x^{-1})^{-1}=x\)` holds for all `\(x\in G\)`.
1. For all `\(a,b\in G\)`, the equation `\(a\ast x=b\)` is uniquely solvable in `\(G\)`, and the solution is `\(x=a^{-1}\ast b\)`.
1. For all `$a,b\in G$`, the equation `\(y\ast a=b\)` is uniquely solvable in `$G$`, and the solution is `$y=b\ast a^{-1}.$`
1. A group is [cancellative][bookofproofs$837], i.e. if `$a\ast x=a\ast y$` then `$x=y$` and if `$x\ast a=y\ast a$` then `$x=y.$`
1. The equation `\((x\ast y)^{-1}=y^{-1}\ast x^{-1}\)` holds for all `\(x,y\in G\)`.
1. `\(x_1\ast  x_2\ast  x_3\ast \ldots\ast  x_n:=(\ldots((x_1\ast  x_2)\ast  x_3)\ast \ldots\ast x_n\)` holds for all `\(x_i\in G\)`.


If the group `\((G,\ast)\)` is [Abelian][bookofproofs$553], then it also follows that  

#8. `\(x_{k_1}\ast  x_{k_2}\ast  \ldots\ast  x_{k_n}=x_{1}\ast  x_{2}\ast  \ldots\ast  x_{n}\)` holds for any permutation `\(k_1,\ldots,k_n\)` of the indices `\(1,\ldots, n\)`.
