A subset `\(B\)` of a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] `\(V\neq \{0\}\)` is called a **basis** (or a **coordinate system**) if 

* `\(B\)` is a [generating system][bookofproofs$279] of `\(V\)`,
* Any [finitely many][bookofproofs$985] vectors of `\(B\)` are [linearly independent][bookofproofs$1036]

In other words, `\(B\)` is a set of linearly independent vectors that, in a linear combination, can represent every vector in `\(V\)`. The elements of the `\(B\)` are called **basis vectors**.
