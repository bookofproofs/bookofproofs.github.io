* By hypothesis,  `$(R, + ,\cdot)$` is an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821].
* Let `$R^\ast\subset R$` be the [subset][bookofproofs$552] of `$R$` containing all [units][bookofproofs$8259] of `$R.$`
* Obviously, `$1\in R^\ast,$` therefore `$R^\ast$` is not empty.
* If `$a\in R^\ast$` then, by definition of a unit, there exists an `$b\in R$` with `$a\cdot b=1.$`
* Since `$R$` is an integral domain, the multiplication "`$\cdot$`" is [commutative][bookofproofs$672].
* Therefore, `$b\cdot a=1,$` thus `$b$` is a also unit.
* Therefore `$b\in R^\ast,$` if `$a\in R^\ast.$`
* We have shown that `$R^\ast$` contains always both, an element `$a\in R^\ast$` and also its [multiplicative inverse][bookofproofs$670] `$b\in R^\ast.$`
* Since "`$\cdot$`" is associative, we have shown all properties of a [group][bookofproofs$671].
* This proves that the _group of units_ `$(R^\ast,\cdot)$` is indeed a group.
