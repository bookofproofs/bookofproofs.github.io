Let `\((G,\circ)\)` be a [group][bookofproofs$671] and  let `\(M\)` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] A [function][bookofproofs$592] `\[\circ:\cases{G\times M\longrightarrow M,\cr (g,x)\longmapsto g\circ x},\]`

is called a *group operation (of `\(G\)` on `\(M\)`)*, if the following properties are fulfilled:

* `\(e\circ x=x\)` for all `\(x\in M\)`.
* `\((g\circ h)\circ x=g\circ (h\circ x)\)` for all `\(g,h\in G\)` and for all `\(x\in M\)`.
