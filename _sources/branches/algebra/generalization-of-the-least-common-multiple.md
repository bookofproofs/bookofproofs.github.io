Let `$(R,\cdot,+)$` be an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] with the [multiplicative neutral element][bookofproofs$661] `$1,$` and let `$M\subseteq R$` be its [finite][bookofproofs$985] [subset][bookofproofs$552] The element `$a$` is called the **least common multiple** of `$M,$` if and only if:

* `$m\mid a\quad\forall m\in M$`, i.e. all elements `$m\in M$` are [divisors][bookofproofs$8257] of `$a$`, i.e. `$a$` is a **common multiple** of `$M$`, and   
* `$m\mid a'\quad\forall m\in M\Rightarrow a\mid a'$`, i.e. `$a$` divides any other common multiple `$a'$` of `$M.$` 

We express these two conditions being fulfilled simultaneously for `$a$` by writing `$a=\operatorname{lcm}(M).$`

### Notes

* This definition corresponds to the special case of a [least common multiple][bookofproofs$1276], if `$R=\mathbb Z.$`
