By hypothesis, `$(R, + ,\cdot)$` is an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821], `$a\in R,$` and `$a\neq 0.$`

### "`$\Rightarrow$`"

* Assume, `$(a)\lhd R$` is a [principal ideal][bookofproofs$1063], which is also [maximal][bookofproofs$6243] among all principal ideals in `$R.$`
* Furthermore, assume `$a=rs$` for some `$r,s\in R.$`
* Since `$R$` is an integral domain, and `$a\neq 0$` by hypothesis, we have `$r\neq 0$` and `$s\neq 0.$`
* In particular, by [divisibility of principal ideals][bookofproofs$1066], since `$r\mid a$` is a [divisor][bookofproofs$8257] of `$a,$` we have `$(r)\mid ( a)$`, in other words `$(a)\subseteq ( r).$`
* But since `$(a)$` is maximal, there is no ideal `$(r)$` being a [proper superset][bookofproofs$552] of `$(a).$`
* Therefore, either `$(a)=(r),$` or `$(r)=R.$`
* In the case `$(r)=R,$` by [principal ideal generated by a unit][bookofproofs$8294], we have that `$r\in R^\ast$` is a [unit][bookofproofs$8259].
* In the case `$(a)=(r),$` by [equality of principal ideals][bookofproofs$8293], we have that `$a\sim b$` are [associates][bookofproofs$8260], i.e. `$s$` is a unit.
* It follows that `$a$` is an [irreducible element][bookofproofs$822] in `$R,$` since we have shown that `$a\neq 0,$` and from `$a=rs$` it followed that `$r$` is a unit or `$s$` is a unit.

### "`$\Leftarrow$`"

* Conversely, assume, `$a$` is [irreducible][bookofproofs$822] in `$R.$`
* Furthermore, assume `$( r )\lhd R$` is a [principal ideal][bookofproofs$1063] with `$(a)\subset ( r )\subset R.$`
* This means `$(r)\mid ( a ),$` and it follows that `$r\mid a$`, i.e. `$a=rs$` for some `$s\in R.$`
* But since `$a$` is irreducible, we have that `$r$` is a unit or `$s$` is a unit.
* Since `$( r)\subset R,$` we have that `$( r)\neq R,$` and by [principal ideal generated by a unit][bookofproofs$8294] `$r$` is _not_ a unit.
* Therefore `$s$` _is_ a unit, but in this case, `$a\sim r$` and by [equality of principal ideals][bookofproofs$8293], `$(a)=( r)$` which [contradicts][bookofproofs$744] `$(a)\subset ( r).$`
* Therefore, the assumption is incorrect, i.e. there is no `$( r )\lhd R$` with `$(a)\subset ( r )\subset R.$` 
* In other words, `$(a)$` is a [maximal ideal][bookofproofs$6243] in `$R$` among all principal ideals in `$R.$`

Finally, we can conclude that if `$R$` is a [principal ideal ring][bookofproofs$1064], then _every_  principal ideal `$(a)$` generated by an irreducible element `$a\in R$` is a maximal ideal in `$R.$`
