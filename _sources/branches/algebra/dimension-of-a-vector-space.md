The **dimension** `\(\operatorname {dim}(V)\)` of a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] `\(V\)` is the maximum number `\(n\)` of [linearly independent][bookofproofs$1036] vectors contained in `\(V\)`. If no such maximum number exists, we set `\(dim(V)=\infty\)`.

* If `\(\operatorname {dim}(V) = \infty\)`, `\(V\)` is called a **infinitely dimensional vector space**.
* If `\(\operatorname {dim}(V) < \infty\)`, `\(V\)` is called a **finitely dimensional vector space**.
