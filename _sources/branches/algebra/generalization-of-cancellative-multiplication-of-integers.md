The following proposition is only a generalization of a [cancelling rule when multiplying integers][bookofproofs$1464] In this sense, the ring of integers `$(\mathbb Z, + ,\cdot)$` is only one special case of an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821], in which this law always holds.

Let `$(R, + ,\cdot)$` be an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821]. Then the multiplication operation `$[\cdot"$` is "cancellative][bookofproofs$837], i.e. for all `$a,b,c\in R$` with `$c\neq 0$` the following equivalence holds: `$$ac=bc\Longleftrightarrow a=b.$$`
