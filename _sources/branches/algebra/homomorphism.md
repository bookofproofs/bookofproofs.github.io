A **homomorphism** is a [total function][bookofproofs$592] `\(f:G\to H\)` between two [algebraic structures][bookofproofs$342] `$(G,\ast)$` and `$(H,\cdot)$`, which for all `$x,y\in G$` fulfills the property 
`\[f(x\ast y)=f(x)\cdot f(y).\]`

### Notes

* Homomorphisms can exist between different types of algebraic structures, including groups, rings, and fields.
* A homomorphism means that it doesn't matter if we first combine the two elements `$x,y$` via the operation `$"\ast"$` in `$G$` and then map the result to `$H$` or if we first map `$x$` and `$y$` to `$H$` and combine `$f(x)$` and `$f(y)$` via the operation `$"\cdot"$` in `$H.$` In both cases, we will get the same result for all pairs of elements `$x,y\in G.$`
