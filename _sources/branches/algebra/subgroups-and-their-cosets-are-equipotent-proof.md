* Let `$(G,\ast)$` be a [group][bookofproofs$671], `$a\in G$` and let `$H\subseteq G$` be a [subgroup][bookofproofs$554] 
* For the [left coset][bookofproofs$827] `$aH$` let `$f:H\to aH,$` `$f(x)=ax$` be a [function][bookofproofs$592]
* By definition, `$f$` is [surjective][bookofproofs$770]
* If `$f(x)=f(y)$` then `$ax=ay$` and since `$a$` has an [inverse][bookofproofs$670] in `$G,$` also `$x=y.$` 
* Thus, `$f$` is [injective][bookofproofs$769] 
* Thus, `$H$` and `$aH$` are [equipotent][bookofproofs$978]
* The same reasoning holds for [right cosets][bookofproofs$827].
