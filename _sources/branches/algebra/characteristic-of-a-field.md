The following definition is analogous to the [characteristic of a ring][bookofproofs$881]:

---

Let `$(F, + ,\cdot)$` be a [field][bookofproofs$557], let `$1\in F$` be its [neutral element][bookofproofs$661] of multiplication `$"\cdot",$` and let `$0\in F$` be its [neutral element][bookofproofs$661] of addition `$"+".$`

A **characteristic of a field** `$\operatorname{char}( F )$` is the minimal[^1] [natural number][bookofproofs$664] `\(n\)`, for which
`\[\underbrace{1 + \ldots + 1}_{n\text{ times}}=n\cdot 1=0.\]`


[^1]: Such minimal element exists due to the [well-ordering principle of the natural numbers][bookofproofs$698] If in a given field `\(F\)` there is no such such `$n$` with `$n > 0$`, then `$n=0$` will do the trick.
