Let `\(\mathcal A=(A,V_A,v)\)` be an [`\(n\)`-dimensional][bookofproofs$6281] [affine space][bookofproofs$6277] for a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `\(n\ge 0\)`. Let `\(U\subseteq \mathcal A\)` be an [affine subspace][bookofproofs$414]

* If `\(\operatorname{dim}(U)=-1\)`, then `\(U=\emptyset\)`.
* If `\(\operatorname{dim}(U)=0\)`, then `\(U\)` is called a **point**.
* If `\(\operatorname{dim}(U)=1\)`, then `\(U\)` is called a **line**.
* If `\(\operatorname{dim}(U)=2\)`, then `\(U\)` is called a **plane**.
* If `\(\operatorname{dim}(U)=s\)` with `\(s < n\)`, then `\(U\)` is called an *`\(s\)`-dimensional hyperplane*.
