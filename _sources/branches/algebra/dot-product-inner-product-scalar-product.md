Let `\(v,w\)` be two [vectors][bookofproofs$560] of a finitely dimensional vector space `\(V\)` over a the [field][bookofproofs$557] `\(F\)` given in their column notations with respect to given [finite][bookofproofs$985] [basis][bookofproofs$299]:

`\[
v=\pmatrix{
\alpha_{1}\cr
\alpha_{2}\cr
\vdots \cr
\alpha_{n} \cr
}, ~~~~~~~~w=\pmatrix{
\beta_{1}\cr
\beta_{2}\cr
\vdots \cr
\beta_{n} \cr
},
\]`
the **inner product**, (or **dot product**, or **scalar product**) of `\(v\)` and `\(w\)` is a [function][bookofproofs$592] `\(\langle v,w\rangle:V\times V\mapsto F\)` defined by 
`\[\langle v,w\rangle:=\pmatrix{
\alpha_{1}~
\alpha_{2}~
\dots ~
\alpha_{n}
}\cdot\pmatrix{
\beta_{1}\cr
\beta_{2}\cr
\vdots \cr
\beta_{n} \cr
}=\alpha_1\beta_1+\alpha_2\beta_2+\ldots+\alpha_n\beta_n\in F.\]`
