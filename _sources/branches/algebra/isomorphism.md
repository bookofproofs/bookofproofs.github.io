An **isomorphism** is a [bijective][bookofproofs$771] [homomorphism][bookofproofs$401] `\(f:G\to H\)` of two [algebraic structures][bookofproofs$342] `\((G,\ast)\)`, `\((H,\cdot)\)` 

`\[f(a\ast b)=f(a)\cdot f(b).\]`

If an isomorphism exists between `\((G,\ast)\)`, `\((H,\cdot),\)` we write `\(G\simeq H\)` and say that `\(G\)` and `\(H\)` are **isomorphic**.
