An [ordered field][bookofproofs$6192], in which one of the following (equivalent) rules is fulfilled is called a **complete ordered field**.

1. Every [Cauchy sequence][bookofproofs$1072] [converges][bookofproofs$141], is called 
1. Every [non-empty][bookofproofs$550] bounded [subset][bookofproofs$552] has a [supremum][bookofproofs$7995].
### Example

Because of the [completeness principle][bookofproofs$1108], the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$1638] is a complete ordered field.
