Let `\((X,\ast)\)` be an [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342] If `$X$` has an element `$e\in X$` with 

* `\(e\ast x=x\)` for all `\(x\in (X,\ast)\)`, then `$e$` is called *left-neutral* (or *left-identity*, or *left-unit*)
* `\(x\ast e=x\)` for all `\(x\in (X,\ast)\)`, then `$e$` is called *right-neutral* (or *right-identity*, or *right-unit*).  

If `$e$` is both, left-neutral and right-neutral, then it is called **neutral** (or **identity**, or **unit**).

### Notes

* If `$"\ast"$` is an "multiplication" operation, we can also say **multiplicative neutral element** and denote `$e$` by `$1.$` 
* If `$"\ast"$` is an "addition" operation, we can also say **additive neutral element** and denote `$e$` by `$0.$`
