Let `\(V\)` be a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over the [field of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690] `\(\mathbb C\)`. It follows immediately from the definition of [scalar product][bookofproofs$1049] `\(\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle\)` on `\(V\)` that it is [function][bookofproofs$592]

`\[V\times V\longrightarrow \mathbb {C} ,\,(v,w)\longmapsto \left\langle v,w\right\rangle \,,\]`

with the following properties:

1. `\(\left\langle \lambda _{1}x_{1}+\lambda _{2}x_{2},y\right\rangle =\lambda _{1}\left\langle x_{1},y\right\rangle +\lambda _{2}\left\langle x_{2},y\right\rangle \,\)` for all `\(\lambda_{1},\lambda _{2}\in \mathbb {C} \)`, `\(x_{1},x_{2},y\in V\)`,
1. `\(\left\langle x, \lambda _{1}y_{1}+\lambda _{2}y_{2}\right\rangle = \lambda_{1}^*\left\langle x, y_{1}\right\rangle + \lambda_{2}^*\left\langle x, y_{2}\right\rangle \,\)` for all `\(\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2}\in \mathbb {C} \)`, `\(x, y_{1},y_{2}\in V\)`, where  `\(\lambda_i^*\)` is the [complex conjugate][bookofproofs$1245] of `\(\lambda_i\)` 
1. `\(\left\langle v,w\right\rangle =\left\langle w,v\right\rangle^* \,\)` for all `\(v,w\in V\)`.
1. `\(\left\langle v,v\right\rangle \geq 0\)` for all `\(v\in V\)` and `\(\left\langle v,v\right\rangle =0\)` if and only if `\(v=0\)`.

If only the first three properties are fulfilled, then we call `\(\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle\)` a **Hermitian form**.
