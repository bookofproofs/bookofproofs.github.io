Let `\( ( G ,\ast) \)` be a [group][bookofproofs$671] and let `\(N\unlhd G\)` be its [normal subgroup][bookofproofs$273] The [quotient set][bookofproofs$829] `\(G/N:=\{aN: a\in G\}\)` of all [ (left) cosets][bookofproofs$827], together with the binary operation "`\(\circ\)`":

`\[(a_1 N)\circ(a_2N):=(a_1\ast a_2)N\quad\quad(a_1,a_2\in G)\]`

forms a group `\((G/N,\circ )\)`, called the **factor group** of `\(G\)` with respect to the normal subgroup `\(N\)`, (also pronounced as "G modulo N"). In particular: 

1. The operation [`\(\circ\)`" is "well-defined][bookofproofs$558], (i.e. it does not depend on the particular choice of representatives `\(a_1,a_2\)`). 
1. The operation [`\(\circ\)`" is "associative][bookofproofs$668] 
1. `\((G/N,\circ )\)` is not [empty][bookofproofs$550] and contains at least the [neutral element][bookofproofs$661] of `\((G/N,\circ )\)` is `\(N\)`. 
1. The [inverse element][bookofproofs$670] of an element `\(aN\)` of `\((G/N,\circ )\)` is `\(a^{-1}N\)`.
1. The [inverse element][bookofproofs$670] of an element `\(aN\)` of `\((G/N,\circ )\)` is `\(a^{-1}N\)`.
