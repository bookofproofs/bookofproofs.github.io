Two [principal ideals][bookofproofs$1063] `$(a)$` and `$(b)$` of an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] `$(R, + ,\cdot)$` are equal, if and only if `$a$` and `$b$` are [associates][bookofproofs$8260] in `$R,$` formally `$$(a)=(b)\Longleftrightarrow a\sim b.$$`

A [principal ideal][bookofproofs$1063] `$(a)$` equals the [zero ring][bookofproofs$879], if and only if `$a=0,$` formally `$$(a)=(0)\Longleftrightarrow a=0.$$`
