Let `\(A\in M_{n\times n}(F)\)` be a [square matrix][bookofproofs$1056]. If there exists another square matrix `\(B\in M_{n\times n}(F)\)` which, when [multiplied][bookofproofs$1050] with `\(A\)`, results in the [identity matrix][bookofproofs$1051]:

`\[AB=BA=I,\]` 

then we call `\(A\)` an **invertible matrix** and `\(B=A^{-1}\)` its **inverse matrix**.
