A [subgroup][bookofproofs$554] `\(N\)` of a [group][bookofproofs$671] `\(G\)` is called **normal** and denoted as `\(N\unlhd G\)`, if and only if:

> *(1)* its [left and right cosets][bookofproofs$827] with respect to any element `\(a\in G\)` coincide, i.e. 
`\[aN=Na,~\forall a\in G.\]`

#### Equivalent definition:

> *(2)* for all `\(a\in G\)`:
`\[aNa^{-1}=N\]`

where the set `\(aNa^{-1}\)` is defined as `\(\{g\in G~|~g=a\ast h\ast a^{-1},~h\in N\}.\)`
