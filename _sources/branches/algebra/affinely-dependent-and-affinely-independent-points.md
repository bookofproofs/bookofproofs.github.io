Let `\(\mathcal A=(A,V_A,v)\)` be an [affine space][bookofproofs$6277] `\(n+1\)` points 
`\[P_0,P_1,P_2\ldots,P_n\]`

are called **affinely independent points** (respectively **affinely dependent points**), if the `\(n\)` vectors 

`\[x_1=\overrightarrow{P_0P_1},\,x_2=\overrightarrow{P_0P_2},\,\ldots,\,x_n=\overrightarrow{P_0P_n}\]`

are [linearly independent][bookofproofs$1036] (respectively [linearly dependent][bookofproofs$1036]) in `\(V_A\)`.
