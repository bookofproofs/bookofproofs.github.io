Let `$I\lhd R$` and `$J\lhd R$` be two [ideals][bookofproofs$1062] of the ring `$R$`. Then we say that the ideal `$I$` **divides** the ideal `$J$` (or that `$J$` is **a multiple** or that `$J$` is **divisible by** `$I$`) - symbolically `\(I \mid J\)`, if `\(I\)` is a [superset][bookofproofs$552] of `\( J \)`:

`\[I \mid J\Longleftrightarrow I\supseteq J.\]`
