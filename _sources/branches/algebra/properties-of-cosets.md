Let `\((G,\ast)\)` be a [group][bookofproofs$671] and `\(H\subseteq G\)` its [subgroup][bookofproofs$554] Then the following properties hold for cosets:

> (1) If `\(|H|=n\)`, then `\(|aH|=n\)` (respectively `\(|Ha|=n\)`), i.e. cosets of a finite subgroup have the same order as this subgroup.

> (2) The relation `\(a\sim_l b:=a\in bH\)` (respectively `\(a\sim_r b:=a\in Hb\)`) defines an [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574] on the group `\(G\)`. In particular, it partitions the group `\(G\)` into left cosets (respectively right cosets). The [quotient set][bookofproofs$574] of these left cosets (respectively right cosets) is denoted by `\(G/\sim_l=\{aH: a\in G\}\)` (or respectively `\(G/\sim_r=\{Ha: a\in G\}\)`).
