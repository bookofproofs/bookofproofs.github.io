Let `\(V\)` be a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over a field `\(F\)`. Consider a set of finitely many vectors `\(A:=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n|~v_i\in V\}\)`. The set of all possible [linear combinations][bookofproofs$1035] of the vectors in `\(A\)` is called the **linear span** (or the **linear hull**) of `\(A\)` and denoted by `\(Span(A)\)`:

`\[Span(A):=\{\alpha_1 x_1 + \ldots \alpha_n x_n|~\alpha_i\in F,~x_i\in A\}\]`
