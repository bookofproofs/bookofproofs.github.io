Let `\(V\)` be a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over a [field][bookofproofs$557] `\(F\)`. A [bilinear form][bookofproofs$6229] `\(\left\langle -,-\right\rangle \)` on `\(V\)`  is called **symmetric**, if

`\[\left\langle v,w\right\rangle =\left\langle w,v\right\rangle \,\]`

for all `\(v,w\in V\)`.
