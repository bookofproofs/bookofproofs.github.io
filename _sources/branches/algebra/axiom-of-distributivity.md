We say that the binary operation "`\(\cdot\)`" is **distributive** over the binary operation "`\( + \)`", if the **distributivity law** 
`\[(x+y)\cdot z=x\cdot z + y\cdot z\quad\quad\text{"right-distributivity property"}\]`
and
`\[x\cdot (y+z)=x\cdot y + x\cdot z\quad\quad\text{"left-distributivity property"}\]`
holds for any three elements `\(x,y,z\)` of an algebraic structure, in which these two operations are defined and for which the law is postulated.
