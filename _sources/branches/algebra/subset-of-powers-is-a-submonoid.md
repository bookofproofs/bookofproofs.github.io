As an example of a substructure, we show that the consecutive performance of the binary operation `$"\ast"$` on the same element creates a substructure in a monoid.

If `$x$` is an element of a [monoid][bookofproofs$659] `$(X,\ast)$`, then the [subset][bookofproofs$552] of all powers `$x^n$`, `$(n=0,1,2,\ldots)$` is a [substructure][bookofproofs$6210] of `$X$`, called its **submonoid**.
