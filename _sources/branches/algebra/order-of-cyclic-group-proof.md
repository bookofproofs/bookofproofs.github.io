By hypothesis, `\((G,\ast)\)` is a [cyclic group][bookofproofs$807] with a [finite][bookofproofs$985] [group order][bookofproofs$8071] i.e. `\(|G|=n < \infty,\)`, `\(e\in G\)` the [neutral element][bookofproofs$661] and `$a\in G.$` 

### Proof of (1)

* From [finite order of an element equals order of generated group][bookofproofs$8270] it follows that the group `$\langle a\rangle$` [generated by][bookofproofs$8265] by `$a$` has a group order, which equals the order [order of the element][bookofproofs$807] `$\operatorname{ord}(a).$` 
* From [Langrange's theorem][bookofproofs$831] it follows that `$|\langle a\rangle|$` is a [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of the [group order][bookofproofs$8071] `$|G|.$`

### Proof of (2)

* Applying [Langrange's theorem][bookofproofs$831] once again, we get 
`$$\begin{array}{rcl}a^{|G|}&=&a^{|\langle a\rangle|\cdot |G/\langle a\rangle|}\\
&=&(a^{|\langle a\rangle|})^{|G/\langle a\rangle|}\\
&=&(a^{\operatorname{ord}(a)})^{|G/\langle a\rangle|}\\
&=&e^{|G/\langle a\rangle|}\\
&=&e
\end{array}$$`
