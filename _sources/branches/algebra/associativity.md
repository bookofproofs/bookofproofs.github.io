Let `$(X,\ast)$` be an [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$85] The [binary operation][bookofproofs$6188] `$"\ast"$` is called **associative** if `$(x\ast y)\ast z=x\ast (y\ast z)$` holds for any three elements `\(x,y,z\in X\)`. 

Note: The parantheses in the above definition are a notation of the [composition of the function][bookofproofs$1314] `$"\ast$`" with itself and it is required that both sides of the following equation are equal:

`$$\ast(\ast(x,y),z)=\ast(x,\ast(y,z)).$$`
