The following proposition is a generalization of how to [create a reduced residue system][bookofproofs$8177] of integers from others".

An element `$c$` is a [unit][bookofproofs$8259] of an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] `$(R, + ,\cdot)$` if and only if the [principal ideal][bookofproofs$1063] `$(c)$` equals the whole domain `$R$`; formally `$$c\in R^\ast\Longleftrightarrow ( c )=R.$$`
