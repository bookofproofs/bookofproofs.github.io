Let `\(\operatorname{Spec}(R)\)` be the [sectrum][bookofproofs$6245] of a [commutative ring][bookofproofs$880] `\(R\)`. We can make `\(R\)` a [topological space][bookofproofs$6189], if we assert that for any [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(T\subseteq R\)` the [set][bookofproofs$550] 
`\[D(T):=\left\{I\in \operatorname {Spec} \left(R\right){|}\,T\not \subseteq I\right\}\]`
is [open][bookofproofs$852] This topology is called the **Zariski topology** on `\(R\)` and is named after the mathematician "Oscar Zariski":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/oscar-zariski/.
