Let `\((F,+,\cdot)\)` be a [field][bookofproofs$557] and `\(V\)` be a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over `\(F\)`. A non-empty [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(U\subseteq V\)` is called **subspace** of `\(V\)`, if

1. `$0\in U,$`
1. `$x + y\in U$` for all `$x,y\in U,$`
1. `$\alpha\cdot x\in U$` for all `$\alpha \in F, x\in U.$`

These properties are equivalent to those:

* `\((U, + )\)` is a  [subgroup][bookofproofs$554] of `\((V, + )\)` and 
* `\(U\)` is closed under the [scalar multiplication][bookofproofs$560] by elements of `\(F\)`.
