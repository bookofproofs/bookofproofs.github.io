Let `\(V\)` be a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over a [field][bookofproofs$557] `\(F\)` and let `\(n\in \mathbb {N} \)` be a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] The **exterior algebra** or the *`\(n\)`-th alternating product of `\(V\)`*, denoted by `\(\bigwedge ^{n}V\)`, is a vector space over `\(F\)` constructed as follows:

* Consider the [set][bookofproofs$550] `\(S\)` of all `\(n\)`-tuples `\({(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{n})}{\text{ mit }}v_{i}\in V\)` and the corresponding [basis vectors][bookofproofs$299] `\(e_{(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{n})}\)`. 
* Build a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] `\(H=K^{(S)}\,,\)` generated by the [generating system][bookofproofs$279] `\(a_{1}e_{s_{1}}+\cdots +a_{k}e_{s_{k}}\)` with `\(a_{i}\in F\)` and `\(s_{i}\in S,\)`.
* In `\(H\)`, consider the [subspace][bookofproofs$562] `\(U\subseteq H\)` generated by the following elements: 
   * Additivity: `\(e_{(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{i-1},v+w,v_{i+1},\ldots ,v_{n})}-e_{(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{i-1},v,v_{i+1},\ldots ,v_{n})}-e_{(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{i-1},w,v_{i+1},\ldots ,v_{n})}\)` for arbitrary `\(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{i-1},v_{i+1},\ldots ,v_{n},v,w\in V\)`.
   * Scalar Multiplication `\(e_{(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{i-1},av,v_{i+1},\ldots ,v_{n})}-ae_{(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{i-1},v,v_{i+1},\ldots ,v_{n})}\)` for arbitrary `\(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{i-1},v_{i+1},\ldots ,v_{n},v\in V\)` und `\(a\in K\)`.
   * Alternating property `\(e_{(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{i-1},v,v_{i+1},\ldots ,v_{j-1},v,v_{j+1},\ldots ,v_{n})}\)` for `\(i < j\)` and arbitrary `\(v_{1},\ldots, v_{i-1},v_{i+1},\ldots,v_{j-1},v_{j+1},\ldots,v_{n},v\in V\)`.

* Set `\(\bigwedge ^{n}V:=H/U\,,\)` as the [quotient space][bookofproofs$71] defined by the [equivalence relation induced by `\(U\)` on `\(H\)` ][bookofproofs$6328]
