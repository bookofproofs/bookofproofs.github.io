Let `\((R, +,\cdot)\)` be an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] 

An element `$p\in R$` is called a **prime** element of `$R$`, if and only if

* `$p\neq 0,$` and
* `$p$` is not a [unit][bookofproofs$8259], and 
* if `$p\mid ab$`, then `$p\mid a\vee p\mid b,$` i.e. if `$p$` [divides][bookofproofs$8257] a product of two elements `$a,b\in  R,$` then it equals on of them.

An element `$p\in R$` is called **irreducible**, if and only if

* `$p\neq 0,$` and
* `$p$` is not a [unit][bookofproofs$8259], and 
* if `$p\mid ab$`, then either `$a$` or `$b$` is a [unit][bookofproofs$8259].
