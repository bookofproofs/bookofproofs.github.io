Let `$(X,\ast)$` be an [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342] and let `$x\in X$`. If `$e$` denotes the [neutral element][bookofproofs$661], an element `$y\in X$` with 
* `$y\ast x=e$` is called *left-inverse* to `$x,$` and
* `$x\ast y=e$` is called *right-inverse* to `$x.$`

If `$y$` is both, left-inverse and right-inverse, it is called an **inverse** element of `$x$`. If such `$y$` exists, then we call the element `$x$` **invertible**. 

### Notes

* If `$"\ast"$` is interpreted as a **multiplication** operation then we write `$x^{-1}$` or `$\frac 1x$` instead of `$y$` and call `$x^{-1}$` the **multiplicative inverse** of `$x.$`
* If `$"\ast"$` is interpreted as an **addition** operation then we write `$-x$` instead of `$y$`  and call `$-x$` the **additive inverse** of `$x.$`
