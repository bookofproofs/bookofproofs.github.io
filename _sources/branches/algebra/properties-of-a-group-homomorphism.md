Let `\((G,\ast)\)` and `\((H,\cdot)\)` be two [groups][bookofproofs$671] with the respective [identities][bookofproofs$661] `\(e_G\)` and `\(e_H\)` and `\(f:G\rightarrow H\)` be a [group homomorphism][bookofproofs$679] Then it has the following properties:

`\[\begin{array}{cl}
(1)&f(e_G)=e_H,\\
(2)&f(x^{-1})=f(x)^{-1}~~\forall x\in G.
\end{array}\]`
