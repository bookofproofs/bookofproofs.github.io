Let `\(I\lhd R\)` and `\(J\lhd R\)` be two [ideals][bookofproofs$1062] of the ring `\(R\)`. Then 

# The [sum][bookofproofs$1068] `\(I+J\)` is an ideal of `\(R\)` and is the greatest [ideal dividing][bookofproofs$1065] `\(I\)` and `\(J\)`. We denote it as the **greatest common divisor** of the ideals
`\[I+J=gcd(I,J).\]`
# The [intersection][bookofproofs$552] of the ideals `\(I\cap J\)` is an ideal of `\(R\)` and is the smallest ideal, which is divisible by  `\(I\)` and `\(J\)`. We denote it as the **least common multiple** of the ideals
`\[I\cap J=lcm(I,J).\]`
