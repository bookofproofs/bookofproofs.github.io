Let `$(G,\ast)$` be a [group][bookofproofs$671] For every [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$A\subseteq G$` define `$$\langle A\rangle:=\bigcap_{A\subset S\subset G}S$$` as the [set intersection][bookofproofs$6828] of all [subgroups][bookofproofs$554] `$S$` of `$G$` containing `$A.$` 

Obviously, `$A\subset \langle A\rangle$` and `$\langle A\rangle \subset S$` for every subgroup `$S$` of `$G.$` Therefore, `$\langle A\rangle$` is the _smallest_ subgroup of `$G$` containing `$A.$` We call `$A$` the **generating set** of `$\langle A\rangle$` and `$\langle A\rangle$` the **group generated by** `$A.$` If `$A$` is finite, we write `$\langle a_1,\ldots,a_n\rangle.$`
