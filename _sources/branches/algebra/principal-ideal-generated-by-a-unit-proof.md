### "`$\Rightarrow$`"

* Let `$c$` is a [unit][bookofproofs$8259] of an  [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] `$(R, + ,\cdot).$`
* This means, there is a [multiplicative inverse][bookofproofs$670] `$b\in R$` with `$bc=1.$`
* Since `$bc\in ( c ),$` we have `$1\in ( c ).$` 
* Therefore `$( c )=R.$`

### "`$\Leftarrow$`"

* Let `$( c )=R.$`
* In particular, `$1\in ( c ).$`
* Therefore, there is an `$b\in R$` with `$bc=1.$`
* Therefore, `$c\in R^\ast.$`
