A [group][bookofproofs$671] `\((G,\ast)\)` is called **cyclic group**, if there exists an element `\(g\in G\)` with `\(G=\{g^n|~n\in\mathbb Z\}\)`, i.e. all elements of `\(G\)` can be represented by positive [powers][bookofproofs$1618] of an element `\(g\)`. In this case, we write `\(G=\langle g \rangle,\)` i.e. `\(G\)` is [generated by][bookofproofs$8265] by the element `\(g\in G\)`. 

The **order of an element** `$a\in G$` is the smallest [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `$n\in\mathbb N,$` for which `$a^n=e$` where `$e\in G$` is the neutral element of the group. It is denoted by `$\operatorname{ord}(a):=n.$` If such a natural number `$n$` does not exist, we write `$\operatorname{ord}(a)=\infty.$`
