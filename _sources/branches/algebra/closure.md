By the definition of an [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342] `$(X,\ast),$` the [image][bookofproofs$592] of the [binary operation][bookofproofs$6188] is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of `$X,$` formally `$\ast[X,X]\subseteq X.$` We express this property by saying that that `$X$` is **closed under** the operation `$"\ast"$`.
