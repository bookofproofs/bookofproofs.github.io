A **monoid** is a [semigroup][bookofproofs$660] `\((X,\ast)\)` with an [identity][bookofproofs$661], i.e. an element `$e\in X$` with `$x=e\ast x=x\ast e$` for all `$x\in X.$`

Please note the [uniqueness of the neutral element][bookofproofs$669] `$e\in X.$`

"Unfolding" all definitions, a _monoid_ fulfills the following axioms:

* Associativity: `$x\ast (y\ast z)=(x\ast y)\ast z$` for all `$x,y,z\in X.$`
* Neutral Element: There is an element `$e\in X$` with `$e\ast x=x\ast e=x$` for all `$x\in X.$`
