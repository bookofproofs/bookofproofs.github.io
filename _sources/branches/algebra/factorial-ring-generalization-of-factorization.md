An [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] `$R$` is called a **factorial ring**, if every `$a\in R\setminus \{0\}$` has the **factorization** `$$a=\prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{e_i}$$` of [irreducible][bookofproofs$822] elements `$p_i$` and [positive integer][bookofproofs$1074] exponents `$e_i > 0,$` which is unique except of the order of the elements `$p_i$` and the [associates][bookofproofs$8260] of all `$p_i.$`
