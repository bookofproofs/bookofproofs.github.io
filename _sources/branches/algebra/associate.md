Let `$(R,\cdot,+)$` be an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] with the [multiplicative neutral element][bookofproofs$661] `$1,$` and let `$a,b\in R.$`

We call `$a$` an **associate** of `$b$` (denoted by `$a\sim b$`) if and only if: `$$a\mid b\wedge b\mid a,$$` i.e. `$a$` is a [divisor][bookofproofs$8257] of `$b$` and vice versa. 

### Notes

* From this definition, it should be clear that in `$R$`, any two associates `$a,b$` can differ only by a [unit][bookofproofs$8259]
* For instance, if `$R=\mathbb Z,$` any positive integer and its negative counterpart are associates (the only two units of `$\mathbb Z$` are `$1$` and `$-1.$`)
* Another example: if `$R=\mathbb Q[X]$` is the ring of polynomials with rational coefficients, then two polynomials are associates if they differ only by a rational number `$q\neq 0$` as a factor (the units in `$\mathbb Q[X]$` are exactly the constant polynomials being the rational numbers unequal `$0$`).
