There are two possibilities to show that a non-empty [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$H$` of a [group][bookofproofs$671] `$(G,\ast)$` is its [subgroup][bookofproofs$554]. Both possibilities are equivalent. Which possibility you choose is more or less a matter of taste and of simplicity.

### `$(1)$` Verify the subgroup properties

* Demonstrate that `$e\in H,$` where `$e$` is also the [neutral element][bookofproofs$661] of `$G$` with respect to the operation `$"\ast".$`
* Demonstrate that if `$a\in H,$` then also its [inverse][bookofproofs$670] `$a^{-1}\in H.$`
* Demonstrate that `$H$` is closed under the operation `$"\ast",$` i.e. `$a\ast b\in H$` for all `$a,b\in H.$`

### `$(2)$` Verify the [subgroup criterion][bookofproofs$811].
I.e. show that `$a\ast b^{-1}\in H$` for all `$a,b\in H.$`
