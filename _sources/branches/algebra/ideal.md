Let `\((R, + , \cdot)\)` be a [ring][bookofproofs$683] An **left (right) ideal** is a subset of `\(R\)` a with the following properties:

1. `\((I, +)\)` is a [subgroup][bookofproofs$554] of `\((R, +)\)`; equivalently, `\(I\)` is not empty and for `\(a,b\in I\)` we have `\(a - b\in I\)`.
1. `\(\forall i \in I, \forall r \in R: \quad r \cdot i \in I\)` (for a **right ideal**)
1. `\(\forall i \in I, \forall r \in R: \quad i \cdot r \in I\)` (for a **left ideal**)

If `\(I\)` is both, a left and a right ideal, we call `\(I\)` simply an **ideal** and write `\(I\lhd R\)`.
