Let `\((R, +,\cdot)\)` and `\((S,\ast,\circ)\)` be two [rings][bookofproofs$683] A [function][bookofproofs$592] `\(f:R\rightarrow S\)` is called a **ring homomorphism**, if and only if for all `\(x,y\in R\)` the following equation holds:

`\[\begin{array}{rcl}
f(x + y)&=&f(x) \ast f(y),\\
f(x \cdot y)&=&f(x)\circ f(y)
\end{array}\]`

If the rings are [unit rings][bookofproofs$683], we require also

`$$f(1_R)=1_S,$$`
where `$1_R$` and `$1_S$` are the respective units of the both rings.
