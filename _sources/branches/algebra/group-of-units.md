The [units][bookofproofs$8259] of an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] `$(R, + ,\cdot)$` form with respect to the multiplication operation "`$\cdot$`" a [group][bookofproofs$671], called the **group of units** of `$R,$` and denoted by `$(R^\ast,\cdot).$`

### Examples

* `$\mathbb Z^\ast=\{1,-1\}.$`
* `$\mathbb Q[X]^\ast=\mathbb Q\setminus\{0\}.$`
