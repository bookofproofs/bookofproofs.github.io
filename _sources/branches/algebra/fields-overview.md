In this chapter, we will introduce the _field_ as a very important algebraic structure. Like it was the case in rings, a field has two different [binary operations][bookofproofs$6188], usually referred to as "addition" and "multiplication". The following tabular overview indicates the properties of a field in comparison to previous algebraic structures:
