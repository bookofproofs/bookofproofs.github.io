Let `$(X,\ast)$` be an [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342] with an [associative][bookofproofs$668] [binary operation][bookofproofs$6188] `\(\ast\)`. When we repeatedly apply the operation on a [finite][bookofproofs$985] number of elements of `$X$`, the result does not depend on the way we put the parantheses. In other words, we can also omitt the parantheses:

`\[x_1\ast x_2\ast x_3\ast \ldots\ast x_n:=(\ldots((x_1\ast x_2)\ast x_3)\ast \ldots)\ast x_n\]`
