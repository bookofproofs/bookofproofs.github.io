Let `$(G,\ast)$`, `$(H,\cdot)$` be [groups][bookofproofs$671] and let `$f:G\to N$` be a [group homomorphism][bookofproofs$679] with the [kernel][bookofproofs$809] `$\ker(f).$`  Then `$(G/\ker(f),\circ)$` is a [factor group][bookofproofs$191] `$(G/\ker(f),\circ)$` and the function `$$\phi:G/\ker(f)\to \operatorname{im}(f),\quad \phi(a\ker(f))=f(a)$$`
between this factor group and the group of the [image][bookofproofs$809] `$\operatorname{im}(f)$` is an [isomorphism][bookofproofs$412], i.e. both groups are [isomorphic][bookofproofs$412].
