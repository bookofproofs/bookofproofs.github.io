Let `$(X,\ast)$` be an [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342] with an associative binary operation `$[\ast".$` Let `$x\in X$`. 
If an [inverse element][bookofproofs$670] of `$x$` exists then it is unique.

### Notes

* This proposition holds in all algebraic structures, in which the existence of inverse elements is postulated.
* Thus, the proof is the same for [groups][bookofproofs$671], [unit rings][bookofproofs$683], and [fields][bookofproofs$557].
