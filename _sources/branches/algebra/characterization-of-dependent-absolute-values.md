Let `$(F,+,\cdot)$` be a field with two [absolute values][bookofproofs$8659] `$|\cdot|_1$` and `$|\cdot|_2$` defined on it. If `$|\cdot|_1$` and `$|\cdot|_2$` are [dependent][bookofproofs$8664], then there exists a [positive real number][bookofproofs$1107] `$\lambda > 0$` such that `$$|x|_1=|x|_y^\lambda$$`

for all `$x\in F$` with `$x\neq 0.$`
