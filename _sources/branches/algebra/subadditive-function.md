Let `$A,B$` be [sets][bookofproofs$550], on which addition operations `$(A,+)$`, and `$(B,\oplus)$` are defined. Let `$B$` be [linearly ordered][bookofproofs$6191] by some order relation "$\le$". 

A **subadditive function** is a [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f\colon A\to B$` such that for all `$x,y\in A$` the inequation `$f(x+y)\leq f(x)\oplus f(y)$` holds.
