### Trivial Absolute Value

Let `$F$` be a [field][bookofproofs$557]. The [constant function][bookofproofs$6342] `$|\cdot|:F\to\mathbb R$` with `$|x|=1$` for all `$x\neq 0$` is an absolute value and a valuation on `$F$`. It is called the **trivial absolute value**.

### P-adic Absolute Value

Let `$m,n$` be integers `$\neq 0$` and let `$r,s$` be the highest powers of a [prime number][bookofproofs$473] `$p$` [dividing][bookofproofs$700] `$p^r\mid m$` and `$p^s\mid n$` respectively. For the [rational number][bookofproofs$1033] `$\frac mn$` we define the *p-adic absolute value*
`$$\left|\frac mn\right|_p=p^{r-s},$$` with an integer `$r\in\mathbb Z.$` Thus, `$|0|_p=0$` and the other axioms of absolute value are easily verified.
