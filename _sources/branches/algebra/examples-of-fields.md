Below, you can find some examples of the algebraic structure called a [field][bookofproofs$557]

### Example 1

The [rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033] together with the addition `$[ + "$` and multiplication `$"\cdot"$`, i.e. the "algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342] `$(\mathbb Q,+,\cdot)$` form a field, which is proven [here][bookofproofs$1647]

### Counterexample 2

The [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$(\mathbb Z, +,\cdot)$` are not a field since `$1$` and `$-1$` are the only integers that have a [multiplicative inverse][bookofproofs$670]  To be a field, it would be necessary that all elements except the additive neutral element `$0$` had a multiplicative inverse. 

### Counterexample 3

The set of all `$n\times n$` [matrices][bookofproofs$1048] over a field `$F$` together with [matrix addition][bookofproofs$8657] and [matrix multiplication][bookofproofs$1050] an `$(M_{n\times n}(F), +,\cdot)$` are not a field, since not all such matrices unequal the [zero matrix][bookofproofs$1052] are [invertible][bookofproofs$1055] matrix [multiplicative inverse][bookofproofs$670] Also, the multiplication is in general not [commutative][bookofproofs$672]

### Example 4

The [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105]":[bookofproofs$844] `$(\mathbb R, +,\cdot)$` form a field (was proven [here][bookofproofs$1638]).

### Example 5

The [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105]":[bookofproofs$844] `$(\mathbb R, +,\cdot)$` form a field (was proven [here][bookofproofs$1638]).

### Example 6

The [complex numbers][bookofproofs$216] `$(\mathbb C, +,\cdot)$` form a field (was proven [here][bookofproofs$1690]).

### Example 7

The smallest [finite field][bookofproofs$295] is the algebraic structure `$(\{1,0\},+,\cdot)$` with the following addition and multiplication, which can be easily verified by the reader as an exercise (just verify all the [field axioms][bookofproofs$557]):

`$$\begin{array}{c|cc}
+&1&0\\\hline
1&0&1\\
0&1&0
\end{array}\quad\begin{array}{c|cc}
\cdot &1&0\\\hline
1&0&0\\
0&0&1
\end{array}$$`
