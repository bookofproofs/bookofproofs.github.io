An [affine space][bookofproofs$6277] `\((A,V_A,v)\)` is called an **unitary affine space**, if `\(V_A\)` is a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over the [field of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690] `\(\mathbb C\)` and a [complex scalar product][bookofproofs$6251] `\(\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle\)` is defined on `\(V_A\)`.
