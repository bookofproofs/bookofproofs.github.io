_Algebra_ is a discipline of mathematics dealing with _sets_ (see [set theory][bookofproofs$27]), which are structured by one or more [binary operations][bookofproofs$6188] While studying these so-called _algebraic structures_ (i.e. _groups_, _rings_, _fields_, _modules_, and _vector spaces_), algebra provides means to find solutions of _equations_ and _systems of equations_ formulated inside these structures. 

### Theoretical minimum (in a nutshell)

You should be acquainted with [set theory][bookofproofs$27], especially the [set operations][bookofproofs$7986] and basics about [functions][bookofproofs$64]

### Concepts you will learn in this part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>

* What are _groups_, which are their properties and applications?
* What are _rings_ and which are the different types of rings and their properties?
* What are _fields_ and how they improve the solvability of _equations_ in comparison to rings?
* What are _vector spaces_, _matrices_, _determinants_ and how these and other concepts of _linear algebra_ help to solve _systems of linear equations_?
* What are _modules_?
* How the _Galois theory_ helps to form new fields out of existing ones and what solvability of equations has to do with geometry?
