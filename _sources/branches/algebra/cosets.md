Let `\((G,\ast)\)` be a [group][bookofproofs$671], and `\(H\subseteq G\)` its [subgroup][bookofproofs$554] and `\(a\in G\)` any element of `\(G\)`. Then the set 
`\[aH:=\{a\ast h:h\in H\}\]`
is called the *left coset of `\(H\)` with respect to `\(a\)`* and 
`\[Ha:=\{h\ast a:h\in H\}\]`
is called the *right coset of `\(H\)` with respect to `\(a\)`*.
