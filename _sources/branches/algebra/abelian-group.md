An important subtype of groups are _commutative_ groups. Therefore, they deserve a separate definition.

---

A **commutative group** `\((G,\ast)\)` is a [group][bookofproofs$671], in which the [binary operation][bookofproofs$6188] `\(\ast\)` is [commutative][bookofproofs$672], i.e. `\(x\ast y=y\ast x\)` for all `\(x,y\in G\)`. 

A commutative group is also called **Abelian**, named after "Niels Hendrik Abel":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/niels-henrik-abel (1802 - 1829).

"Unfolding" all definitions, an _Abelian group_ fulfills the following axioms:

* Associativity: `$x\ast (y\ast z)=(x\ast y)\ast z$` for all `$x,y,z\in G.$`
* Commutativity: `$x\ast y=y\ast x$` for all `$x,y\in G.$`
* Neutral Element: There is an element `$e\in G$` with `$e\ast x=x\ast e=x$` for all `$x\in G.$`
* Inverse elements: For all `$x\in G$` there exists an `$x^{-1}\in G$` with `$x\ast x^{-1} =x^{-1}\ast x=e.$`
