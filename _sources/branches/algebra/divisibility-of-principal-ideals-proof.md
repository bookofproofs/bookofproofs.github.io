### `$"\Rightarrow"$`

* By assumption, `\((i)=Ri\)` and `\((j)=Rj\)` are [principal ideals][bookofproofs$1063] for some `\(i,j\in R\)`, where `$(R, + ,\cdot)$` is an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] 
* If `\(i \mid j\)`, then following the [definition of divisibility in the ring][bookofproofs$8257] there exists an element `\(x\in R\)` with `\(xi=j\)`. 
* It follows that `$(j)=Rj=R(xi)\subseteq Ri=(i).$` 
* Following the [definition of divisibility of ideals][bookofproofs$1065] `$(j)\subseteq (i)$` is equivalent to `$(i)\mid (j).$`

### `$"\Leftarrow"$`

* If, vice versa, `\((i)\mid (j)\)`, we have the set inclusion `\((j)\subseteq (i)\)`. 
* Because `\(j\in (j)\)`, it follows that `\(j\in (i)\)`. 
* Therefore, there exists an element `\(x\in R\)` with `\(j=xi\)`. 
* Thus, `\(i\mid j\)`.
