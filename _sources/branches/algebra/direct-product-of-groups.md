Let `\((G,\ast)\)` and `\((H,\circ)\)` be two [groups][bookofproofs$671], and let `$G\times H$` by the [cartesian product][bookofproofs$748] of the sets `$G$` and `$H$`, i.e. the set of all pairs `$(g,h)$` with `$g\in G$` and `$h\in H$`. Let a [binary operation][bookofproofs$6188] "$\cdot$" on such pairs be defined by `$$(g_1,h_1)\cdot (g_2,h_2):=(g_1\ast g_2,h_1\circ h_2).$$`

Then the set `$(G\times H,\cdot)$`, called the **direct product** of the groups `$G$` and `$H$`, is a group and with the identity element `$(e_G, e_H)$` (where `$e_G$` is the identity of `$G$` and `$e_H$` is the identity of `$H$`) and with the inverse elements `$(g^{-1},h^{-1})$` for all `$(g,h)\in G\times H$`.

More generally and similarily, let `$(G_1,\ast_1), (G_2,\ast_2),\ldots (G_n,\ast_n)$` be groups. Then the direct product `$(G_1\times G_2\times\ldots\times G_n,\cdot)$` is a group with the binary operation "$\cdot$" defined on the `$n$`-tupels 
`$$(g_1,g_2,\ldots,g_n)\cdot (g'_1,g'_2,\ldots,g'_n):=(g_1\ast_1 g'_1,g_2\ast_2 g'_2,\ldots,g_n\ast_n g'_n)$$`
with the identity element `$(e_1,\ldots,e_n)$` ($e_i$ being the identity of `$G_i$`) and the inverse elements `$(g^{-1}_1,\ldots,g^{-1}_n)$` for all `$(g_1,\ldots,g_n)\in G_1\times G_2\times\ldots\times G_n$`.
