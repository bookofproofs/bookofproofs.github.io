Let `\((R, + ,\cdot)\)` be a [ring][bookofproofs$683] with `\(1\)` as the identity of `\((R,\cdot)\)` and `\(0\)` as the identity of `\((R,+)\)`. Further, let `\(a\in R\)`.

* If `\(a\neq 0\)` and there exists `\(b\in R, b\neq 0\)` with
   * `\(a\cdot b=0\)`, then we call `\(a\)` a **left zero divisor** in `\(R\)`.
   * `\(b\cdot a=0\)`, then we call `\(a\)` a **right zero divisor** in `\(R\)`.
   * we call `\(a\)` a **zero divisor** in `\(R\)`, if `\(a\)` is both, a left and a right zero divisor[^1].

A [commutative ring][bookofproofs$880] `\(R\)`, which is not the [zero ring][bookofproofs$879] and in which `\(0\)` is the only zero divisor[^2] is called **integral domain**.

[^1]: Please note that if `\(R\)` is commutative, every left zero divisor is also a right zero divisor.

[^2]: Please note that this is equivalent to `\(a\cdot b=0\Leftrightarrow a=0 \vee b=0\)`.
