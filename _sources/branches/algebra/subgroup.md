A **subgroup** is a [substructure][bookofproofs$6210] `$H\subseteq G$` of a [group][bookofproofs$671] `$(G,\ast)$`, which is itself a group. In particular, `$H$` fulfills the definition of a group:


1. `$e\in H\cap G$`, where `$e$` is the [unique neutral element][bookofproofs$669] of `$G.$`
1. If `\(a\in H\cap G\)` then `\(a^{-1}\in H\)`, where `$a^{-1}$` denotes each the [unique inverse element][bookofproofs$359] of `$a.$`
1. If `\(a\in H\cap G\)` then `\(a^{-1}\in H\)`, where `$a^{-1}$` denotes each the [unique inverse element][bookofproofs$359] of `$a.$`
