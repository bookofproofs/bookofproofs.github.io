Let `\((G,\ast)\)` be an [group][bookofproofs$671], `\(x,y\in G\)`, and `\(n,m\in\mathbb Z\)` two [integers][bookofproofs$844] Then the calculation rules for [exponentiation][bookofproofs$401] are:

`\[\begin{array}{cl}
(1)&x^nx^m=x^{n+m},\\
\end{array}
\]`

If the group is [Abelian][bookofproofs$553], then, in addition 
`\[\begin{array}{cl}
(2)&(x^n)^m=x^{nm}.\\
(3)&x^ny^n=(xy)^n.\\
(4)&\frac{x^n}{y^n}=\left(\frac xy\right)^n.
\end{array}
\]`
