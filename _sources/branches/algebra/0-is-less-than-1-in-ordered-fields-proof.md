* Let `$(F,+,\cdot)$` be an [ordered field][bookofproofs$6192]
* Let `$0\in F$` be the [zero element][bookofproofs$661] of addition in the [field][bookofproofs$557] `$F$`, and let `$1\in F$` be the [unity element][bookofproofs$661] of multiplication in `$F$`.
* It "has been shown that `$1\neq 0$`":https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/0-is-unequal-1/.
* It [has also been shown that][bookofproofs$6860] for all `$x\in F$` with `$x\neq 0$` we have `$x^2 > 0$`.
* Thus, it follows `$1^2 > 0.$`
* Because `$1$` is the [unity element][bookofproofs$661] of multiplication in `$F$`, we also have `$1\cdot 1=1^2=1.$`
* It follows `$1 > 0.$`
