Let `\((F, +, \cdot)\)` be a [field][bookofproofs$557] and let `\(V\)` and `\(W\)` be [vector spaces][bookofproofs$560] over `\(F\)`. A [map][bookofproofs$592] `\(\varphi \colon V\longrightarrow W\)` is called a **linear map**, if the following properties are both fulfilled:

* `\(\varphi (u\oplus v)=\varphi (u) \oplus  \varphi (v)\)` for all `\(u,v\in V\)`,
* `\(\varphi (sv)=s\varphi (v)\)` for all `\(s\in F\)` and `\(v\in V\)`.
