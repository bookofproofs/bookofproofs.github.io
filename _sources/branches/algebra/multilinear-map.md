Let `\(F\)` be a [field][bookofproofs$557] and let `\(V_{1},\ldots ,V_{n}\)` and `\(W\)` be [vector spaces][bookofproofs$560] over `\(F\)`. A [map][bookofproofs$592]

`\[\Phi \colon V_{1}\times \cdots \times V_{n}\longrightarrow W\,\]`

is called a **multilinear map**, if for each `\(i\in \{1,\ldots ,n\}\)` and each `\((n-1)\)`-tuple `\((v_{1},\ldots ,v_{i-1},v_{i+1},\ldots ,v_{n})\)` with `\(v_{j}\in V_{j}\)`, the induced map

`\[V_{i}\longrightarrow W,\,v_{i}\longmapsto \Phi (v_{1},\ldots ,v_{i-1},v_{i},v_{i+1},\ldots ,v_{n})\,,\]`

is a [linear map][bookofproofs$403] over `\(F\)`.
