A **polynomial reduced modulo** a [prime number][bookofproofs$473] `$p$` is a [polynomial][bookofproofs$487] `$p(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+\cdots+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+a_nx^{n},$`  over the [ring of integers][bookofproofs$892] `$\mathbb Z[X],$` in which all coefficients have been replaced by the [congruence classes][bookofproofs$8154] modulo a [prime number][bookofproofs$473] `$q$`, i.e. the polynomial

`$$p(x) \mod q:=a_{0}(p)+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+\cdots+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+a_nx^{n}\mod q.$$`
