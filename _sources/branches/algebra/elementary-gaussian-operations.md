Let an [SLE][bookofproofs$1044] be given in the form of its [extended coefficient matrix][bookofproofs$7941]

`$$A|\beta:=\left(\begin{array}{ccc|c}\alpha_{11}& \ldots&\alpha_{1n}&\beta_1\\ 
\alpha_{21}& \ldots&\alpha_{2n}&\beta_2\\ 
\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots\\ 
\alpha_{m1}& \ldots&\alpha_{mn}&\beta_m\end{array}\right)$$`

with elements `$\beta_i,a_ij\in F$` of a [field][bookofproofs$557] `$F.$` The following are the **elementary Gaussian operations**:

### Row operations

#{list-style-type:upper-roman;} Exchanging two rows of `$A|\beta:$`
`$$R_j\leftrightarrow R_i.$$`
1. Multiplying a row of `$A|\beta$` by a number `$c\in F$` with `$c\neq 0$`: `$$c R_i\rightarrow R_i.$$`
1. Adding a multiple of one row `$R_i$` to another row `$R_j:$`
`$$R_i+cR_j\rightarrow R_i.$$`

### Column operation

#4{list-style-type:upper-roman;} Exchanging two columns of `$A:$`

`$$C_j\leftrightarrow C_i.$$`
