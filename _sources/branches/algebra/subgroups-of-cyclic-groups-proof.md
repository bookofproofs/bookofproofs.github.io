Let `\((G,\ast)\)` be a cyclic group generated by `\(g\)`, i.e. `\(G=\langle g \rangle\)` and let `\(H\subseteq G\)` be its [subgroup][bookofproofs$554]. We can easily recognize trivial subgroups `\(H=\{e\}=\langle g^0 \rangle\)` and `\(H=G=\langle g^1 \rangle\)` as cyclic. Thus, assume `\(H\)` being another subgroup of `\(G\)`. In such a case, `\(H\)` must contain at least one element `\(x=g^k\)` with a natural number `\(k > 1\)`. Consider the set of all such natural numbers, more precisely 

`\[K:=\{k~|~x=g^k, x\in H,~ k > 1\}.\]`

Because `\(H\)` is non-empty by assumption, also `\(K\)` is non-empty. By virtue of the [well-ordering principle][bookofproofs$698], the set `\(K\)` contains a smallest element, call it `\(b\)`. Therefore, also `\(H\)` contains the element `\(g^b\)`. Because `\(H\)` is closed under the operation `\(\ast\)`, it must contain all powers of `\((g^b)^q=g^{b\cdot q}\)`, `\(q\in\mathbb Z\)` but no other powers of `\(g\)`. For if it contained a power of `\(g\)`, e.g. `\(g^a\)`, whose exponent `\(a\)` was not a multiple of `\(b\)`, then we could use a unique [division with a quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$818] to write 
`\[a=q\cdot b+r\]`
with `\(0 < r < b\)`. In this case, however, it would follow that `\(g^r\in H\)`, and so that `\(r\in K\)`, in [contradiction][bookofproofs$744] to the minimality of `\(b\)` in `\(K\)`. Therefore, `\(H\)` is [cyclic][bookofproofs$807] and generated by `\(g^b\)`, i.e. `\(H=\langle g^b \rangle\)`.
