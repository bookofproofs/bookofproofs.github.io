Let `$F$` be a [field][bookofproofs$557] A **diagonal matrix** is a [square matrix][bookofproofs$1056] of the form

`\[
\pmatrix{
\alpha_{11} & 0 & \ldots & 0 \cr
0 & \alpha_{22} & \ldots & 0 \cr
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \cr
0 & 0 & \ldots & \alpha_{nn} \cr
}
\]`

i.e. in which all but the **diagonal elements** `\(\alpha_{ii}\in F\)` for `$i=1,\ldots,n$` equal zero.
