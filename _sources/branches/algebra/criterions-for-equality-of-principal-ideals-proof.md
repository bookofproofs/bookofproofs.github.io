In the following proof, `$(R, + ,\cdot)$` is an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821]

### `$"\Rightarrow"$`

* Let `$(a)\lhd R$` and `$(b)\lhd R$` be two [principal ideals][bookofproofs$1063] with `$(a)=(b)$`.
* By the [equality of sets][bookofproofs$6841], whe have `$(a)\subseteq (b)$` and `$(b)\subseteq (a).$`
* By the definition of [divisibility of ideals][bookofproofs$1065], it follows `$(b)\mid (a)$` and `$(a)\mid (b).$`
* By the lemma of [divisibility of principal ideals][bookofproofs$1066], it follows `$a\mid b$` and `$b\mid a.$`
* Following the definition of [divisors][bookofproofs$8257] there are elements `$c,d\in R$` with `$ac=b$` and `$bd=a.$`
* It follows with the definition of [associates][bookofproofs$8260] that `$a\sim b.$`

### `$"\Leftarrow"$`

* Let `$a\sim b.$`
* By the [criterion for associates][bookofproofs$8292] there is a [unit][bookofproofs$8259] `$c\in R^\ast$` with `$a=bc.$` 
* Since `$(c)=R$` (see [principal ideal generated by a unit][bookofproofs$8294]) it follows `$(a)=aR=bcR=bR=(b).$` 

If `$(a)=(0)$` then `$a\sim 0.$` Therefore, there exist `$b,c\in R$` with `$ab=0$` and `$c0=a.$` In particular, `$a=0.$`
