Let `\((R, +, \cdot)\)` be an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] Then there exists a unique [field][bookofproofs$557] `\((F, \ast, \circ)\)` with the following properties:

> (1) There is a subset `\(S\subset  F\)`, which is a [ring isomorphic][bookofproofs$885] to `\(R\)`, i.e. where `\((S, \ast, \circ)\simeq (R, +, \cdot)\)`.

> (2) `\((F, \ast, \circ)\)` is [subfield][bookofproofs$887] of any other field `\((X, \ast, \circ)\)` fulfilling the property (1), i.e. `\((F, \ast, \circ)\)` is the minimal field with the property (1).
