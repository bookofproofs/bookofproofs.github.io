Let `$(R,\cdot,+)$` be a [ring][bookofproofs$683] For every [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$A\subseteq R$` define `$$\langle A\rangle_R:=\bigcap_{A\subset I,I\lhd R}I$$` as the [set intersection][bookofproofs$6828] of all [ideals][bookofproofs$1062] `$I$` of `$R$` containing `$A.$`

Obviously, `$A\subset \langle A\rangle_R$` and `$\langle A\rangle_R \subset I$` for every ideal `$I$` of `$R.$` Therefore, `$\langle A\rangle_R$` is the _smallest_ ideal of `$R$` containing `$A.$` We call `$A$` the **generating set** of `$\langle A\rangle_R$` and `$\langle A\rangle_R$` the **ideal generated by** `$A.$` If `$A$` contains only a finite number of elements, we can also write `$\langle a_1,\ldots, a_n\rangle_R.$`
