Let `\(\mathcal A=(A,V_A,v)\)` be an [affine space][bookofproofs$6277] with `\(V_A\)` as the associated [vector space over a field `\(F\)` ][bookofproofs$560] Let `\[P_0,P_1,P_2\ldots,P_n\]`
be an [affine basis][bookofproofs$434] of `\(\mathcal A\)`. Then every point `\(Q\in\mathcal A\)` can be uniquely represented by the `\((n+1)\)`-tuple of field elements `\(\lambda_0, \ldots, \lambda_n\in F \)`  such that
`\[\lambda_0+ \cdots +\lambda_n=1\]`
and
`\[Q=\lambda _{0}P_{0}+\cdots +\lambda_{n}P_{n}.\]`

The elements `\(\lambda_0, \ldots, \lambda_n\in F \)` are called the **barycentric coordinates**. If `\(\lambda_0= \cdots =\lambda_n\)`, then such a point is called the **barycenter** of `\(\mathcal A\)`.
