We want to show that if `\(V\)` is a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over a  [field][bookofproofs$557]  `\(F\)` and if `\(U\subseteq V\)` is its [subspace][bookofproofs$562], then the [relation][bookofproofs$571] defined by `\(v\sim w \Longleftrightarrow v-w\in U,\)` defines an [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574] on `\(V\)`. We have to check all properties of the equivalence relation:

* Reflexivity: `\(v-v=0\in U\)`.
* Symmetry: `\(w-v=-(v-w)\in U\)`.
* Transitivity: From `\(u-v\in U\)` and `\(v-w\in U\)` it follows `\(u-w=(u-v)+(v-w)\in U\)`.
