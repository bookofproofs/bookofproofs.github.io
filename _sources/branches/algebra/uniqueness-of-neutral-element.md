Let `$(X,\ast)$` be an [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342] with at least one [neutral element][bookofproofs$661] `$e\in X.$` Then exactly one `$e\in X$` is neutral.

### Notes

* This proposition holds in all algebraic structures having a neutral element.
* Thus, the proof is the same for [groups][bookofproofs$671], [unit rings][bookofproofs$683], and [fields][bookofproofs$557].
