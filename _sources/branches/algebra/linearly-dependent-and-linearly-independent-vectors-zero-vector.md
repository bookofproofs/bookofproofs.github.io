Let `\(V\)` be a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over a field `\(F\)`. [Finitely many][bookofproofs$985] vectors `\(x_1,\ldots,x_n\in V\)` are called **linearly dependent**, if there exist field elements `\(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n\in F\)`, which are not all equal zero, for which 
`\[\alpha_1 x_1 + \ldots \alpha_n x_n=0,\]` 
i.e. for which the corresponding [linear combination][bookofproofs$1035] of the vectors  `\(x_1,\ldots,x_n\in V\)` is the **zero vector**, although `\(\alpha_i\neq 0\)` for at least one `\(i=1,\ldots, n\)`.

The finitely many vectors `\(x_1,\ldots,x_n\in V\)` are called **linearly independent**, if they are not linearly dependent, i.e. if from 
`\[\alpha_1 x_1 + \ldots \alpha_n x_n=0\]` 
it always follows that `\(\alpha_1=\ldots=\alpha_n=0\)`, which means that the zero vector has only a trivial linear combination of the `\(x_1,\ldots,x_n\in V\)` with all scalars `\(\alpha_i\in F\)` being zero.
