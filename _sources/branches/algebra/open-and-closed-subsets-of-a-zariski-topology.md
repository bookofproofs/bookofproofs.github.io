For a [commutative ring][bookofproofs$880] `\(R\)`, the following properties are fulfilled:


1. For an [ideal][bookofproofs$1062] `\({I}\lhd R\)`, let `\(R/I\)` be the [factor ring][bookofproofs$274] and let the function `\(q\colon R\longrightarrow R/{I}\,\)` have the corresponding [spectrum function][bookofproofs$6249] `\(q^{ * }\colon \operatorname {Spec} \left(R/{I}\right)\longrightarrow \operatorname {Spec} \left(R\right)\,\)`. The [image][bookofproofs$592] of the spectrum function `\(q^{ * }\)` is [closed][bookofproofs$6242] It is the set `\(V(I)\)` of all ideals of `\(R\)` containing `\(I\)`.
1. For a [multiplicative system][bookofproofs$6234] `\(M\subseteq R\)` let the canonical function `\(\iota \colon R\longrightarrow R_{M}\,\)` have the corresponding spectrum function `\(\iota ^{ * }\colon \operatorname {Spec} \left(R_{M}\right)\longrightarrow \operatorname {Spec} \left(R\right)\,\)`. The spectrum function `\(\iota ^{ * }\)` is [injective][bookofproofs$769] and the image consists of all prime ideals `\(I\lhd M\)` with `\(I\cap M=\emptyset\)`.
