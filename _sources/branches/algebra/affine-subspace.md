Let `\(\mathcal A=(A,V_A,v)\)` be an [affine space][bookofproofs$6277] Let `\(W\subseteq V_A\)` is a [subspace of the vector space][bookofproofs$562] `\(V_A\)` and let `\(P\in\mathcal A\)` be a point. A [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(\mathcal U\subseteq \mathcal A\)` is called an **affine subspace** of `\(\mathcal A\)`, if:
`\[\mathcal U=\{Q\in \mathcal A\,:\,\overrightarrow{PQ}\in W\}=\{P+x\,|\,x\in W\}\]`

i.e. if `\(U\)` consists of all points of `\(\mathcal A\)`, which are translations of `\(P\)` by vectors `\(x\)` from the subspace `\(W\subseteq V_A\)`.
