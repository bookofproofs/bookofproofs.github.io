First of all, we want to define formally, what exactly shall be understood under an algebraic structure. We start with the concept of a _binary operation_.

---

A **binary operation** `\(\ast\)` on a [set][bookofproofs$550] `\(X\)` ist a [total function][bookofproofs$592] `$\ast :X\times X\to X$` mapping all pairs `$x,y\in X\times X$` to a specific `$z\in X,$` formally `$$x\ast y:=\ast (x,y)=z.$$`
