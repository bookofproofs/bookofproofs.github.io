Let `\(\mathcal A=(A,V_A,v)\)` be an [`\(n\)`-dimensional][bookofproofs$6281] [affine space][bookofproofs$6277] with `\(V_A\)` as the associated [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over the field `\(\mathbb R\)` of [real numbers][bookofproofs$6194]

A [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(X\subseteq \mathcal A\)` is called **convex**, if with any two points `\(P,Q\in X\)` it also contains the [straight line segment][bookofproofs$645] `\[\overline{PQ}:=\{\lambda P+(1-\lambda)Q\,|\,0\le\lambda\le 1\}\]` 
between them.   The following figure demonstrates a non-convex and a convex subset of the plane:
