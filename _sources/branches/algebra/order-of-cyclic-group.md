Let `\((G,\ast)\)` be a "cyclic group":https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/cyclic-group/ with a [finite][bookofproofs$985] [group order][bookofproofs$8071] i.e. `\(|G|=n < \infty,\)` the [neutral element][bookofproofs$661] `\(e\in G\)` and let `$a\in G.$` Then:

1. The [order of the element][bookofproofs$807] `$\operatorname{ord}(a)$` is a [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of the [group order][bookofproofs$8071] `$|G|.$`
