Let `\(L\)` be a [field][bookofproofs$557] and `\(F\subseteq L\)` a [subfield][bookofproofs$887] of `\(L\)`. Then we call `\(L\)` an **extension field** of `\(F\)` and the inclusion `\(F\subseteq L\)` is called a **field extension**. 

We also denote a field extension `\(F\subseteq L\)` by `\(L/F\)` (read "L over F").
