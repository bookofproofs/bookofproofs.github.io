Please note that every vector space `\(V\)` over a given field `\(F\)` has two trivial subspaces:

1. `\(V\)` itself is a subspace of `\(V\)`, and 
1. The subset `\(U:=\{0_V\}\)` consisting of the zero vector of `\(V\)` is also a subspace of `\(V\)`. 

`\(U\)` is sometimes also called the **zero space**. The vector `\( 0_V \)` has to exist, since `\((V,\oplus)\)` is a [group][bookofproofs$553], which is part of the [definition of vector space][bookofproofs$560] The index of the vector `\(0_V\)` is used to differentiate it from the zero element of the addition `\(0\in F\)`, and can be omitted, if it is clear from the context, which zero element is meant.
