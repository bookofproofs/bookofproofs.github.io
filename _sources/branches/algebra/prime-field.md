A **prime field** `$(P, + ,\cdot)$` is a [field][bookofproofs$557]which does not contain any proper [subfields][bookofproofs$887] Formally, if `$(F, + ,\cdot)$` is a  [field][bookofproofs$557], then `$P$` is  the [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342] defined by `$$P:=\bigcap_{S\subset F,\;S\text{ subfield of }F}S.$$`
