An [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342]  `$(X,\ast)$` is said to have

* the **left cancellation** property, if for all elements `\(x,y,a\in G\)` the equation `\(a\ast x=a\ast y\)` always implies `\(x=y\)` and
* the **right cancellation** property, if for all elements `\(x,y,a\in G\)` the  equation `\(x\ast a=y\ast a\)` always implies `\(x=y\)`.

If `$(X,\ast)$` has both, the left and the right cancellation property, then it is called **cancellative**.
