Let `$(F,+,\cdot)$` be a field with two [absolute values][bookofproofs$8659] `$|\cdot|_1$` and `$|\cdot|_2$` defined on it. `$|\cdot|_1$` and `$|\cdot|_2$` are called **dependent**, if and only if `$$|x|_1 < 1\Longleftrightarrow |x|_2 < 1$$` for all `$x\in F.$` Otherwise, we call them **independent**.
