You might ask, why the [characteristic of a ring][bookofproofs$881] is defined to be `$\operatorname{char}(R)=0$` and not infinite  `$\operatorname{char}(R)=\infty$` if a minimal number `$n$` with the property `$$\underbrace{1+\cdots+1}_{n \text{ times}} = 0$$` does not exist. Under this alternative definition, the characteristic of a ring would be a kind of the [order][bookofproofs$8071] of the additive [cyclic group][bookofproofs$807] `$(R, + ).$` generated by `$1\in R.$` 

The key to an explanation is the [classification of cyclic groups][bookofproofs$8272]. Here, we recap why:

By hypothesis, `$(R, + )$` is a [cyclic group][bookofproofs$807] with a generator `$1\in R$` with `$R=\langle 1\rangle.$` Consider a [group homomorphism][bookofproofs$679] `$f:(\mathbb Z, + )\to (R, + )$` defined by `$$f(a):=\underbrace{a+\cdots+a}_{n \text{ times}}$$` for all `$a\in (R, + )$` for all `$n\in\mathbb Z.$` Note that the [kernel][bookofproofs$809] `$\ker(f)=\{a\in R\mid f(a)=1\}$` is a [subgroup of `$(Z,+)$`][bookofproofs$833]. Now, if `$R$` has an [infinite order][bookofproofs$8071] `$|R|=\infty,$` then `$\ker(f)=\{0\}.$` It follows from the [isomorphism theorem for groups][bookofproofs$8271] that `$(R, + )$` is [isomorphic][bookofproofs$412] to `$\mathbb Z/\{0\}=\mathbb Z.$` Therefore, `$\operatorname{char}(R)=0$`, since `$\ker(f)=\{0\}$` (the kernel consists of all multiples of `$0$` and has therefore only the element `$0$`). 

To even better see the parallel, let consider the finite case. If `$R$` has a [finite order][bookofproofs$8071] `$|R|=n$` with `$n > 0.$` Note that all [additive subgroups of integers][bookofproofs$8268] have the form `$(\mathbb Z_n, + )$` for a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `$n\in\mathbb N.$` In particular, `$\ker(f)$` has this form. It follows again from the [isomorphism theorem for groups][bookofproofs$8271] that `$(R, + )$` is [isomorphic][bookofproofs$412] to `$(\mathbb Z/\ker(f), + ) = (\mathbb Z_n, + ).$` Therefore, `$\operatorname{char}(R)=n$`, since `$\ker(f)=\{kn\mid k\in Z\},$` (the kernel consists of all [multiples][bookofproofs$700] of `$n$`).
