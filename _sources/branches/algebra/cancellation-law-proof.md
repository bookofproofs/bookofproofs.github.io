"`\(\Leftarrow\)`"

Let `\(a=b\)`. Multiplying the equation with `\(c\)` results in `\(ac=bc\)`.

"`\(\Rightarrow\)`"

Let `\(ac=bc\)` and `\(c\neq 0\)`. Following the [distributivity axiom][bookofproofs$682] in `\(R\)`, we get `\((a-b)c=0\)`. Because `\(R\)` is an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] and `\(c\neq 0\)`, it follows that `\((a-b)=0\)`, which is equivalent with `\(a=b\)`.
