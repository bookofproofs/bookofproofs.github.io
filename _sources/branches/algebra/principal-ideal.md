Let `\(I\lhd R\)` be an [left (or right) ideal][bookofproofs$1062] of a [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] `$(R, + , \cdot).$`

1. If there is an `\(a\in I\)` with `\(I=Ra:=\{ra\in I:\quad \forall r\in R\}\)`, we call with an **left principal ideal**.
1. If there is an `\(a\in I\)` with `\(I=aR:=\{ar\in I:\quad \forall r\in R\}\)`, we call with an **right principal ideal**.
1. If `\(I\)` is both, a left and a right principal ideal, we call `\(I\)` simply a **principal ideal** (generated by `$a$`) and denote it by `$(a).$`

Loosely speaking, a principal ideal `$(a)$` is a subset of the integral domain consisting of all [multiples][bookofproofs$8257] of a given element `$a\in R.$`
