An [affine space][bookofproofs$6277] `\((A,V_A,v)\)` is called an **Euclidean affine space**, if `\(V_A\)` is a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$6194] `\(\mathbb R\)` and a [real scalar product][bookofproofs$6214] `\(\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle\)` is defined on `\(V_A\)`.
