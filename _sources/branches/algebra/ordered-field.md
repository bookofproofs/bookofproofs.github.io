We say a [field][bookofproofs$557] `$(F, +, \cdot)$` is **ordered**, if there exists a [strict total order][bookofproofs$7993] `$"<"$` on `$F$` that fulfills the two properties:

1. from `\(a > b\)` it follows `\(a+c > b+c\)` (for arbitrary `\(c\in F\)`),
1. from `\(a > 0\)` and `\(b > 0\)` it follows `\(a\cdot b > 0\)`.

We call 
* `$a > 0$` **positive**,
* `$a < 0$` **negative**,
* `$a\ge 0$` *non-negative*, 
* `$a\le 0$` *non-positive*.

### Examples

* The field of rational numbers `$(\mathbb Q,+,\cdot)$`
* The field of real numbers `$(\mathbb R,+,\cdot)$`

### Counterexamples

* The field of complex numbers `$(\mathbb C,+,\cdot)$`
* For a prime number `$p,$` the finite field `$(\mathbb Z_p,+,\cdot)$`
