Let `\((F,+,\cdot)\)` and `\((F^\prime,\oplus,\odot)\)` be two [fields][bookofproofs$557] The map `\(f:F\mapsto F^\prime\)` is called a **field homomorphism**, if for all `\(a,b\in F\)`: `$$\begin{array}{rcl}f(a+b)&=&f(a)\oplus f(b),\\f(a\cdot b)&=&f(a)\odot f(b),\\f(1_{F})&=&f(1_{F^\prime}),\end{array}$$`
where `$1_{F}$` and `$1_{F^\prime}$` denote the respective [multiplicative neutral elements][bookofproofs$661] of the respective two fields.

### Example

The [complex conjugation][bookofproofs$1245] `$f:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$` is a field homomorphism (even an endomorphism), since `$(\mathbb C,+,\cdot)$` is a field and `$$\begin{array}{rcl}
(z_1+z_2)^*&=&z_1^*+z_2^*\\
(z_1\cdot z_2)^*&=&z_1^*\cdot z_2^*\\
(1)^*&=&1^*
\end{array}$$`
