### `$"\Rightarrow"$`

* Assume, `$ac=bc.$`
* Because of the [distributivity law in rings][bookofproofs$683], it follows `$(a-b)c=0.$`
* By hypothesis, `$(R, + ,\cdot)$` is an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] and `$c\neq 0.$`
* Therefore `$a-b=0.$`
* This is equivalent to `$a=b.$`

### `$"\Leftarrow"$`

* Assume, `$a=b.$`
* Multiplication by `$c$` gives us `$ac=bc.$`
