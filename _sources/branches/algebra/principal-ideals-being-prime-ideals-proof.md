By assumption, `$(R, + ,\cdot)$` be an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821], `$a\in R,$` `$a\neq 0,$` and `$(a)\lhd R$` a [principal ideal][bookofproofs$1063]


### "$\Rightarrow$"

* Let `$(a)$` be a [prime ideal][bookofproofs$6240]
* By definition of prime ideals, `$(a)\neq R.$`
* By [principal ideal generated by a unit][bookofproofs$8294], `$a\not\in R^\ast$` (i.e. `$a$` is not a [unit][bookofproofs$8259])
* Let `$r,s\in R$` with `$a\mid rs$` (i.e. `$a$` is a [divisor][bookofproofs$8257] of `$rs.$`)
* Since `$(a)$` is a [principal ideal]https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/principal-ideal/m `$rs\in (a).$`
* Since `$(a)$` is a prime ideal, we have `$r\in (a)$` or `$s\in (a).$`
* Therefore, `$a\mid r$` or `$a\mid s.$`
* We have already shown that `$a$` is not a unit and, by hypothesis, `$a\neq 0.$`
* Altogether, by definition of [prime elements][bookofproofs$822], it follows that `$a$` is a prime element of `$R.$`

### "$\Leftarrow$"

* Let `$a\in R$` be a [prime element][bookofproofs$822].
* By definition, `$a\neq 0$` and `$a$` is not a [unit][bookofproofs$8259]
* Therefore, `$(a)\neq (0).$`
* Let `$rs\in (a)$` for some `$r,s\in R.$`
* Since `$a\mid rs$` and `$a$` prime, it follows `$a\mid r$` or `$a\mid s.$`
* Therefore, `$r\in (a)$` or `$s\in (a).$`
* Since `$a$` is not a unit, by [principal ideal generated by a unit][bookofproofs$8294], `$(a)\neq R.$`
* By definition of [prime ideals][bookofproofs$6240], `$(a)$` is a prime ideal.
