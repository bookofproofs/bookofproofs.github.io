When we dealt with [number systems][bookofproofs$195], we became familiar for instance with the [natural numbers together with addition][bookofproofs$841] `$(\mathbb N, + )$`, the [integers together with addition and multiplication][bookofproofs$892] `$(\mathbb Z, +,  \cdot),$` or the [real numbers together with addition and multiplication][bookofproofs$1638] `$(\mathbb R , + ,\cdot).$` 

In general, if on a [set][bookofproofs$550] one or more _operation_, like addition or multiplication, is defined, usually these operations "shape" a structure inside the set, called an _algebraic structure_. 

In this part, we start our treatise of algebra with a quick overview of the different algebraic structures. In later parts, we will dive deeper into the theory of the separate algebraic structures.
