Let `\(F\)` be a [field][bookofproofs$557] and let `\(V\)` be a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over `\(F\)`. Further, let `\(U_{1},\ldots ,U_{m}\)` be a [family][bookofproofs$6198] of [subspaces][bookofproofs$562] of `\(V\)`. We say that `\(V\)` is a **direct sum** of the `\(U_{i}\)`, if the following two properties are fulfilled:

1. `\(U_{i}\cap \left(\sum _{j\neq i}U_{j}\right)=0\)` for all `\(i\)`.
1. `\(U_{i}\cap \left(\sum _{j\neq i}U_{j}\right)=0\)` for all `\(i\)`.
