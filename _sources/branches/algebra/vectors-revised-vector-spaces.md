So far, we have dealt with [vectors][bookofproofs$7943]  in the context of solving [linear equations][bookofproofs$138] Before we continue our applications of vectors, it makes sense to pause dealing with applications and take a look at vectors from a higher perspective. It is necessary to learn more about one of the most important algebraic structures in mathematics strongly linked to vectors, called **vector spaces** and which we will now define formally.
