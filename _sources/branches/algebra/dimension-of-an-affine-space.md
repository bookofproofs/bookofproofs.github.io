The **dimension** `\(\operatorname {dim}(\mathcal A)\)` of an [affine space][bookofproofs$6277] `\(\mathcal A=(A,V_A,v)\)` is the [dimension of the corresponding vector space][bookofproofs$1041] `\(V_A\)`:

`\[\operatorname {dim}(\mathcal A):=\operatorname {dim}(V_A)\]`

Note: If `\(\operatorname {dim}(V_A)\)` is finite, say `\(n\)`, then this means that we need `\(n+1\)` [affinely independent points][bookofproofs$6280]
`\[P_0,P_1,P_2\ldots,P_n\]`
to form an [affine basis][bookofproofs$434] of `\(\mathcal A\)`.
