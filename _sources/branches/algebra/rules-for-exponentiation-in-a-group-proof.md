### Ad `$(1)$` 

* The rule follows immediately from the definition of [exponentiation in a group][bookofproofs$401], the [associativity][bookofproofs$668] of the operation `$[\ast"$` and the "associativity of adding integers][bookofproofs$1443]

### Ad `$(2)$` and `$(3)$` 

* These rules require in addition the [commutativity][bookofproofs$672] of the operation `$[\ast"$` and follow from the "commutativity of adding integers][bookofproofs$1460]

### Ad `$(4)$` 

* The rule is only a special notation for the rule `$(3)$`, since `$$\frac{x^n}{y^n}=x^n\ast y^{-n}=x^n\ast (y^{-1})^n=\left(x\ast y^{-1}\right)^n.$$`
