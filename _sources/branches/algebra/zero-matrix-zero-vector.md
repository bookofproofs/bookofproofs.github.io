A **zero matrix** is a [matrix][bookofproofs$1048] `\(E\in M_{m\times n}(F)\)` of the form

`$$
O:=\pmatrix{
0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \cr
0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \cr
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \cr
0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \cr
}$$`
In `\(O\)`, all elements equal `\(0\in F\)`.

As a special case, a zero vector is a [vector][bookofproofs$7943] of the form

`$$o=\pmatrix{0\\\vdots\\0},$$`

or [transposed][bookofproofs$1054],

`$$o^T=\pmatrix{0,&\ldots,&0}.$$`
