Let `$(G,\ast)$` be a [cyclic group][bookofproofs$807] Then `$G$` is [isomorphic][bookofproofs$412]:
* either to the [group of integers, together with addition][bookofproofs$1654] `$(\mathbb Z,+),$` if `$G$` is of [infinite order][bookofproofs$8071] `$|G|=\infty,$`
* or to the [additive subgroup of integers][bookofproofs$8268] `$(\mathbb Z_n,+),$` if `$|G|=n.$`
