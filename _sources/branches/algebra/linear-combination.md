Let `\(V\)` be a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over a field `\(F\)`. Consider [finitely many][bookofproofs$985] vectors `\(x_1,\ldots,x_n\in V\)` and finitely many field elements `\(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n\in F\)`. Then the vector `\(y\in V\)` with

`\[y:=\alpha_1 x_1 + \ldots \alpha_n x_n\]`
is called the **linear combination** of the vectors  `\(x_1,\ldots,x_n\in V\)`.
