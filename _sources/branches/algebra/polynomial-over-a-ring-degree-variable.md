A **polynomial** over the [commutative ring][bookofproofs$880]  `\(R\)` is a term

`\[p:=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+\cdots +a_{n}x^{n}\]`

with `\(a_{i}\in R,\,i=0,\ldots ,n,\,n\in \mathbb {N} \)`. 

### Related definitions:

* The symbol `\(x\)` is called an **indeterminate** or **variable**. 
* The [maximal natural number][bookofproofs$697] `$n$` with `\(a_n\neq 0\)` is called the **degree** of the polynomial, and denoted by `$\deg(p).$`
* By convention, the degree of the **zero polynomial**, i.e. the polynomial `$p$` with `$p=0$` is set to `$-\infty.$` 
* A polynomial `$p$` with `$\deg(p)=-\infty$` or `$\deg(p)=0$` is called a *constant polynomial.*
* A polynomial `$p$` with `$\deg(p)=1$` is called a *linear polynomial.*
* A polyonmial `$p$` with `$\deg(p)=n$` and `$a_n=1$` is called **normed** or  **monic**).
