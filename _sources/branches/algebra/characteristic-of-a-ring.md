Let `\((R, +,\cdot)\)` be a [ring][bookofproofs$683] free of [zero divisors][bookofproofs$821] and let `\(1\)` be its multiplicative and `\(0\)` its additive identity. Then the minimal[^1] [natural number][bookofproofs$664] `\(n\)`, for which
`\[\underbrace{1 + \ldots + 1}_{n\text{ times}}=n\cdot 1=0\]`
is called the **characteristic** of `\(R\)`, and denoted by `\[\operatorname{char}( R ):=n.\]`

[^1]: Such minimal element exists due to the [well-ordering principle of the natural numbers][bookofproofs$698] If in a given ring `\(R\)` there is no such number with `\(n > 0\)`, then `\(n=0\)` is the minimal number with this property. In this case we set `\(char( R )=0\)`, see also [explanation why][bookofproofs$8277]
