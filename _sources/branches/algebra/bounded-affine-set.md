Let `\(\mathcal A=(A,V_A,v)\)` be an [`\(n\)`-dimensional][bookofproofs$6281] [affine space][bookofproofs$6277] with the associated [normed vector space][bookofproofs$846] `\((V_A,||~||)\)` over the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$6194] `\(\mathbb R\)`). Let `\(P_0,P_1,P_2\ldots,P_s\)` be `\(s,\, (s\le n)\)` [affinely independent points][bookofproofs$6280] 


A non-empty [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(\mathcal U\subset \mathcal B\)` of the [affine subspace][bookofproofs$414] 

`\[\mathcal B:=\{\lambda_0P_0+\cdots+\lambda_sP_s\,:\,\lambda_i\in \mathbb R, \,i=0,\ldots,s\,\wedge\, \lambda_0+\cdots+\lambda_s=1\}\]` 

with the designated [barycenter][bookofproofs$6283]

`\[B:=\{\lambda(P_0+\cdots+P_s)\,:\,\lambda:=(s+1)^{-1}\in \mathbb R\}\in\mathcal U\]` 


is called **bounded**, if there exists an [upper bound][bookofproofs$584] `\(c\in\mathbb R\)` with 

`\[||\overrightarrow{BQ}||\le c\]`

for all `\(Q\in\mathcal U\)`.
