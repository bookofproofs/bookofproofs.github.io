Let `\((G,\ast)\)` and `\((H,\cdot)\)` be two [groups][bookofproofs$671] with the respective [identities][bookofproofs$661] `\(e_G\)` and `\(e_H\)` and `\(f:G\rightarrow H\)` be a [group homomorphism][bookofproofs$679] 

We define:

* the **kernel** `$\operatorname{ker}(f):= \{g\in G\mid f(g)=e_H\}$`, in other words, it is the [fiber of `$e_H$` under the group homomorphism `$f$` ][bookofproofs$592],
* the **image** `$\operatorname{im}(f):=f[G]=\{f(g)\in H\mid g\in G\},$` in other words, it is the [image of `$G$` under the group homomorphism `$f$`][bookofproofs$592]. 

The kernel and the image of `$f$` fulfill the following defining properties:

1. `\(\ker(f)=\{e_G\}\)` `\(\Longleftrightarrow f\)` is [injective][bookofproofs$769]
1. `\(\ker(f)=\{e_G\}\)` `\(\Longleftrightarrow f\)` is [injective][bookofproofs$769]
