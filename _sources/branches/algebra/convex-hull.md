Let  `\(\mathcal A=(A,V_A,v)\)` be the [`\(n\)`-dimensional][bookofproofs$6281] [affine space][bookofproofs$6277] with `\(V_A\)` as the associated [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over the field `\(\mathbb R\)` of [real numbers][bookofproofs$6194] Let `\(X\subseteq\mathcal A\)` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] 

The **convex hull** of `\(X\)` [can be constructed as the intersection][bookofproofs$6289] of all [convex sets][bookofproofs$6287] `\(Y\)` that contain `\(X\)`:

`\[\operatorname{conv}(X):=\bigcap\{Y\subseteq \mathcal A\,:\,X\subseteq Y\,,\,Y\text{ convex}\}.\]`
