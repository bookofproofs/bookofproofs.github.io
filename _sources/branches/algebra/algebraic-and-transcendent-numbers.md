The [b-adic fractions][bookofproofs$1110] used for the representation of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] are dependent on the basis `$b.$` For instance, a real number like for instance `$\pi$` can be written in the decimal system `$3.14159 26536\ldots$`, the binary system `$11.001001000011\ldots,$` the hexadecimal system `$3.243F6A8886\ldots$`, etc.

Therefore, a real number `$x\in\mathbb R$` can have different b-adic representations, and each b-adic representation provides only a little (if any) information about the nature of `$x.$` Also, the distinction between [rational numbers][bookofproofs$844] `$\mathbb Q$` and [irrational numbers][bookofproofs$6663] `$\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$` does not reveal all aspects of the nature of real numbers, except the fact that an irrational number cannot be written as a fraction of two [integers][bookofproofs$844].
