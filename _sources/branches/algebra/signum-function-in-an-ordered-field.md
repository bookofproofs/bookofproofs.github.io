Let `$(F,+,\cdot)$` be an [ordered field][bookofproofs$6192]. The **signum** `$\operatorname{sign}:F\to F$` is a [function][bookofproofs$592] defined for all `$x\in F$` by `$$\operatorname{sign}(x):=\begin{cases}
1&\text{if }x > 0,\\
0&\text{if }x = 0,\\
-1&\text{if }x < 0,\\
\end{cases}$$`

for `$1,-1,0\in F.$`
