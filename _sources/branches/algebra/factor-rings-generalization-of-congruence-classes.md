Let `\((R,+,\cdot)\)` be a [ring][bookofproofs$683] and let `\(I\lhd R\)` be an [ideal][bookofproofs$1062]. Then there exists a non-empty set `\(R/I\)` of **congruence classes** `\(r+I~(r\in R)\)` and, together with the two new [binary operations][bookofproofs$6188].
* **addition**: `$$(r_1 + I)\oplus (r_2 + I):=(r_1 + r_2) + I,$$`
* **multiplication**: `$$(r_1 + I)\odot (r_2 + I):=(r_1 \cdot r_2) + I.$$` 

it forms a new ring `\((R/I,\oplus,\odot)\)`, called the **factor ring** (or **quotient ring**, or **residue class ring**) with respect to the ideal `\(I\)`.

### Notes

* This is a generalization of the [ring of integer congruence classes][bookofproofs$8156].
* The factor ring is not to be confused with [factorial ring][bookofproofs$8262].
