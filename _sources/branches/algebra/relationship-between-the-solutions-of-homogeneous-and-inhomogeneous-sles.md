Let `$u_1,\ldots,u_n$` be a solution of an [inhomogeneous system of linear equations][bookofproofs$1044].
`$$\begin{array}{ccl} 
\alpha_{11}x_1+\ldots+\alpha_{1n}x_n&=&\beta_1\\\ 
\alpha_{21}x_1+\ldots+\alpha_{2n}x_n&=&\beta_2\\ 
\vdots&\vdots&\vdots\\ 
\alpha_{m1}x_1+\ldots+\alpha_{mn}x_n&=&\beta_m.\\ 
\end{array}\quad\quad ( * )$$`

Then all other solutions `$w_1,\ldots,w_n$` of `$( * )$` are given by

`$$w_\nu:=u_\nu\pm h_\nu\quad\quad\text{ for all }\,\mu=1,\ldots,m,$$`  

where  `$h_1,\ldots,h_n$` is a solution of the corresponding [homogeneous system of linear equations][bookofproofs$1044].
`$$\begin{array}{ccl} 
\alpha_{11}x_1+\ldots+\alpha_{1n}x_n&=&0\\\ 
\alpha_{21}x_1+\ldots+\alpha_{2n}x_n&=&0\\ 
\vdots&\vdots&\vdots\\ 
\alpha_{m1}x_1+\ldots+\alpha_{mn}x_n&=&0.\\ 
\end{array}$$`
