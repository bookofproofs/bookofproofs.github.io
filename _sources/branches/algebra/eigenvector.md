Let `\(V\)` be a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over a  [field][bookofproofs$557] `\(F\)` and let 

`\[\varphi \colon V\longrightarrow V\,\]`

be a [linear map][bookofproofs$403]. A vector `\(v\in V\)`, `\(v\neq 0\)`, is called an **eigenvector** of `\(\varphi \)` associated with the [eigenvalue][bookofproofs$6250] `\(\lambda \in F\)`, if

`\[\varphi (v)=\lambda v.\]`
