Let `\((H,\circ)\)` be a [semigroup][bookofproofs$660], which is [commutative][bookofproofs$672] and [cancellative][bookofproofs$837] Then there exists a unique [group][bookofproofs$671] `\((G,\ast)\)` with the following properties:

1. There is a subset `\(S\subset G\)`, which is a [semigroup isomorphic][bookofproofs$838] to `\(H\)`, i.e. where `\((S,\ast)\simeq (H,\circ)\)`.
1. There is a subset `\(S\subset G\)`, which is a [semigroup isomorphic][bookofproofs$838] to `\(H\)`, i.e. where `\((S,\ast)\simeq (H,\circ)\)`.
