The **identity matrix** is a [square matrix][bookofproofs$1056] of the form

`\[
I:=\pmatrix{
1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \cr
0 & 1 & \ldots & 0 \cr
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \cr
0 & 0 & \ldots & 1 \cr
}
\]`
In `\(I\)`, the diagonal elements equal the identity element `\(1\in F\)` and all other elements equal `\(0\in F\)`.
