In this chapter, we will introduce an even more complex algebraic structure - the _ring_. In rings, not only one but two different [binary operations][bookofproofs$6188] are defined, usually referred to as "addition" and "multiplication". The following tabular overview indicates the properties of a ring in comparison to previous algebraic structures:


Algebra `$(X,\ast)$`  | [Closure][bookofproofs$1103] | [Associativity][bookofproofs$668] | [Neutral Element][bookofproofs$661] | [Existence of Inverse][bookofproofs$670] | [Cancellation][bookofproofs$837] | [Commutativity][bookofproofs$672] | [Distributivity][bookofproofs$682]
:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:-------------
 [Magma][bookofproofs$836]| ✔| (✔)| (✔)| (✔)| (✔)| (✔)| n/a
 [Semigroup][bookofproofs$660]| ✔| ✔| (✔)| (✔)| (✔)| (✔)| n/a
 [Monoid][bookofproofs$659]| ✔| ✔| ✔| (✔)| (✔)| (✔)| n/a
 [Group][bookofproofs$671]| ✔| ✔| ✔| ✔| ✔| (✔)| n/a
 [Ring][bookofproofs$683] `$(R,\oplus,\odot)$` | `$\oplus$` ✔,<br/>$\odot$ ✔| `$\oplus$` ✔,<br/>$\odot$ ✔| `$\oplus$` ✔,<br/>$\odot$ (✔) | `$\oplus$` ✔,<br/>$\odot$(✔)| `$\oplus$` ✔,<br/>$\odot$ (✔)| `$\oplus$` ✔,<br/>$\odot$ (✔)| ✔

Like it was the case for [groups][bookofproofs$212], in rings, the existence of inverse elements ensures the cancellation property. Moreover, the "addition" operation `$"\oplus"$` is always commutative, has a neutral element and inverse elements. Unfortunately, in general, these properties are not fulfilled for the "multiplication" operation `$"\odot"$`. Rings, in which these properties also hold for multiplication are called _fields_, which we will introduce later.
