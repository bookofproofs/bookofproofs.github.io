The following figure illustrates the connections between the different morphisms and their properties:

![morphisms](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/morphisms.png?raw=true)

These words should help you to memorize the diagram:

> "HIMSI" Homomorphism (Injective) Monomorphism (Surjective) Isomorphism 

and  

> "DIA" enDomorphism epImorphism Automorphism. 

From these words, it should be easier to rebuild the whole diagram from scratch.
