Above, we have learned about [magmas, semigroups, monoids][bookofproofs$120] as simple types of [algebraic structures][bookofproofs$342] In this chapter, we will introduce a more complex algebra - the _group_. We continue with our tabular overview to indicate, which properties of a group fulfills:


Algebra `$(X,\ast)$`  | [Closure][bookofproofs$1103] | [Associativity][bookofproofs$668] | [Neutral Element][bookofproofs$661] | [Existence of Inverse][bookofproofs$670] | [Cancellation][bookofproofs$837] | [Commutativity][bookofproofs$672]
:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:-------------
 [Magma][bookofproofs$836]| ✔| (✔)| (✔)| (✔)| (✔)| (✔)
 [Semigroup][bookofproofs$660]| ✔| ✔| (✔)| (✔)| (✔)| (✔)
 [Monoid][bookofproofs$659]| ✔| ✔| ✔| (✔)| (✔)| (✔)
 [Group][bookofproofs$671]| ✔| ✔| ✔| ✔| ✔| (✔)

We will see later that, in every group, the existence of inverse elements already ensures the cancellation property. Therefore the entry is "✔" (required) and not the optional "(✔)". 

Groups are so important structures in algebra that _group theory_ can be considered as a separate branch of algebra and mathematics. The results of group theory have various applications in physics and technology.
