Let `$(G,\ast)$` be a group and `$a\in G$` be an element with the [finite][bookofproofs$985] [order][bookofproofs$807] `$\operatorname{ord}(a)=n < \infty.$` The group [generated by][bookofproofs$8265] `$a$` `$\langle a\rangle=\{a^0,a^1,a^2,\ldots a^{n-1}\}$` has the [group order][bookofproofs$8071] equal to the order of the element `$a,$` formally `$$|\langle a\rangle|=\operatorname{ord}(a)=n.$$`
