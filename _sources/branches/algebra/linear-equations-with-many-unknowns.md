Let `\(F\)` be a [field][bookofproofs$557] (e.g. the [field of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1647] `$\mathbb Q$`, the [real numbers][bookofproofs$1638] `$\mathbb R$`, or the [complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690] `$\mathbb C$`) and let `\(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n,\gamma \in F\)`. A **linear equation** with with  `\(n\)` **variables** (or **unknowns**) `\(x_1,\ldots,x_n\)` is the equation
`\[\alpha_1x_1+\ldots+\alpha_nx_n=\beta\quad\quad ( * ).\]`
The linear equation is called
* **homogeneous**, if `$\beta= 0$` and
* **inhomogeneus**, if `$\beta\neq 0.$`

We say that the linear equation has a **solution**, if there exist numbers `\(a_1,\ldots,a_n\in F\)` such that for the replacement `\(x_1:=a_1,\ldots,x_n:=a_n\)` the equation `$( * )$` is fulfilled.
