Let `\((R, + , \cdot)\)` be an [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] and let `\((i)\lhd R\)`, `\((j)\lhd R\)` be two [principal  ideals][bookofproofs$1064], i.e. there exist two elements `\(i,j\in R\)` with `\((i)=Ri\)` and `\((j)=Rj\)`. In this case, the following equivalence holds: 

`$$i \mid j \Longleftrightarrow (i) \mid (j),$$`

or, in set-theoretic notation,

`$$i \mid j \Longleftrightarrow (i)\supseteq (j).$$`
