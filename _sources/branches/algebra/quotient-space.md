Let `\(V\)` be a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] over a [field][bookofproofs$557] `\(F\)`, and 
let `\(U\subseteq V\)` be its [subspace][bookofproofs$562]. Let `\(V/_U\)` be the [quotient][bookofproofs$7991].
set of all [equivalent classes][bookofproofs$7990] defined by the [equivalence relation induced by `\(U\)` on `\(V\)`][bookofproofs$6328].
and let `$q\colon V\rightarrow V/U,\,v\mapsto [v]\,$` be its [canonical projection][bookofproofs$6330]. 
Then, there exists a uniquely defined vector space on `\(V/_U\)`, called **quotient space** such that `\(q\)` is a 
[linear map][bookofproofs$403] over the field `\(F\)`.
