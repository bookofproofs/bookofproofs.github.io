Let `\(\mathcal A=(A,V_A,v)\)` be an [affine space][bookofproofs$6277]. Any `\(n+1\)` [affinely independent points][bookofproofs$6280].
`\[P_0,P_1,P_2\ldots,P_n\quad\quad ( * )\]`

are called an **affine basis** (or an **affine coordinate system**) of `\(\mathcal A\)`. 

Equivalently, `\( ( * ) \)` is an affine basis, if the `\(n\)` vectors 

`\[x_1=\overrightarrow{P_0P_1},\,x_2=\overrightarrow{P_0P_2},\,\ldots,\,x_n=\overrightarrow{P_0P_n}\]`

form a [basis of the corresponding vector space][bookofproofs$299] `\(V_A\)`.
