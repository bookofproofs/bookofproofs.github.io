The original object of investigation in the [number theory][bookofproofs$62] is the [set of integers as an integral domain][bookofproofs$892] `$(\mathbb Z, + ,\cdot),$` in which the addition `$"+"$` and the multiplication `$"\cdot"$` operations are defined, but in which no general division operation is defined, instead the relation of "divisibility][bookofproofs$700] is being studied.  

The set `$(\mathbb Z, + ,\cdot)$` is not the only [integral domain][bookofproofs$821] Other examples are [polynomial rings][bookofproofs$6323] `$\mathbb Z[X]$` with integer coefficients, the so-called _quadradtic integer rings_, which we will learn about later. In this part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>, we will generalize the results arising from divisibility known from [elementary number theory][bookofproofs$67] in the sense that we ask not only for the solvability of the equation `$ax=b,$` in which `$a,b$` are elements of `$\mathbb Z$`, (which is only a special case of an integral domain), but for the solvability of this equation, if `$a,b$` are elements of _any_ integral domain.
