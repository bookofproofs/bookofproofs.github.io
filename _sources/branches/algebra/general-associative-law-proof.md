* The general associative law follows immediately from the [associativity][bookofproofs$668] property, using it repeatedly.
* This holds only if the number of involved elements is [finite][bookofproofs$985]. This counterexample with an infinite number of elements might be instructive: 
`$$\begin{array}{rcl}(1-1)-(1-1)-(1-1)-\ldots&=&0-0-\ldots=0,\\
1-(1-1)-(1-1)-(1-1)-\ldots&=&1-0-0-\ldots=1,
\end{array}$$` 
therefore `$$(1-1)-(1-1)-(1-1)-\ldots\neq 1-(1-1)-(1-1)-(1-1)-\ldots.$$`
