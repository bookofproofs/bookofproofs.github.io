If a [ring][bookofproofs$683] `\((R, +,\cdot)\)` with a multiplicative identity `\(1\)` and an additive identity `\(0\)` is free of [zero divisors][bookofproofs$821], then its  [characteristic][bookofproofs$881] `\(\operatorname{char}( R )\)` is either a [prime number][bookofproofs$704], or `\(0\)`.
