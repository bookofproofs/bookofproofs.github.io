* Let `\((G,\ast)\)` be a "cyclic group":https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/cyclic-group/ generated by the element `\(g\)`, i.e. `\(G=\langle g \rangle\)`. 
* Then any two elements `\(x,y\in G\)` can be represented as `\(x=g^k\)` and `\(y=g^l\)` for some integers `\(k,l\in\mathbb Z\)`. 
* It follows by the [exponentiation in a group][bookofproofs$401] and [commutativity of integer addition][bookofproofs$1460] that `\[\begin{array}{rcl}x\ast y&=&g^k\ast g^l\\&=&g^{k+l}\\&=&g^{l+k}\\&=&g^l\ast g^k\\&=&y\ast x,\end{array}\]`
which means that `\(G\)` is also [Abelian][bookofproofs$553]
