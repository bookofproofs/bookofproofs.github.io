Let `$p(x)=ax^2 + bx +c$` be a **quadratic polynomial** [over the field][bookofproofs$487] `$F[X]$`, i.e. where the coefficients `$a,b,c$` are elements of some [field][bookofproofs$557] `$(F, + , \cdot)$` and `$a\neq 0$`. Then the formula `$p(x)=0$` has exactly two [roots][bookofproofs$6736] given by 
`$$x_{1,2}:=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$`
