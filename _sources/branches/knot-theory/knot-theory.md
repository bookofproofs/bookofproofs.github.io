__Knot theory__ is a relatively new branch of mathematical research. In the 1880s, "Lord Kelvin":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/william-thomson-lord-kelvin proposed to model atoms as knots of vertices in the __ether__. Although this model was not very successful (the existence of ether was disproved in the [Michelson-Morley Experiment][bookofproofs$6270], laying the foundations for <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Einstein/">Einstein</a>'s _special relativity_), knot theory remained a vivid area of mathematics research, and its applications e.g. for physics are far from being given up, including brand new areas like [quantum computation][bookofproofs$622].
Knot theory many areas which are accessible even for undergraduates. From the physical point of view, we construct a knot by taking a segment of rope or a cord, knotting it and fusing the endpoints. A more strict definition from the mathematical point of view is that a knot is a closed loop in three-dimensional space.

### Theoretical minimum (in a nutshell)

To start studying knot theory, you should be already acquainted with the following:

* Basic concepts of [combinatorics][bookofproofs$82],
* The notion of [equivalence classes][bookofproofs$7990],
* The notions of some algebraic structures, including [groups][bookofproofs$671] and [polynomials][bookofproofs$199],
* [linear algebra][bookofproofs$121].
### Concepts you will learn in this part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>

* How to represent knots using _Reidemeister moves_,  _Gauss diagrams_, and algebraic structures called _quandles_?
* What are _knot invariants_ and why they are important for the classification of knots?
* How to define different equivalence classes of knot diagrams and which different knot theories result from that approach?
* Methods of knot construction.
* Which are the still unsolved problems concerning the classification of knots you are invited to do research for?
