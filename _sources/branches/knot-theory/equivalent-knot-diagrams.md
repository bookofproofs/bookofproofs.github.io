Two [knot diagrams][bookofproofs$6358] `\(K\)` and `\(K'\)` are called **equivalent** and denoted by `\(K\sim K'\)`, if there is a [finite][bookofproofs$985] [sequence][bookofproofs$874] of [diagrammatic moves][bookofproofs$6359] (i.e. either Reidemeister moves or planar isotopy moves) `\((K_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`, such that 

`\[K=K_0\sim K_1\sim K_2\sim\ldots\sim K_n=K'.\]`

In particular, the diagrammatic moves define an [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574] on knot diagrams.
