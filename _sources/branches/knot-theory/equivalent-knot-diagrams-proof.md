We want to show that the existence of a [finite][bookofproofs$985] [sequence][bookofproofs$874] of [diagrammatic moves][bookofproofs$6359] defines an [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574] on [knot diagrams][bookofproofs$6358].
* Reflexivity: A knot diagram `\(K\)` is related to itself by a sequence of length one: `\(K=K_0=K\Longleftrightarrow K\sim K.\)`
* Symmetry: If `\(K\sim K'\)`, then there is a finite sequence `\(K=K_0\sim K_1\sim K_2\sim\ldots\sim K_n=K'\)`. By reversing the order of the sequence, we get `\(K'\sim K\)`.
* Transitivity: if `\(K\sim K'\)` and `\(K'\sim K^*\)`, then we can form a finite sequence of moves transforming `\(K\)` to `\(K^*\)` so that `\(K\sim K^*\)`.
