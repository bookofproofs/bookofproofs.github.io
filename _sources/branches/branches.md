# Branches 

In the **Branches** part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>BookOf</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>, we systematically derive the foundations of different branches of mathematics, computer sciences, and physics.
Whenever possible, we use the [axiomatic method][bookofproofs$7081] for each branch, but some branches may build upon the axioms of other branches.

In the meanwhile, the project offers thousands of definitions, theorems, proofs, and examples from undergraduate to university level.
