* By hypothesis, let `$g$` be a [straight line][bookofproofs$8322] and `$A$` be a [point][bookofproofs$8322] that does not [lie on][bookofproofs$8323] it.
* Let `$C, D$` be distinct points that lie on `$g$` and a [plane][bookofproofs$8322] `$\alpha,$` so that `$g$` is in `$\alpha.$`
* Only if `$A$` lies on `$\alpha$`, by [5th axiom of connection][bookofproofs$8325], the points `$A, B, C$` completely determine `$\alpha.$`
* Therefore, there is exactly one plane `$\alpha$` such that the [straight line][bookofproofs$8322] `$g$` is in the plane and the point `$A$` lies on the plane.
