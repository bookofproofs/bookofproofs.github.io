* Let `$g,h$` be two distinct [straight lines][bookofproofs$8322] in a [plane][bookofproofs$8322] `$\alpha.$`
* By [3rd axiom of connection][bookofproofs$8325] there are at least two distinct [points][bookofproofs$8322] `$A, B$` that [lie on][bookofproofs$8323] `$g.$`
* For sure, `$A$` and `$B$` do not lie both on `$h$` since otherwise they would determine both [straight lines][bookofproofs$8322] `$g$` and `$h$` ([2nd axiom of connection][bookofproofs$8325]) and, by hypothesis, `$g\neq h.$`
* Therefore, at most one of the points `$A$` and `$B$` lie on both straight lines at once.
