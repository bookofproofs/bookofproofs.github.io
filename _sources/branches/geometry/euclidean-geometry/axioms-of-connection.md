### Planar Axioms

1. For any two distinct [points][bookofproofs$8322] `$A,B,$`  there is exactly one [straight line][bookofproofs$8322] `$l$` such that `$A,B$` [lie on][bookofproofs$8323] `$l.$` We write `$AB=BA=l.$`
1. Any two points `$A,B$` which lie on a straight line `$l,$` completely determine that straight line, i.e. if `$AB=l$` and `$AC=l$` and `$B\neq C$` then `$BC=l.$`
1. There are at least two distinct points that lie on a given straight line. There are at least three distinct points that do not lie on the same straight line. 

### Spacial Axioms

#4 For any three distinct points `$A, B, C$` which do not lie on the same straight line, there is exactly one [plane][bookofproofs$8322] `$\alpha$` such that `$A, B, C$` lie on `$\alpha.$` We write `$ABC=\alpha.$` 
1. Any three distinct points `$A, B, C$` which lie on a plane `$\alpha$` but do not lie on the same straight line completely determine that plane.
1. If two distinct points `$A, B$` lie both on a line `$l$` and a plane `$\alpha,$` then all points which lie on `$l$` also lie on `$\alpha.$`  We also say that `$l$` **is on the plane** `$\alpha.$`
1. If a point `$A$` lies on two distinct planes `$\alpha,\beta$` then there is at least another point `$B$` which also lies on them. 
1. If a point `$A$` lies on two distinct planes `$\alpha,\beta$` then there is at least another point `$B$` which also lies on them.
