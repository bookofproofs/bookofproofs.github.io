Let `$\mathcal P$`, `$\mathcal L$` and `$\Pi$` be sets of [points, straight lines, and planes][bookofproofs$8322] respectively.

The "lies on" relation* `$R$` is an arbitrary [relation][bookofproofs$571] `$R\subseteq \mathcal P\times\mathcal L.$` We say that a point `$A\in \mathcal P$` **lies on** a straight line `$h\in \mathcal L$` if the [ordered pair][bookofproofs$747] `$(A,h)$` is contained in `$R$` in set-theoretical sense, i.e. `$(A,h)\in R.$` 

Similarly, the *"lies on" relation* `$S\subseteq \mathcal P\times\Pi$` means that a point `$A\in \mathcal P$` **lies on** a plane `$\alpha \in \Pi$` if the [ordered pair][bookofproofs$747] `$(A,\alpha)\in S$` in set-theoretical sense.

### Notes

* In undergraduate mathematics, many authors define the "lies on" relation by the [contained relation][bookofproofs$8066]. A point `$A$` lies on `$h$` if it is contained in `$h$`, i.e. `$A\in h.$` Similarly, if `$A\in\alpha$` then the point `$A$` "lies on" the plane `$\alpha.$` These definitions are the most descriptive and intuitive ones but not the only possible.
* The reader should be aware that in <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hilbert/">Hilbert</a>'s original, general sense, the relations `$R$` and `$S$` are arbitrary. All that counts is the set-theoretical "being contained" of the ordered pairs `$(A,h)\in R,$` respectively `$(A,\alpha)\in S.$` Nevertheless, Hilbert called his relation "lies upon" for the sake of a better intuition.
