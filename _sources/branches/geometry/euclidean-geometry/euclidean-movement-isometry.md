In a [Euclidean metric space][bookofproofs$1206] `\((\mathbb R^n,d)\)` with the Euclidean distance

`\[d(A,B):=\sqrt{(x_1+y_1)^2+(x_2+y_2)^2+\ldots+(x_n+y_n)^2}\]`

for any two points `\(A,B\in\mathbb R^n\)`:

`\[\begin{array}{rcl}
A&=&(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n),\\
B&=&(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n)
\end{array}\]`

a **Euclidean movement** is an [automorphism][bookofproofs$8649] (i.e. reversible function of `\(\mathbb R^n\)` to itself)

`\[f :\mathbb R^n \mapsto \mathbb R^n,\]`

which is also an [isometry][bookofproofs$2778], i.e. which preserves the distance

`\[d(f(A),f(B))=d(A,B).\]`

There are four types of Euclidean movements:

1. **Identity** - maps every point `\(A\)` to itself (no movement at all)
1. **Translation** - moves every point `\(A\)` by the same amount in a given direction.
1. **Rotation** - circular movement of any point `\(A\)` around a center . In the plane `\(\mathbb R^2\)`, this center is called the **point of rotation**. In the three-dimensional space `\(\mathbb R^3\)`, objects always rotate around an imaginary line called a **rotation axis**.
