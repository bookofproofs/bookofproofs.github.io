Let `$\mathcal P$` be an arbitrary [non-empty set][bookofproofs$550]. The elements `$A,B,C\ldots \in \mathcal P$` are called **points**.

Let `$\mathcal L$` be an arbitrary [non-empty set][bookofproofs$550]. We call the elements `$a,b,c \ldots \in \mathcal L$` **lines**.

Let `$\Pi$` be an arbitrary [non-empty set][bookofproofs$550]. We call the elements `$\alpha,\beta,\gamma \ldots \in \Pi$` **planes**.

### Notes

* Points `$\mathcal P$` constitute the _elements of linear geometry_.
* Points `$\mathcal P$` and straight lines `$\mathcal L$` constitute the _elements of plane geometry_.
* Points `$\mathcal P$`, straight lines `$\mathcal L$`, and planes `$\Pi$` constitute the _elements of spacial geometry_.
