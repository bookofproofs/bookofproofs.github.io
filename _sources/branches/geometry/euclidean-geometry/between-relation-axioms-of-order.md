Let `$\mathcal P_l$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] of [points" that "lie on][bookofproofs$8323] a given [straight line][bookofproofs$8322] `$l$`. The **between** relation is a [relation][bookofproofs$571] `$R\subseteq \mathcal P_l\times \mathcal P_l\times \mathcal P_l$` fulfilling the following axioms:

### Linear Axioms

# If a point `$B$` lies between a point `$A$` and a point `$C,$` then all these points are distinct and `$B$` also lies between `$C$` and `$A.$`

#2 For any two points `$A$`, `$C$` that lie on a straight line there is at least another point `$B$` on that straight line such that `$C$` lies between `$A$` and `$B$`.

#3 Of any three points that lie on a straight line, there is no more than one which lies between the other two.

### Plane Axiom

#4 Let `$g$` be a straight line in a plane determined by three points `$A$`, `$B,$` and `$C$` such that none of these points lie on `$g.$` If there is a point `$D$` between `$A$` and `$B$` that lies on `$g$`, then there is also a point `$E$` such that it lies on `$g$` and also it lies either between `$A$` and `$C,$` or between `$B$` and `$C.$`
