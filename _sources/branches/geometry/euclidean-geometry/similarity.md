Two [subsets][bookofproofs$552] `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` of [Euclidean metric space][bookofproofs$1206] `\(\mathbb R^n\)` are called **similar**, if there exist a [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `\( c > 0\)`, called the **scaling constant**, such that `\(X\)` is [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] to the subset `\(Y'\)` obtained from `\(Y\)` [by multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] each point `\(A\in Y\)` by the scaling constant 

`\[X\sim Y'=c\cdot Y.\]`

Thus, `\(X\)` can be obtained from `\(Y\)` by uniformly scaling (enlarging or shrinking) `\(Y\)`, possibly with additional [Euclidean movements][bookofproofs$2777], like translation, rotation and reflection.
