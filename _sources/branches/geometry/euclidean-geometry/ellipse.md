Let `\(F_1\)` and `\(F_2\)` be two fixed [points][bookofproofs$631] in a [plane][bookofproofs$647] `\(\mathcal P\)`. An **ellipse** is the [plane figure][bookofproofs$687] comprised of the [set][bookofproofs$550] of points `\(M\in\mathcal P\)` such that the sum of their [lengths of the segments][bookofproofs$645] to `\(\overline{MF_1}\)` and `\(\overline{MF_2}\)` is constant. `\(F_1\)` and `\(F_2\)` are called the **focal points** of the ellipse.

`\[d(M,F_1)+d(M,F_2)=\operatorname{const.}\]`
