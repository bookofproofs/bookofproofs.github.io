* By hypothesis, let `$\alpha$` be a [plane][bookofproofs$8322] and `$g$` be a [straight line][bookofproofs$8322] that is not in `$\alpha.$`
* If there is no [point][bookofproofs$8322] `$A,$` that lies on both, `$g$` and `$\alpha$` then there is nothing left to be proven.
* Therefore, let `$A$` [lie on][bookofproofs$8323] both, `$g$` and `$\alpha.$`
* Assume, there is another point `$B\neq A$` that also lies on both, `$g$` and `$\alpha.$`
* By assumption and [6th axiom of connection][bookofproofs$8325], `$g$` would be in `$\alpha,$` contradicting the hypothesis.
* Therefore, there is at most one point `$A,$` that lies on both.
