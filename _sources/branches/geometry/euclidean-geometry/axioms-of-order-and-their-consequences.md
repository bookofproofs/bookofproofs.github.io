The next group of axioms comprises rules governing the [between" relation of "points][bookofproofs$8322] that lie on a [straight line][bookofproofs$8322] and allows ordering points on a line. <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hilbert/">Hilbert</a> did not invent these axioms by himself but used the work of "Moritz Pasch":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/moritz-pasch (1843 - 1930), who also worked on the foundations of geometry before him.
