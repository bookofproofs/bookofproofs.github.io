Two [subsets][bookofproofs$552] `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` of [Euclidean metric space][bookofproofs$1206] `\(\mathbb R^n\)` are called **congruent**, if there exist an [Euclidean movement][bookofproofs$2777] (or a [composition][bookofproofs$1314] of such movements), that reversibly transforms every point of `\(X\)` into a point of `\(Y\)`.

### Special Case Euclidean 1-dimensional Space (Straight Line) `\(\mathbb R^1\)`

We call two [segments][bookofproofs$645] on a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] congruent, if they are identical in size and position, or if we can find one or more than one Euclidean movements (like translations and/or reflections) such that both segments become identical in size and position.


### Special Case Euclidean 2-dimensional Space (Plane) `\(\mathbb R^2\)`

We call two [plane figures][bookofproofs$687] (e.g. triangles, rectangles, trapezoids, circles) in a plane congruent, if they are identical in size and position, or if we can find one or more than one Euclidean movements (like translations, reflections and/or rotations) such that both figures become identical in size and position.

### Special Case Euclidean 3-dimensional Space `\(\mathbb R^3\)`

We call two [solids][bookofproofs$2210] (e.g. polyhedrons, spheres) congruent, if they are identical in size and position, or if we can find one or more than one Euclidean movements (like translations, reflections and/or rotations) such that both solids become identical in size and position.
