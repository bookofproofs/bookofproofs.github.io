* By hypothesis, let `$g,h$` be [straight lines][bookofproofs$8322] and let `$A$` be the only [point][bookofproofs$8322] that [lies on][bookofproofs$8323] both of them.
* By [3rd axiom of connection][bookofproofs$8325], there are at least two points on `$g$` and at least two points on `$h$`. Let `$B$` be an additional point on `$g$` and `$C$` be an additional point on `$h.$`
* Let `$\alpha$` be a [plane][bookofproofs$8322], in which both, `$g$` is located (i.e., by [6th axiom of connection][bookofproofs$8325], `$A, B$` lie on `$\alpha$`) and `$h$` is located (i.e., by [6th axiom of connection][bookofproofs$8325], `$A, C$` lie on `$\alpha$`).
* By construction, `$A, B, C$` lie on `$\alpha.$`
* BY [5th axiom of connection][bookofproofs$8325], the points `$A, B, C$` completely determine `$\alpha.$`
* Therefore, there is exactly one plane `$\alpha$` such that both straight lines `$g$`, `$h$` are in that plane.
