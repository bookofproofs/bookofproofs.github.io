As mentioned above, <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hilbert/">David Hilbert</a> (1862 - 1943) proposed an axiomatic system dealing with geometrical objects like "points", "straight lines", and "planes", detaching them from their specific meaning. Hilbert wanted to avoid any attempt to define exactly what a _point_, a _straight line_, or a _plane_ is. He rather focussed on the _relationships_ between these objects. The following definitions and axioms demonstrate this approach.
