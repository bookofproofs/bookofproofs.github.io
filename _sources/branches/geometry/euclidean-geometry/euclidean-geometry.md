Since the ancient greek world the **Euclidean Geometry** has been a highly deductive formal description of what we see around us - the space of three dimensions (length, breadth, and height). On a daily basis, we can observe that objects in this three-dimensional space move around, change their sizes and positions and that we can measure distances between objects along straight lines. 

The beginnings of Euclidean geometry have been established by the epochal work [Elements][bookofproofs$621] of Euclid of Alexandria (ca. 300 B.C.E.) -  which will be introduced below.
