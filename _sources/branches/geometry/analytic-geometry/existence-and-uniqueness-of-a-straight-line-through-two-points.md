The existence and uniqueness of a straight line through two points was just postulated in [one of the five axioms][bookofproofs$692] of [Euclid's Elements][bookofproofs$621] written more than 2,000 years ago. By means of modern [analytic geometry][bookofproofs$139], we are able to actually prove what was postulated in ancient times in the following theorem:

Let `$A, B$` be two points of an `$n$`-dimensional [number space][bookofproofs$7959] `$\mathbb R^n$` with `$A\neq B$`. Then there is exactly one [straight line][bookofproofs$7961] containing the points `$A, B.$`
