*Analytic geometry* is a mathematical discipline describing geometrical figures using equations and numbers. The figures (e.g. points, circles, parables, planes, straight lines, etc.) are interpreted as sets of points in a [coordinate system][bookofproofs$299]. Depending on the number of dimensions of the coordinate system, every point can be described using one, two, three or more coordinates. Usually, the study is focused on two or three dimensions and the corresponding subdisciplines are called **planar analytic geometry**, respectively **spacial analytic geometry**. 

The sets of points forming the figures in the coordinate systems turn out to be solutions of some types of equations. In this sense, each type of these equations corresponds to some specific type of a geometric figure. In this sense, analytic geometry is able to "translate" geometric phenomena into the language of algebra and vice versa.
