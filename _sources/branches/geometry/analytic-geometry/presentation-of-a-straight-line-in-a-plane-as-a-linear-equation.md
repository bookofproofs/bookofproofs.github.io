Let `$L$` be a [straight line][bookofproofs$7961] in the [number plane][bookofproofs$7959] `$\mathbb R^2.$` Then  

* `$L$` goes through the origin `$(0,0)\in L$` if and only if `$L$` is the set of solutions of the [homogenous linear equation][bookofproofs$1043] `$\alpha_1x_1+\alpha_2x_2=0$` for some real-valued coefficients `$\alpha_1,\alpha_2\in\mathbb R$` which do not both equal zero.
* `$L$` does not go through the origin `$(0,0)\not\in L$` if and only if `$L$` is the set of solutions of the [inhomogenous linear equation][bookofproofs$1043] `$\alpha_1x_1+\alpha_2x_2=\beta$` for some real-valued coefficients `$\alpha_1,\alpha_2\in\mathbb R$` which do not both equal zero and some real number `$\beta\in\mathbb R$`, `$\beta\neq 0.$`
