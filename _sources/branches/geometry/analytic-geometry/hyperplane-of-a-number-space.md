The [above proposition][bookofproofs$7980] shows that a straight line is a solution set of a [linear equation][bookofproofs$1043] with two unknowns. In other words, given a point `$A=(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$` in a [number plane][bookofproofs$7959] `$\mathbb R^2$` which is not the origin and a number `$b\in\mathbb R$`, a straight line `$L$` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of all points of the plane `$\mathbb R^2$` defined as

`$$L:=\{P\in\mathbb R^2:\; P=(x_1,x_2): \alpha_1x_1+\alpha_2x_2=\beta\}.$$`

This concept can be generalized.

For `$n\ge 1$`, given a point `$A\in\mathbb R^n$` in the [number space][bookofproofs$7959] `$\mathbb R^n$` which is not the origin, as well as a number `$b\in\mathbb R$`, a **hyperplane** `$H$` is the set of solutions of the [linear equation][bookofproofs$1043] with `$n$` unknowns:

`$$H:=\{P\in\mathbb R^n:\; P=(x_1,\dots,x_n): \alpha_1x_1+\ldots+\alpha_nx_n=\beta\}.$$`
