Different [points][bookofproofs$631] (and/or [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), which are [incident][bookofproofs$7969] to a [plane][bookofproofs$647] are said to be **coplanar**. We also say that a plane `$\alpha$` **joins** the points `$A_1,A_2,\ldots$` or the straight lines `$l_1,l_2,\ldots,$` or the points and straight lines write `$$\alpha=A_1A_2\ldots=l_1l_2\ldots=A_1l_1,A2,\ldots$$`

In the text to follow, we want to agree that the order of the straight lines or points written down in this notation does not play any role, for instance, for a coplanar point `$P$` and a straight line `$l$`, the expressions `$Pl$` and `$lP$` shall denote the same plane.
