### (Proposition 9 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> ([Straight-lines][bookofproofs$645]) [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and which are not in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657] as it, are also [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one another.
* For let `$AB$` and `$CD$` each be [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$EF$`, not being in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657] as it.
* I say that `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$`.
