* For, if possible, let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$AC$` have been set up at the same [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` at [right angles to the reference plane][bookofproofs$2212], on the same side.
* And let the plane through `$BA$` and `$AC$` have been drawn.

* So it will make a straight cutting (passing) through ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$A$` in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] [[Prop. 11.3]][bookofproofs$2240].
* Let it have made `$DAE$`.
* Thus, `$AB$`, `$AC$`, and `$DAE$` are [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] in one [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* And since `$CA$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], it will thus also make [right angles][bookofproofs$653] with all of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to it which are also in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212].
* And `$DAE$`, which is in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], is joined to it.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$CAE$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$BAE$` is also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$CAE$` (is) equal to `$BAE$`.
* And they are in one [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, two (different) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] cannot be set up at the same [point][bookofproofs$631] at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the same [plane][bookofproofs$657], on the same side.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
