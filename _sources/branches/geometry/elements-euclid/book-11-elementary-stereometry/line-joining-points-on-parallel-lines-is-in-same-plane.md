### Euclid's Formulation

> If there are two [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and random [points][bookofproofs$631] are taken on each of them, then the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining the two [points][bookofproofs$631] is in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657] as the [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be two [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and let the random [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` and `$F$` have been taken on each of them (respectively).
* I say that the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` and `$F$` is in the same (reference) plane as the [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
