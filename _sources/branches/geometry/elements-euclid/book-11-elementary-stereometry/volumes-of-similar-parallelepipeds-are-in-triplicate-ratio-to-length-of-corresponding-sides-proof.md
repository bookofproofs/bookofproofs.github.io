* Let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be [similar][bookofproofs$2218] [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222], and let `$AE$` correspond to `$CF$`.
* I say that [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` has to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$AE$` (has) to `$CF$`.

* For let `$EK$`, `$EL$`, and `$EM$` have been produced in a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] with `$AE$`, `$GE$`, and `$HE$` (respectively).
* And let `$EK$` be made equal to `$CF$`, and `$EL$` equal to `$FN$`, and, further, `$EM$` equal to `$FR$`.
* And let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$KL$` have been completed, and the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$KP$`.
* And since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$KE$` and `$EL$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$CF$` and `$FN$`, but angle `$KEL$` is also equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$CFN$`, inasmuch as `$AEG$` is also equal to `$CFN$`, on account of the similarity of the solids `$AB$` and `$CD$`, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$KL$` is thus equal [and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CN$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$KM$` is also equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [[parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]] `$CR$`, and, further, `$EP$` to `$DF$`.
* Thus, three [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$KP$` are equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to three [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$`.
* But the three (former [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909]) are equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the three opposite ([parallelograms][bookofproofs$909]), and the three (latter [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909]) are equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the three opposite ([parallelograms][bookofproofs$909]) [[Prop. 11.24]][bookofproofs$2261].
* Thus, the whole of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$KP$` is equal and [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the whole of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` [ [Def. 11.10] ][bookofproofs$2219].
* Let [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$GK$` have been completed.
* And let the solids `$EO$` and `$LQ$`, with bases the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$GK$` and `$KL$` (respectively), and with the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] as `$AB$`, have been completed.
* And since, on account of the similarity of solids `$AB$` and `$CD$`, as `$AE$` is to `$CF$`, so `$EG$` (is) to `$FN$`, and `$EH$` to `$FR$` [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983], [ [Def. 11.9] ][bookofproofs$2218], and `$CF$` (is) equal to `$EK$`, and `$FN$` to `$EL$`, and `$FR$` to `$EM$`, thus as `$AE$` is to `$EK$`, so `$GE$` (is) to `$EL$`, and `$HE$` to `$EM$`.
* But, as `$AE$` (is) to `$EK$`, so [[parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]] `$AG$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$GK$`, and as `$GE$` (is) to `$EL$`, so `$GK$` (is) to `$KL$`, and as `$HE$` (is) to `$EM$`, so `$QE$` (is) to `$KM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* And thus as [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AG$` (is) to `$GK$`, so `$GK$` (is) to `$KL$`, and `$QE$` (is) to `$KM$`.
* But, as `$AG$` (is) to `$GK$`, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$EO$`, and as `$GK$` (is) to `$KL$`, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$OE$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$QL$`, and as `$QE$` (is) to `$KM$`, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$QL$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$KP$` [[Prop. 11.32]][bookofproofs$2269].
* And, thus, as [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` is to `$EO$`, so `$EO$` (is) to `$QL$`, and `$QL$` to `$KP$`.
* And if four magnitudes are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] then the first has to the fourth the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that (it has) to the second [ [Def. 5.10] ][bookofproofs$1949].
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` has to `$KP$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] which `$AB$` (has) to `$EO$`.
* But, as `$AB$` (is) to `$EO$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AG$` (is) to `$GK$`, and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AE$` to `$EK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Hence, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` also has to `$KP$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$AE$` (has) to `$EK$`.
* And [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$KP$` (is) equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$`, and [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EK$` to `$CF$`.
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` also has to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] which its corresponding side `$AE$` (has) to the corresponding side `$CF$`.

* Thus, [similar][bookofproofs$2218] [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] are to one another as the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] of their corresponding sides.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
