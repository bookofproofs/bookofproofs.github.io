### (Proposition 23 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To construct a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] from three (given) [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650], (the sum of) two of which is greater than the remaining (one, the [angles][bookofproofs$650]) being taken up in any (possible way). So, it is necessary for the (sum of the) three ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) to be less than four [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 11.21]][bookofproofs$2258].

* Let `$ABC$`, `$DEF$`, and `$GHK$` be the three given [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650], of which let (the sum of) two be greater than the remaining (one, the [angles][bookofproofs$650]) being taken up in any (possible way), and, further, (let) the (sum of the) three (be) less than four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* So, it is necessary to construct a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] from ([rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650]) equal to `$ABC$`, `$DEF$`, and `$GHK$`.
