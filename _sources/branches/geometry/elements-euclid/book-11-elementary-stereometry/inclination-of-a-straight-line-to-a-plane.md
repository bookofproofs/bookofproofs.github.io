> The **inclination of a straight line to a plane** is the [angle][bookofproofs$650] contained by the drawn and standing ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), when a [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] is lead to the [plane][bookofproofs$647] from the end of the (standing) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] raised (out of the [plane][bookofproofs$647]), and a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is (then) joined from the [point][bookofproofs$631] (so) generated to the end of the (standing) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] (lying) in the [plane][bookofproofs$647].
