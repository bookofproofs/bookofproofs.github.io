* Let the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$AE$` and `$CF$` be on the equal bases `$AB$` and `$CD$` (respectively), and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986].
* I say that [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AE$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CF$`.

* So, let the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up, `$HK$`, `$BE$`, `$AG$`, `$LM$`, `$PQ$`, `$DF$`, `$CO$`, and `$RS$`, first of all, be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the bases `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* And let `$RT$` have been produced in a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] with `$CR$`.
* And Let [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$TRU$`, equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ALB$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$RT$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$R$` on it [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* And let `$RT$` be made equal to `$AL$`, and `$RU$` to `$LB$`.
* And let the base `$RW$`, and the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$XU$`, have been completed.
* And since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$TR$` and `$RU$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AL$` and `$LB$` (respectively), and they contain equal [angles][bookofproofs$650], [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$RW$` is thus equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$HL$` [[Prop. 6.14]][bookofproofs$2000].
* And, again, since `$AL$` is equal to `$RT$`, and `$LM$` to `$RS$`, and they contain [right angles][bookofproofs$653], [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$RX$` is thus equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AM$` [[Prop. 6.14]][bookofproofs$2000].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$LE$` is also equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$SU$`.
* Thus, three [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AE$` are equal and [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to three [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$XU$`.
* But, the three ([faces][bookofproofs$2211] of the former [solid][bookofproofs$2210]) are equal and [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the three opposite ([faces][bookofproofs$2211]), and the three ([faces][bookofproofs$2211] of the latter [solid][bookofproofs$2210]) to the three opposite ([faces][bookofproofs$2211]) [[Prop. 11.24]][bookofproofs$2261].
* Thus, the whole [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$AE$` is equal to the whole [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$XU$` [ [Def. 11.10] ][bookofproofs$2219].
* Let `$DR$` and `$WU$` have been drawn across, and let them have met one another at `$Y$`.
* And let `$aTb$` have been drawn through `$T$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$DY$`.
* And let `$PD$` have been produced to `$a$`.
* And let the solids `$YX$` and `$RI$` have been completed.
* So, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$XY$`, whose base is [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$RX$`, and opposite ([face][bookofproofs$2211]) `$Yc$`, is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$XU$`, whose base (is) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$RX$`, and opposite ([face][bookofproofs$2211]) `$UV$`.
* For they are on the same base `$RX$`, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], and the (ends of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up in them, `$RY$`, `$RU$`, `$Tb$`, `$TW$`, `$Se$`, `$Sd$`, `$Xc$` and `$XV$`, are on the same [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$YW$` and `$eV$` [[Prop. 11.29]][bookofproofs$2266].
* But, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$XU$` is equal to `$AE$`.
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$XY$` is also equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AE$`.
* And since [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$RUWT$` is equal to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$YT$`.
* For they are on the same base `$RT$`, and between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788] `$RT$` and `$YW$` [[Prop. 1.35]][bookofproofs$943].
* But, `$RUWT$` is equal to `$CD$`, since (it is) also (equal) to `$AB$`.
* [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$YT$` is thus also equal to `$CD$`.
* And `$DT$` is another ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]).
* Thus, as base `$CD$` is to `$DT$`, so `$YT$` (is) to `$DT$` [[Prop. 5.7]][bookofproofs$1964].
* And since the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$CI$` has been cut by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$RF$`, which is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] (of `$CI$`), as base `$CD$` is to base `$DT$`, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CF$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$RI$` [[Prop. 11.25]][bookofproofs$2262].
* So, for the same (reasons), since the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$YI$` has been cut by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$RX$`, which is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] (of `$YI$`), as base `$YT$` is to base `$TD$`, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$YX$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$RI$` [[Prop. 11.25]][bookofproofs$2262].
* But, as base `$CD$` (is) to `$DT$`, so `$YT$` (is) to `$DT$`.
* And, thus, as [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CF$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$RI$`, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$YX$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$RI$`.
* Thus, solids `$CF$` and `$YX$` each have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to `$RI$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CF$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$YX$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
* But, `$YX$` was show (to be) equal to `$AE$`.
* Thus, `$AE$` is also equal to `$CF$`.

* And so let the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up, `$AG$`, `$HK$`, `$BE$`, `$LM$`, `$CO$`, `$PQ$`, `$DF$`, and `$RS$`, not be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the bases `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* Again, I say that [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AE$` (is) equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CF$`.
* For let `$KN$`, `$ET$`, `$GU$`, `$MV$`, `$QW$`, `$FX$`, `$OY$`, and `$SI$` have been drawn from [points][bookofproofs$631] `$K$`, `$E$`, `$G$`, `$M$`, `$Q$`, `$F$`, `$O$`, and `$S$` (respectively) [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] (i.e., the plane of the bases `$AB$` and `$CD$`), and let them have met the [plane][bookofproofs$647] at[points][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`, `$T$`, `$U$`, `$V$`, `$W$`, `$X$`, `$Y$`, and `$I$` (respectively).
* And let `$NT$`, `$NU$`, `$UV$`, `$TV$`, `$WX$`, `$WY$`, `$YI$`, and `$IX$` have been joined.
* So [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$KV$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$QI$`.
* For they are on the equal bases `$KM$` and `$QS$`, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], and the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up in them are at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to their bases (see first part of proposition).
* But, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$KV$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AE$`, and `$QI$` to `$CF$`.
* For they are on the same base, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], and the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up in them are not on the same [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] [[Prop. 11.30]][bookofproofs$2267].
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AE$` is also equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CF$`.
* Thus, [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] which are on equal bases, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], are equal to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
