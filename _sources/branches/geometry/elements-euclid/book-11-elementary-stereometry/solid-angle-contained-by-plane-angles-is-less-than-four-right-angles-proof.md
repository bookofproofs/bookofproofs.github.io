* Let the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] `$A$` be contained by the [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$`, `$CAD$`, and `$DAB$`.[^1]
* I say that (the sum of) `$BAC$`, `$CAD$`, and `$DAB$` is less than four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].

* For let the random [points][bookofproofs$631] `$B$`, `$C$`, and `$D$` have been taken on each of (the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$`, `$AC$`, and `$AD$` (respectively).
* And let `$BC$`, `$CD$`, and `$DB$` have been joined.
* And since the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] at `$B$` is contained by the three [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] `$CBA$`, `$ABD$`, and `$CBD$`, (the sum of) any two is greater than the remaining (one) [[Prop. 11.20]][bookofproofs$2257].
* Thus, (the sum of) `$CBA$` and `$ABD$` is greater than `$CBD$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), (the sum of) `$BCA$` and `$ACD$` is also greater than `$BCD$`, and (the sum of) `$CDA$` and `$ADB$` is greater than `$CDB$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the) six [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$CBA$`, `$ABD$`, `$BCA$`, `$ACD$`, `$CDA$`, and `$ADB$` is greater than the (sum of the) three ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$CBD$`, `$BCD$`, and `$CDB$`.
* But, the (sum of the) three ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$CBD$`, `$BDC$`, and `$BCD$` is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, the (sum of the) six [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$CBA$`, `$ABD$`, `$BCA$`, `$ACD$`, `$CDA$`, and `$ADB$` is greater than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And since the (sum of the) three [angles][bookofproofs$650] of each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`, `$ACD$`, and `$ADB$` is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653], the (sum of the) nine [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$CBA$`, `$ACB$`, `$BAC$`, `$ACD$`, `$CDA$`, `$CAD$`, `$ADB$`, `$DBA$`, and `$BAD$` of the three [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] is equal to six [right angles][bookofproofs$653], of which the (sum of the) six [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$`, `$BCA$`, `$ACD$`, `$CDA$`, `$ADB$`, and `$DBA$` is greater than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the (sum of the) remaining three [[angles][bookofproofs$650]] `$BAC$`, `$CAD$`, and `$DAB$`, containing the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220], is less than four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, any [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] is contained by [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] (whose sum is) less [than] four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: This proposition is only proved for the case of a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] contained by three [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650]. However, the generalization to a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] contained by more than three [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] is straightforward (translator's note).
