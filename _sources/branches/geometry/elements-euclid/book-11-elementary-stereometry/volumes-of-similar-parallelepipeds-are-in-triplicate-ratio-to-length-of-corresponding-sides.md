### (Proposition 33 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> [Similar][bookofproofs$2218] [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] are to one another as the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] of their corresponding sides.

* Let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be [similar][bookofproofs$2218] [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222], and let `$AE$` correspond to `$CF$`.
* I say that [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` has to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$AE$` (has) to `$CF$`.
