* For let the opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$CF$` and `$AH$` of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234] `$AF$` have been cut in half at the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$K$`, `$L$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, `$O$`, `$Q$`, `$P$`, and `$R$`.
* And let the [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$KN$` and `$OR$` have been produced through the pieces.
* And let `$US$` be the common section of the [planes][bookofproofs$647], and `$DG$` the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of [cube][bookofproofs$2234] `$AF$`.
* I say that `$UT$` is equal to `$TS$`, and `$DT$` to `$TG$`.

* For let `$DU$`, `$UE$`, `$BS$`, and `$SG$` have been joined.
* And since `$DO$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$PE$`, the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$DOU$` and `$UPE$` are equal to one another [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* And since `$DO$` is equal to `$PE$`, and `$OU$` to `$UP$`, and they contain equal [angles][bookofproofs$650], base `$DU$` is thus equal to base `$UE$`, and [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DOU$` is equal to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$PUE$`, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] (are) equal to the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$OUD$` (is) equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$PUE$`.
* So, for this (reason), `$DUE$` is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] [[Prop. 1.14]][bookofproofs$767].
* So, for the same (reason), `$BSG$` is also a [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and `$BS$` equal to `$SG$`.
* And since `$CA$` is equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$DB$`, but `$CA$` is also equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$EG$`, `$DB$` is thus also equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$EG$` [[Prop. 11.9]][bookofproofs$2246].
* And the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$DE$` and `$BG$` join them.
* `$DE$` is thus [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BG$` [[Prop. 1.33]][bookofproofs$931].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EDT$` (is) equal to `$BGT$`.
* For (they are) alternate [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* And (angle) `$DTU$` (is equal) to `$GTS$` [[Prop. 1.15]][bookofproofs$782].
* So, `$DTU$` and `$GTS$` are two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having two [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to two [angles][bookofproofs$650], and one side equal to one side - (namely), that subtended by one of the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] - (that is), `$DU$` (equal) to `$GS$`.
* For they are halves of `$DE$` and `$BG$` (respectively).
* (Thus), they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides [[Prop. 1.26]][bookofproofs$905].
* Thus, `$DT$` (is) equal to `$TG$`, and `$UT$` to `$TS$`.
* Thus, if the sides of the opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] of a [cube][bookofproofs$2234] are cut in half, and [planes][bookofproofs$647] are produced through the pieces, then the common section of the (latter) [planes][bookofproofs$647] and the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234] cut one another in half.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
