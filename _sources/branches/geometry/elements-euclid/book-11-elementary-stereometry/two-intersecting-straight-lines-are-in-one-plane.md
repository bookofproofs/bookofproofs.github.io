### (Proposition 2 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)[^1]

> If two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] cut one another then they are in one [plane][bookofproofs$647], and every [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] (formed using [segments][bookofproofs$645] of both lines) is in one [plane][bookofproofs$647].

* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$CD$` have cut one another at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`.
* I say that `$AB$` and `$CD$` are in one [plane][bookofproofs$647], and that every [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] (formed using [segments][bookofproofs$645] of both lines) is in one [plane][bookofproofs$647].

### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)

[^1]: The proofs of the first three propositions in this book are not at all rigorous. Hence, these three propositions should properly be regarded as additional axioms (translator's note)
