* For let `$AB$` and `$CD$` each be [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$EF$`, not being in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657] as it.
* I say that `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$`.

* For let some [point][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` have been taken at random on `$EF$`.
* And from it let `$GH$` have been drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$EF$` in the plane through `$EF$` and `$AB$`.
* And let `$GK$` have been drawn, again at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$EF$`, in the plane through `$FE$` and `$CD$`.
* And since `$EF$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to each of `$GH$` and `$GK$`, `$EF$` is thus also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$GH$` and `$GK$` [[Prop. 11.4]][bookofproofs$2241].
* And `$EF$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` is also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$HGK$` [[Prop. 11.8]][bookofproofs$2245].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$CD$` is also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$HGK$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` and `$CD$` are each at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$HGK$`.
* And if two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are at right--[angles][bookofproofs$650] to the same [plane][bookofproofs$657] then the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [[Prop. 11.6]][bookofproofs$2243].
* Thus, `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
