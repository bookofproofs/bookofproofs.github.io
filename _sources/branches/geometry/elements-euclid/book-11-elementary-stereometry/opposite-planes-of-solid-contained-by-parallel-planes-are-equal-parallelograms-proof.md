* For let the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] (figure) `$CDHG$` have been contained by the [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] `$AC$`, `$GF$`, and `$AH$`, `$DF$`, and `$BF$`, `$AE$`.
* I say that its opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] are both equal and [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909].

* For since the two [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] `$BG$` and `$CE$` are cut by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$AC$`, their common sections are [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [[Prop. 11.16]][bookofproofs$2253].
* Thus, `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$DC$`.
* Again, since the two [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] `$BF$` and `$AE$` are cut by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$AC$`, their common sections are [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [[Prop. 11.16]][bookofproofs$2253].
* Thus, `$BC$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AD$`.
* And `$AB$` was also shown (to be) [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$DC$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909].
* So, similarly, we can also show that `$DF$`, `$FG$`, `$GB$`, `$BF$`, and `$AE$` are each [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909].
* Let `$AH$` and `$DF$` have been joined.
* And since `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$DC$`, and `$BH$` to `$CF$`, so the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) joining one another, `$AB$` and `$BH$`, are [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joining one another, `$DC$` and `$CF$` (respectively), not (being) in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* Thus, they will contain equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [[Prop. 11.10]][bookofproofs$2247].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABH$` (is) equal to (angle) `$DCF$`.
* And since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BH$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DC$` and `$CF$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933], and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABH$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DCF$`, the base `$AH$` is thus equal to the base `$DF$`, and triangle `$ABH$` is equal to triangle `$DCF$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BG$` is double (triangle) `$ABH$`, and [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CE$` double (triangle) `$DCF$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* Thus, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BG$` (is) equal to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CE$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that `$AC$` is also equal to `$GF$`, and `$AE$` to `$BF$`.
* Thus, if a [solid][bookofproofs$2210] (figure) is contained by (six) [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] then its opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] are both equal and [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
