* For let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$` have (been) set up at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$` and `$CD$`, cutting one another at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, at `$E$`.
* I say that `$EF$` is also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] (passing) through `$AB$` and `$CD$`.

* For let `$AE$`, `$EB$`, `$CE$` and `$ED$` have been cut off from (the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] so as to be) equal to one another.
* And let `$GEH$` have been drawn, at random, through `$E$` (in the plane passing through `$AB$` and `$CD$`).
* And let `$AD$` and `$CB$` have been joined.
* And, furthermore, let `$FA$`, `$FG$`, `$FD$`, `$FC$`, `$FH$`, and `$FB$` have been joined from the random ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$F$` (on `$EF$`).
* For since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AE$` and `$ED$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$CE$` and `$EB$`, and they enclose equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [[Prop. 1.15]][bookofproofs$782], the base `$AD$` is thus equal to the base `$CB$`, and triangle `$AED$` will be equal to triangle `$CEB$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Hence, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DAE$` [is] equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EBC$`.
* And the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$AEG$` (is) also equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BEH$` [[Prop. 1.15]][bookofproofs$782].
* So `$AGE$` and `$BEH$` are two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having two [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to two [angles][bookofproofs$650], respectively, and one side equal to one side - (namely), those by the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650], `$AE$` and `$EB$`.
* Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides [[Prop. 1.26]][bookofproofs$905].
* Thus, `$GE$` (is) equal to `$EH$`, and `$AG$` to `$BH$`.
* And since `$AE$` is equal to `$EB$`, and `$FE$` is common and at [right angles][bookofproofs$653], the base `$FA$` is thus equal to the base `$FB$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$FC$` is also equal to `$FD$`.
* And since `$AD$` is equal to `$CB$`, and `$FA$` is also equal to `$FB$`, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FA$` and `$AD$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FB$` and `$BC$`, respectively.
* And the base `$FD$` was shown (to be) equal to the base `$FC$`.
* Thus, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FAD$` is also equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FBC$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* And, again, since `$AG$` was shown (to be) equal to `$BH$`, but `$FA$` (is) also equal to `$FB$`, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FA$` and `$AG$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FB$` and `$BH$` (respectively).
* And the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FAG$` was shown (to be) equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FBH$`.
* Thus, the base `$FG$` is equal to the base `$FH$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And, again, since `$GE$` was shown (to be) equal to `$EH$`, and `$EF$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$GE$` and `$EF$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$HE$` and `$EF$` (respectively).
* And the base `$FG$` (is) equal to the base `$FH$`.
* Thus, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$GEF$` is equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$HEF$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* Each of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$GEF$` and `$HEF$` (are) thus [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [ [Def. 1.10] ][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$FE$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$GH$`, which was drawn at random through `$E$` (in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] passing though `$AB$` and `$AC$`).
* So, similarly, we can show that `$FE$` will make [right angles][bookofproofs$653] with all [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to it which are in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647].
* And a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is at [right angles to a plane][bookofproofs$2212] when it makes [right angles][bookofproofs$653] with all [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to it which are in the plane [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212].
* Thus, `$FE$` is at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212].
* And the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] is that (passing) through the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$FE$` is at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] (passing) through `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is set up at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] cutting one another, at the common [point][bookofproofs$631] of section, then it will also be at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] (passing) through them (both).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
