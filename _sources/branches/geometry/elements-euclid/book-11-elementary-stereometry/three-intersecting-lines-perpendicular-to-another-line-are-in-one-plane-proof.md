* For let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` have been set up at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`, `$BD$`, and `$BE$`, at the (common) [point][bookofproofs$631] of section `$B$`.
* I say that `$BC$`, `$BD$`, and `$BE$` are in one [plane][bookofproofs$657].

* For (if) not, and if possible, let `$BD$` and `$BE$` be in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], and `$BC$` in a more elevated (plane).
* And let the plane through `$AB$` and `$BC$` have been produced.
* So it will make a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] as a common section with the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212].
* Let it make `$BF$`.
* Thus, the three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, `$BC$`, and `$BF$` are in one [plane][bookofproofs$657] - (namely), that drawn through `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* And since `$AB$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to each of `$BD$` and `$BE$`, `$AB$` is thus also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] (passing) through `$BD$` and `$BE$` [[Prop. 11.4]][bookofproofs$2241].
* And the plane (passing) through `$BD$` and `$BE$` is the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647].
* Thus, `$AB$` is at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212].
* Hence, `$AB$` will also make [right angles][bookofproofs$653] with all [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to it which are also in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212].
* And `$BF$`, which is in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], is joined to it.
* Thus, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABF$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And `$ABC$` was also assumed to be a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABF$` (is) equal to `$ABC$`.
* And they are in one [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$BC$` is not in a more elevated plane.
* Thus, the three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`, `$BD$`, and `$BE$` are in one [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is set up at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] cutting one another, at the (common) [point][bookofproofs$631] of section, then the three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are in one [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
