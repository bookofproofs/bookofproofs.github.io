* For let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to a reference [plane][bookofproofs$647].
* I say that all of the [planes][bookofproofs$647] (passing) through `$AB$` are also at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212].

* For let the plane `$DE$` have been produced through `$AB$`.
* And let `$CE$` be the common section of the plane `$DE$` and the reference (plane).
* And let some random [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` have been taken on `$CE$`.
* And let `$FG$` have been drawn from `$F$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$CE$`, in the plane `$DE$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759].
* And since `$AB$` is at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212], `$AB$` is thus also at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to all of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to it which are also in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212].
* Hence, it is also at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$CE$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABF$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And `$GFB$` is also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$FG$` [[Prop. 1.28]][bookofproofs$913].
* And `$AB$` is at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212].
* Thus, `$FG$` is also at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647][:[bookofproofs$2212] " [Prop. 11.8] ][bookofproofs$2245].
* And a [plane][bookofproofs$647] is at [right angles to a(nother) plane][bookofproofs$2212] when the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the common section of the [planes][bookofproofs$647], (and lying) in one of the [planes][bookofproofs$647], are at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the remaining plane [ [Def. 11.4] ][bookofproofs$2213].
* And `$FG$`, (which was) drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the common section of the [planes][bookofproofs$647], `$CE$`, in one of the [planes][bookofproofs$647], `$DE$`, was shown to be at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212].
* Thus, plane `$DE$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the reference (plane).
* So, similarly, it can be shown that all of the [planes][bookofproofs$647] (passing) at random through `$AB$` (are) at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212].
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is at [right angles to some plane][bookofproofs$2212] then all of the [planes][bookofproofs$647] (passing) through it will also be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the same [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
