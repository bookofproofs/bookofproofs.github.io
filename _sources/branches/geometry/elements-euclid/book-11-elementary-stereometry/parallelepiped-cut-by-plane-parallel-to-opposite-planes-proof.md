* For let the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$ABCD$` have been cut by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$FG$` which is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$RA$` and `$DH$`.
* I say that as the base `$AEFV$` (is) to the base `$EHCF$`, so the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$ABFU$` (is) to the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$EGCD$`.

* For let `$AH$` have been produced in each direction.
* And let any number whatsoever (of lengths), `$AK$` and `$KL$`, be made equal to `$AE$`, and any number whatsoever (of lengths), `$HM$` and `$MN$`, equal to `$EH$`.
* And let the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$LP$`, `$KV$`, `$HW$`, and `$MS$` have been completed, and the solids `$LQ$`, `$KR$`, `$DM$`, and `$MT$`.
* And since the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$LK$`, `$KA$`, and `$AE$` are equal to one another, the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$LP$`, `$KV$`, and `$AF$` are also equal to one another, and `$KO$`, `$KB$`, and `$AG$` (are equal) to one another, and, further, `$LX$`, `$KQ$`, and `$AR$` (are equal) to one another.
* For (they are) opposite [[Prop. 11.24]][bookofproofs$2261].
* So, for the same (reasons), the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$EC$`, `$HW$`, and `$MS$` are also equal to one another, and `$HG$`, `$HI$`, and `$IN$` are equal to one another, and, further, `$DH$`, `$MY$`, and `$NT$` (are equal to one another).
* Thus, three [planes][bookofproofs$647] of (one of) the solids `$LQ$`, `$KR$`, and `$AU$` are equal to the (corresponding) three [planes][bookofproofs$647] (of the others).
* But, the three [planes][bookofproofs$647] (in one of the soilds) are equal to the three opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] [[Prop. 11.24]][bookofproofs$2261].
* Thus, the three solids `$LQ$`, `$KR$`, and `$AU$` are equal to one another [ [Def. 11.10] ][bookofproofs$2219].
* So, for the same (reasons), the three solids `$ED$`, `$DM$`, and `$MT$` are also equal to one another.
* Thus, as many [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] as the base `$LF$` is of the base `$AF$`, so many [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] is the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$LU$` also of the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AU$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), as many [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] as the base `$NF$` is of the base `$FH$`, so many [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] is the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$NU$` also of the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$HU$`.
* And if the base `$LF$` is equal to the base `$NF$` then the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$LU$` is also equal to the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$NU$`.[^1] 
* And if the base `$LF$` exceeds the base `$NF$` then the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$LU$` also exceeds the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$NU$`.
* And if ($LF$) is less than ($NF$) then ($LU$) is (also) less than ($NU$).
* So, there are four magnitudes, the two bases `$AF$` and `$FH$`, and the two solids `$AU$` and `$UH$`, and equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] have been taken of the base `$AF$` and the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AU$` -  (namely), the base `$LF$` and the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$LU$` - and of the base `$HF$` and the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$HU$` - (namely), the base `$NF$` and the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$NU$`.
* And it has been shown that if the base `$LF$` exceeds the base `$FN$` then the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$LU$` also exceeds the [[solid][bookofproofs$2210]] `$NU$`, and if ($LF$ is) equal (to `$FN$`) then ($LU$ is) equal (to `$NU$`), and if ($LF$ is) less than ($FN$) then ($LU$ is) less than ($NU$).
* Thus, as the base `$AF$` is to the base `$FH$`, so the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AU$` (is) to the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$UH$` [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: Here, Euclid assumes that `$LF\gtreqqless NF$` implies `$LU \gtreqqless NU$`. This is easily demonstrated (translator's note)
