* Let `$AB$`, `$CD$`, `$EF$`, and `$GH$`, be four [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], (such that) as `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$GH$`.
* And let the [similar][bookofproofs$2218], and similarly laid out, [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$KA$`, `$LC$`, `$ME$` and `$NG$` have been described on `$AB$`, `$CD$`, `$EF$`, and `$GH$` (respectively).
* I say that as `$KA$` is to `$LC$`, so `$ME$` (is) to `$NG$`.

* For since the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$KA$` is [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to `$LC$`, `$KA$` thus has to `$LC$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$AB$` (has) to `$CD$` [[Prop. 11.33]][bookofproofs$2270].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$ME$` also has to `$NG$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$EF$` (has) to `$GH$` [[Prop. 11.33]][bookofproofs$2270].
* And since as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$GH$`, thus, also, as `$AK$` (is) to `$LC$`, so `$ME$` (is) to `$NG$`.
* And so let [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AK$` be to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$LC$`, as [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$ME$` (is) to `$NG$`.
* I say that as [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$GH$`.
* For, again, since `$KA$` has to `$LC$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$AB$` (has) to `$CD$` [[Prop. 11.33]][bookofproofs$2270], and `$ME$` also has to `$NG$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$EF$` (has) to `$GH$` [[Prop. 11.33]][bookofproofs$2270], and as `$KA$` is to `$LC$`, so `$ME$` (is) to `$NG$`, thus, also, as `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$GH$`.
* Thus, if four [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], and so on of the proposition.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
