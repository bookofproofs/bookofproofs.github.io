* Let `$BAC$` and `$EDF$` be two equal rectilinear [angles][bookofproofs$650].
* And let the raised [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AG$` and `$DM$` have been stood on [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` and `$D$`, containing equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] respectively with the original [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]. (That is) `$MDE$` (equal) to `$GAB$`, and `$MDF$` (to) `$GAC$`.
* And let the random [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$M$` have been taken on `$AG$` and `$DM$` (respectively).
* And let the `$GL$` and `$MN$` have been drawn from [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$M$` [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the [planes][bookofproofs$647] through `$BAC$` and `$EDF$` (respectively).
* And let them have joined the [planes][bookofproofs$647] at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$L$` and `$N$` (respectively).
* And let `$LA$` and `$ND$` have been joined.
* I say that [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$GAL$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$MDN$`.

* Let `$AH$` be made equal to `$DM$`.
* And let `$HK$` have been drawn through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$GL$`.
* And `$GL$` is [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the plane through `$BAC$`.
* Thus, `$HK$` is also [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the plane through `$BAC$` [[Prop. 11.8]][bookofproofs$2245].
* And let `$KC$`, `$NF$`, `$KB$`, and `$NE$` have been drawn from [points][bookofproofs$631] `$K$` and `$N$` [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$`, `$DF$`, `$AB$`, and `$DE$`.
* And let `$HC$`, `$CB$`, `$MF$`, and `$FE$` have been joined.
* Since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HA$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$HK$` and `$KA$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968], and the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$KC$` and `$CA$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KA$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968], thus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HA$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$HK$`, `$KC$`, and `$CA$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HC$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$HK$` and `$KC$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HA$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$HC$` and `$CA$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$HCA$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.48]][bookofproofs$971].
* So, for the same (reasons), angle `$DFM$` is also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ACH$` is equal to (angle) `$DFM$`.
* And `$HAC$` is also equal to `$MDF$`.
* So, `$MDF$` and `$HAC$` are two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having two [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to two [angles][bookofproofs$650], respectively, and one side equal to one side - (namely), that subtending one of the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650]  - (that is), `$HA$` (equal) to `$MD$`.
* Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides, respectively [[Prop. 1.26]][bookofproofs$905].
* Thus, `$AC$` is equal to `$DF$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that `$AB$` is also equal to `$DE$`.
* Therefore, since `$AC$` is equal to `$DF$`, and `$AB$` to `$DE$`, so the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$CA$` and `$AB$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FD$` and `$DE$` (respectively).
* But, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$CAB$` is also equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FDE$`.
* Thus, base `$BC$` is equal to base `$EF$`, and [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] ($ACB$) to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] ($DFE$), and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] to the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] (respectively) [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ACB$` (is) equal to `$DFE$`.
* And the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] `$ACK$` is also equal to the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] `$DFN$`.
* Thus, the remainder `$BCK$` is equal to the remainder `$EFN$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$CBK$` is also equal to `$FEN$`.
* So, `$BCK$` and `$EFN$` are two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having two [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to two [angles][bookofproofs$650], respectively, and one side equal to one side - (namely), that by the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] - (that is), `$BC$` (equal) to `$EF$`.
* Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides (respectively) [[Prop. 1.26]][bookofproofs$905].
* Thus, `$CK$` is equal to `$FN$`.
* And `$AC$` (is) also equal to `$DF$`.
* So, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$` and `$CK$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DF$` and `$FN$` (respectively).
* And they enclose [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, base `$AK$` is equal to base `$DN$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And since `$AH$` is equal to `$DM$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AH$` is also equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DM$`.
* But, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AK$` and `$KH$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AH$`.
* For angle `$AKH$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$DN$` and `$NM$` (is) equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DM$`.
* For angle `$DNM$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AK$` and `$KH$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$DN$` and `$NM$`, of which the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AK$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DN$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KH$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$NM$`.
* Thus, `$HK$` (is) equal to `$MN$`.
* And since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$HA$` and `$AK$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$MD$` and `$DN$`, respectively, and base `$HK$` was shown (to be) equal to base `$MN$`, angle `$HAK$` is thus equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$MDN$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* Thus, if there are two equal [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650], and so on of the proposition.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
