### (Lemma to Proposition 23 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> And we can demonstrate, thusly, in which manner to take the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `\(OR\)` equal to that (area) by which the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `\(AB\)` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `\(LO\)`.
