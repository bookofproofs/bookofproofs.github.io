* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` be three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] in [ (continued) proportion][bookofproofs$6552], (such that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$C$`.
* I say that the ([parallelepiped][bookofproofs$2222]) [solid][bookofproofs$2210] (formed) from `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` is equal to the equilateral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] on `$B$` (which is) equiangular with the aforementioned ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]).

* Let the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] at `$E$`, contained by `$DEG$`, `$GEF$`, and `$FED$`, be set out.
* And let `$DE$`, `$GE$`, and `$EF$` each be made equal to `$B$`.
* And let the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$EK$` have been completed.
* And (let) `$LM$` (be made) equal to `$A$`.
* And let the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] contained by `$NLO$`, `$OLM$`, and `$MLN$` have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$LM$`, and at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$` on it, (so as to be) equal to the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] `$E$` [[Prop. 11.23]][bookofproofs$2260].
* And let `$LO$` be made equal to `$B$`, and `$LN$` equal to `$C$`.
* And since as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$C$`, and `$A$` (is) equal to `$LM$`, and `$B$` to each of `$LO$` and `$ED$`, and `$C$` to `$LN$`, thus as `$LM$` (is) to `$EF$`, so `$DE$` (is) to `$LN$`.
* And (so) the sides around the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$NLM$` and `$DEF$` are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$MN$` is equal to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$DF$` [[Prop. 6.14]][bookofproofs$2000].
* And since the two plane rectilinear [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$DEF$` and `$NLM$` are equal, and the raised [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] stood on them (at their apexes), `$LO$` and `$EG$`, are equal to one another, and contain equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] respectively with the original [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (forming the [angles][bookofproofs$650]), the [perpendiculars][bookofproofs$653] drawn from [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$O$` to the [planes][bookofproofs$647] through `$NLM$` and `$DEF$` (respectively) are thus equal to one another [ [Prop. 11.35 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6466].
* Thus, the solids `$LH$` and `$EK$` (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986].
* And [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] on equal bases, and with the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], are equal to one another [[Prop. 11.31]][bookofproofs$2268].
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$HL$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$EK$`.
* And `$LH$` is the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] (formed) from `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`, and `$EK$` the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] on `$B$`.
* Thus, the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] (formed) from `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` is equal to the equilateral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] on `$B$` (which is) equiangular with the aforementioned ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
