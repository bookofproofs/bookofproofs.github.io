* Let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be two [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and let one of them, `$AB$`, be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to a reference [plane][bookofproofs$647].
* I say that the remaining (one), `$CD$`, will also be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the same [plane][bookofproofs$657].

* For let `$AB$` and `$CD$` meet the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` and `$D$` (respectively).
* And let `$BD$` have been joined.
* `$AB$`, `$CD$`, and `$BD$` are thus in one [plane][bookofproofs$657] [[Prop. 11.7]][bookofproofs$2244].
* Let `$DE$` have been drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$BD$` in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], and let `$DE$` be made equal to `$AB$`, and let `$BE$`, `$AE$`, and `$AD$` have been joined.
* And since `$AB$` is at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212], `$AB$` is thus also at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to all of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to it which are in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212].
* Thus, the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABD$` and `$ABE$` [are] each [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$` has met the [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$CD$`, the (sum of the) [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABD$` and `$CDB$` is thus equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* And `$ABD$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$CDB$` (is) also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* `$CD$` is thus at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$BD$`.
* And since `$AB$` is equal to `$DE$`, and `$BD$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BD$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$ED$` and `$DB$` (respectively).
* And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABD$` (is) equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EDB$`.
* For each (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the base `$AD$` (is) equal to the base `$BE$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And since `$AB$` is equal to `$DE$`, and `$BE$` to `$AD$`, the two (sides) `$AB$`, `$BE$` are equal to the two (sides) `$ED$`, `$DA$`, respectively.
* And their base `$AE$` is common.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABE$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EDA$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* And `$ABE$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* `$EDA$` (is) thus also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$ED$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AD$`.
* And it is also at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$DB$`.
* Thus, `$ED$` is also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$BD$` and `$DA$` [[Prop. 11.4]][bookofproofs$2241].
* And `$ED$` will thus make [right angles][bookofproofs$653] with all of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to it which are also in the plane through `$BDA$`.
* And `$DC$` is in the plane through `$BDA$`, inasmuch as `$AB$` and `$BD$` are in the plane through `$BDA$` [[Prop. 11.2]][bookofproofs$2239], and in which(ever plane) `$AB$` and `$BD$` (are found), `$DC$` is also (found).
* Thus, `$ED$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$DC$`.
* Hence, `$CD$` is also at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$DE$`.
* And `$CD$` is also at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$BD$`.
* Thus, `$CD$` is standing at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$DE$` and `$DB$`, which meet one another, at the ([point][bookofproofs$631]) of section, `$D$`.
* Hence, `$CD$` is also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$DE$` and `$DB$` [[Prop. 11.4]][bookofproofs$2241].
* And the plane through `$DE$` and `$DB$` is the reference (plane).
* `$CD$` is thus at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212].
* Thus, if two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [parallel][bookofproofs$788], and one of them is at [right angles to some plane][bookofproofs$2212], then the remaining (one) will also be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the same [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
