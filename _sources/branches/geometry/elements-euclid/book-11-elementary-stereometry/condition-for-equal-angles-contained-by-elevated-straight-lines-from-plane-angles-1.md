### (Corollary to Proposition 35 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So, it is clear, from this, that if there are two equal [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650], and equal raised [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are stood on them (at their apexes), containing equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] respectively with the original [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (forming the [angles][bookofproofs$650]), then the [perpendiculars][bookofproofs$653] drawn from (the raised ends of) them to the [planes][bookofproofs$647] in which the original [angles][bookofproofs$650] lie are equal to one another. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
