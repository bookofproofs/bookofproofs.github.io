* Let `$ABC$`, `$DEF$`, and `$GHK$` be the three given [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650], of which let (the sum of) two be greater than the remaining (one, the [angles][bookofproofs$650]) being taken up in any (possible way), and, further, (let) the (sum of the) three (be) less than four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* So, it is necessary to construct a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] from ([rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650]) equal to `$ABC$`, `$DEF$`, and `$GHK$`.

* Let `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$DE$`, `$EF$`, `$GH$`, and `$HK$` be cut off (so as to be) equal (to one another).
* And let `$AC$`, `$DF$`, and `$GK$` have been joined.
* It is, thus, possible to construct a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] from ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) equal to `$AC$`, `$DF$`, and `$GK$` [[Prop. 11.22]][bookofproofs$2259].
* Let (such a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432]), `$LMN$`, have be constructed, such that `$AC$` is equal to `$LM$`, `$DF$` to `$MN$`, and, further, `$GK$` to `$NL$`.
* And let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$LMN$` have been [circumscribed about][bookofproofs$6438] triangle `$LMN$` [[Prop. 4.5]][bookofproofs$1929].
* And let its [center][bookofproofs$6428] [have been found][bookofproofs$1058], and let it be (at) `$O$`.
* And let `$LO$`, `$MO$`, and `$NO$` have been joined.

* I say that `$AB$` is greater than `$LO$`.
* For, if not, `$AB$` is either equal to, or less than, `$LO$`.
* Let it, first of all, be equal.
* And since `$AB$` is equal to `$LO$`, but `$AB$` is equal to `$BC$`, and `$OL$` to `$OM$`, so the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$LO$` and `$OM$`, respectively.
* And the base `$AC$` was assumed (to be) equal to the base `$LM$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$LOM$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$DEF$` is also equal to `$MON$`, and, further, `$GHK$` to `$NOL$`.
* Thus, the three [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$`, `$DEF$`, and `$GHK$` are equal to the three [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$LOM$`, `$MON$`, and `$NOL$`, respectively.
* But, the (sum of the) three [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$LOM$`, `$MON$`, and `$NOL$` is equal to four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the (sum of the) three [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$`, `$DEF$`, and `$GHK$` is also equal to four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And it was also assumed (to be) less than four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* The very thing (is) [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$AB$` is not equal to `$LO$`.
* So, I say that `$AB$` is not less than `$LO$` either.
* For, if possible, let it be (less).
* And let `$OP$` be made equal to `$AB$`, and `$OQ$` equal to `$BC$`, and let `$PQ$` have been joined.
* And since `$AB$` is equal to `$BC$`, `$OP$` is also equal to `$OQ$`.
* Hence, the remainder `$LP$` is also equal to (the remainder) `$QM$`.
* `$LM$` is thus [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$PQ$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988], and (triangle) `$LMO$` (is) equiangular with (triangle) `$PQO$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* Thus, as `$OL$` is to `$LM$`, so `$OP$` (is) to `$PQ$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* Alternately, as `$LO$` (is) to `$OP$`, so `$LM$` (is) to `$PQ$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And `$LO$` (is) greater than `$OP$`.
* Thus, `$LM$` (is) also greater than `$PQ$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* But `$LM$` was made equal to `$AC$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` is also greater than `$PQ$`.
* Therefore, since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$PO$` and `$OQ$` (respectively), and the base `$AC$` is greater than the base `$PQ$`, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` is thus greater than the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$POQ$` [[Prop. 1.25]][bookofproofs$901].
* So, similarly, we can show that `$DEF$` is also greater than `$MON$`, and `$GHK$` than `$NOL$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the) three [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$`, `$DEF$`, and `$GHK$` is greater than the (sum of the) three [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$LOM$`, `$MON$`, and `$NOL$`.
* But, (the sum of) `$ABC$`, `$DEF$`, and `$GHK$` was assumed (to be) less than four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, (the sum of) `$LOM$`, `$MON$`, and `$NOL$` is much less than four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* But, (it is) also equal (to four [right angles][bookofproofs$653]).
* The very thing is [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$AB$` is not less than `$LO$`.
* And it was shown (to be) not equal either.
* Thus, `$AB$` (is) greater than `$LO$`.

* So let `$OR$` have been set up at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$O$` at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$LMN$` [[Prop. 11.12]][bookofproofs$2249].
* And let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$OR$` be equal to that (area) by which the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LO$` [ [Prop. 11.23 lem.] ][bookofproofs$2372].
* And let `$RL$`, `$RM$`, and `$RN$` have been joined.
* And since `$RO$` is at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$LMN$`, `$RO$` is thus also at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to each of `$LO$`, `$MO$`, and `$NO$`.
* And since `$LO$` is equal to `$OM$`, and `$OR$` is common and at [right angles][bookofproofs$653], the base `$RL$` is thus equal to the base `$RM$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$RN$` is also equal to each of `$RL$` and `$RM$`.
* Thus, the three ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$RL$`, `$RM$`, and `$RN$` are equal to one another.
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$OR$` was assumed to be equal to that (area) by which the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LO$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is thus equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$LO$` and `$OR$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LR$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$LO$` and `$OR$`.
* For `$LOR$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$RL$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` (is) equal to `$RL$`.
* But, each of `$BC$`, `$DE$`, `$EF$`, `$GH$`, and `$HK$` is equal to `$AB$`, and each of `$RM$` and `$RN$` equal to `$RL$`.
* Thus, each of `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$DE$`, `$EF$`, `$GH$`, and `$HK$` is equal to each of `$RL$`, `$RM$`, and `$RN$`.
* And since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$LR$` and `$RM$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BC$` (respectively), and the base `$LM$` was assumed (to be) equal to the base `$AC$`, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$LRM$` is thus equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$MRN$` is also equal to `$DEF$`, and `$LRN$` to `$GHK$`.
* Thus, the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] `$R$`, contained by the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$LRM$`, `$MRN$`, and `$LRN$`, has been constructed out of the three plane [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$LRM$`, `$MRN$`, and `$LRN$`, which are equal to the three given ([rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$ABC$`, `$DEF$`, and `$GHK$` (respectively).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
