* For let the two [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] `$AB$` and `$CD$` have been cut by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$EFGH$`.
* And let `$EF$` and `$GH$` be their common sections.
* I say that `$EF$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$GH$`.

* For, if not, being produced, `$EF$` and `$GH$` will meet either in the direction of `$F$`, `$H$`, or of `$E$`, `$G$`.
* Let them be produced, as in the direction of `$F$`, `$H$`, and let them, first of all, have met at `$K$`.
* And since `$EFK$` is in the plane `$AB$`, all of the [points][bookofproofs$631] on `$EFK$` are thus also in the plane `$AB$` [[Prop. 11.1]][bookofproofs$2238].
* And `$K$` is one of the [points][bookofproofs$631] on `$EFK$`.
* Thus, `$K$` is in the plane `$AB$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$K$` is also in the plane `$CD$`.
* Thus, the [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$AB$` and `$CD$`, being produced, will meet.
* But they do not meet, on account of being (initially) assumed (to be mutually) [parallel][bookofproofs$788].
* Thus, the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$` and `$GH$`, being produced in the direction of `$F$`, `$H$`, will not meet.
* So, similarly, we can show that the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$` and `$GH$`, being produced in the direction of `$E$`, `$G$`, will not meet either.
* And ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] in one [plane][bookofproofs$657] which), being produced, do not meet in either direction are [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [ [Def. 1.23] ][bookofproofs$788].
* `$EF$` is thus [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$GH$`.
* Thus, if two [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] are cut by some [plane][bookofproofs$657] then their common sections are [parallel][bookofproofs$788].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
