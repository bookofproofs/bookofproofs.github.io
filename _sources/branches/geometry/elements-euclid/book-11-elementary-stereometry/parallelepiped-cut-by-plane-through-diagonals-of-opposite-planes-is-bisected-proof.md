* For let the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$AB$` have been cut by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$CDEF$` (passing) through the diagonals of the opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$CF$` and `$DE$`.[^1] 
* I say that the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` will be cut in half by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$CDEF$`.

* For since [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$CGF$` is equal to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$CFB$`, and `$ADE$` (is equal) to `$DEH$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933], and [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CA$` is also equal to `$EB$` - for (they are) opposite [[Prop. 11.24]][bookofproofs$2261] - and `$GE$` (equal) to `$CH$`, thus the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] contained by the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$CGF$` and `$ADE$`, and the three [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$GE$`, `$AC$`, and `$CE$`, is also equal to the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] contained by the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$CFB$` and `$DEH$`, and the three [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$CH$`, `$BE$`, and `$CE$`.
* For they are contained by [planes][bookofproofs$647] (which are) equal in number and in magnitude " [Def. 11.10] ":https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/equal-solid-figures/.[^2] 
* Thus, the whole of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` is cut in half by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$CDEF$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: Here, it is assumed that the two diagonals lie in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657]. The proof is easily supplied (translator's note).

[^2]: However, strictly speaking, the [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] are not similarly arranged, being mirror images of one another (translator's note).
