* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$CD$` be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to a reference [plane][bookofproofs$647].
* I say that `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$`.

* For let them meet the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` and `$D$` (respectively).
* And let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$` have been joined.
* And let `$DE$` have been drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$BD$` in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647].
* And let `$DE$` be made equal to `$AB$`.
* And let `$BE$`, `$AE$`, and `$AD$` have been joined.
* And since `$AB$` is at [right angles to the reference plane][bookofproofs$2212], it will [thus] also make [right angles][bookofproofs$653] with all [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to it which are in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212].
* And `$BD$` and `$BE$`, which are in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], are each joined to `$AB$`.
* Thus, each of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABD$` and `$ABE$` are [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* So, for the same (reasons), each of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$CDB$` and `$CDE$` are also [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And since `$AB$` is equal to `$DE$`, and `$BD$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BD$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$ED$` and `$DB$` (respectively).
* And they contain [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the base `$AD$` is equal to the base `$BE$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And since `$AB$` is equal to `$DE$`, and `$AD$` (is) also (equal) to `$BE$`, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BE$` are thus equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$ED$` and `$DA$` (respectively).
* And their base `$AE$` (is) common.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABE$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EDA$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* And `$ABE$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$EDA$` (is) also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* `$ED$` is thus at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$DA$`.
* And it is also at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to each of `$BD$` and `$DC$`.
* Thus, `$ED$` is standing at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$`, `$DA$`, and `$DC$` at the (common) [point][bookofproofs$631] of section.
* Thus, the three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$`, `$DA$`, and `$DC$` are in one [plane][bookofproofs$657] [[Prop. 11.5]][bookofproofs$2242].
* And in which(ever) plane `$DB$` and `$DA$` (are found), in that (plane) `$AB$` (will) also (be found).
* For every [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] is in one [plane][bookofproofs$657] [[Prop. 11.2]][bookofproofs$2239].
* And each of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABD$` and `$BDC$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$` [[Prop. 1.28]][bookofproofs$913].
* Thus, if two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the same [plane][bookofproofs$657] then the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] will be [parallel][bookofproofs$788].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
