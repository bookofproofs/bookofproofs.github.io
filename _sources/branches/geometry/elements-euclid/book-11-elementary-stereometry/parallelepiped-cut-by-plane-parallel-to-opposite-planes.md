### (Proposition 25 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] is cut by a [plane][bookofproofs$647] which is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] (of the [parallelepiped][bookofproofs$2222]) then as the base (is) to the base, so the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] will be to the [solid][bookofproofs$2210].

* For let the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$ABCD$` have been cut by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$FG$` which is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$RA$` and `$DH$`.
* I say that as the base `$AEFV$` (is) to the base `$EHCF$`, so the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$ABFU$` (is) to the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$EGCD$`.
