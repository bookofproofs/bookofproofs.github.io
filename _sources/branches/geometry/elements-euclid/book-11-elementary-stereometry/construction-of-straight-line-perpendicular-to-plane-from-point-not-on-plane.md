### (Proposition 11 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To draw a [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] from a given raised [point][bookofproofs$631] to a given [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* Let `$A$` be the given raised [point][bookofproofs$631], and the given plane the reference (plane).
* So, it is required to draw a [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647].
