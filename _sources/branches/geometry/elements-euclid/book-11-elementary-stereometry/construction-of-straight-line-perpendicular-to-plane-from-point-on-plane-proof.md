* Let the given plane be the reference (plane), and `$A$` a [point][bookofproofs$631] in it.
* So, it is required to set up a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] at "right angles" to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`.

* Let some raised [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` have been assumed, and let the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BC$` have been drawn from `$B$` to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] [[Prop. 11.11]][bookofproofs$2248].
* And let `$AD$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* Therefore, since `$AD$` and `$CB$` are two [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and one of them, `$BC$`, is at "right angles" to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], the remaining (one) `$AD$` is thus also at "right angles" to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] [[Prop. 11.8]][bookofproofs$2245].
* Thus, `$AD$` has been set up at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the given plane, from the [point][bookofproofs$631] in it, `$A$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
