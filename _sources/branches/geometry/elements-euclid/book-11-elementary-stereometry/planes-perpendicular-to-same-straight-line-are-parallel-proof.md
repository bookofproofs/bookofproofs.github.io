* For let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to each of the [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$CD$` and `$EF$`.
* I say that the [planes][bookofproofs$647] are [parallel][bookofproofs$788].

* For, if not, being produced, they will meet.
* Let them have met.
* So they will make a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] as a common section [[Prop. 11.3]][bookofproofs$2240].
* Let them have made `$GH$`.
* And let some random [point][bookofproofs$631] `$K$` have been taken on `$GH$`.
* And let `$AK$` and `$BK$` have been joined.
* And since `$AB$` is at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] `$EF$`, `$AB$` is thus also at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$BK$`, which is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] in the produced plane `$EF$` [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABK$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$BAK$` is also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* So the (sum of the) two [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABK$` and `$BAK$` in the triangle `$ABK$` is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 1.17]][bookofproofs$789].
* Thus, [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$CD$` and `$EF$`, being produced, will not meet.
* [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$CD$` and `$EF$` are thus [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [ [Def. 11.8] ][bookofproofs$2217].
* Thus, [planes][bookofproofs$647] to which the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] are [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
