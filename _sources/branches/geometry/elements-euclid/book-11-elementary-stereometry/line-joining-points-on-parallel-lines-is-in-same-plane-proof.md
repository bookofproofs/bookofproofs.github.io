* Let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be two [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and let the random [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` and `$F$` have been taken on each of them (respectively).
* I say that the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` and `$F$` is in the same (reference) plane as the [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).

* For (if) not, and if possible, let it be in a more elevated (plane), such as `$EGF$`.
* And let a plane have been drawn through `$EGF$`.
* So it will make a straight cutting in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] [[Prop. 11.3]][bookofproofs$2240].
* Let it make `$EF$`.
* Thus, two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (with the same end-[points][bookofproofs$631]), `$EGF$` and `$EF$`, will enclose an area.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining `$E$` to `$F$` is not in a more elevated plane.
* The [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining `$E$` to `$F$` is thus in the plane through the [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* Thus, if there are two [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and random [points][bookofproofs$631] are taken on each of them, then the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining the two [points][bookofproofs$631] is in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657] as the [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
