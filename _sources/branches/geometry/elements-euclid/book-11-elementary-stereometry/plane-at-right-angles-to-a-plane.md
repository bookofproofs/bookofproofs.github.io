> A **plane is at right angles to a(nother) plane** when (all of) the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] drawn in one of the [planes][bookofproofs$647], at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the common section of the [planes][bookofproofs$647], are at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the remaining [plane][bookofproofs$647].
