* For, if possible, let some part, `$AB$`, of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$ABC$` be in a reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], and some part, `$BC$`, in a more elevated ([plane][bookofproofs$647]).
* In the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], there will be some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] continuous with, and [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to, `$AB$`.[^2] 
* Let it be `$BD$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` is a common segment of the two (different) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$ABC$` and `$ABD$`.
* The very thing is impossible, inasmuch as if we draw a [circle][bookofproofs$690] with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$B$` and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$` then the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] ($ABD$ and `$ABC$`) will cut off unequal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].

* Thus, some part of a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] cannot be in a reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], and (some part) in a more elevated (plane).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: The proofs of the first three propositions in this book are not at all rigorous. Hence, these three propositions should properly be regarded as additional axioms (translator's note)

[^2]: This assumption essentially presupposes the validity of the proposition under discussion (translator's note).
