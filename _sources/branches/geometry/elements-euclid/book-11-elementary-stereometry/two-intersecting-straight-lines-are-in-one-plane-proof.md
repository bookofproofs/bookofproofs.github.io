* For let the random [points][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` and `$G$` have been taken on `$EC$` and `$EB$` (respectively).
* And let `$CB$` and `$FG$` have been joined, and let `$FH$` and `$GK$` have been drawn across.
* I say, first of all, that triangle `$ECB$` is in one (reference) [plane][bookofproofs$647].
* For if part of triangle `$ECB$`, either `$FHC$` or `$GBK$`, is in the reference [plane], and the remainder in a different (plane) then a part of one the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$EC$` and `$EB$` will also be in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], and (a part) in a different (plane).
* And if the part `$FCBG$` of triangle `$ECB$` is in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], and the remainder in a different (plane) then parts of both of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$EC$` and `$EB$` will also be in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], and (parts) in a different (plane).
* The very thing was shown to be absurb [[Prop. 11.1]][bookofproofs$2238].
* Thus, triangle `$ECB$` is in one [plane][bookofproofs$647].
* And in whichever (plane) triangle `$ECB$` is (found), in that (plane) `$EC$` and `$EB$` (will) each also (be found).
* And in whichever (plane) `$EC$` and `$EB$` (are) each (found), in that (plane) `$AB$` and `$CD$` (will) also (be found) [[Prop. 11.1]][bookofproofs$2238].
* Thus, the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$CD$` are in one [plane][bookofproofs$647], and every [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] (formed using [segments][bookofproofs$645] of both lines) is in one [plane][bookofproofs$647].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: The proofs of the first three propositions in this book are not at all rigorous. Hence, these three propositions should properly be regarded as additional axioms (translator's note)
