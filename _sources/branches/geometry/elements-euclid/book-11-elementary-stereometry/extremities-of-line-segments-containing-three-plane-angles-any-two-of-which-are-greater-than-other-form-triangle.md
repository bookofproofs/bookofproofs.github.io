### Euclid's Formulation

> If there are three [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650], of which (the sum of any) two is greater than the remaining (one), (the [angles][bookofproofs$650]) being taken up in any (possible way), and if equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] contain them, then it is possible to construct a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] from (the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] created by) joining the (ends of the) equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].

* Let `$ABC$`, `$DEF$`, and `$GHK$` be three [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650], of which the sum of any) two is greater than the remaining (one), (the [angles][bookofproofs$650]) being taken up in any (possible way) - (that is), `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` (greater) than `$GHK$`, `$DEF$` and `$GHK$` (greater) than `$ABC$`, and, further, `$GHK$` and `$ABC$` (greater) than `$DEF$`.
* And let `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$DE$`, `$EF$`, `$GH$`, and `$HK$` be equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* And let `$AC$`, `$DF$`, and `$GK$` have been joined.
* I say that that it is possible to construct a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] out of ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) equal to `$AC$`, `$DF$`, and `$GK$` - that is to say, that (the sum of) any two of `$AC$`, `$DF$`, and `$GK$` is greater than the remaining (one).
