* For let the two [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$AB$` and `$BC$` be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to a reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], and let their common section be `$BD$`.
* I say that `$BD$` is at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212].

* For (if) not, let `$DE$` also have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, in the plane `$AB$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AD$`, and `$DF$`, in the plane `$BC$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$CD$`.
* And since the plane `$AB$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the reference (plane), and `$DE$` has been drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to their common section `$AD$`, in the plane `$AB$`, `$DE$` is thus at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647][:[bookofproofs$2212] " [Def. 11.4] ][bookofproofs$2213].
* So, similarly, we can show that `$DF$` is also at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212].
* Thus, two (different) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are set up, at the same [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212], on the same side.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 11.13]][bookofproofs$2250].
* Thus, no (other [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) except the common section `$DB$` of the [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$AB$` and `$BC$` can be set up at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212].
* Thus, if two [planes][bookofproofs$647] cutting one another are at [right angles to some plane][bookofproofs$2212] then their common section will also be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the same [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
