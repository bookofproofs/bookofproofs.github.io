* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to one another, `$AB$` and `$BC$`, be (respectively) [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to one another, `$DE$` and `$EF$`, (but) not in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* I say that [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` is equal to (angle) `$DEF$`.

* For let `$BA$`, `$BC$`, `$ED$`, and `$EF$` have been cut off (so as to be, respectively) equal to one another.
* And let `$AD$`, `$CF$`, `$BE$`, `$AC$`, and `$DF$` have been joined.
* And since `$BA$` is equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$ED$`, `$AD$` is thus also equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BE$` [[Prop. 1.33]][bookofproofs$931].
* So, for the same reasons, `$CF$` is also equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BE$`.
* Thus, `$AD$` and `$CF$` are each equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BE$`.
* And [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and which are not in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657] as it, are also [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one another [[Prop. 11.9]][bookofproofs$2246].
* Thus, `$AD$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] and equal to `$CF$`.
* And `$AC$` and `$DF$` join them.
* Thus, `$AC$` is also equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$DF$` [[Prop. 1.33]][bookofproofs$931].
* And since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$` and `$EF$` (respectvely), and the base `$AC$` (is) equal to the base `$DF$`, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` is thus equal to the (angle) `$DEF$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* Thus, if two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to one another are (respectively) [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to one another, (but are) not in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657], then they will contain equal [angles][bookofproofs$650].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
