### (Definition 18 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A **cone** is the [(solid) figure][bookofproofs$2210] enclosed when, one of the sides of a [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431] about the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] remaining (fixed), the triangle is carried around, and again established at the same (position) from which it began to be moved. And if the fixed [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is equal to the remaining ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) about the [right angle][bookofproofs$653], (which is) carried around, then the cone will be *right-angled*, and if less, [*obtuse-angled*][bookofproofs$689], and if greater, [*acute-angled*][bookofproofs$6426].
