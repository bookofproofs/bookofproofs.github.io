* Let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] (having) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986].
* I say that the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$AB$` and `$CD$` are to one another as their bases.

* That is to say, as base `$AE$` is to base `$CF$`, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$`.
* For let `$FH$`, equal to `$AE$`, have been applied to `$FG$` (in the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FGH$` equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$LCG$`) [[Prop. 1.45]][bookofproofs$963].
* And let the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$GK$`, (having) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] as `$CD$`, have been completed on the base `$FH$`.
* So [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$GK$`.
* For they are on the equal bases `$AE$` and `$FH$`, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] [[Prop. 11.31]][bookofproofs$2268].
* And since the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$CK$` has been cut by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$DG$`, which is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] (of `$CK$`), thus as the base `$CF$` is to the base `$FH$`, so the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` (is) to the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$DH$` [[Prop. 11.25]][bookofproofs$2262].
* And base `$FH$` (is) equal to base `$AE$`, and [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$GK$` to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$`.
* And thus as base `$AE$` is to base `$CF$`, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$`.
* Thus, [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] which (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] are to one another as their bases.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
