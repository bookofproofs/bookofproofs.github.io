* For let the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] `$A$` have been contained by the three [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$`, `$CAD$`, and `$DAB$`.
* I say that (the sum of) any two of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$`, `$CAD$`, and `$DAB$` is greater than the remaining (one), (the [angles][bookofproofs$650]) being taken up in any (possible way).

* For if the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$`, `$CAD$`, and `$DAB$` are equal to one another then (it is) clear that (the sum of) any two is greater than the remaining (one).
* But, if not, let `$BAC$` be greater (than `$CAD$` or `$DAB$`).
* And Let [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BAE$`, equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DAB$`, have been constructed in the plane through `$BAC$`, on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` on it.
* And let `$AE$` be made equal to `$AD$`.
* And `$BEC$` being drawn across through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, let it cut the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$AC$` at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` and `$C$` (respectively).
* And let `$DB$` and `$DC$` have been joined.
* And since `$DA$` is equal to `$AE$`, and `$AB$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AD$` and `$AB$` are) equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$EA$` and `$AB$`, respectively).
* And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DAB$` (is) equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAE$`.
* Thus, the base `$DB$` is equal to the base `$BE$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And since the (sum of the) two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BD$` and `$DC$` is greater than `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.20]][bookofproofs$795], of which `$DB$` was shown (to be) equal to `$BE$`, the remainder `$DC$` is thus greater than the remainder `$EC$`.
* And since `$DA$` is equal to `$AE$`, but `$AC$` (is) common, and the base `$DC$` is greater than the base `$EC$`, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DAC$` is thus greater than the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EAC$` [[Prop. 1.25]][bookofproofs$901].
* And `$DAB$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$BAE$`.
* Thus, (the sum of) `$DAB$` and `$DAC$` is greater than `$BAC$`.
* So, similarly, we can also show that the remaining ([angles][bookofproofs$650]), being taken in pairs, are greater than the remaining (one).
* Thus, if a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] is contained by three [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] then (the sum of) any two ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) is greater than the remaining (one), (the [angles][bookofproofs$650]) being taken up in any (possible way).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
