### Euclid's Formulation

> To describe a [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] similar, and similarly laid out, to a given [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] on a given [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* Let the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] be `$AB$`, and the given [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$CD$`.
* So, it is necessary to describe a [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] similar, and similarly laid out, to the given [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$CD$` on the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.
