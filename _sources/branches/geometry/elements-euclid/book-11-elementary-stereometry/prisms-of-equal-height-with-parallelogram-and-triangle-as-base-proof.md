* Let `$ABCDEF$` and `$GHKLMN$` be two equal [height][bookofproofs$1986] [prisms][bookofproofs$2222], and let the former have the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AF$`, and the latter the [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$GHK$`, as a base.
* And let [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AF$` be twice [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$GHK$`.
* I say that [prism][bookofproofs$2222] `$ABCDEF$` is equal to [prism][bookofproofs$2222] `$GHKLMN$`.

* For let the solids `$AO$` and `$GP$` have been completed.
* Since [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AF$` is double [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$GHK$`, and [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$HK$` is also double [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$GHK$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933], [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AF$` is thus equal to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$HK$`.
* And [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] which are on equal bases, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], are equal to one another [[Prop. 11.31]][bookofproofs$2268].
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AO$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$GP$`.
* And [prism][bookofproofs$2222] `$ABCDEF$` is half of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AO$`, and [prism][bookofproofs$2222] `$GHKLMN$` half of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$GP$` [[Prop. 11.28]][bookofproofs$2265].
* [prism][bookofproofs$2222] `$ABCDEF$` is thus equal to [prism][bookofproofs$2222] `$GHKLMN$`.
* Thus, if there are two equal [height][bookofproofs$1986] [prisms][bookofproofs$2222], and one has a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], and the other a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], (as a) base, and the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] is double the [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], then the [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] are equal.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
