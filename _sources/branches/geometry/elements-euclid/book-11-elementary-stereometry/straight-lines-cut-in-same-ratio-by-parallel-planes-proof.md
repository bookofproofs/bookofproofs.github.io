* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$CD$` be cut by the [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] `$GH$`, `$KL$`, and `$MN$` at the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, `$E$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`, `$F$`, `$D$` (respectively).
* I say that as the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AE$` is to `$EB$`, so `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$`.

* For let `$AC$`, `$BD$`, and `$AD$` have been joined, and let `$AD$` meet the plane `$KL$` at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$O$`, and let `$EO$` and `$OF$` have been joined.
* And since two [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] `$KL$` and `$MN$` are cut by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$EBDO$`, their common sections `$EO$` and `$BD$` are [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [[Prop. 11.16]][bookofproofs$2253].
* So, for the same (reasons), since two [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] `$GH$` and `$KL$` are cut by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$AOFC$`, their common sections `$AC$` and `$OF$` are [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [[Prop. 11.16]][bookofproofs$2253].
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EO$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one of the sides `$BD$` of triangle `$ABD$`, thus, proportionally, as `$AE$` is to `$EB$`, so `$AO$` (is) to `$OD$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* Again, since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$OF$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one of the sides `$AC$` of triangle `$ADC$`, proportionally, as `$AO$` is to `$OD$`, so `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* And it was also shown that as `$AO$` (is) to `$OD$`, so `$AE$` (is) to `$EB$`.
* And thus as `$AE$` (is) to `$EB$`, so `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, if two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are cut by [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] then they will be cut in the [same ratios][bookofproofs$1945].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
