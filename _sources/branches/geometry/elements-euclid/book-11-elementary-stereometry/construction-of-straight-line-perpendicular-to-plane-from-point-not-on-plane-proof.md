* Let `$A$` be the given raised [point][bookofproofs$631], and the given plane the reference (plane).
* So, it is required to draw a [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647].

* Let some random [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$` have been drawn across in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647], and let the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.12]][bookofproofs$760].
* If, therefore, `$AD$` is also [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] then that which was prescribed will have occurred.
* And, if not, let `$DE$` have been drawn in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759], and let the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AF$` have been drawn from `$A$` [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$DE$` [[Prop. 1.12]][bookofproofs$760], and let `$GH$` have been drawn through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* And since `$BC$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to each of `$DA$` and `$DE$`, `$BC$` is thus also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$EDA$` [[Prop. 11.4]][bookofproofs$2241].
* And `$GH$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to it.
* And if two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [parallel][bookofproofs$788], and one of them is at [right angles to some plane][bookofproofs$2212], then the remaining ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) will also be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the same [plane][bookofproofs$657] [[Prop. 11.8]][bookofproofs$2245].
* Thus, `$GH$` is also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$ED$` and `$DA$`.
* And `$GH$` is thus at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to all of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to it which are also in the plane through `$ED$` and `$AD$` [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212].
* And `$AF$`, which is in the plane through `$ED$` and `$DA$`, is joined to it.
* Thus, `$GH$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$FA$`.
* Hence, `$FA$` is also at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$HG$`.
* And `$AF$` is also at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$AF$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to each of `$GH$` and `$DE$`.
* And if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is set up at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] cutting one another, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] of section, then it will also be at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through them [[Prop. 11.4]][bookofproofs$2241].
* Thus, `$FA$` is at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$ED$` and `$GH$`.
* And the plane through `$ED$` and `$GH$` is the reference (plane).
* Thus, `$AF$` is at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212].
* Thus, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AF$` has been drawn from the given raised [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
