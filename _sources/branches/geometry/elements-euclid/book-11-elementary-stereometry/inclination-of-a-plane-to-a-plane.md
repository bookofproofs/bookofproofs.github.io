> The **inclination of a plane to a(nother) plane** is the [acute angle][bookofproofs$6426] contained by the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), (one) in each of the [planes][bookofproofs$647], drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the common segment (of the [planes][bookofproofs$647]), at the same [point][bookofproofs$631].
