* For let the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$CM$` and `$CN$` be on the same base `$AB$`, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], and let the (ends of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up in them, `$AG$`, `$AF$`, `$LM$`, `$LN$`, `$CD$`, `$CE$`, `$BH$`, and `$BK$`, be on the same [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$FN$` and `$DK$`.
* I say that [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CM$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CN$`.

* For since `$CH$` and `$CK$` are each [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909], `$CB$` is equal to each of `$DH$` and `$EK$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* Hence, `$DH$` is also equal to `$EK$`.
* Let `$EH$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remainder `$DE$` is equal to the remainder `$HK$`.
* Hence, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DCE$` is also equal to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$HBK$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738], [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753], and [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$DG$` to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$HN$` [[Prop. 1.36]][bookofproofs$945].
* So, for the same (reasons), traingle `$AFG$` is also equal to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$MLN$`.
* And [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CF$` is also equal to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BM$`, and `$CG$` to `$BN$` [[Prop. 11.24]][bookofproofs$2261].
* For they are opposite.
* Thus, the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] contained by the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$AFG$` and `$DCE$`, and the three [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$AD$`, `$DG$`, and `$CG$`, is equal to the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] contained by the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$MLN$` and `$HBK$`, and the three [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$BM$`, `$HN$`, and `$BN$`.
* Let the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] whose base (is) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AB$`, and (whose) opposite ([face][bookofproofs$2211] is) `$GEHM$`, have been added to both ([prisms][bookofproofs$2222]).
* Thus, the whole [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$CM$` is equal to the whole [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$CN$`.
* Thus, [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] which are on the same base, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], and in which the (ends of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up (are) on the same [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], are equal to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
