* Let `$AB$` be the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and `$A$` the given [point][bookofproofs$631] on it, and `$D$` the given [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220], contained by the [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] `$EDC$`, `$EDF$`, and `$FDC$`.
* So, it is necessary to construct a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] equal to the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] `$D$` on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, and at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` on it.

* For let some random [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` have been taken on `$DF$`, and let `$FG$` have been drawn from `$F$` [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the plane through `$ED$` and `$DC$` [[Prop. 11.11]][bookofproofs$2248], and let it meet the [plane][bookofproofs$647] at$G$, and let `$DG$` have been joined.
* And let `$BAL$`, equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EDC$`, and `$BAK$`, equal to `$EDG$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` on it [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* And let `$AK$` be made equal to `$DG$`.
* And let `$KH$` have been set up at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$K$` at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$BAL$` [[Prop. 11.12]][bookofproofs$2249].
* And let `$KH$` be made equal to `$GF$`.
* And let `$HA$` have been joined.
* I say that the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] at `$A$`, contained by the (plane) [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BAL$`, `$BAH$`, and `$HAL$`, is equal to the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] at `$D$`, contained by the (plane) [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$EDC$`, `$EDF$`, and `$FDC$`.
* For let `$AB$` and `$DE$` have been cut off (so as to be) equal, and let `$HB$`, `$KB$`, `$FE$`, and `$GE$` have been joined.
* And since `$FG$` is at "right angles to the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647]":[bookofproofs$2212] ($EDC$), it will also make [right angles][bookofproofs$653] with all of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to it which are also in the reference [plane][bookofproofs$647] [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212].
* Thus, the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$FGD$` and `$FGE$` are [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* So, for the same (reasons), the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$HKA$` and `$HKB$` are also [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$KA$` and `$AB$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$GD$` and `$DE$`, respectively, and they contain equal [angles][bookofproofs$650], the base `$KB$` is thus equal to the base `$GE$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And `$KH$` is also equal to `$GF$`.
* And they contain [right angles][bookofproofs$653] (with the respective bases).
* Thus, `$HB$` (is) also equal to `$FE$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Again, since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AK$` and `$KH$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DG$` and `$GF$` (respectively), and they contain [right angles][bookofproofs$653], the base `$AH$` is thus equal to the base `$FD$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And `$AB$` (is) also equal to `$DE$`.
* So, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$HA$` and `$AB$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DF$` and `$DE$` (respectively).
* And the base `$HB$` (is) equal to the base `$FE$`.
* Thus, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAH$` is equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EDF$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$HAL$` is also equal to `$FDC$`.
* And `$BAL$` is also equal to `$EDC$`.
* Thus, (a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220]) has been constructed, equal to the given [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] at `$D$`, on the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, at the given [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` on it.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
