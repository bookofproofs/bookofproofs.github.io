* Let the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$CM$` and `$CN$` be on the same base, `$AB$`, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], and let the (ends of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up in them, `$AF$`, `$AG$`, `$LM$`, `$LN$`, `$CD$`, `$CE$`, `$BH$`, and `$BK$`, not be on the same [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* I say that the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CM$` is equal to the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CN$`.

* For let `$NK$` and `$DH$` have been produced, and let them have joined one another at `$R$`.
* And, further, let `$FM$` and `$GE$` have been produced to `$P$` and `$Q$` (respectively).
* And let `$AO$`, `$LP$`, `$CQ$`, and `$BR$` have been joined.
* So, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CM$`, whose base (is) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ACBL$`, and opposite ([face][bookofproofs$2211]) `$FDHM$`, is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CP$`, whose base (is) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ACBL$`, and opposite ([face][bookofproofs$2211]) `$OQRP$`.
* For they are on the same base, `$ACBL$`, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], and the (ends of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up in them, `$AF$`, `$AO$`, `$LM$`, `$LP$`, `$CD$`, `$CQ$`, `$BH$`, and `$BR$`, are on the same [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$FP$` and `$DR$` [[Prop. 11.29]][bookofproofs$2266].
* But, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CP$`, whose base is [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ACBL$`, and opposite ([face][bookofproofs$2211]) `$OQRP$`, is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CN$`, whose base (is) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ACBL$`, and opposite ([face][bookofproofs$2211]) `$GEKN$`.
* For, again, they are on the same base, `$ACBL$`, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], and the (ends of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up in them, `$AG$`, `$AO$`, `$CE$`, `$CQ$`, `$LN$`, `$LP$`, `$BK$`, and `$BR$`, are on the same [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$GQ$` and `$NR$` [[Prop. 11.29]][bookofproofs$2266].
* Hence, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CM$` is also equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CN$`.
* Thus, [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] (which are) on the same base, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], and in which the (ends of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up are not on the same [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], are equal to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
