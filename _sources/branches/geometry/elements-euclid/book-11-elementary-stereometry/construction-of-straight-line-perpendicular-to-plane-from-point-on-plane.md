### Euclid's Formulation

> To set up a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to a given [plane][bookofproofs$657] from a given [point][bookofproofs$631] in it.

* Let the given plane be the reference (plane), and `$A$` a [point][bookofproofs$631] in it.
* So, it is required to set up a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] at [right angles to the reference plane][bookofproofs$2212] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`.
