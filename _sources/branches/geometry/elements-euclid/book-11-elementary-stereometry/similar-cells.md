> **Similar solid figures** are those [figures][bookofproofs$2210] contained by equal numbers of similar [planes][bookofproofs$647] (which are similarly arranged).

### Modern Formulation

Please refer to the [modern definition of similarity][bookofproofs$2782], which is valid for Euclidean spaces of any dimension and for all geometrical objects contained in them.
