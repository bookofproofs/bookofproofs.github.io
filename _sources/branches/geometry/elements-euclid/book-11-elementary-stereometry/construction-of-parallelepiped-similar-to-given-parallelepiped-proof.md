* Let the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] be `$AB$`, and the given [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$CD$`.
* So, it is necessary to describe a [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] [similar][bookofproofs$2218], and similarly laid out, to the given [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$CD$` on the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.

* For, let a ([solid angle][bookofproofs$2220]) contained by the ([rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$BAH$`, `$HAK$`, and `$KAB$` have been constructed, equal to [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] at `$C$`, on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` on it [[Prop. 11.26]][bookofproofs$2263], such that [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAH$` is equal to `$ECF$`, and `$BAK$` to `$ECG$`, and `$KAH$` to `$GCF$`.
* And let it have been contrived that as `$EC$` (is) to `$CG$`, so `$BA$` (is) to `$AK$`, and as `$GC$` (is) to `$CF$`, so `$KA$` (is) to `$AH$` [[Prop. 6.12]][bookofproofs$1998].
* And thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$EC$` is to `$CF$`, so `$BA$` (is) to `$AH$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* And let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$HB$` have been completed, and the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AL$`.
* And since as `$EC$` is to `$CG$`, so `$BA$` (is) to `$AK$`, and the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ECG$` and `$BAK$` are (thus) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$GE$` is thus [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$KB$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$KH$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$GF$`, and, further, `$FE$` (is [similar][bookofproofs$1983]) to `$HB$`.
* Thus, three of the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` are [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to three of the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AL$`.
* But, the (former) three are equal and [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the three opposite, and the (latter) three are equal and [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the three opposite.
* Thus, the whole [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` is [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the whole [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AL$` [ [Def. 11.9] ][bookofproofs$2218].
* Thus, `$AL$`, [similar][bookofproofs$2218], and similarly laid out, to the given [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$CD$`, has been described on the given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
