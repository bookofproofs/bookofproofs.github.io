> **Similar cones and cylinders** are those for which the [axes (of the cones][bookofproofs$2228], respectively [axes of the cylinders][bookofproofs$2231]) and the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of the [bases (of the cones][bookofproofs$2229], respectively [bases of the cylinders][bookofproofs$2232]) are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
### Modern Formulation

Please refer to the [modern definition of similarity][bookofproofs$2782], which is valid for Euclidean spaces of any dimension and for all geometrical objects contained in them.
