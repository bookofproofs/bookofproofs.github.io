### Euclid's Formulation

> If two [planes][bookofproofs$647] cut one another then their common section is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* For let the two [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$AB$` and `$BC$` cut one another, and let their common section be the line `$DB$`.
* I say that the line `$DB$` is straight.

### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)

[^1]: The proofs of the first three propositions in this book are not at all rigorous. Hence, these three propositions should properly be regarded as additional axioms (translator's note)
