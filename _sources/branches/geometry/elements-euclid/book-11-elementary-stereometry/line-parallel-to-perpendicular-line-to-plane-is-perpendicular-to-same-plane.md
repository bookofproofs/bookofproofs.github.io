### (Proposition 8 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [parallel][bookofproofs$788], and one of them is at [right angles to some plane][bookofproofs$2212], then the remaining (one) will also be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the same [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* Let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be two [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and let one of them, `$AB$`, be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to a reference [plane][bookofproofs$647].
* I say that the remaining (one), `$CD$`, will also be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the same [plane][bookofproofs$657].
