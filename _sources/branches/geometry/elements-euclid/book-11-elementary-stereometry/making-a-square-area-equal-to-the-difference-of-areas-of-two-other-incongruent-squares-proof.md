* Let the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$LO$` be set out, and let `$AB$` be greater, and let the semicircle `$ABC$` have been drawn around it.
* And let `$AC$`, equal to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$LO$`, which is not greater than the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$AB$`, have been [inserted into the semicircle][bookofproofs$1012] `$ABC$` [[Prop. 4.1]][bookofproofs$1925].
* And let `$CB$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ACB$` is in the semicircle `$ACB$`, `$ACB$` is thus a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Hence, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$`.
* And `$AC$` (is) equal to `$LO$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LO$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$`.
* Therefore, if we take `$OR$` equal to `$BC$` then the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` will be greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LO$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$OR$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was prescribed to do.
