### (Proposition 6 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the same [plane][bookofproofs$657] then the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] will be [parallel][bookofproofs$788].
* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$CD$` be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to a reference [plane][bookofproofs$647].
* I say that `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$`.

### Modern Formulation

In other words, If two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the same [plane][bookofproofs$657] then the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] lie in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657], and never meet when produced in either direction.
