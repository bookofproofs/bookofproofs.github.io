### (Proposition 4 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)[^1]

> The bases of equal [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights. And those [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] whose bases are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights are equal.

* Let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be equal [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222].
* I say that the bases of the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$AB$` and `$CD$` are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights, and (so) as base `$EH$` is to base `$NQ$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)

[^1]: This proposition assumes that (a) if two [parallelepiped][bookofproofs$2222]s are equal, and have equal bases, then their heights are equal, and (b) if the bases of two equal [parallelepiped][bookofproofs$2222]s are unequal, then that [solid][bookofproofs$2210] which has the lesser base has the greater [height][bookofproofs$1986] (translator's note).
