* Let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be equal [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222].
* I say that the bases of the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$AB$` and `$CD$` are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights, and (so) as base `$EH$` is to base `$NQ$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$`.

* For, first of all, let the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up, `$AG$`, `$EF$`, `$LB$`, `$HK$`, `$CM$`, `$NO$`, `$PD$`, and `$QR$`, be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to their bases.
* I say that as base `$EH$` is to base `$NQ$`, so `$CM$` (is) to `$AG$`.
* Therefore, if base `$EH$` is equal to base `$NQ$`, and [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` is also equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$`, `$CM$` will also be equal to `$AG$`.
* For [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] are to one another as their bases [[Prop. 11.32]][bookofproofs$2269].
* And as base `$EH$` (is) to `$NQ$`, so `$CM$` will be to `$AG$`.
* And (so it is) clear that the bases of the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$AB$` and `$CD$` are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights.
* So let base `$EH$` not be equal to base `$NQ$`, but let `$EH$` be greater.
* And [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` is also equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$CM$` is also greater than `$AG$`.
* Therefore, let `$CT$` be made equal to `$AG$`.
* And let the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$VC$` have been completed on the base `$NQ$`, with [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$CT$`.
* And since [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$`, and `$CV$` (is) extrinsic (to them), and equal (magnitudes) have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to the same (magnitude) [[Prop. 5.7]][bookofproofs$1964], thus as [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` is to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CV$`, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CV$`.
* But, as [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CV$`, so base `$EH$` (is) to base `$NQ$`.
* For the solids `$AB$` and `$CV$` (are) of equal [height][bookofproofs$1986] [[Prop. 11.32]][bookofproofs$2269].
* And as [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CV$`, so base `$MQ$` (is) to base `$TQ$` [[Prop. 11.25]][bookofproofs$2262], and `$CM$` to `$CT$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* And, thus, as base `$EH$` is to base `$NQ$`, so `$MC$` (is) to `$AG$`.
* And `$CT$` (is) equal to `$AG$`.
* And thus as base `$EH$` (is) to base `$NQ$`, so `$MC$` (is) to `$AG$`.
* Thus, the bases of the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$AB$` and `$CD$` are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights.
* So, again, let the bases of the parallelepipid solids `$AB$` and `$CD$` be [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights, and let base `$EH$` be to base `$NQ$`, as the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$`.
* I say that [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$`.
* For let the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up again be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the bases.
* And if base `$EH$` is equal to base `$NQ$`, and as base `$EH$` is to base `$NQ$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$`, the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` is thus also equal to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$`.
* And [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] on equal bases, and also with the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], are equal to one another [[Prop. 11.31]][bookofproofs$2268].
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$`.
* So, let base `$EH$` not be equal to [base] `$NQ$`, but let `$EH$` be greater.
* Thus, the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` is also greater than the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$`, that is to say `$CM$` (greater) than `$AG$`.
* Let `$CT$` again be made equal to `$AG$`, and let the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CV$` have been similarly completed.
* Since as base `$EH$` is to base `$NQ$`, so `$MC$` (is) to `$AG$`, and `$AG$` (is) equal to `$CT$`, thus as base `$EH$` (is) to base `$NQ$`, so `$CM$` (is) to `$CT$`.
* But, as [base] `$EH$` (is) to base `$NQ$`, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CV$`.
* For solids `$AB$` and `$CV$` are of equal heights [[Prop. 11.32]][bookofproofs$2269].
* And as `$CM$` (is) to `$CT$`, so (is) base `$MQ$` to base `$QT$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], and [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CV$` [[Prop. 11.25]][bookofproofs$2262].
* And thus as [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CV$`, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CV$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` and `$CD$` each have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to `$CV$`.
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].

* So, let the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) standing up, `$FE$`, `$BL$`, `$GA$`, `$KH$`, `$ON$`, `$DP$`, `$MC$`, and `$RQ$`, not be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to their bases.
* And let [perpendiculars][bookofproofs$653] have been drawn to the [planes][bookofproofs$647] through `$EH$` and `$NQ$` from [points][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`, `$G$`, `$B$`, `$K$`, `$O$`, `$M$`, `$R$`, and `$D$`, and let them have joined the [planes][bookofproofs$647] at ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$S$`, `$T$`, `$U$`, `$V$`, `$W$`, `$X$`, `$Y$`, and `$a$` (respectively).
* And let the solids `$FV$` and `$OY$` have been completed.
* In this case, also, I say that the solids `$AB$` and `$CD$` being equal, their bases are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights, and (so) as base `$EH$` is to base `$NQ$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$`.
* Since [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$`, but `$AB$` is equal to `$BT$`.
* For they are on the same base `$FK$`, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] [[Prop. 11.29]][bookofproofs$2266], [[Prop. 11.30]][bookofproofs$2267].
* And [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` is equal is equal to `$DX$`.
* For, again, they are on the same base `$RO$`, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] [[Prop. 11.29]][bookofproofs$2266], [[Prop. 11.30]][bookofproofs$2267].
* [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$BT$` is thus also equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$DX$`.
* Thus, as base `$FK$` (is) to base `$OR$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$DX$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$BT$` (see first part of proposition).
* And base `$FK$` (is) equal to base `$EH$`, and base `$OR$` to `$NQ$`.
* Thus, as base `$EH$` is to base `$NQ$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$DX$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$BT$`.
* And solids `$DX$`, `$BT$` are the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] as (solids) `$DC$`, `$BA$` (respectively).
* Thus, as base `$EH$` is to base `$NQ$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$DC$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$`.
* Thus, the bases of the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$AB$` and `$CD$` are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights.
* So, again, let the bases of the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$AB$` and `$CD$` be [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights, and (so) let base `$EH$` be to base `$NQ$`, as the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$`.
* I say that [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$`.
* For, with the same construction (as before), since as base `$EH$` is to base `$NQ$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$`, and base `$EH$` (is) equal to base `$FK$`, and `$NQ$` to `$OR$`, thus as base `$FK$` is to base `$OR$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$`.
* And solids `$AB$`, `$CD$` are the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] as (solids) `$BT$`, `$DX$` (respectively).
* Thus, as base `$FK$` is to base `$OR$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$DX$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$BT$`.
* Thus, the bases of the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$BT$` and `$DX$` are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights.
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$BT$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$DX$` (see first part of proposition).
* But, `$BT$` is equal to `$BA$`.
* For [they are] on the same base `$FK$`, and (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] [[Prop. 11.29]][bookofproofs$2266], [[Prop. 11.30]][bookofproofs$2267].
* And [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$DX$` is equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$DC$` [[Prop. 11.29]][bookofproofs$2266], [[Prop. 11.30]][bookofproofs$2267].
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$AB$` is also equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$CD$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
