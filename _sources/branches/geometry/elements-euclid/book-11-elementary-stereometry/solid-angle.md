### (Definition 11 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A **solid angle** is the inclination (constituted) by more than two lines joining one another (at the same [point][bookofproofs$631]), and not being in the same surface, to all of the lines. Otherwise, a solid angle is that contained by more than two [plane angles][bookofproofs$650], not being in the same [plane][bookofproofs$647], and constructed at one [point][bookofproofs$631].
