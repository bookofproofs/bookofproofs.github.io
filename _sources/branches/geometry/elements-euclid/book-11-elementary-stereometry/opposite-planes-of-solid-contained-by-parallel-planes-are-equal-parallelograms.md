### (Proposition 24 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [solid][bookofproofs$2210] (figure) is contained by (six) [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] then its opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] are both equal and [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909].

* For let the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] (figure) `$CDHG$` have been contained by the [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] `$AC$`, `$GF$`, and `$AH$`, `$DF$`, and `$BF$`, `$AE$`.
* I say that its opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] are both equal and [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909].
