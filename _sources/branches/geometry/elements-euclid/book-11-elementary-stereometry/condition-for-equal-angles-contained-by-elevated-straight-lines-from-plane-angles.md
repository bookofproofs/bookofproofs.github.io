### Euclid's Formulation

> If there are two equal [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650], and raised [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are stood on the apexes of them, containing equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] respectively with the original [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (forming the [angles][bookofproofs$650]), and random [points][bookofproofs$631] are taken on the raised ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), and [perpendiculars][bookofproofs$653] are drawn from them to the [planes][bookofproofs$647] in which the original [angles][bookofproofs$650] are, and [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are joined from the [points][bookofproofs$631] created in the [planes][bookofproofs$647] to the (vertices of the) original [angles][bookofproofs$650], then they will enclose equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] with the raised ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).

* Let `$BAC$` and `$EDF$` be two equal rectilinear [angles][bookofproofs$650].
* And let the raised [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AG$` and `$DM$` have been stood on [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` and `$D$`, containing equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] respectively with the original [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]. (That is) `$MDE$` (equal) to `$GAB$`, and `$MDF$` (to) `$GAC$`.
* And let the random [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$M$` have been taken on `$AG$` and `$DM$` (respectively).
* And let the `$GL$` and `$MN$` have been drawn from [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$M$` [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the [planes][bookofproofs$647] through `$BAC$` and `$EDF$` (respectively).
* And let them have joined the [planes][bookofproofs$647] at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$L$` and `$N$` (respectively).
* And let `$LA$` and `$ND$` have been joined.
* I say that [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$GAL$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$MDN$`.
