* Let `$ABC$`, `$DEF$`, and `$GHK$` be three [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650], of which the sum of any) two is greater than the remaining (one), (the [angles][bookofproofs$650]) being taken up in any (possible way) - (that is), `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` (greater) than `$GHK$`, `$DEF$` and `$GHK$` (greater) than `$ABC$`, and, further, `$GHK$` and `$ABC$` (greater) than `$DEF$`.
* And let `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$DE$`, `$EF$`, `$GH$`, and `$HK$` be equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* And let `$AC$`, `$DF$`, and `$GK$` have been joined.
* I say that that it is possible to construct a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] out of ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) equal to `$AC$`, `$DF$`, and `$GK$` - that is to say, that (the sum of) any two of `$AC$`, `$DF$`, and `$GK$` is greater than the remaining (one).

* Now, if the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$`, `$DEF$`, and `$GHK$` are equal to one another then (it is) clear that, (with) `$AC$`, `$DF$`, and `$GK$` also becoming equal, it is possible to construct a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] from ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) equal to `$AC$`, `$DF$`, and `$GK$`.
* And if not, let them be unequal, and let `$KHL$`, equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$HK$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$` on it.
* And let `$HL$` be made equal to one of `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$DE$`, `$EF$`, `$GH$`, and `$HK$`.
* And let `$KL$` and `$GL$` have been joined.
* And since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$KH$` and `$HL$` (respectively), and the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$B$` (is) equal to `$KHL$`, the base `$AC$` is thus equal to the base `$KL$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And since (the sum of) `$ABC$` and `$GHK$` is greater than `$DEF$`, and `$ABC$` equal to `$KHL$`, `$GHL$` is thus greater than `$DEF$`.
* And since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$GH$` and `$HL$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$` and `$EF$` (respectively), and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$GHL$` (is) greater than `$DEF$`, the base `$GL$` is thus greater than the base `$DF$` [[Prop. 1.24]][bookofproofs$899].
* But, (the sum of) `$GK$` and `$KL$` is greater than `$GL$` [[Prop. 1.20]][bookofproofs$795].
* Thus, (the sum of) `$GK$` and `$KL$` is much greater than `$DF$`.
* And `$KL$` (is) equal to `$AC$`.
* Thus, (the sum of) `$AC$` and `$GK$` is greater than the remaining ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DF$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that (the sum of) `$AC$` and `$DF$` is greater than `$GK$`, and, further, that (the sum of) `$DF$` and `$GK$` is greater than `$AC$`.
* Thus, it is possible to construct a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] from ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) equal to `$AC$`, `$DF$`, and `$GK$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
