### (Definition 10 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> But **equal and similar solid figures** are those ([solid figures][bookofproofs$2210]) contained by similar [planes][bookofproofs$647] equal in number and in magnitude (which are similarly arranged).

### Modern Formulation

Please refer to the [modern definition of congruence][bookofproofs$2781], which is valid for Euclidean spaces of any dimension and for all geometrical objects contained in them.
