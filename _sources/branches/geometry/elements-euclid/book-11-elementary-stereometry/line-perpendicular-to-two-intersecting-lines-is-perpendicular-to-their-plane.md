### Euclid's Formulation

> If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is set up at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] cutting one another, at the common [point][bookofproofs$631] of section, then it will also be at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] (passing) through them (both).
* For let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$` have (been) set up at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$` and `$CD$`, cutting one another at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, at `$E$`.
* I say that `$EF$` is also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] (passing) through `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
