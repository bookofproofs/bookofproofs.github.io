### (Corollary to Proposition 33 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So, (it is) clear, from this, that if four [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are in [ (continued) proportion][bookofproofs$6552] then as the first is to the fourth, so the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] on the first will be to the [similar][bookofproofs$2218], and similarly described, [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] on the second, since the first also has to the fourth the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that (it has) to the second.
