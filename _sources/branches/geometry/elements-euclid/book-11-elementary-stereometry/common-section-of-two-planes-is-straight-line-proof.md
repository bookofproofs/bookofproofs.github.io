* For let the two [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$AB$` and `$BC$` cut one another, and let their common section be the line `$DB$`.
* I say that the line `$DB$` is straight.

* For, if not, let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$DEB$` have been joined from `$D$` to `$B$` in the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$AB$`, and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$DFB$` in the plane `$BC$`.
* So two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$DEB$` and `$DFB$`, will have the same ends, and they will clearly enclose an area.
* The very thing (is) [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$DEB$` and `$DFB$` are not [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* So, similarly, we can show than no other [straight line][bookofproofs$645] can be joined from `$D$` to `$B$` except `$DB$`, the common section of the [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* Thus, if two [planes][bookofproofs$647] cut one another then their common section is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: The proofs of the first three propositions in this book are not at all rigorous. Hence, these three propositions should properly be regarded as additional axioms (translator's note)
