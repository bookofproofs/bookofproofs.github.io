### (Proposition 21 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Any [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] is contained by [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] (whose sum is) less [than] four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Let the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] `$A$` be contained by the [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$`, `$CAD$`, and `$DAB$`.[^1]
* I say that (the sum of) `$BAC$`, `$CAD$`, and `$DAB$` is less than four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].

### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)

[^1]: This proposition is only proved for the case of a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] contained by three [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650]. However, the generalization to a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] contained by more than three [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] is straightforward (translator's note).
