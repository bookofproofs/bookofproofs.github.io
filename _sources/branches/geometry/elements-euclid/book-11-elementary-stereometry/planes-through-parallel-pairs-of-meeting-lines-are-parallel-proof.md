* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to one another, `$AB$` and `$BC$`, be [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to one another, `$DE$` and `$EF$` (respectively), not being in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* I say that the [planes][bookofproofs$647] through `$AB$`, `$BC$` and `$DE$`, `$EF$` will not meet one another (when) produced.

* For let `$BG$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the plane through `$DE$` and `$EF$` [[Prop. 11.11]][bookofproofs$2248], and let it meet the [plane][bookofproofs$647] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$G$`.
* And let `$GH$` have been drawn through `$G$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$ED$`, and `$GK$` ([parallel][bookofproofs$788]) to `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* And since `$BG$` is at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$DE$` and `$EF$`, it will thus also make [right angles][bookofproofs$653] with all of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to it, which are also in the plane through `$DE$` and `$EF$` [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212].
* And each of `$GH$` and `$GK$`, which are in the plane through `$DE$` and `$EF$`, are joined to it.
* Thus, each of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BGH$` and `$BGK$` are [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And since `$BA$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$GH$` [[Prop. 11.9]][bookofproofs$2246], the (sum of the) [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$GBA$` and `$BGH$` is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* And `$BGH$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* `$GBA$` (is) thus also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$GB$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$BA$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$GB$` is also at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$BC$`.
* Therefore, since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$GB$` has been set up at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$BA$` and `$BC$`, cutting one another, `$GB$` is thus at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$BA$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 11.4]][bookofproofs$2241].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$BG$` is also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$GH$` and `$GK$`.
* And the plane through `$GH$` and `$GK$` is the (plane) through `$DE$` and `$EF$`.
* And it was also shown that `$GB$` is at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] through `$AB$` and `$BC$`. And [planes][bookofproofs$647] to which the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] are [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] [[Prop. 11.14]][bookofproofs$2251].
* Thus, the plane through `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the (plane) through `$DE$` and `$EF$`.
* Thus, if two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to one another are [parallel][bookofproofs$788] (respectively) to two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to one another, which are not in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657], then the [planes][bookofproofs$647] through them are [parallel][bookofproofs$2217] (to one another).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
