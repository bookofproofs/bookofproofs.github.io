### (Proposition 14 from Book 11 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> [Planes][bookofproofs$647] to which the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] will be [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217].
* For let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to each of the [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$CD$` and `$EF$`.
* I say that the [planes][bookofproofs$647] are [parallel][bookofproofs$788].
