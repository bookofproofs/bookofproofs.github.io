* For, `$AB$` and `$CD$` being two unequal magnitudes, and `$AB$` (being) the lesser, let the remainder never measure the (magnitude) before it, (when) the lesser (magnitude is) continually subtracted in turn from the greater.
* I say that the magnitudes `$AB$` and `$CD$` are [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].

* For if they are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] then some magnitude will measure them (both).
* If possible, let it (so) measure (them), and let it be `$E$`.
* And let `$AB$` leave `$CF$` less than itself (in) measuring `$FD$`, and let `$CF$` leave `$AG$` less than itself (in) measuring `$BG$`, and let this happen continually, until some magnitude which is less than `$E$` is left.
* Let (this) have occurred,[^1] and let `$AG$`, (which is) less than `$E$`, have been left.
* Therefore, since `$E$` measures `$AB$`, but `$AB$` measures `$DF$`, `$E$` will thus also measure `$FD$`.
* And it also measures the whole (of) `$CD$`.
* Thus, it will also measure the remainder `$CF$`.
* But, `$CF$` measures `$BG$`.
* Thus, `$E$` also measures `$BG$`.
* And it also measures the whole (of) `$AB$`.
* Thus, it will also measure the remainder `$AG$`, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, some magnitude cannot measure (both) the magnitudes `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* Thus, the magnitudes `$AB$` and `$CD$` are [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [ [Def. 10.1] ][bookofproofs$1095].
* Thus, if ... of two unequal magnitudes, and so on ....

[^1]: The fact that this will eventually occur is guaranteed by [[Prop. 10.1]][bookofproofs$2095] (translator's note).
