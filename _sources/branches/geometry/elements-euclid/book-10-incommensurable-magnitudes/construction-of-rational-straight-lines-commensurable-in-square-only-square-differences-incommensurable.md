### (Proposition 30 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find two [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, such that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater is larger than the (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) lesser by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the greater.
