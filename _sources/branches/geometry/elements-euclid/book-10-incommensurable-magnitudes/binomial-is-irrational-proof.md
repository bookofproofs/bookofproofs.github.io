* For let the two [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$AB$` and `$BC$`, (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, be laid down together.
* I say that the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), `$AC$`, is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083].

* For since `$AB$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$` - for they are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only - and as `$AB$` (is) to `$BC$`, so the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ABC$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$`, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is thus in[commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* But, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$BC$` - for the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BC$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* Thus, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And, via [composition][bookofproofs$1953], twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` - that is to say, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [[Prop. 2.4]][bookofproofs$1017] - is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.16]][bookofproofs$2110].
* And the sum of the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [is] [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* Hence, `$AC$` is also [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084] - let it be called a **binomial** ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
