### (Proposition 78 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with the whole, and with the whole makes the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and, moreover, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them, is subtracted from a(nother) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] then the remainder is an [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]). Let it be called that which makes with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.

* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`, which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] `$AB$`, and fulfils the (other) prescribed (conditions), have been subtracted from the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.35]][bookofproofs$2129].
* I say that the remainder `$AC$` is the [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called that which makes with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.

### Modern Formulation

Thus, **that which makes with a medial (area) a medial whole** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645], whose length is expressible as

`\[\beta^{1/4}\left(\sqrt{\frac 12+\frac{\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}} -\sqrt{\frac 12-\frac{\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}}\right)\]` 
for some [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076] `\(\alpha, \beta\)`. See also  [[Prop. 10.41]][bookofproofs$2135].
