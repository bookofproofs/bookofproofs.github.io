* For let the area `$AB$` have been contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$` and the [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] `$AD$`.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].

* For since `$AD$` is a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091], let `$DG$` be its attachment.
* Thus, `$AG$` and `$DG$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* And the whole, `$AG$`, is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$`, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GD$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AG$) [ [Def. 10.11] ][bookofproofs$2091].
* Thus, if (an area) equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DG$` is applied to `$AG$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, then it divides ($AG$) into (parts which are) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] [[Prop. 10.17]][bookofproofs$2111].
* Let `$DG$` have been cut in half at `$E$`.
* And let (an area) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` have been applied to `$AG$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure.
* And let it be the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AF$` and `$FG$`.
* `$AF$` is thus [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$`.
* And let `$EH$`, `$FI$`, and `$GK$` have been drawn through [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, `$F$`, and `$G$` (respectively), [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AC$`.
* And since `$AF$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$`, `$AG$` is thus also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$AF$` and `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* But `$AG$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$`.
* Thus, each of `$AF$` and `$FG$` is also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And `$AC$` is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$AF$` and `$FG$` (are) each also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Hence, `$AI$` and `$FK$` are also each [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (areas) [[Prop. 10.19]][bookofproofs$2113].
* And since `$DE$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EG$`, `$DG$` is thus also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$DE$` and `$EG$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* And `$DG$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$`.
* `$DE$` and `$EG$` (are) thus each [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Thus, `$DH$` and `$EK$` are each [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* So let the square `$LM$`, equal to `$AI$`, be laid down.
* And let the square `$NO$`, equal to `$FK$`, have been subtracted (from `$LM$`), having with it the common angle `$LPM$`.
* Thus, the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$LM$` and `$NO$` are about the same diagonal [[Prop. 6.26]][bookofproofs$2012].
* Let `$PR$` be their (common) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn.
* Therefore, since the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AF$` and `$FG$` is equal to the square `$EG$`, thus as `$AF$` is to `$EG$`, so `$EG$` (is) to `$FG$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* But, as `$AF$` (is) to `$EG$`, so `$AI$` (is) to `$EK$`, and as `$EG$` (is) to `$FG$`, so `$EK$` is to `$KF$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$EK$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$AI$` and `$KF$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* And `$MN$` is also [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$LM$` and `$NO$`, as shown before [ [Prop. 10.53 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6478].
* And `$AI$` is equal to the square `$LM$`, and `$KF$` to `$NO$`.
* Thus, `$MN$` is also equal to `$EK$`.
* But, `$EK$` is equal to `$DH$`, and `$MN$` to `$LO$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959].
* Thus, `$DK$` is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$UVW$` and `$NO$`.
* And `$AK$` is also equal to (the sum of) the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$LM$` and `$NO$`.
* Thus, the remainder `$AB$` is equal to `$ST$`.
* And `$ST$` is the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$LN$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$LN$` is equal to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$LN$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$AB$`.
* So, I say that `$LN$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* For since `$AI$` and `$FK$` are each [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (areas), and are equal to `$LM$` and `$NO$` (respectively), thus `$LM$` and `$NO$` - that is to say, the (squares) on each of `$LP$` and `$PN$` (respectively) - are also each [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (areas).
* Thus, `$LP$` and `$PN$` are also each [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Again, since `$DH$` is a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], and is equal to `$LO$`, `$LO$` is thus also a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* Therefore, since `$LO$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and `$NO$` [rational][bookofproofs$2083], `$LO$` is thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$NO$`.
* And as `$LO$` (is) to `$NO$`, so `$LP$` is to `$PN$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* `$LP$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$PN$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they are both [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$LP$` and `$PN$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$LN$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* And it is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$`.
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* Thus, if an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and so on ....
