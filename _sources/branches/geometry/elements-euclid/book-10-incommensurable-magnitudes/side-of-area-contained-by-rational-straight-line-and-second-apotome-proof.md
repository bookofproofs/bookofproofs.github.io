* For let the area `$AB$` have been contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$` and the [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] `$AD$`.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$` is the [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For let `$DG$` be an attachment to `$AD$`.
* Thus, `$AG$` and `$GD$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167], and the attachment `$DG$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$`, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the whole, `$AG$`, is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the attachment, `$GD$`, by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AG$) [ [Def. 10.12] ][bookofproofs$2092].
* Therefore, since the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GD$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AG$), thus if (an area) equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GD$` is applied to `$AG$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, then it divides ($AG$) into (parts which are) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] [[Prop. 10.17]][bookofproofs$2111].
* Therefore, let `$DG$` have been cut in half at `$E$`.
* And let (an area) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` have been applied to `$AG$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure.
* And let it be the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AF$` and `$FG$`.
* Thus, `$AF$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$`.
* `$AG$` is thus also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$AF$` and `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* And `$AG$` (is) a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$`.
* `$AF$` and `$FG$` are thus also each [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Thus, `$AI$` and `$FK$` are each [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Again, since `$DE$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EG$`, thus `$DG$` is also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$DE$` and `$EG$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* But, `$DG$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$` [thus, `$DE$` and `$EG$` are also each [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$`].
* Thus, `$DH$` and `$EK$` are each [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (areas) [[Prop. 10.19]][bookofproofs$2113].
* Therefore, let the square `$LM$`, equal to `$AI$`, have been constructed.
* And let `$NO$`, equal to `$FK$`, which is about the same angle `$LPM$` as `$LM$`, have been subtracted (from `$LM$`).
* Thus, the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$LM$` and `$NO$` are about the same diagonal [[Prop. 6.26]][bookofproofs$2012].
* Let `$PR$` be their (common) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn.
* Therefore, since `$AI$` and `$FK$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas), and are equal to the (squares) on `$LP$` and `$PN$` (respectively), [thus] the (squares) on `$LP$` and `$PN$` are also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$LP$` and `$PN$` are also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.[^1] 
* And since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AF$` and `$FG$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$`, thus as `$AF$` is to `$EG$`, so `$EG$` (is) to `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.17]][bookofproofs$2111].
* But, as `$AF$` (is) to `$EG$`, so `$AI$` (is) to `$EK$`.
* And as `$EG$` (is) to `$FG$`, so `$EK$` [is] to `$FK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$EK$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$AI$` and `$FK$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* And `$MN$` is also [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$LM$` and `$NO$` [ [Prop. 10.53 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6478].
* And `$AI$` is equal to `$LM$`, and `$FK$` to `$NO$`.
* Thus, `$MN$` is also equal to `$EK$`.
* But, `$DH$` [is] equal to `$EK$`, and `$LO$` equal to `$MN$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959].
* Thus, the whole (of) `$DK$` is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$UVW$` and `$NO$`.
* Therefore, since the whole (of) `$AK$` is equal to `$LM$` and `$NO$`, of which `$DK$` is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$UVW$` and `$NO$`, the remainder `$AB$` is thus equal to `$TS$`.
* And `$TS$` is the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LN$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LN$` is equal to the area `$AB$`.
* `$LN$` is thus the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$`.
* So, I say that `$LN$` is the [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* For since `$EK$` is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area), and is equal to `$LO$`, `$LO$` - that is to say, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$LP$` and `$PN$` - is thus a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* And `$NO$` was shown (to be) a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* Thus, `$LO$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$NO$`.
* And as `$LO$` (is) to `$NO$`, so `$LP$` is to `$PN$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$LP$` and `$PN$` are [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* `$LP$` and `$PN$` are thus [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and which contain a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* Thus, `$LN$` is the [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.74]][bookofproofs$2168].
* And it is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$`.
* Thus, the square root of area `$AB$` is the [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: There is an error in the argument here. It should just say that `$LP$` and `$PN$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], rather than in square only, since `$LP$` and `$PN$` are only shown to be [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] later on (translator's note).
