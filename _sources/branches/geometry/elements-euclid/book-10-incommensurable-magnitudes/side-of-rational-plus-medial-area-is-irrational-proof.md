* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$` and `$BC$`, [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], (and) fulfilling the prescribed (conditions), be laid down together [[Prop. 10.34]][bookofproofs$2128].
* I say that `$AC$` is irrational.

* For since the sum of the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083], the sum of the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* Hence, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.16]][bookofproofs$2110].
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` (is) thus irrational.
* Thus, `$AC$` (is) [irrational][bookofproofs$2084] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084] - let it be called the square root of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
