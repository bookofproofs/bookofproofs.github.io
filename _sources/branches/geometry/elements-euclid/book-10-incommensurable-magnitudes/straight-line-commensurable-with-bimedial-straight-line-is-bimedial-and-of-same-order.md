### (Proposition 67 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with a [bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is itself also [bimedial][bookofproofs$2131], and the same in order.
* Let `$AB$` be a [bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and let `$CD$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$CD$` is [bimedial][bookofproofs$2131], and the same in order[^1] as `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)

[^1]: Euclid's expression "(not) being the same in order" means that the resulting irrational number is "(not) of the same kind" as that irrational number, with which it is commensurable.
