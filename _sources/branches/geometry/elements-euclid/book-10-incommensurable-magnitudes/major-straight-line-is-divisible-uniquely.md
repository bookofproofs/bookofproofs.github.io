### (Proposition 45 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) can only be divided (into its component terms) at the same [point][bookofproofs$631].
* Let `$AB$` be a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which has been divided at `$C$`, so that `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CB$` [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CD$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.39]][bookofproofs$2133].
* I say that `$AB$` cannot be (so) divided at another [point][bookofproofs$631].

### Modern Formulation

In other words, `\[\sqrt{\frac{1+\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}} + \sqrt{\frac{1-\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}} =\sqrt{\frac{1+\beta}{2\sqrt{1+\beta^2}}} + \sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{2\sqrt{1+\beta^2}}}\]` has only one solution: i.e., `\[\beta=\alpha,\]`
where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

This proposition corresponds to [[Prop. 10.82]][bookofproofs$2176], with plus signs instead of minus signs.
