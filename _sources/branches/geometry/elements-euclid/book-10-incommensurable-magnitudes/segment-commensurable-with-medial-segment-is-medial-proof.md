* Let `$A$` be a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and let `$B$` be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$A$`.
* I say that `$B$` is also a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (staight-line).

* Let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$` be set out, and let the rectangular area `$CE$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$ED$` as width.
* `$ED$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And let the rectangular area `$CF$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$DF$` as width.
* Therefore, since `$A$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is also [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$B$`.
* But, `$EC$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`, and `$CF$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`.
* Thus, `$EC$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CF$`.
* And as `$EC$` is to `$CF$`, so `$ED$` (is) to `$DF$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$ED$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DF$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$ED$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$`.
* `$DF$` is thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.3] ][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DC$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Thus, `$CD$` and `$DF$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* And the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only is [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CD$` and `$DF$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CD$` and `$DF$`.
* Thus, `$B$` is a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
