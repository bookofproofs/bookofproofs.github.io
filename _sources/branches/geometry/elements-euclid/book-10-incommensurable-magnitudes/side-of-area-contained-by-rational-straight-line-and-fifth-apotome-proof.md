* For let the area `$AB$` have been contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$` and the [fifth apotome][bookofproofs$6445] `$AD$`.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$` is that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.

* For let `$DG$` be an attachment to `$AD$`.
* Thus, `$AG$` and `$DG$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167], and the attachment `$GD$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$`, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the whole, `$AG$`, is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the attachment, `$DG$`, by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AG$) [ [Def. 10.15] ][bookofproofs$6445].
* Thus, if (some area), equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DG$`, is applied to `$AG$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, then it divides ($AG$) into (parts which are) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] [[Prop. 10.18]][bookofproofs$2112].
* Therefore, let `$DG$` have been divided in half at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, and let (some area), equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$`, have been applied to `$AG$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, and let it be the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AF$` and `$FG$`.
* Thus, `$AF$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$`.
* And since `$AG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CA$`, and both are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$AK$` is thus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Again, since `$DG$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$`, `$DK$` is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) [[Prop. 10.19]][bookofproofs$2113].
* Therefore, let the square `$LM$`, equal to `$AI$`, have been constructed.
* And let the square `$NO$`, equal to `$FK$`, (and) about the same angle, `$LPM$`, have been subtracted (from `$NO$`).
* Thus, the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$LM$` and `$NO$` are about the same diagonal [[Prop. 6.26]][bookofproofs$2012].
* Let `$PR$` be their (common) diagonal, and let (the rest of) the figure have been drawn.
* So, similarly (to the previous propositions), we can show that `$LN$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$`.
* I say that `$LN$` is that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.
* For since `$AK$` was shown (to be) a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], and is equal to (the sum of) the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$LP$` and `$PN$`, the sum of the (squares) on `$LP$` and `$PN$` is thus [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Again, since `$DK$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and is equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$LP$` and `$PN$`, (the latter) is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since `$AI$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FK$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LP$` is thus also in[commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$PN$`.
* Thus, `$LP$` and `$PN$` are ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the remainder `$LN$` is the [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called that which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole [[Prop. 10.77]][bookofproofs$2171].
* And it is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$`.
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$` is that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
