* Let `$AB$` be a [bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and let `$CD$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$CD$` is [bimedial][bookofproofs$2131], and the same in order as `$AB$`.

* For since `$AB$` is a [bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), let it have been divided into its (component) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) at `$E$`.
* Thus, `$AE$` and `$EB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.37]][bookofproofs$2131], [[Prop. 10.38]][bookofproofs$2132].
* And let it have been contrived that as `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$`, (so) `$AE$` (is) to `$CF$` [[Prop. 6.12]][bookofproofs$1998].
* And thus as the remainder `$EB$` is to the remainder `$FD$`, so `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$` [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2, [[Prop. 6.16]][bookofproofs$2002].
* And `$AB$` (is) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$AE$` and `$EB$` are also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CF$` and `$FD$`, respectively [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$AE$` and `$EB$` (are) [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$CF$` and `$FD$` (are) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.23]][bookofproofs$2117].
* And since as `$AE$` is to `$EB$`, (so) `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$`, and `$AE$` and `$EB$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, `$CF$` and `$FD$` are [thus] also [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they were also shown (to be) [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$CD$` is a [bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* So, I say that it is also the same in order as `$AB$`.
* For since as `$AE$` is to `$EB$`, (so) `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$`, thus also as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AEB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CFD$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473].
* Alternately, as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$`, so the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AEB$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CFD$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` (is) [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$CF$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AEB$` (is) also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CFD$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Therefore, either the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AEB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CFD$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [and, on account of this, ($AE$ and `$CD$`) are [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645])], or (the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AEB$` is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and (the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CFD$` is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and ($AB$ and `$CD$`) are each second ([bimedial][bookofproofs$2132] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.23]][bookofproofs$2117], [[Prop. 10.37]][bookofproofs$2131], [[Prop. 10.38]][bookofproofs$2132].
And, on account of this, `$CD$` will be the same in order[^1] as `$AB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: Euclid's expression "(not) being the same in order" means that the resulting irrational number is "(not) of the same kind" as that irrational number, with which it is commensurable.
