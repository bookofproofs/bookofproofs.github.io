> And if neither (the whole nor the attached [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), a **sixth (apotome)**.

### Modern Formulation

The **sixth apotome** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is `\[\sqrt{\alpha}-\sqrt{\beta},\]` 
where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
