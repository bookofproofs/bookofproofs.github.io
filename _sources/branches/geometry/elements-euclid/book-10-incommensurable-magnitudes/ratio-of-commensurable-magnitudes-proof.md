### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)



* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes.
* I say that `$A$` has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315].

* For if `$A$` and `$B$` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (magnitudes) then some magnitude will measure them.
* Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be `$C$`.
* And as many times as `$C$` measures `$A$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$D$`.
* And as many times as `$C$` measures `$B$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$E$`.
* Therefore, since `$C$` measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$D$`, and a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] also measures `$D$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it, a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] thus measures the number `$D$` as many times as the magnitude `$C$` (measures) `$A$`.
* Thus, as `$C$` is to `$A$`, so a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] (is) to `$D$`[^1] [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, inversely, as `$A$` (is) to `$C$`, so `$D$` (is) to a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] [ [Prop. 5.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6451].
* Again, since `$C$` measures `$B$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$E$`, and a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] also measures `$E$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it, a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] thus measures `$E$` the same number of times that `$C$` (measures) `$B$`.
* Thus, as `$C$` is to `$B$`, so a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] (is) to `$E$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* And it was also shown that as `$A$` (is) to `$C$`, so `$D$` (is) to a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* Thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so the number `$D$` (is) to the (number) `$E$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* Thus, the [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes `$A$` and `$B$` have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which the number `$D$` (has) to the number `$E$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: There is a slight logical gap here, since [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328] applies to four [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], rather than two numbers and two magnitudes (translator's note).
