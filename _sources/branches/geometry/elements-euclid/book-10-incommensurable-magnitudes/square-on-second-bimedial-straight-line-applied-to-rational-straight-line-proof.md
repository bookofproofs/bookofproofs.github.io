* Let `$AB$` be a [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) having been divided into its (component) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) at `$C$`, such that `$AC$` is the greater segment.
* And let `$DE$` be some [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$DF$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$DE$`, producing `$DG$` as breadth.
* I say that `$DG$` is a [third binomial][bookofproofs$2087] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* Let the same construction be made as that shown previously.
* And since `$AB$` is a [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), having been divided at `$C$`, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are thus [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and containing a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] [[Prop. 10.38]][bookofproofs$2132].
* Hence, the sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109], [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* And it is equal to `$DL$`.
* Thus, `$DL$` (is) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`.
* `$MD$` is thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$MG$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$ML$` - that is to say, with `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$DM$` and `$MG$` are each [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$`.
* And since `$AC$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CB$`, and as `$AC$` (is) to `$CB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ACB$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` (is) also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ACB$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And hence the sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ACB$` - that is to say, `$DL$` with `$MF$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106], [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Hence, `$DM$` is also [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$MG$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they are [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* `$DG$` is thus a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, we must show that (it is) also a [third (binomial][bookofproofs$2087] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* So, similarly to the previous (propositions), we can conclude that `$DM$` is greater than `$MG$`, and `$DK$` (is) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KM$`.
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DKM$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MN$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DM$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$MG$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($DM$) [[Prop. 10.17]][bookofproofs$2111].
* And neither of `$DM$` and `$MG$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$DG$` is a [third binomial][bookofproofs$2087] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.7] ][bookofproofs$2087].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
