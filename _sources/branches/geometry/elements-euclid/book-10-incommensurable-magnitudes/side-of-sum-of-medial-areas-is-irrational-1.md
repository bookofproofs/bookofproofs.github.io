### (Lemma to Proposition 41 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> We will now demonstrate that the aforementioned [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) are uniquely divided into the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] of which they are the sum, and which produce the prescribed types, (after) setting forth the following lemma.
* Let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` be laid out, and let the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) have been cut into unequal parts at each of the ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$C$` and `$D$`. 
* And let `$AC$` be assumed (to be) greater than `$DB$`. 
* I say that (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is greater than (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$`.
