> Again, if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the whole is greater than (the square on) the attached ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) by the (square) on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) incommensurable [in length] with (the whole), and the whole is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), then let the (apotome) be called a **fourth apotome**.

### Modern Formulation

The **fourth apotome** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is 
`\[\alpha-\frac \alpha{\sqrt{1+\beta}},\]` 

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
