### (Proposition 74 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

* For let the [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BC$`, which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with `$AB$`, and which makes with `$AB$` the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, have been subtracted from the [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.27]][bookofproofs$2121].
* I say that the remainder `$AC$` is an irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Let it be called the [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation


A [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is expressible as 

`\[\delta^{1/4} - \delta^{3/4},\]`

for some [positive rational number][bookofproofs$1076] `\(\delta\)`. See also [[Prop. 10.37]][bookofproofs$2131].
