* Let two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$AC$` and `$CB$` be laid down such that their sum `$AB$` has to `$BC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], and does not have to `$CA$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] [ [Prop. 10.28 lem. I] ][bookofproofs$6474].
* And let some [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$D$` be laid down.
* And let `$EF$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$D$`.
* `$EF$` is thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.3] ][bookofproofs$2083].
* And let it have been contrived that as the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* And `$AB$` has to `$AC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` also has to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315].
* Hence, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And `$EF$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$FG$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since `$BA$` does not have to `$AC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], thus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$EF$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* `$EF$` and `$FG$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$EG$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* I say that (it is) also a [first (binomial][bookofproofs$2085] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For since as the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$BA$` is to `$AC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$`, and `$BA$` (is) greater than `$AC$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) thus also greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Therefore, let (the sum of) the (squares) on `$FG$` and `$H$` be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$`.
* And since as `$BA$` is to `$AC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$`, thus, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], as `$AB$` is to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$` [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2.
* And `$AB$` has to `$BC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` also has to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, `$EF$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$H$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FG$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($EF$).
* And `$EF$` and `$FG$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* And `$EF$` (is) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$D$`.
* Thus, `$EG$` is a [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) " [Def. 10.5] ":[bookofproofs$2085].[^1] 
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
