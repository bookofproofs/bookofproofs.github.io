### (Proposition 70 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) is (itself also) the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).
* Let `$AB$` be the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas), and (let) `$CD$` (be) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* We must show that `$CD$` is also the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).
