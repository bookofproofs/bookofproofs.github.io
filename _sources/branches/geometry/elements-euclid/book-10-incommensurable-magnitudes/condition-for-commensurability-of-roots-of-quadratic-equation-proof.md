* Let `$A$` and `$BC$` be two unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], of which (let) `$BC$` (be) the greater.
* And let a ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the lesser, `$A$` - that is, (equal) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on half of `$A$` - falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, have been applied to `$BC$`.
* And let it be the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$DC$` [ [see previous lemma] ][bookofproofs$6472].
* And let `$BD$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DC$`.
* I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than the (square on) `$A$` by (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BC$).

* For let `$BC$` have been cut in half at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757].
* And let `$EF$` be made equal to `$DE$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736].
* Thus, the remainder `$DC$` is equal to `$BF$`.
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$` has been cut into equal (pieces) at `$E$`, and into unequal (pieces) at `$D$`, the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$BD$` and `$DC$`, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$ED$`, is thus equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EC$` [[Prop. 2.5]][bookofproofs$1019].
* (The same) also (for) the quadruples.
* Thus, four times the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$DC$`, plus the quadruple of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DE$`, is equal to four times the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EC$`.
* But, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is equal to the quadruple of the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$DC$`, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DF$` is equal to the quadruple of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DE$`.
* For `$DF$` is double `$DE$`.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is equal to the quadruple of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EC$`.
* For, again, `$BC$` is double `$CE$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` and `$DF$` is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$`.
* Hence, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DF$`.
* Thus, `$BC$` is greater in square than `$A$` by `$DF$`.
* It must also be shown that `$BC$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DF$`.
* For since `$BD$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DC$`, `$BC$` is thus also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* But, `$CD$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` plus `$BF$`.
* For `$CD$` is equal to `$BF$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* Thus, `$BC$` is also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BF$` plus `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* Hence, `$BC$` is also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the remainder `$FD$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$A$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BC$).
* And so let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` be greater than the (square on) `$A$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BC$).
* And let a ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) equal to the fourth (part) of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, have been applied to `$BC$`.
* And let it be the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$DC$`.
* It must be shown that `$BD$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DC$`.
* For, similarly, by the same construction, we can show that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than the (square on) `$A$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FD$`.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than the (square on) `$A$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BC$).
* Thus, `$BC$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FD$`.
* Hence, `$BC$` is also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the remaining sum of `$BF$` and `$DC$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* But, the sum of `$BF$` and `$DC$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [in length] with `$DC$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* Hence, `$BC$` is also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* Thus, via [separation][bookofproofs$1954], `$BD$` is also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DC$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* Thus, if there are two unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and so on ....
