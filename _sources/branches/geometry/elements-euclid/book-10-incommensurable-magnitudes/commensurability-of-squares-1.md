### (Corollary to Proposition 9 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> And it will be clear, from (what) has been demonstrated, that ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] (are) always also ([commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]) in square, but ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]) in square (are) not always also ([commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]) in length.
