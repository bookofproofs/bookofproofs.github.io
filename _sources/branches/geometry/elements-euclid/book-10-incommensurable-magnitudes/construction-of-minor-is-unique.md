### (Proposition 82 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Only one [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with the whole, and (together) with the whole makes the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], can be attached to a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* Let `$AB$` be a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and let `$BC$` be (so) attached to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.76]][bookofproofs$2170].
* I say that another another [straight line][bookofproofs$645] fulfilling the same (conditions) cannot be attached to `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

In other words, `\[\sqrt{\frac{1+\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}} - \sqrt{\frac{1-\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}} =\sqrt{\frac{1+\beta}{2\sqrt{1+\beta^2}}} - \sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{2\sqrt{1+\beta^2}}}\]` has only one solution: i.e., `\[\beta=\alpha,\]`
where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

This proposition corresponds to [[Prop. 10.45]][bookofproofs$2139], with minus signs instead of plus signs.
