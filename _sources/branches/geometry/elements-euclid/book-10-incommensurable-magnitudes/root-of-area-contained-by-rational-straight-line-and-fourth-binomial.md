### Euclid's Formulation

> If an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [major][bookofproofs$2133].

* For let the area `$AC$` be contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and the [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`, which has been divided into its (component) terms at `$E$`, of which let `$AE$` be the greater.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$AC$` is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [major][bookofproofs$2133].

### Modern Formulation

If the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has [unit][bookofproofs$2314] length then this proposition states that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is a [major][bookofproofs$2133] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]: i.e., a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has a length 
`\[\alpha\,\left(1+\frac 1{\sqrt{1+\beta}}\right)\]` 
whose [square root][bookofproofs$46] can be written 
`\[\rho\,\sqrt{\frac 12+\frac\delta{2\sqrt{1+\delta^{\,2}}}}+\rho\,\sqrt{\frac 12 -\frac\delta{2\sqrt{1+\delta^{\,2}}}},\]` 
where 
`\[\rho=\sqrt{\alpha}\quad\text{ and }\quad\delta^{\,2}=\beta.\]` 

This is the length of a [major][bookofproofs$2133] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] (see [[Prop. 10.39]][bookofproofs$2133]), since `$\rho, \delta,\alpha,\beta$` are all [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
