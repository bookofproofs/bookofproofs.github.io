* Let the [three] [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`, (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, be laid down.
* And let, `$D$`, [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) to `$A$` and `$B$`, have been taken [[Prop. 6.13]][bookofproofs$1999].
* And let it be contrived that as `$B$` (is) to `$C$`, (so) `$D$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 6.12]][bookofproofs$1998].

* Since the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$` and `$B$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$B$` - that is to say, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003] - is [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$D$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* And since `$B$` and `$C$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and as `$B$` is to `$C$`, (so) `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, `$D$` and `$E$` are thus [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$D$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* `$E$` (is) thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.23]][bookofproofs$2117].
* Thus, `$D$` and `$E$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* So, I say that they also enclose a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* For since as `$B$` is to `$C$`, (so) `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, thus, alternately, as `$B$` (is) to `$D$`, (so) `$C$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And as `$B$` (is) to `$D$`, (so) `$D$` (is) to `$A$`.
* And thus as `$D$` (is) to `$A$`, (so) `$C$` (is) to `$E$`.[^1]
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$C$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$D$` and `$E$` [[Prop. 6.16]][bookofproofs$2002].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$C$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$D$` and `$E$` (is) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, (two) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$D$` and `$E$`), containing a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, have been found.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: `$D$` and `$E$` have lengths `$\alpha^{1/4}$` and `$\beta^{1/2}/\alpha^{1/4}$` times that of `$A$`, respectively, where the lengths of `$B$` and `$C$` are `$\alpha^{1/2}$` and `$\beta^{1/2}$` times that of `$A$`, respectively, for some positive rational numbers `\(\alpha\)` and `\(\beta\)` (translator's note).
