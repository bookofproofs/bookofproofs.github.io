* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$` and `$BC$`, [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], and fulfilling the prescribed (conditions), be laid down together [[Prop. 10.33]][bookofproofs$2127].
* I say that `$AC$` is irrational.

* For since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [thus] also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100], [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* And the sum of the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* Hence, (the sum of) the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` - that is, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [[Prop. 2.4]][bookofproofs$1017] - is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.16]][bookofproofs$2110] [and the sum of the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is irrational.
* Hence, `$AC$` is also [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084] - let it be called a **major** ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
