### (Proposition 75 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

* For let the [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CB$`, which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, `$AB$`, and which contains with the whole, `$AB$`, the [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, have been subtracted from the [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.28]][bookofproofs$2122].
* I say that the remainder `$AC$` is an irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Let it be called a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation

A [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is expressible as 

`\[\alpha^{1/4}-\frac{\sqrt{\beta}}{\alpha^{1/4}},\]` 

where `$\alpha$` and `$\beta$` are [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076]. See also [[Prop. 10.38]][bookofproofs$2132].
