* Let `$AB$` be that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole, and `$CD$` a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let `$CE$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$CF$` as breadth.
* I say that `$CF$` is a [fifth apotome][bookofproofs$6445].

* Let `$BG$` be an attachment to `$AB$`.
* Thus, the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AG$` and `$GB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.77]][bookofproofs$2171].
* And let `$CH$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, and `$KL$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$`.
* The whole of `$CL$` is thus equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$`.
* And the sum of the (squares) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` together is [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$CL$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it has been applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$`, producing `$CM$` as breadth.
* `$CM$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since the whole of `$CL$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$`, of which `$CE$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, the remainder `$FL$` is thus equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* Therefore, let `$FM$` have been cut in half at `$N$`.
* And let `$NO$` have been drawn through `$N$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$CD$` or `$ML$`.
* Thus, `$FO$` and `$NL$` are each equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`.
* And since twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [is] equal to `$FL$`, `$FL$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`, producing `$FM$` as breadth.
* Thus, `$FM$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* And since `$CL$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and `$FL$` [rational][bookofproofs$2083], `$CL$` is thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FL$`.
* And as `$CL$` (is) to `$FL$`, so `$CM$` (is) to `$MF$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* `$CM$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$MF$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And both are [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$CM$` and `$MF$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$CF$` is thus an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [fifth (apotome) ][bookofproofs$6445].
* For, similarly (to the previous propositions), we can show that the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CKM$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$NM$` - that is to say, to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FM$`.
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` is in[commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$GB$`, and the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` (is) equal to `$CH$`, and the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$` to `$KL$`, `$CH$` (is) thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KL$`.
* And as `$CH$` (is) to `$KL$`, so `$CK$` (is) to `$KM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$CK$` (is) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KM$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Therefore, since `$CM$` and `$MF$` are two unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and (some area), equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FM$`, has been applied to `$CM$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, and divides it into [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (parts), the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CM$` is thus greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$MF$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($CM$) [[Prop. 10.18]][bookofproofs$2112].
* And the attachment `$FM$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$CF$` is a [fifth apotome][bookofproofs$6445] [ [Def. 10.15] ][bookofproofs$6445].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
