### (Lemma to Proposition 21 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If there are two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] then as the first is to the second, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the first (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* Let `$FE$` and `$EG$` be two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* I say that as `$FE$` is to `$EG$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$FE$` and `$EG$`.
