* Let `$A$` be a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and `$BC$` a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), of which let `$DC$` be the greater term.
* And let the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BC$` and `$EF$` be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`.
* I say that `$EF$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] whose terms are [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` and `$DB$`, and in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945], and, moreover, that `$EF$` will have the same order as `$BC$`.

* For, again, let the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$G$` be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`.
* Therefore, since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BC$` and `$EF$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$G$`, thus as `$CB$` is to `$BD$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$EF$` [[Prop. 6.16]][bookofproofs$2002].
* And `$CB$` (is) greater than `$BD$`.
* Thus, `$G$` is also greater than `$EF$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973], [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Let `$EH$` be equal to `$G$`.
* Thus, as `$CB$` is to `$BD$`, so `$HE$` (is) to `$EF$`.
* Thus, via [separation][bookofproofs$1954], as `$CD$` is to `$BD$`, so `$HF$` (is) to `$FE$` [[Prop. 5.17]][bookofproofs$1974].
* Let it have been contrived that as `$HF$` (is) to `$FE$`, so `$FK$` (is) to `$KE$`.
* And, thus, the whole `$HK$` is to the whole `$KF$`, as `$FK$` (is) to `$KE$`.
* For as one of the leading ([proportional][bookofproofs$2328] magnitudes is) to one of the following, so all of the leading (magnitudes) are to all of the following [[Prop. 5.12]][bookofproofs$1969].
* And as `$FK$` (is) to `$KE$`, so `$CD$` is to `$DB$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* And, thus, as `$HK$` (is) to `$KF$`, so `$CD$` is to `$DB$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` (is) [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$DB$` [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HK$` is thus also [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$KF$` [[Prop. 6.22]][bookofproofs$2008], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HK$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KF$`, so `$HK$` (is) to `$KE$`, since the three ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$HK$`, `$KF$`, and `$KE$` are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [ [Def. 5.9] ][bookofproofs$1948].
* `$HK$` is thus [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KE$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Hence, `$HE$` is also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EK$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$EH$` and `$BD$`, and the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$EH$` and `$BD$` is thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BD$`.
* Thus, `$EH$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BD$` [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* And, hence, the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with it, `$EK$`, is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.3] ][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BD$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* Therefore, since as `$CD$` is to `$DB$`, so `$FK$` (is) to `$KE$`, and `$CD$` and `$DB$` are ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, `$FK$` and `$KE$` are also [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$KE$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$FK$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* `$FK$` and `$KE$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$EF$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$DB$` either by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095], or by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($CD$).
* Therefore, if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$DB$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with [$CD$] then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FK$` will also be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$KE$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($FK$) [[Prop. 10.14]][bookofproofs$2108].
* And if `$CD$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with a (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), (so) also (is) `$FK$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105], [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And if `$BD$` (is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), (so) also (is) `$KE$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And if neither of `$CD$` or `$DB$` (is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), neither also (are) either of `$FK$` or `$KE$`.
* And if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$DB$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($CD$) then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FK$` will also be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$KE$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($FK$) [[Prop. 10.14]][bookofproofs$2108].
* And if `$CD$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with a (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), (so) also (is) `$FK$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105], [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And if `$BD$` (is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), (so) also (is) `$KE$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And if neither of `$CD$` or `$DB$` (is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), neither also (are) either of `$FK$` or `$KE$`.
* Hence, `$FE$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] whose terms, `$FK$` and `$KE$`, are [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the terms, `$CD$` and `$DB$`, of the [binomial][bookofproofs$2130], and in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945].
* And ($FE$) has the same order as `$BC$` [ [Def. 10.5] ][bookofproofs$2085], [ [Def. 10.6] ][bookofproofs$2086], [ [Def. 10.7] ][bookofproofs$2087], [ [Def. 10.8] ][bookofproofs$2088], [ [Def. 10.9] ][bookofproofs$2089], [ [Def. 10.10] ][bookofproofs$2090].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
