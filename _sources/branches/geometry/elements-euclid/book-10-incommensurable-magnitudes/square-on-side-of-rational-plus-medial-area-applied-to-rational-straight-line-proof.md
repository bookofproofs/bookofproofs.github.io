* Let `$AB$` be the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] having been divided into its (component) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] at `$C$`, such that `$AC$` is greater.
* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$` be laid down.
* And let the ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$DF$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$DE$`, producing `$DG$` as breadth.
* I say that `$DG$` is a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] [straight line][bookofproofs$645].

* Let the same construction be made as in the (propositions) before this.
* Therefore, since `$AB$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], having been divided at `$C$`, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are thus [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.40]][bookofproofs$2134].
* Therefore, since the sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], `$DL$` is thus [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Hence, `$DM$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083] and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* Again, since twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ACB$` - that is to say, `$MF$` - is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], `$MG$` (is) thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] and [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$` [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* `$DM$` (is) thus [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$MG$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Thus, `$DM$` and `$MG$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$DG$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [fifth (binomial][bookofproofs$2089] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* For, similarly (to the previous propositions), it can be shown that the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DKM$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MN$`, and `$DK$` (is) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KM$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DM$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$MG$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($DM$) [[Prop. 10.18]][bookofproofs$2112].
* And `$DM$` and `$MG$` are [[rational][bookofproofs$2083]] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and the lesser `$MG$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$DG$` is a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.9] ][bookofproofs$2089].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
