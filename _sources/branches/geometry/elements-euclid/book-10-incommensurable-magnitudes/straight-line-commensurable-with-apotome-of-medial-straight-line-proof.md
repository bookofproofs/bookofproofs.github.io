* Let `$AB$` be an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and let `$CD$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$CD$` is also an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and (is) the same in order as `$AB$`.

* For since `$AB$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), let `$EB$` be an attachment to it.
* Thus, `$AE$` and `$EB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.74]][bookofproofs$2168], [[Prop. 10.75]][bookofproofs$2169].
* And let it have been contrived that as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$BE$` (is) to `$DF$` [[Prop. 6.12]][bookofproofs$1998].
* Thus, `$AE$` [is] also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CF$`, and `$BE$` with `$DF$` [[Prop. 5.12]][bookofproofs$1969], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$AE$` and `$EB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$CF$` and `$FD$` are thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.23]][bookofproofs$2117], [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Thus, `$CD$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.74]][bookofproofs$2168], [[Prop. 10.75]][bookofproofs$2169].
* So, I say that it is also the same in order[^1] as `$AB$`.
* For since as `$AE$` is to `$EB$`, so `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.12]][bookofproofs$1969], [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973] [but as `$AE$` (is) to `$EB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$`, and as `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$`], thus as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` also (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473] [and, alternately, as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$`, so the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$`].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` (is) [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$CF$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Therefore, either the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$` will also be rational [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084], or the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` [is] [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$` [is] also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* Therefore, `$CD$` is the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and is the same in order as `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.74]][bookofproofs$2168], [[Prop. 10.75]][bookofproofs$2169].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: Euclid's expression "(not) being the same in order" means that the resulting irrational number is "(not) of the same kind" as that irrational number, with which it is commensurable.
