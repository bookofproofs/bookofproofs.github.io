* Let `$AB$` be a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and let `$CD$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$CD$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and (is) the same in order as `$AB$`.

* For since `$AB$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), let it have been divided into its (component) terms at `$E$`, and let `$AE$` be the greater term.
* `$AE$` and `$EB$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* Let it have been contrived that as `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$`, so `$AE$` (is) to `$CF$` [[Prop. 6.12]][bookofproofs$1998].
* Thus, the remainder `$EB$` is also to the remainder `$FD$`, as `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$` [[Prop. 6.16]][bookofproofs$2002], [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2.
* And `$AB$` (is) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$AE$` is also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CF$`, and `$EB$` with `$FD$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$AE$` and `$EB$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$CF$` and `$FD$` are also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And as `$AE$` is to `$CF$`, (so) `$EB$` (is) to `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, alternately, as `$AE$` is to `$EB$`, (so) `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And `$AE$` and `$EB$` [are] [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$CF$` and `$FD$` are also [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they are [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* `$CD$` is thus a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, I say that it is the same in order as `$AB$`.
* For the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$EB$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) either [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] or [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AE$).
* Therefore, if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$EB$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AE$) then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` will also be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FD$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($CF$) [[Prop. 10.14]][bookofproofs$2108].
* And if `$AE$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with (some previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then `$CF$` will also be [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with it [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And, on account of this, `$AB$` and `$CD$` are each [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.5] ][bookofproofs$2085] - that is to say, the same in order.
* And if `$EB$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then `$FD$` is also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with it [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106], and, again, on account of this, ($CD$) will be the same in order as `$AB$`.
* For each of them will be [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.6] ][bookofproofs$2086].
* And if neither of `$AE$` and `$EB$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then neither of `$CF$` and `$FD$` will be [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with it [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107], and each (of `$AB$` and `$CD$`) is a [third (binomial][bookofproofs$2087] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.7] ][bookofproofs$2087].
* And if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$EB$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AE$) then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` is also greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FD$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($CF$) [[Prop. 10.14]][bookofproofs$2108].
* And if `$AE$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then `$CF$` is also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with it [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106], and each (of `$AB$` and `$CD$`) is a [fourth (binomial][bookofproofs$2088] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.8] ][bookofproofs$2088].
* And if `$EB$` (is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the previously laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then `$FD$` (is) also ([commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with it), and each (of `$AB$` and `$CD$`) will be a [fifth (binomial][bookofproofs$2089] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.9] ][bookofproofs$2089].
* And if neither of `$AE$` and `$EB$` (is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the previously laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then also neither of `$CF$` and `$FD$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and each (of `$AB$` and `$CD$`) will be a [sixth (binomial][bookofproofs$2090] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.10] ][bookofproofs$2090].
* Hence, a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and the same in order.[^1]
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: Euclid's expression "(not) being the same in order" means that the resulting irrational number is "(not) of the same kind" as that irrational number, with which it is commensurable.
