* Let `$A$` be a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and `$BD$` an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* And let the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$KH$` be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`, such that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$`, applied to the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] `$BD$`, produces `$KH$` as breadth.
* I say that `$KH$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] whose terms are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the terms of `$BD$`, and in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945], and, moreover, that `$KH$` has the same order as `$BD$`.

* For let `$DC$` be an attachment to `$BD$`.
* Thus, `$BC$` and `$CD$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* And let the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BC$` and `$G$` also be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* The ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BC$` and `$G$` (is) thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And it has been applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BC$`.
* Thus, `$G$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* Therefore, since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BC$` and `$G$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$KH$`, thus, proportionally, as `$CB$` is to `$BD$`, so `$KH$` (is) to `$G$` [[Prop. 6.16]][bookofproofs$2002].
* And `$BC$` (is) greater than `$BD$`.
* Thus, `$KH$` (is) also greater than `$G$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973], [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Let `$KE$` be made equal to `$G$`.
* `$KE$` is thus [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`.
* And since as `$CB$` is to `$BD$`, so `$HK$` (is) to `$KE$`, thus, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], as `$BC$` (is) to `$CD$`, so `$KH$` (is) to `$HE$` [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2.
* Let it have been contrived that as `$KH$` (is) to `$HE$`, so `$HF$` (is) to `$FE$`.
* And thus the remainder `$KF$` is to `$FH$`, as `$KH$` (is) to `$HE$` - that is to say, [as] `$BC$` (is) to `$CD$` [[Prop. 5.19]][bookofproofs$1976].
* And `$BC$` and `$CD$` [are] [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$KF$` and `$FH$` are thus also [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And since as `$KH$` is to `$HE$`, (so) `$KF$` (is) to `$FH$`, but as `$KH$` (is) to `$HE$`, (so) `$HF$` (is) to `$FE$`, thus, also as `$KF$` (is) to `$FH$`, (so) `$HF$` (is) to `$FE$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* And hence as the first (is) to the third, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the first (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the second [ [Def. 5.9] ][bookofproofs$1948].
* And thus as `$KF$` (is) to `$FE$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KF$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KF$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$FH$`.
* For `$KF$` and `$FH$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082].
* Thus, `$KF$` is also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FE$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Hence, `$KF$` [is] also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KE$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* And `$KE$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`.
* Thus, `$KF$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And since as `$BC$` is to `$CD$`, (so) `$KF$` (is) to `$FH$`, alternately, as `$BC$` (is) to `$KF$`, so `$DC$` (is) to `$FH$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And `$BC$` (is) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KF$`.
* Thus, `$FH$` (is) also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$BC$` and `$CD$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$KF$` and `$FH$` are thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [ [Def. 10.3] ][bookofproofs$2083], [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Thus, `$KH$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* Therefore, if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$CD$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BC$), then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$KF$` will also be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FH$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($KF$) [[Prop. 10.14]][bookofproofs$2108].
* And if `$BC$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with a (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), (so) also (is) `$KF$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And if `$CD$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with a (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), (so) also (is) `$FH$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And if neither of `$BC$` or `$CD$` (are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), neither also (are) either of `$KF$` or `$FH$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$CD$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BC$) then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$KF$` will also be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FH$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($KF$) [[Prop. 10.14]][bookofproofs$2108].
* And if `$BC$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with a (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), (so) also (is) `$KF$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And if `$CD$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095], (so) also (is) `$FH$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And if neither of `$BC$` or `$CD$` (are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), neither also (are) either of `$KF$` or `$FH$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* `$KH$` is thus a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] whose terms, `$KF$` and `$FH$`, [are] [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the terms, `$BC$` and `$CD$`, of the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], and in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945].
* Moreover, `$KH$` will have the same order as `$BC$` [ [Def. 10.5] ][bookofproofs$2085], [ [Def. 10.6] ][bookofproofs$2086], [ [Def. 10.7] ][bookofproofs$2087], [ [Def. 10.8] ][bookofproofs$2088], [ [Def. 10.9] ][bookofproofs$2089], [ [Def. 10.10] ][bookofproofs$2090].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
