* For, as in the previous figures, let the [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] `$BD$`, [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the whole, have been subtracted from the [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] `$BC$`.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$EC$` is one of two [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) - either a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), or that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.

* For since `$BC$` and `$BD$` are each [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas), and `$BC$` (is) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BD$`, accordingly, `$FH$` and `$FK$` will each be [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since `$BC$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BD$` - that is to say, `$GH$` with `$GK$` - `$HF$` (is) also [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Thus, `$FH$` and `$FK$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$KH$` is thus as apotome [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167], [and `$FK$` an attachment (to it).
* So, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FK$` either by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095], or by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($FH$).]
* So, if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FK$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($FH$), and (since) neither of `$FH$` and `$FK$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FG$`, `$KH$` is a [third apotome][bookofproofs$2093] [ [Def. 10.3] ][bookofproofs$2083].
* And `$KL$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [third apotome][bookofproofs$2093] is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083], and the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of it is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.93]][bookofproofs$2187].
* Hence, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$LH$` - that is to say, (of) `$EC$` - is a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FK$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [in length] with ($FH$), and (since) neither of `$HF$` and `$FK$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$`, `$KH$` is a [sixth apotome][bookofproofs$6446] [ [Def. 10.16] ][bookofproofs$6446].
* And the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [sixth apotome][bookofproofs$6446] is that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole [[Prop. 10.96]][bookofproofs$2190].
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$LH$` - that is to say, (of) `$EC$` - is that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
