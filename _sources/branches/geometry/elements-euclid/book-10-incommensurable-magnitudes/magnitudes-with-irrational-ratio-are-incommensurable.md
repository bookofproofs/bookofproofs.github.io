### (Proposition 8 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two magnitudes do not have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] then the magnitudes will be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
* For let the two magnitudes `$A$` and `$B$` not have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315].
* I say that the magnitudes `$A$` and `$B$` are [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
