* Let `$AB$` be a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area), and `$CD$` a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AD$` is either [binomial][bookofproofs$2130], or [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131], or [major][bookofproofs$2133], or the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].

* For `$AB$` is either greater or less than `$CD$`.
* Let it, first of all, be greater.
* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$` be laid down.
* And let (the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$EG$`, equal to `$AB$`, have been applied to `$EF$`, producing `$EH$` as breadth.
* And let (the recatangle) `$HI$`, equal to `$DC$`, have been applied to `$EF$`, producing `$HK$` as breadth.
* And since `$AB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and is equal to `$EG$`, `$EG$` is thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And it has been applied to the [[rational][bookofproofs$2083]] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`, producing `$EH$` as breadth.
* `$EH$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* Again, since `$CD$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and is equal to `$HI$`, `$HI$` is thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`, producing `$HK$` as breadth.
* `$HK$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since `$CD$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and `$AB$` [rational][bookofproofs$2083], `$AB$` is thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$`.
* Hence, `$EG$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$HI$`.
* And as `$EG$` (is) to `$HI$`, so `$EH$` is to `$HK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$EH$` is also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$HK$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they are both [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$EH$` and `$HK$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$EK$` is thus a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), having been divided (into its component terms) at `$H$` [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* And since `$AB$` is greater than `$CD$`, and `$AB$` (is) equal to `$EG$`, and `$CD$` to `$HI$`, `$EG$` (is) thus also greater than `$HI$`.
* Thus, `$EH$` is also greater than `$HK$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Therefore, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EH$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$HK$` either by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($EH$), or by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (in length with `$EH$`).
* Let it, first of all, be greater by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (in length with `$EH$`).
* And the greater (of the two components of `$EK$`) `$HE$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`.
* `$EK$` is thus a [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.5] ][bookofproofs$2085].
* And `$EF$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And if an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.54]][bookofproofs$2148].
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$EI$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Hence the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$AD$` is also a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And, so, let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EH$` be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$HK$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($EH$).
* And the greater (of the two components of `$EK$`) `$EH$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`.
* Thus, `$EK$` is a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.8] ][bookofproofs$2088].
* And `$EF$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And if an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called [major][bookofproofs$2133] [[Prop. 10.57]][bookofproofs$2151].
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$EI$` is a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Hence, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$AD$` is also [major][bookofproofs$2133].
* And so, let `$AB$` be less than `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$EG$` is also less than `$HI$`.
* Hence, `$EH$` is also less than `$HK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$HK$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$EH$` either by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($HK$), or by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($HK$).
* Let it, first of all, be greater by the [square][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($HK$).
* And the lesser (of the two components of `$EK$`) `$EH$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`.
* Thus, `$EK$` is a [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.6] ][bookofproofs$2086].
* And `$EF$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And if an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.55]][bookofproofs$2149].
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$EI$` is a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Hence, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$AD$` is also a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And so, let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$HK$` be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$HE$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($HK$).
* And the lesser (of the two components of `$EK$`) `$EH$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`.
* Thus, `$EK$` is a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.9] ][bookofproofs$2089].
* And `$EF$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And if an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] [[Prop. 10.58]][bookofproofs$2152].
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$EI$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* Hence, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AD$` is also the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* Thus, when a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] and a [medial area][bookofproofs$6462] are added together, four [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) arise (as the [square root][bookofproofs$46]s of the total area) - either a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130], or a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131], or a [major][bookofproofs$2133], or the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
