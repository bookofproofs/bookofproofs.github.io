* For let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) `$BD$` have been subtracted from the [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] `$BC$`.
* I say that one of two [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) arise (as) the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the remaining (area), `$EC$` - either a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), or that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.

* For let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FG$` be laid down, and let similar areas (to the preceding proposition) have been applied (to it).
* So, accordingly, `$FH$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$`, and `$KF$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$`.
* Thus, `$FH$` and `$FK$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* `$KH$` is thus an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167], and `$FK$` an attachment to it.
* So, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$HF$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FK$` either by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($HF$), or by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (in length with `$HF$`).
* Therefore, if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$HF$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FK$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($HF$), and (since) the attachment `$FK$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FG$`, `$KH$` is a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] [ [Def. 10.12] ][bookofproofs$2092].
* And `$FG$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Hence, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$LH$` - that is to say, (of) `$EC$` - is a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.92]][bookofproofs$2186].
* And if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$HF$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FK$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (in length with `$HF$`), and (since) the attachment `$FK$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FG$`, `$KH$` is a [fifth apotome][bookofproofs$6445] [ [Def. 10.15] ][bookofproofs$6445].
* Hence, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$EC$` is that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole [[Prop. 10.95]][bookofproofs$2189].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
