* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$` and `$BC$`, [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], (and) fulfilling the prescribed (conditions), be laid down together [[Prop. 10.35]][bookofproofs$2129].
* I say that `$AC$` is irrational.

* Let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$` be laid out, and let (the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$DF$`, equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$`, and (the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$GH$`, equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, have been applied to `$DE$`.
* Thus, the whole of `$DH$` is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [[Prop. 2.4]][bookofproofs$1017].
* And since the sum of the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and is equal to `$DF$`, `$DF$` is thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$DG$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$GK$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GF$` - that is to say, `$DE$`.
* And since (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, `$DF$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GH$`.
* Hence, `$DG$` is also [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they are [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$DG$` and `$GK$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$DK$` is irrational, and that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* And `$DE$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$DH$` is irrational, and its [square root][bookofproofs$46] is irrational [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* And `$AC$` (is) the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$HD$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` is irrational - let it be called the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
