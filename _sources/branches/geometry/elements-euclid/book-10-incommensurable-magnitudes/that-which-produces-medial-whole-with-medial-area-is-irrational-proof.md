* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`, which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] `$AB$`, and fulfils the (other) prescribed (conditions), have been subtracted from the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.35]][bookofproofs$2129].
* I say that the remainder `$AC$` is the [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called that which makes with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.

* For let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DI$` be laid down.
* And let `$DE$`, equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$`, have been applied to `$DI$`, producing `$DG$` as breadth.
* And let `$DH$`, equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, have been subtracted (from `$DE$`) [producing `$DF$` as breadth].
* Thus, the remainder `$FE$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* Hence, `$AC$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$FE$`.
* And since the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and is equal to `$DE$`, `$DE$` [is] thus [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DI$`, producing `$DG$` as breadth.
* Thus, `$DG$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DI$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* Again, since twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and is equal to `$DH$`, `$DH$` is thus [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DI$`, producing `$DF$` as breadth.
* Thus, `$DF$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DI$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, `$DE$` (is) also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DH$`.
* And as `$DE$` (is) to `$DH$`, so `$DG$` also is to `$DF$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$DG$` (is) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DF$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they are both [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$GD$` and `$DF$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$FG$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* And `$FH$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And the [[rectangle][bookofproofs$909]] contained by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114], and its [square root][bookofproofs$46] is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And `$AC$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$FE$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Let it be called that which makes with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
