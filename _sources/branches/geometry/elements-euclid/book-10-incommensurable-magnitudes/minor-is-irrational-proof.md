* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`, which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with the whole, and fulfils the (other) prescribed (conditions), have been subtracted from the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.33]][bookofproofs$2127].
* I say that the remainder `$AC$` is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called **minor**.

* For since the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115], the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* And, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the remaining [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021], [[Prop. 10.16]][bookofproofs$2110].
* And the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` (is) thus [irrational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$AC$` (is) an irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* Let it be called a **minor** ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
