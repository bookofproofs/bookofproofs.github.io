* For let `$AB$` be a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and (let) `$CD$` (be) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$CD$` is also a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For let the same things have been contrived (as in the former proposition).
* And since `$AE$` and `$EB$` are ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] [[Prop. 10.76]][bookofproofs$2170], `$CF$` and `$FD$` are thus also ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Therefore, since as `$AE$` is to `$EB$`, so `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.12]][bookofproofs$1969], [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973], thus also as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FD$` [[Prop. 6.22]][bookofproofs$2008].
* Thus, via [composition][bookofproofs$1953], as the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AE$` and `$EB$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EB$`, so the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$CF$` and `$FD$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.18]][bookofproofs$1975], [also alternately].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$DF$` [[Prop. 10.104]][bookofproofs$2198].
* The sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` and `$EB$` (is) thus also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` and `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And the sum of the (squares) on `$AE$` and `$EB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.76]][bookofproofs$2170].
* Thus, the sum of the (squares) on `$CF$` and `$FD$` is also [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* Again, since as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473], and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` (is) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$`, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` is thus also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$`.
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.76]][bookofproofs$2170].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$` (is) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* `$CF$` and `$FD$` are thus ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$CD$` is a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.76]][bookofproofs$2170].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
