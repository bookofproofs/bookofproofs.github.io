* For let the two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$AB$` and `$BC$`, [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, (and) containing a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], be laid down together [[Prop. 10.28]][bookofproofs$2122].
* I say that `$AC$` is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083].

* For let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$` be laid down, and let (the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$DF$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`, have been applied to `$DE$`, making `$DG$` as breadth [[Prop. 1.44]][bookofproofs$961].
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 2.4]][bookofproofs$1017], so let (the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$EH$`, equal to (the sum of) the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$`, have been applied to `$DE$`.
* The remainder `$HF$` is thus equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* And since `$AB$` and `$BC$` are each [medial][bookofproofs$2115], (the sum of) the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is thus also medial.[^1] 
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` was also assumed (to be) [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And `$EH$` is equal to (the sum of) the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$`, and `$FH$` (is) equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* Thus, `$EH$` and `$HF$` (are) each [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And they were applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$DH$` and `$HG$` are each [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* Therefore, since `$AB$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`, and as `$AB$` is to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* But, the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* Thus, the sum of the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* But, `$EH$` is equal to (the sum of) the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$`, and `$HF$` is equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* Thus, `$EH$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$HF$`.
* Hence, `$DH$` is also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$HG$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Thus, `$DH$` and `$HG$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Hence, `$DG$` is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* And `$DE$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] and [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* The area `$DF$` is thus [irrational][bookofproofs$2083], and (so) the [square root][bookofproofs$46] [of it] is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* And `$AC$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$DF$`.
* `$AC$` is thus [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] - let it be called a **second bimedial** ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]). 
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: Since, by hypothesis, the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] - see [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109], [[Prop. 10.23]][bookofproofs$2117] (translator's note)
