* Let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$AB$` and `$BC$` be laid down.

* And let them be either (both) even or (both) odd.
* And since, if an [even (number) ][bookofproofs$2317] is subtracted from an [even (number) ][bookofproofs$2317], or if an odd (number is subtracted) from an [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318], then the remainder is even [[Prop. 9.24]][bookofproofs$2069], [[Prop. 9.26]][bookofproofs$2071], the remainder `$AC$` is thus even.
* Let `$AC$` have been cut in half at `$D$`.
* And let `$AB$` and `$BC$` also be either [similar plane (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329], or square ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) - which are themselves also [similar plane (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329].
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$`, is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` [[Prop. 2.6]][bookofproofs$1020].
* And the (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [square][bookofproofs$2326] - inasmuch as it was shown that if two [similar plane (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329] make some (number) by [multiplying one another][bookofproofs$6437] then the (number so) created is [square][bookofproofs$2326] [[Prop. 9.1]][bookofproofs$2047].
* Thus, two [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326] have been found - (namely,) the (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, and the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` - which, (when) added (together), make the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`.
* And (it is) clear that two square ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) have again been found - (namely,) the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`, and the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` - such that their difference - (namely,) the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BC$` - is [square][bookofproofs$2326] whenever `$AB$` and `$BC$` are [similar plane (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329].
* But, when they are not [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329], two square ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) have been found - (namely,) the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`, and the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$` - between which the difference - (namely,) the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BC$` - is not [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
