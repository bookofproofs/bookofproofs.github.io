### (Proposition 2 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If the remainder of two unequal magnitudes (which are) [laid out] never measures the (magnitude) before it, (when) the lesser (magnitude is) continually subtracted in turn from the greater, then the (original) magnitudes will be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
* For, `$AB$` and `$CD$` being two unequal magnitudes, and `$AB$` (being) the lesser, let the remainder never measure the (magnitude) before it, (when) the lesser (magnitude is) continually subtracted in turn from the greater.
* I say that the magnitudes `$AB$` and `$CD$` are [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
