* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` be the three given [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes.
* So it is required to find the greatest common measure of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.

* For let the greatest common measure of the two (magnitudes) `$A$` and `$B$` have been taken [[Prop. 10.3]][bookofproofs$2097], and let it be `$D$`.
* So `$D$` either measures, or [does] not [measure], `$C$`.
* Let it, first of all, measure ($C$).
* Therefore, since `$D$` measures `$C$`, and it also measures `$A$` and `$B$`, `$D$` thus measures `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* Thus, `$D$` is a common measure of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* And (it is) clear that (it is) also (the) greatest (common measure).
* For no magnitude larger than `$D$` measures (both) `$A$` and `$B$`.
* So let `$D$` not measure `$C$`.
* I say, first, that `$C$` and `$D$` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
* For if `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] then some magnitude will measure them which will clearly also measure `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Hence, it will also measure `$D$`, the greatest common measure of `$A$` and `$B$` [ [Prop. 10.3 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6458].
* And it also measures `$C$`.
* Hence, the aforementioned magnitude will measure (both) `$C$` and `$D$`.
* Thus, `$C$` and `$D$` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [ [Def. 10.1] ][bookofproofs$1095].
* Therefore, let their greatest common measure have been taken [[Prop. 10.3]][bookofproofs$2097], and let it be `$E$`.
* Therefore, since `$E$` measures `$D$`, but `$D$` measures (both) `$A$` and `$B$`, `$E$` will thus also measure `$A$` and `$B$`.
* And it also measures `$C$`.
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* Thus, `$E$` is a common measure of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* So I say that (it is) also (the) greatest (common measure).
* For, if possible, let `$F$` be some magnitude greater than `$E$`, and let it measure `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* And since `$F$` measures `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, it will thus also measure `$A$` and `$B$`, and will (thus) measure the greatest common measure of `$A$` and `$B$` [ [Prop. 10.3 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6458].
* And `$D$` is the greatest common measure of `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, `$F$` measures `$D$`.
* And it also measures `$C$`.
* Thus, `$F$` measures (both) `$C$` and `$D$`.
* Thus, `$F$` will also measure the greatest common measure of `$C$` and `$D$` [ [Prop. 10.3 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6458].
* And it is `$E$`.
* Thus, `$F$` will measure `$E$`, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, some [magnitude] greater than the magnitude `$E$` cannot measure `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* Thus, if `$D$` does not measure `$C$` then `$E$` is the greatest common measure of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* And if it does measure ($C$) then `$D$` itself (is the greatest common measure).
* Thus, the greatest common measure of three given [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes has been found.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
