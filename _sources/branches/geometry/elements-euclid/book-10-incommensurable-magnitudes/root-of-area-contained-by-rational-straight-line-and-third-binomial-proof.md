* For let the area `$ABCD$` be contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and by the [third binomial][bookofproofs$2087] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`, which has been divided into its (component) terms at `$E$`, of which `$AE$` is the greater.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AC$` is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132].

* For let the same construction be made as previously.
* And since `$AD$` is a [third binomial][bookofproofs$2087] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), `$AE$` and `$ED$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$ED$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AE$), and neither of `$AE$` and `$ED$` [is] [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$` [ [Def. 10.7] ][bookofproofs$2087].
* So, similarly to that which has been previously demonstrated, we can show that `$MO$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AC$`, and `$MN$` and `$NO$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Hence, `$MO$` is [bimedial][bookofproofs$2131].
* So, we must show that (it is) also second ([bimedial][bookofproofs$2132]).
* And, since `$DE$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$` - that is to say, with `$EK$` - and `$DE$` (is) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$`, `$EF$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EK$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And they are (both) [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$FE$` and `$EK$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$EL$` - that is to say, `$MR$` - [is] thus [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is contained by `$MNO$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$MNO$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$MO$` is a [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.38]][bookofproofs$2132].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
