* For let the two magnitudes `$A$` and `$B$` have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$` (has) to the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$E$`.
* I say that the magnitudes `$A$` and `$B$` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095].

* For, as many [units][bookofproofs$2314] as there are in `$D$`, let `$A$` have been divided into so many equal (divisions).
* And let `$C$` be equal to one of them.
* And as many [units][bookofproofs$2314] as there are in `$E$`, let `$F$` be the sum of so many magnitudes equal to `$C$`.
* Therefore, since as many [units][bookofproofs$2314] as there are in `$D$`, so many magnitudes equal to `$C$` are also in `$A$`, therefore whichever [part][bookofproofs$703] a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] is of `$D$`, `$C$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$A$`.
* Thus, as `$C$` is to `$A$`, so a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] (is) to `$D$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* And a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] measures the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$`.
* Thus, `$C$` also measures `$A$`.
* And since as `$C$` is to `$A$`, so a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] (is) to the [ [number] ][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$`, thus, inversely, as `$A$` (is) to `$C$`, so the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$` (is) to a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] [ [Prop. 5.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6451].
* Again, since as many [units][bookofproofs$2314] as there are in `$E$`, so many (magnitudes) equal to `$C$` are also in `$F$`, thus as `$C$` is to `$F$`, so a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] (is) to the [ [number] ][bookofproofs$2315] `$E$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* And it was also shown that as `$A$` (is) to `$C$`, so `$D$` (is) to a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* Thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$A$` is to `$F$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* But, as `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, so `$A$` is to `$B$`.
* And thus as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so (it) also is to `$F$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, `$A$` has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to each of `$B$` and `$F$`.
* Thus, `$B$` is equal to `$F$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
* And `$C$` measures `$F$`.
* Thus, it also measures `$B$`.
* But, in fact, (it) also (measures) `$A$`.
* Thus, `$C$` measures (both) `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, `$A$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$` [ [Def. 10.1] ][bookofproofs$1095].
* Thus, if two magnitudes ... to one another, and so on ....
