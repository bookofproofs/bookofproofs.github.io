### (Proposition 38 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, which contain a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], are added together then the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] - let it be called a **second bimedial** ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).[^1]
* For let the two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$AB$` and `$BC$`, [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, (and) containing a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], be laid down together [[Prop. 10.28]][bookofproofs$2122].
* I say that `$AC$` is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083].

### Modern Formulation

The **second bimedial** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length  is expressible as 
`\[\alpha^{1/4}+\frac{\sqrt{\beta}}{\alpha^{1/4}},\]` 

where `$\alpha$` and `$\beta$` are [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

The second bimedial and the [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (see [Prop. 10.75][bookofproofs$2169]), whose length is expressible as


`\[\alpha^{1/4}-\frac{\sqrt{\beta}}{\alpha^{1/4}},\]` 

are the positive roots of the quartic `\[x^4-2\,\left(\frac{\left(\alpha+\beta\right)}{\sqrt{\alpha}}\right)\,x^2+ \left(\frac{\left(\alpha-\beta\right)^2}{\alpha}\right) = 0.\]`

[^1]: Literally, "second from two medials" (translator's note).
