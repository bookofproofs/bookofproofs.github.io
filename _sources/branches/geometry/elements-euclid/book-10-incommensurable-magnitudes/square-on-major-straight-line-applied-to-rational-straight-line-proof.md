* Let `$AB$` be a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) having been divided at `$C$`, such that `$AC$` is greater than `$CB$`, and (let) `$DE$` (be) a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$DF$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$DE$`, producing `$DG$` as breadth.
* I say that `$DG$` is a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* Let the same construction be made as that shown previously.
* And since `$AB$` is a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), having been divided at `$C$`, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.39]][bookofproofs$2133].
* Therefore, since the sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], `$DL$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$DM$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$` [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* Again, since twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` - that is to say, `$MF$` - is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and is (applied to) the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$ML$`, `$MG$` is thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* `$DM$` is thus also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$MG$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* `$DM$` and `$MG$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$DG$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So we must show that (it is) also a [fourth (binomial][bookofproofs$2088] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* So, similarly to the previous (propositions), we can show that `$DM$` is greater than `$MG$`, and that the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DKM$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MN$`.
* Therefore, since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is in[commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$CB$`, `$DH$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KL$`.
* Hence, `$DK$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And if there are two unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the lesser, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, is applied to the greater, and divides it into (parts which are) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095], then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater will be larger than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the lesser by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the greater [[Prop. 10.18]][bookofproofs$2112].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DM$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$MG$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($DM$).
* And `$DM$` and `$MG$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* And `$DM$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$DG$` is a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.8] ][bookofproofs$2088].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
