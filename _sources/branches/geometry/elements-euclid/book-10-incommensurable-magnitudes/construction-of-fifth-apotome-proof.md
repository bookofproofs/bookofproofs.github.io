* Let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$` be laid down, and let `$CG$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$A$`.
* Thus, `$CG$` [is] a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$DF$` and `$FE$` be laid down such that `$DE$` again does not have to each of `$DF$` and `$FE$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* And let it have been contrived that as `$FE$` (is) to `$ED$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* Thus, `$BG$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since as `$DE$` is to `$EF$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$`.
* And `$DE$` does not have to `$EF$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` thus does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$BG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GC$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And they are both [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* `$BG$` and `$GC$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$BC$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [fifth (apotome) ][bookofproofs$6445].

* For, let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$` be that (area) by which the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$` [ [Prop. 10.13 lem.] ][bookofproofs$2371].
* Therefore, since as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$`, so `$DE$` (is) to `$EF$`, thus, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], as `$ED$` is to `$DF$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$` [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2.
* And `$ED$` does not have to `$DF$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$BG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$H$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GC$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GC$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($GB$).
* And the attachment `$CG$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$`.
* Thus, `$BC$` is a [fifth apotome][bookofproofs$6445] [ [Def. 10.15] ][bookofproofs$6445].
* Thus, the [fifth apotome][bookofproofs$6445] `$BC$` has been found.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
