* Let `$AB$` be that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole, and `$CD$` a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let `$CE$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$CF$` as breadth.
* I say that `$CF$` is a [sixth apotome][bookofproofs$6446].

* For let `$BG$` be an attachment to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AG$` and `$GB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` [[Prop. 10.78]][bookofproofs$2172].
* Therefore, let `$CH$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$CK$` as breadth, and `$KL$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$`.
* Thus, the whole of `$CL$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$`.
* `$CL$` [is] thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$`, producing `$CM$` as breadth.
* Thus, `$CM$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* Therefore, since `$CL$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$`, of which `$CE$` (is) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, the remainder `$FL$` is thus equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$FL$` is also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FE$`, producing `$FM$` as breadth.
* `$FM$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`, and `$CL$` equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$`, and `$FL$` equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`, `$CL$` [is] thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FL$`.
* And as `$CL$` (is) to `$FL$`, so `$CM$` is to `$MF$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$CM$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$MF$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they are both [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$CM$` and `$MF$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$CF$` is thus an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [sixth (apotome) ][bookofproofs$6446].
* For since `$FL$` is equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`, let `$FM$` have been cut in half at `$N$`, and let `$NO$` have been drawn through `$N$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$FO$` and `$NL$` are each equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`.
* And since `$AG$` and `$GB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` is thus in[commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$GB$`.
* But, `$CH$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$`, and `$KL$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$`.
* Thus, `$CH$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KL$`.
* And as `$CH$` (is) to `$KL$`, so `$CK$` is to `$KM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$CK$` is [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KM$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to the (squares) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473], and `$CH$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$`, and `$KL$` equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$`, and `$NL$` equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`, `$NL$` is thus also [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$CH$` and `$KL$`.
* Thus, as `$CH$` is to `$NL$`, so `$NL$` (is) to `$KL$`.
* And for the same (reasons as the preceding propositions), the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CM$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$MF$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($CM$) [[Prop. 10.18]][bookofproofs$2112].
* And neither of them is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$CF$` is a [sixth apotome][bookofproofs$6446] [ [Def. 10.16] ][bookofproofs$6446].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
