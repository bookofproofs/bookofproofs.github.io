* For let the (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, as we said, be [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* And (let) `$CA$` (be) even.
* And let `$CA$` have been cut in half at `$D$`.

* So it is clear that the square (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$`, is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` [see previous lemma].
* Let the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$DE$` have been subtracted (from `$BD$`).
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`, is less than the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`.
* I say, therefore, that the square (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`, is not [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* For if it is [square][bookofproofs$2326], it is either equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$`, or less than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$`, but cannot any more be greater (than the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$`), lest the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] be divided.
* First of all, if possible, let the (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`, be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$`.
* And let `$GA$` be double the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$DE$`.
* Therefore, since the whole of `$AC$` is double the whole of `$CD$`, of which `$AG$` is double `$DE$`, the remainder `$GC$` is thus double the remainder `$EC$`.
* Thus, `$GC$` has been cut in half at `$E$`.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$GB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`, is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$` [[Prop. 2.6]][bookofproofs$1020].
* But, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`, was also assumed (to be) equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$`.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$GB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`, is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`.
* And subtracting the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$` from both, `$AB$` is inferred (to be) equal to `$GB$`.
* The very thing is [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`, is not equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$`.
* So I say that (it is) not less than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$` either.
* For, if possible, let it be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$`.
* And (let) `$HA$` (be) double `$DF$`.
* And it can again be inferred that `$HC$` (is) double `$CF$`.
* Hence, `$CH$` has also been cut in half at `$F$`.
* And, on account of this, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$HB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FC$`, becomes equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$` [[Prop. 2.6]][bookofproofs$1020].
* And the (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`, was also assumed (to be) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$`.
* Hence, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$HB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$`, will also be equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`.
* The very thing is [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`, is not equal to less than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$`.
* And it was shown that (is it) not equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$` either.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`, is not [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
