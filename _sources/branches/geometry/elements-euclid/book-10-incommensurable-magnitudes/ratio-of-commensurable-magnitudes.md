### Euclid's Formulation

> [Commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315].
* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes.
* I say that `$A$` has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315].
