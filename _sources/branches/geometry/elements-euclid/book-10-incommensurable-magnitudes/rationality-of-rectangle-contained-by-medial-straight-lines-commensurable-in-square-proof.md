* For let the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] `$AC$` be contained by the [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$BC$` (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* I say that `$AC$` is either [rational][bookofproofs$2083] or [medial][bookofproofs$2115].

* For let the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$AD$` and `$BE$` have been described on (the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BC$` (respectively).
* `$AD$` and `$BE$` are thus each [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FG$` be laid out.
* And let the rectangular [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$GH$`, equal to `$AD$`, have been applied to `$FG$`, producing `$FH$` as breadth.
* And let the rectangular [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$MK$`, equal to `$AC$`, have been applied to `$HM$`, producing `$HK$` as breadth.
* And, finally, let `$NL$`, equal to `$BE$`, have similarly been applied to `$KN$`, producing `$KL$` as breadth.
* Thus, `$FH$`, `$HK$`, and `$KL$` are in a [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* Therefore, since `$AD$` and `$BE$` are each [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and `$AD$` is equal to `$GH$`, and `$BE$` to `$NL$`, `$GH$` and `$NL$` (are) thus each also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And they are applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FG$`.
* `$FH$` and `$KL$` are thus each [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since `$AD$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BE$`, `$GH$` is thus also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$NL$`.
* And as `$GH$` is to `$NL$`, so `$FH$` (is) to `$KL$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$FH$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KL$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Thus, `$FH$` and `$KL$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$FH$` and `$KL$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.19]][bookofproofs$2113].
* And since `$DB$` is equal to `$BA$`, and `$OB$` to `$BC$`, thus as `$DB$` is to `$BC$`, so `$AB$` (is) to `$BO$`.
* But, as `$DB$` (is) to `$BC$`, so `$DA$` (is) to `$AC$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* And as `$AB$` (is) to `$BO$`, so `$AC$` (is) to `$CO$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, as `$DA$` is to `$AC$`, so `$AC$` (is) to `$CO$`.
* And `$AD$` is equal to `$GH$`, and `$AC$` to `$MK$`, and `$CO$` to `$NL$`.
* Thus, as `$GH$` is to `$MK$`, so `$MK$` (is) to `$NL$`.
* Thus, also, as `$FH$` is to `$HK$`, so `$HK$` (is) to `$KL$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$FH$` and `$KL$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HK$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$FH$` and `$KL$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HK$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$HK$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And if it is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` then `$HN$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.19]][bookofproofs$2113].
* And if it is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` then `$KH$` and `$HM$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only: thus, `$HN$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$HN$` is either [rational][bookofproofs$2083] or [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And `$HN$` (is) equal to `$AC$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` is either [rational][bookofproofs$2083] or [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, the ... by [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and so on ....
