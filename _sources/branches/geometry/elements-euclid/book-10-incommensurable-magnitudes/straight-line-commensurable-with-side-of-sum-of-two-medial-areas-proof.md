* Let `$AB$` be the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas), and (let) `$CD$` (be) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* We must show that `$CD$` is also the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).

* For since `$AB$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas), let it have been divided into its (component) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] at `$E$`.
* Thus, `$AE$` and `$EB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and, moreover, the sum of the (squares) on `$AE$` and `$EB$` [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AE$` and `$EB$` [[Prop. 10.41]][bookofproofs$2135].
* And let the same construction have been made as in the previous (propositions).
* So, similarly, we can show that `$CF$` and `$FD$` are also [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], and (that) the sum of the (squares) on `$AE$` and `$EB$` (is) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of the (squares) on `$CF$` and `$FD$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$`.
* Hence, the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` and `$FD$` is also [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and, moreover, the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` and `$FD$` (is) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$`.
* Thus, `$CD$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) [[Prop. 10.41]][bookofproofs$2135].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
