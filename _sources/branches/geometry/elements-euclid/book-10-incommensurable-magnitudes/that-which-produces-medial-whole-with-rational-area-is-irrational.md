### (Proposition 77 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with the whole, and with the whole makes the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], is subtracted from a(nother) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] then the remainder is an [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]). Let it be called that which makes with a [rational][bookofproofs$2084] (area) a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.
* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`, which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with `$AB$`, and fulfils the (other) prescribed (conditions), have been subtracted from the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.34]][bookofproofs$2128].
* I say that the remainder `$AC$` is the aforementioned [irrational][bookofproofs$2084] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation

Thus, **that which makes with a rational (area) a medial whole** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645], whose length is expressible as

`\[\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}+\rho}{2\,(1+\rho^2)}} -\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}-\rho}{2\,(1+\rho^2)}},\]` 
for some [positive rational number][bookofproofs$1076] `\(\rho\)`. See also  [[Prop. 10.40]][bookofproofs$2134].
