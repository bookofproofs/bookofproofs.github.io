### Euclid's Formulation

> If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with the whole, and with the whole makes the (squares) on them (added) together [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], is subtracted from a(nother) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] then the remainder is an [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]). Let it be called a **minor** ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`, which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with the whole, and fulfils the (other) prescribed (conditions), have been subtracted from the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.33]][bookofproofs$2127].
* I say that the remainder `$AC$` is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called **minor**.

### Modern Formulation

Thus, a **minor** [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has a length expressible as 
`\[\sqrt{\left(1+\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}}\right)\frac 12} - \sqrt{\left(1-\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}}\right)\frac 12}, \]`

for some [rational][bookofproofs$2083] number `\(\rho\)`. See also [[Prop. 10.39]][bookofproofs$2133].
