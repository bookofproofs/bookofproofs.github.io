* Let `$AB$` be a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and `$CD$` a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let `$CE$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$CF$` as breadth.
* I say that `$CF$` is a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092].

* For let `$BG$` be an attachment to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AG$` and `$GB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, containing a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) [[Prop. 10.74]][bookofproofs$2168].
* And let `$CH$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$CK$` as breadth, and `$KL$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$`, producing `$KM$` as breadth.
* Thus, the whole of `$CL$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$`.
* Thus, `$CL$` (is) also a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109], [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$`, producing `$CM$` as breadth.
* `$CM$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since `$CL$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$`, of which the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is equal to `$CE$`, the remainder, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`, is thus equal to `$FL$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` [is] [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$FL$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FE$`, producing `$FM$` as breadth.
* `$FM$` is thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* Therefore, since the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` - that is to say, `$CL$` - is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` - that is to say, `$FL$` - (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083], `$CL$` is thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FL$`.
* And as `$CL$` (is) to `$FL$`, so `$CM$` is to `$FM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$CM$` (is) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FM$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they are both [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$CM$` and `$MF$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$CF$` is thus an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [second (apotome) ][bookofproofs$2092].
* For let `$FM$` have been cut in half at `$N$`.
* And let `$NO$` have been drawn through ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$N$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$FO$` and `$NL$` are each equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`.
* And since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` and `$GB$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473], and the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` is equal to `$CH$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` to `$NL$`, and the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` to `$KL$`, `$NL$` is thus also [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$CH$` and `$KL$`.
* Thus, as `$CH$` is to `$NL$`, so `$NL$` (is) to `$KL$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* But, as `$CH$` (is) to `$NL$`, so `$CK$` is to `$NM$`, and as `$NL$` (is) to `$KL$`, so `$NM$` is to `$MK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, as `$CK$` (is) to `$NM$`, so `$NM$` is to `$KM$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* The ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CK$` and `$KM$` is thus equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$NM$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003] - that is to say, to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FM$` [and since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$BG$`, `$CH$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KL$` - that is to say, `$CK$` with `$KM$`].
* Therefore, since `$CM$` and `$MF$` are two unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CK$` and `$KM$`, equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MF$`, has been applied to the greater `$CM$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, and divides it into [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (parts), the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CM$` is thus greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$MF$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($CM$) [[Prop. 10.17]][bookofproofs$2111].
* The attachment `$FM$` is also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$`.
* `$CF$` is thus a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] [ [Def. 10.16] ][bookofproofs$6446].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] as breadth.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
