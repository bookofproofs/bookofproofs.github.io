* Let `$A$` be the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* So it is required to find two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$A$`, the one [ (incommensurable) in length][bookofproofs$1095] only, the other also [ (incommensurable) in square][bookofproofs$2082].

* For let two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$B$` and `$C$`, not having to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] - that is to say, not (being) [similar plane (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329] - have been taken.
* And let it be contrived that as `$B$` (is) to `$C$`, so the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (is) to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$`.
* For we learned (how to do this) [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (is) [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$D$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And since `$B$` does not have to `$C$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` thus does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$A$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$D$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Let the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$E$` (which is) in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$A$` and `$D$` have been taken [[Prop. 6.13]][bookofproofs$1999].
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$D$`, so the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` [ [Def. 5.9] ][bookofproofs$1948].
* And `$A$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$D$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is also incommensurble with the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Thus, `$A$` is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with `$E$`.
* Thus, two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$D$` and `$E$`, (which are) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$A$`, have been found, the one, `$D$`, [ (incommensurable) in length][bookofproofs$1095] only, the other, `$E$`, [ (incommensurable) in square][bookofproofs$2082], and, clearly, also [in length][bookofproofs$1095].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
