### (Proposition 40 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] contained) by them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], are added together then the whole [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is irrational - let it be called the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$` and `$BC$`, [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], (and) fulfilling the prescribed (conditions), be laid down together [[Prop. 10.34]][bookofproofs$2128].
* I say that `$AC$` is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083].

### Modern Formulation

Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] has a length expressible as `\[\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}+\rho}{2\,(1+\rho^2)}} +\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}-\rho}{2\,(1+\rho^2)}},\]`

for some [positive rational number][bookofproofs$1076] `\(\rho\)`. 

### Notes

This and the corresponding irrational with a minus sign[^1] whose length is expressible as 

`\[\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}+\rho}{2\,(1+\rho^2)}} -\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}-\rho}{2\,(1+\rho^2)}},\]` 

(see [Prop. 10.77][bookofproofs$2171]), are the positive roots of the quartic `\[x^4-\frac 2{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}}x^2+ \frac{\rho^2}{(1+\rho^2)^2} = 0.\]`

[^1]: which Euclid calls "that which makes with a rational (area) a medial whole" (see [Prop. 10.77][bookofproofs$2171]).
