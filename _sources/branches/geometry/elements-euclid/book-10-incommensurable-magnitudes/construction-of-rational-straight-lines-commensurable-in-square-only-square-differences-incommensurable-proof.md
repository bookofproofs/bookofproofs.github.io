* Let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` be laid out, and the two [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326], `$CE$` and `$ED$`, such that the sum of them, `$CD$`, is not [square][bookofproofs$2326] [ [Prop. 10.28 lem. II] ][bookofproofs$6475].
* And let the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$AFB$` have been drawn on `$AB$`.
* And let it be contrived that as `$DC$` (is) to `$CE$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* And let `$FB$` have been joined.
* So, similarly to the (proposition) before this, we can show that `$BA$` and `$AF$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* And since as `$DC$` is to `$CE$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$`, thus, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], as `$CD$` (is) to `$DE$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$` [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2, [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911], [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And `$CD$` does not have to `$DE$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] has to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$AB$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BF$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is greater than the (square on) `$AF$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FB$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968], (which is) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AB$).
* Thus, `$AB$` and `$AF$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$AF$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FB$`, (which is) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$(AB)$`.[^1] 
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: `$AB$` and `$AF$` have lengths `$1$` and `$1/\sqrt{1+k^2}$` times that of `$AB$`, respectively, where `$k=\sqrt{DE/CE}$` (translator's note)
