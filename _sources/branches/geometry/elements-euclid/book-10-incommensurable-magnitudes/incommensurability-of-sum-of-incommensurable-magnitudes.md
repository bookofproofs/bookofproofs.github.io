### (Proposition 16 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes are added together then the whole will also be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with each of them. And if the whole is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with one of them then the original magnitudes will also be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (with one another).

* For let the two [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes `$AB$` and `$BC$` be laid down together.
* I say that the whole `$AC$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* And so let `$AC$` be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with one of `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* I say that `$AB$` and `$BC$` are also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
