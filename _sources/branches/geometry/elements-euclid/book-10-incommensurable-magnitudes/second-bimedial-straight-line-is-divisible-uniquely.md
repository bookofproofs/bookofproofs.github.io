### (Proposition 44 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) can be divided (into its component terms) at one [point][bookofproofs$631] only.
* Let `$AB$` be a [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which has been divided at `$C$`, so that `$AC$` and `$BC$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, (and) containing a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] [[Prop. 10.38]][bookofproofs$2132].
* So, (it is) clear that `$C$` is not (located) at the [point][bookofproofs$631] of bisection, since ($AC$ and `$BC$`) are not [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095].
* I say that `$AB$` cannot be (so) divided at another [point][bookofproofs$631].

### Modern Formulation

In other words, 

`\[\alpha^{1/4}+\frac{\beta^{1/2}}{\alpha^{1/4}} = \gamma^{1/4}+\frac{\delta^{1/2}}{\gamma^{1/4}}\]` has only one solution: i.e., `\[\gamma=\alpha\quad\text{ and }\quad \delta=\beta,\]`
 where `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

This proposition corresponds to [[Prop. 10.81]][bookofproofs$2175], with plus signs instead of minus signs.
