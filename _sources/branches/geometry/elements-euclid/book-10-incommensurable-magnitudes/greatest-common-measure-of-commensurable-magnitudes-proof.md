* Let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be the two given magnitudes, of which (let) `$AB$` (be) the lesser.
* So, it is required to find the greatest common measure of `$AB$` and `$CD$`.

* For the magnitude `$AB$` either measures, or (does) not (measure), `$CD$`.
* Therefore, if it measures ($CD$), and (since) it also measures itself, `$AB$` is thus a common measure of `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* And (it is) clear that (it is) also (the) greatest.
* For a (magnitude) greater than magnitude `$AB$` cannot measure `$AB$`.
* So let `$AB$` not measure `$CD$`.
* And continually subtracting in turn the lesser (magnitude) from the greater, the remaining (magnitude) will (at) some time measure the (magnitude) before it, on account of `$AB$` and `$CD$` not being [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [[Prop. 10.2]][bookofproofs$2096].
* And let `$AB$` leave `$EC$` less than itself (in) measuring `$ED$`, and let `$EC$` leave `$AF$` less than itself (in) measuring `$FB$`, and let `$AF$` measure `$CE$`.
* Therefore, since `$AF$` measures `$CE$`, but `$CE$` measures `$FB$`, `$AF$` will thus also measure `$FB$`.
* And it also measures itself.
* Thus, `$AF$` will also measure the whole (of) `$AB$`.
* But, `$AB$` measures `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$AF$` will also measure `$ED$`.
* And it also measures `$CE$`.
* Thus, it also measures the whole of `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$AF$` is a common measure of `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* So I say that (it is) also (the) greatest (common measure).
* For, if not, there will be some magnitude, greater than `$AF$`, which will measure (both) `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* Let it be `$G$`.
* Therefore, since `$G$` measures `$AB$`, but `$AB$` measures `$ED$`, `$G$` will thus also measure `$ED$`.
* And it also measures the whole of `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$G$` will also measure the remainder `$CE$`.
* But `$CE$` measures `$FB$`.
* Thus, `$G$` will also measure `$FB$`.
* And it also measures the whole (of) `$AB$`.
* And (so) it will measure the remainder `$AF$`, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, some magnitude greater than `$AF$` cannot measure (both) `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$AF$` is the greatest common measure of `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* Thus, the greatest common measure of two given [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes, `$AB$` and `$CD$`, has been found.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
