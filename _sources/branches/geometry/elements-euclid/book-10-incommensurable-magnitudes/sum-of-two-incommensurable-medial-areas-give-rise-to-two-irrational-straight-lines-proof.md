* For let the two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) `$AB$` and `$CD$`, (which are) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with one another, have been added together.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AD$` is either a [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132], or the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).

* For `$AB$` is either greater than or less than `$CD$`.
* By chance, let `$AB$`, first of all, be greater than `$CD$`.
* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$` be laid down.
* And let `$EG$`, equal to `$AB$`, have been applied to `$EF$`, producing `$EH$` as breadth, and `$HI$`, equal to `$CD$`, producing `$HK$` as breadth.
* And since `$AB$` and `$CD$` are each [medial][bookofproofs$2115], `$EG$` and `$HI$` (are) thus also each [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And they are applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$FE$`, producing `$EH$` and `$HK$` (respectively) as breadth.
* Thus, `$EH$` and `$HK$` are each [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since `$AB$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$`, and `$AB$` is equal to `$EG$`, and `$CD$` to `$HI$`, `$EG$` is thus also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$HI$`.
* And as `$EG$` (is) to `$HI$`, so `$EH$` is to `$HK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* `$EH$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$HK$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Thus, `$EH$` and `$HK$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$EK$` is thus a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EH$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$HK$` either by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($EH$), or by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (in length with `$EH$`).
* Let it, first of all, be greater by the [square][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($EH$).
* And neither of `$EH$` or `$HK$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`.
* Thus, `$EK$` is a [third binomial][bookofproofs$2087] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.7] ][bookofproofs$2087].
* And `$EF$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And if an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [third binomial][bookofproofs$2087] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is a [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.56]][bookofproofs$2150].
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$EI$` - that is to say, of `$AD$` - is a [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132].
* And so, let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EH$` be greater than (the square) on `$HK$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($EH$).
* And `$EH$` and `$HK$` are each [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$`.
* Thus, `$EK$` is a [sixth binomial][bookofproofs$2090] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.10] ][bookofproofs$2090].
* And if an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [sixth binomial][bookofproofs$2090] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) [[Prop. 10.59]][bookofproofs$2153].
* Hence, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AD$` is also the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).
* So, similarly, we can show that, even if `$AB$` is less than `$CD$`, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AD$` is either a [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132] or the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).
* Thus, when two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas which are) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with one another are added together, the remaining two [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) arise (as the [square root][bookofproofs$46]s of the total area) - either a [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132], or the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).
* A [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and the (other) [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) after it, are neither the same as a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) nor (the same) as one another.
* For the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with (the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) to which it is applied [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] [[Prop. 10.60]][bookofproofs$2154].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] [[Prop. 10.61]][bookofproofs$2155].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [third binomial][bookofproofs$2087] [[Prop. 10.62]][bookofproofs$2156].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] [[Prop. 10.63]][bookofproofs$2157].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] [[Prop. 10.64]][bookofproofs$2158].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [sixth binomial][bookofproofs$2090] [[Prop. 10.65]][bookofproofs$2159].
* And the aforementioned breadths differ from the first (breadth), and from one another - from the first, because it is [rational][bookofproofs$2083] - and from one another, because they are not the same in order.[^1]
* Hence, the (previously mentioned) [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) themselves also differ from one another.

[^1]: Euclid's expression "(not) being the same in order" means that the resulting irrational number is "(not) of the same kind" as that irrational number, with which it is commensurable.
