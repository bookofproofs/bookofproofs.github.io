### (Proposition 85 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091].
* Let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$` be laid down.
* And let `$BG$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$A$`.
* `$BG$` is thus also a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let two [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326] `$DE$` and `$EF$` be laid down, and let their difference `$FD$` be not square [ [Prop. 10.28 lem. I] ][bookofproofs$6474].
* Thus, `$ED$` does not have to `$DF$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* And let it have been contrived that as `$ED$` (is) to `$DF$`, so the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` (is) to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$GC$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$GC$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since `$ED$` does not have to `$DF$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` thus does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$BG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GC$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And they are both [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$BG$` and `$GC$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$BC$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [first (apotome][bookofproofs$2091]).

### Modern Formulation

This proposition proves that the [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] has length 
`\[\alpha-\alpha\,\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}},\]`

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
