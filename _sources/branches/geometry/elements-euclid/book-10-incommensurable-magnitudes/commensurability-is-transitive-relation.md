### Euclid's Formulation

> (Magnitudes) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the same magnitude are also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with one another.
* For let `$A$` and `$B$` each be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$C$`.
* I say that `$A$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.
