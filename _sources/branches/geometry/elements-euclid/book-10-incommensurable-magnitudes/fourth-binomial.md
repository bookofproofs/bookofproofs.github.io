> So, again, if the square on the greater term is larger than (the square on) [the lesser] by the (square) on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with (the greater) then, if the greater term is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] previously) laid out, let (the whole [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) be called a **fourth binomial** ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation

The **fourth binomial** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is `\[\alpha+\frac \alpha{\sqrt{1+\beta}},\]` 

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
