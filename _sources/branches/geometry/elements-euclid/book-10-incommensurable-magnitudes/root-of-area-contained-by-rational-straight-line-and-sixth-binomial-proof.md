* For let the area `$ABCD$` be contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and the [sixth binomial][bookofproofs$2090] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`, which has been divided into its (component) terms at `$E$`, such that `$AE$` is the greater term.
* So, I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$AC$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).

* For let the same construction be made as that shown previously.
* So, (it is) clear that `$MO$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$AC$`, and that `$MN$` is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with `$NO$`.
* And since `$EA$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$` [ [Def. 10.10] ][bookofproofs$2090], `$EA$` and `$AB$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$AK$` - that is to say, the sum of the (squares) on `$MN$` and `$NO$` - is [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Again, since `$ED$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$` [ [Def. 10.10] ][bookofproofs$2090], `$FE$` is thus also [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EK$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Thus, `$FE$` and `$EK$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$EL$` - that is to say, `$MR$` - that is to say, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$MNO$` - is [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* And since `$AE$` is [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$`, `$AK$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EL$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* But, `$AK$` is the sum of the (squares) on `$MN$` and `$NO$`, and `$EL$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$MNO$`.
* Thus, the sum of the (squares) on `$MNO$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$MNO$`.
* And each of them is [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And `$MN$` and `$NO$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082].
* Thus, `$MO$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) [[Prop. 10.41]][bookofproofs$2135].
* And (it is) the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$AC$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
