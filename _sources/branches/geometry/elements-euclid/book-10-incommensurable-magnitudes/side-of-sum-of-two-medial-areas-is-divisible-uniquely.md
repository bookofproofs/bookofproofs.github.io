### (Proposition 47 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> The [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) can be divided (into its component terms) at one [point][bookofproofs$631] only.
* Let `$AB$` be [the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas)] which has been divided at `$C$`, such that `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and, moreover, [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of the (squares) on ($AC$ and `$CB$`) [[Prop. 10.41]][bookofproofs$2135].
* I say that `$AB$` cannot be divided at another [point][bookofproofs$631] fulfilling the prescribed (conditions).

### Modern Formulation

In other words, `\[\beta^{1/4}\sqrt{\frac{1+\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}}+\beta^{1/4}\sqrt{\frac{1-\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}}=\gamma^{1/4}\sqrt{\frac{1+\delta}{2\sqrt{1+\delta^2}}} + \gamma^{1/4}\sqrt{\frac{1-\delta}{2\sqrt{1+\delta^2}}}\]` has only one solution: i.e., `\[\delta=\alpha\quad\text{ and }\quad\gamma=\beta,\]`

where `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

This proposition corresponds to [[Prop. 10.84]][bookofproofs$2178], with plus signs instead of minus signs.
