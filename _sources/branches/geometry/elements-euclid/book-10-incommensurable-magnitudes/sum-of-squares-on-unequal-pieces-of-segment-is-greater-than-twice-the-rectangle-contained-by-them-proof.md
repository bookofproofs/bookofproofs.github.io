* Let `$AB$` be a [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and let it have been cut unequally at `$C$`, and let `$AC$` be greater (than `$CB$`).
* I say that (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is greater than twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.

* For let `$AB$` have been cut in half at `$D$`.
* Therefore, since a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has been cut into equal (parts) at `$D$`, and into unequal (parts) at `$C$`, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$`, is thus equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` [[Prop. 2.5]][bookofproofs$1019].
* Hence, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` is less than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$`.
* Thus, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` is less than double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$`.
* But, (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` [is] double (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DC$` [[Prop. 2.9]][bookofproofs$1023].
* Thus, (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is greater than twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
