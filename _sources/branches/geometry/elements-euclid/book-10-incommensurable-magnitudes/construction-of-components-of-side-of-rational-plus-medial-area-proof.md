* Let the two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, be laid out having the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], (and) such that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$BC$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AB$) [[Prop. 10.31]][bookofproofs$2125].
* And let the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$ADB$` have been drawn on `$AB$`.
* And let `$BC$` have been cut in half at `$E$`.
* And let a (rectangular) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$`, (and) falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, have been applied to `$AB$`, (and let it be) the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by) `$AFB$` [[Prop. 6.28]][bookofproofs$2014].
* Thus, `$AF$` [is] [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FB$` [[Prop. 10.18]][bookofproofs$2112].
* And let `$FD$` have been drawn from `$F$` at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$`.
* And let `$AD$` and `$DB$` have been joined.
* Since `$AF$` is [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FB$`, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BA$` and `$AF$` is thus also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BF$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BA$` and `$AF$` (is) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BF$` to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DB$` [ [Prop. 10.32 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6476].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` is also in[commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$DB$`.
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], the sum of the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` (is) thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911], [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And since `$BC$` is double `$DF$` [see previous proposition], the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) thus also double the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$FD$`.
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$FD$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100], [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$FD$` (is) equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` [ [Prop. 10.32 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6476].
* And hence the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AD$` and `$DB$`, (which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], have been found, making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [rational][bookofproofs$2083].[^1] 
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: `$AD$` and `$DB$` have lengths `$\sqrt{[(1+k^2)^{1/2}+k]/[2\,(1+k^2)]}$` and `$\sqrt{[(1+k^2)^{1/2}-k]/[2\,(1+k^2)]}$` times that of `$AB$`, respectively, where `$k$` is defined in the footnote to [[Prop. 10.29]][bookofproofs$2123] (translator's note).
