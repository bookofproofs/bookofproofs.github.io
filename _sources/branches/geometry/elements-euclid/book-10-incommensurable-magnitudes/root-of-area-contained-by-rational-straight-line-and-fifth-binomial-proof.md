* For let the area `$AC$` be contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and the [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`, which has been divided into its (component) terms at `$E$`, such that `$AE$` is the greater term.
* So I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AC$` is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].

* For let the same construction be made as that shown previously.
* So, (it is) clear that `$MO$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AC$`.
* So, we must show that `$MO$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* For since `$AG$` is [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GE$` [[Prop. 10.18]][bookofproofs$2112], `$AH$` is thus also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$HE$` - that is to say, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MN$` with the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$NO$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Thus, `$MN$` and `$NO$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082].
* And since `$AD$` is a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and `$ED$` [is] its lesser segment, `$ED$` (is) thus [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$` [ [Def. 10.9] ][bookofproofs$2089].
* But, `$AE$` is [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$ED$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` is also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AE$` [$BA$ and `$AE$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only] [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Thus, `$AK$` - that is to say, the sum of the (squares) on `$MN$` and `$NO$` - is [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* And since `$DE$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$` - that is to say, with `$EK$` - but, `$DE$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$`, `$EF$` is thus also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EK$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And `$EK$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$EL$` - that is to say, `$MR$` - that is to say, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$MNO$` - (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.19]][bookofproofs$2113].
* `$MN$` and `$NO$` are thus ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$MO$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] [[Prop. 10.40]][bookofproofs$2134].
* And (it is) the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AC$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
