* For let `$A$` and `$B$` each be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$C$`.
* I say that `$A$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.

* For since `$A$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$C$`, `$A$` thus has to `$C$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] [[Prop. 10.5]][bookofproofs$2099].
* Let it have (the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943]) which `$D$` (has) to `$E$`.
* Again, since `$C$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`, `$C$` thus has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] [[Prop. 10.5]][bookofproofs$2099].
* Let it have (the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943]) which `$F$` (has) to `$G$`.
* And for any multitude whatsoever of given [ratio][bookofproofs$1943]s - (namely,) those which `$D$` has to `$E$`, and `$F$` to `$G$` - let the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$H$`, `$K$`, `$L$` (which are) continuously ([proportional][bookofproofs$2328]) in the(se) given [ratio][bookofproofs$1943]s have been taken [[Prop. 8.4]][bookofproofs$2023].
* Hence, as `$D$` is to `$E$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$K$`, and as `$F$` (is) to `$G$`, so `$K$` (is) to `$L$`.
* Therefore, since as `$A$` is to `$C$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, but as `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$K$`, thus also as `$A$` is to `$C$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$K$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Again, since as `$C$` is to `$B$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$G$`, but as `$F$` (is) to `$G$`, [so] `$K$` (is) to `$L$`, thus also as `$C$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$K$` (is) to `$L$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* And also as `$A$` is to `$C$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$K$`.
* Thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$L$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* Thus, `$A$` has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$H$` (has) to the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$L$`.
* Thus, `$A$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* Thus, (magnitudes) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the same magnitude are also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
