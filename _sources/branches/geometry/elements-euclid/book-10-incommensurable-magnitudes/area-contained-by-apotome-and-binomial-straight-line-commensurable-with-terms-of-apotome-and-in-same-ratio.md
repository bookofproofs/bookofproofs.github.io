### Euclid's Formulation

> If an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], and a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] whose terms are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with, and in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as, the terms of the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* For let an area, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$CD$`, have been contained by the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] `$AB$`, and the [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] `$CD$`, of which let the greater term be `$CE$`.
* And let the terms of the [binomial][bookofproofs$2130], `$CE$` and `$ED$`, be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the terms of the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], `$AF$` and `$FB$` (respectively), and in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945].
* And let the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$CD$` be `$G$`.
* I say that `$G$` is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
