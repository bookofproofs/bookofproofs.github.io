* Let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$`, and `$GC$` (which is) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$A$`, be laid down.
* Thus, `$GC$` is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let the two [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326] `$DE$` and `$EF$` be laid down, and let their difference `$DF$` be not square [ [Prop. 10.28 lem. I] ][bookofproofs$6474].
* And let it have been contrived that as `$FD$` (is) to `$DE$`, so the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CG$` (is) to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CG$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CG$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$` [is] also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$BG$` is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And since the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], `$CG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GB$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And they are both [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$CG$` and `$GB$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$BC$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* So, I say that it is also a [second (apotome) ][bookofproofs$2092].

* For let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$` be that (area) by which the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$` [ [Prop. 10.13 lem.] ][bookofproofs$2371].
* Therefore, since as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$`, so the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$ED$` (is) to the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$DF$`, thus, also, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$`, so `$DE$` (is) to `$EF$` [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2.
* And `$DE$` and `$EF$` are each square ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]).
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` has to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, `$BG$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$H$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GC$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GC$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BG$).
* And the attachment `$CG$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the (prevously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$`.
* Thus, `$BC$` is a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] [ [Def. 10.12] ][bookofproofs$2092].
* Thus, the [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] `$BC$` has been found.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
