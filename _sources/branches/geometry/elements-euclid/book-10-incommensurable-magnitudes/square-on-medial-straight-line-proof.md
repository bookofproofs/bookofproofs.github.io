* Let `$A$` be a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and `$CB$` a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and let the rectangular area `$BD$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`, have been applied to `$BC$`, producing `$CD$` as breadth.
* I say that `$CD$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CB$`.

* For since `$A$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], the [square][bookofproofs$909] on it is equal to a (rectangular) area [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on ($A$) be equal to `$GF$`.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on ($A$) is also equal to `$BD$`.
* Thus, `$BD$` is equal to `$GF$`.
* And ($BD$) is also equiangular with ($GF$).
* And for equal and equiangular [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909], the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [[Prop. 6.14]][bookofproofs$2000].
* Thus, proportionally, as `$BC$` is to `$EG$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$CD$`.
* And, also, as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` [[Prop. 6.22]][bookofproofs$2008].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$EG$`.
* For they are each [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` is also [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* Thus, `$CD$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since `$EF$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EG$`.
* For they are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* And as `$EF$` (is) to `$EG$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$FE$` and `$EG$` [see previous lemma].
* The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` [is] thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$FE$` and `$EG$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* But, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$EF$`.
* For they are [rational in square][bookofproofs$2084].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DC$` and `$CB$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$FE$` and `$EG$`.
* For they are (both) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DC$` and `$CB$`, so `$DC$` is to `$CB$` [see previous lemma].
* Thus, `$DC$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CB$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Thus, `$CD$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
