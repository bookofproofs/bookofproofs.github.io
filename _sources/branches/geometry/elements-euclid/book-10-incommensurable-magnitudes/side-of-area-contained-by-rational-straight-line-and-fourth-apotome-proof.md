* For let the area `$AB$` have been contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$` and the [fourth apotome][bookofproofs$2094] `$AD$`.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$` is a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For let `$DG$` be an attachment to `$AD$`.
* Thus, `$AG$` and `$DG$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167], and `$AG$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$`, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the whole, `$AG$`, is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the attachment, `$DG$`, by the [square][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AG$) [ [Def. 10.14] ][bookofproofs$2094].
* Therefore, since the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GD$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AG$), thus if (some area), equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DG$`, is applied to `$AG$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, then it divides ($AG$) into (parts which are) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] [[Prop. 10.18]][bookofproofs$2112].
* Therefore, let `$DG$` have been cut in half at `$E$`, and let (some area), equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$`, have been applied to `$AG$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, and let it be the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AF$` and `$FG$`.
* Thus, `$AF$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$`.
* Therefore, let `$EH$`, `$FI$`, and `$GK$` have been drawn through `$E$`, `$F$`, and `$G$` (respectively), [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AC$` and `$BD$`.
* Therefore, since `$AG$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$`, the whole (area) `$AK$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.19]][bookofproofs$2113].
* Again, since `$DG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$`, and both are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$DK$` is thus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Again, since `$AF$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$`, `$AI$` (is) thus also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Therefore, let the square `$LM$`, equal to `$AI$`, have been constructed.
* And let `$NO$`, equal to `$FK$`, (and) about the same angle, `$LPM$`, have been subtracted (from `$LM$`).
* Thus, the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$LM$` and `$NO$` are about the same diagonal [[Prop. 6.26]][bookofproofs$2012].
* Let `$PR$` be their (common) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn.
* Therefore, since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AF$` and `$FG$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$`, thus, proportionally, as `$AF$` is to `$EG$`, so `$EG$` (is) to `$FG$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* But, as `$AF$` (is) to `$EG$`, so `$AI$` is to `$EK$`, and as `$EG$` (is) to `$FG$`, so `$EK$` is to `$FK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$EK$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$AI$` and `$FK$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* And `$MN$` is also [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$LM$` and `$NO$` [ [Prop. 10.13 lem.] ][bookofproofs$2371], and `$AI$` is equal to `$LM$`, and `$FK$` to `$NO$`.
* `$EK$` is thus also equal to `$MN$`.
* But, `$DH$` is equal to `$EK$`, and `$LO$` is equal to `$MN$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959].
* Thus, the whole of `$DK$` is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$UVW$` and `$NO$`.
* Therefore, since the whole of `$AK$` is equal to the (sum of the) squares `$LM$` and `$NO$`, of which `$DK$` is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$UVW$` and the square `$NO$`, the remainder `$AB$` is thus equal to `$ST$` - that is to say, to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$LN$`.
* Thus, `$LN$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$`.
* I say that `$LN$` is the [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [minor][bookofproofs$2170].
* For since `$AK$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and is equal to the (sum of the) squares `$LP$` and `$PN$`, the sum of the (squares) on `$LP$` and `$PN$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Again, since `$DK$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and `$DK$` is equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$LP$` and `$PN$`, thus twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$LP$` and `$PN$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And since `$AI$` was shown (to be) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FK$`, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$LP$` (is) thus also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$PN$`.
* Thus, `$LP$` and `$PN$` are ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* `$LN$` is thus the [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called [minor][bookofproofs$2170] [[Prop. 10.76]][bookofproofs$2170].
* And it is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$`.
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$` is a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
