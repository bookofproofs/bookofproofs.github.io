* Let three [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$A$`, `$B$` and `$C$`, [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, be laid out such that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$`) by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($A$) [[Prop. 10.29]][bookofproofs$2123].
* And let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$` be equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$D$` is also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* And let the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$D$` and `$E$` be equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$B$` and `$C$`.
* And since as the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$B$` is to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$B$` and `$C$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$C$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473], but the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$B$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$D$` and `$E$` to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$B$` and `$C$`, thus as `$A$` is to `$C$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$D$` and `$E$`.
* And as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$D$` and `$E$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473].
* And thus as `$A$` (is) to `$C$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$`.
* And `$A$` (is) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] [only] with `$C$`.
* Thus, `$D$` (is) also [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with `$E$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$D$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$E$` (is) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.23]][bookofproofs$2117].
* And since as `$A$` is to `$C$`, (so) `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$C$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($A$), the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$` will thus also be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$E$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($D$) [[Prop. 10.14]][bookofproofs$2108].
* So, I also say that the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$D$` and `$E$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* For since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$B$` and `$C$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$D$` and `$E$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$B$` and `$C$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [for `$B$` and `$C$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115], the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$D$` and `$E$` (is) thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$D$` and `$E$`, [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, (and) containing a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], have been found such that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater is larger than the ([square][bookofproofs$909] on the) lesser by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the greater.[^1]
* So, similarly, (the proposition) can again also be demonstrated for (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (in length with the greater), provided that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$C$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($A$)[^2] [[Prop. 10.30]][bookofproofs$2124].
[^1]: `$D$` and `$E$` have lengths `$k'^{1/4}$` and `$k'^{1/4}\sqrt{1-k^2}$` times that of `$A$`, respectively, where the length of `$B$` is `$k'^{1/2}$` times that of `$A$`, and `$k$` is defined in the footnote to [[Prop. 10.29]][bookofproofs$2123] (translator's note).

[^2]: `$D$` and `$E$` would have lengths `$k'^{1/4}$` and `$k'^{1/4}/\sqrt{1+k^2}$` times that of `$A$`, respectively, where the length of `$B$` is `$k'^{1/2}$` times that of `$A$`, and `$k$` is defined in the footnote to [[Prop. 10.30]][bookofproofs$2124] (translator's note).
