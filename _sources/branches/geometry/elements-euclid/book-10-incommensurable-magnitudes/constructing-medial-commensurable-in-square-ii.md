### (Proposition 32 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, (and) containing a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (area), such that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater is larger than the ([square][bookofproofs$909] on the) lesser by the (square) on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the greater.
