* For let the area `$AB$` have been contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$` and the [third apotome][bookofproofs$2093] `$AD$`.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$` is the [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For let `$DG$` be an attachment to `$AD$`.
* Thus, `$AG$` and `$GD$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167], and neither of `$AG$` and `$GD$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$`, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the whole, `$AG$`, is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the attachment, `$DG$`, by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AG$) [ [Def. 10.13] ][bookofproofs$2093].
* Therefore, since the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GD$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AG$), thus if (an area) equal to the fourth part of the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DG$` is applied to `$AG$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, then it divides ($AG$) into (parts which are) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] [[Prop. 10.17]][bookofproofs$2111].
* Therefore, let `$DG$` have been cut in half at `$E$`.
* And let (an area) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` have been applied to `$AG$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure.
* And let it be the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AF$` and `$FG$`.
* And let `$EH$`, `$FI$`, and `$GK$` have been drawn through [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, `$F$`, and `$G$` (respectively), [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AC$`.
* Thus, `$AF$` and `$FG$` are [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095].
* `$AI$` (is) thus also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And since `$AF$` and `$FG$` are [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095], `$AG$` is thus also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$AF$` and `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* And `$AG$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$`.
* Hence, `$AF$` and `$FG$` (are) also ([rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$`) [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Thus, `$AI$` and `$FK$` are each [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Again, since `$DE$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EG$`, `$DG$` is also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$DE$` and `$EG$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* And `$GD$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$`.
* Thus, `$DE$` and `$EG$` (are) each also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* `$DH$` and `$EK$` are thus each [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* And since `$AG$` and `$GD$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, `$AG$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GD$`.
* But, `$AG$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AF$`, and `$DG$` with `$EG$`.
* Thus, `$AF$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EG$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And as `$AF$` (is) to `$EG$`, so `$AI$` is to `$EK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$AI$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EK$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Therefore, let the square `$LM$`, equal to `$AI$`, have been constructed.
* And let `$NO$`, equal to `$FK$`, which is about the same angle as `$LM$`, have been subtracted (from `$LM$`).
* Thus, `$LM$` and `$NO$` are about the same diagonal [[Prop. 6.26]][bookofproofs$2012].
* Let `$PR$` be their (common) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn.
* Therefore, since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AF$` and `$FG$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$`, thus as `$AF$` is to `$EG$`, so `$EG$` (is) to `$FG$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* But, as `$AF$` (is) to `$EG$`, so `$AI$` is to `$EK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* And as `$EG$` (is) to `$FG$`, so `$EK$` is to `$FK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* And thus as `$AI$` (is) to `$EK$`, so `$EK$` (is) to `$FK$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, `$EK$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$AI$` and `$FK$`.
* And `$MN$` is also [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$LM$` and `$NO$` [ [Prop. 10.53 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6478].
* And `$AI$` is equal to `$LM$`, and `$FK$` to `$NO$`.
* Thus, `$EK$` is also equal to `$MN$`.
* But, `$MN$` is equal to `$LO$`, and `$EK$` [is] equal to `$DH$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959].
* And thus the whole of `$DK$` is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$UVW$` and `$NO$`.
* And `$AK$` (is) also equal to `$LM$` and `$NO$`.
* Thus, the remainder `$AB$` is equal to `$ST$` - that is to say, to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$LN$`.
* Thus, `$LN$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$`.
* I say that `$LN$` is the [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* For since `$AI$` and `$FK$` were shown (to be) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas), and are equal to the (squares) on `$LP$` and `$PN$` (respectively), the (squares) on each of `$LP$` and `$PN$` (are) thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$LP$` and `$PN$` (are) each [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* And since `$AI$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LP$` (is) thus also [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$PN$`.
* Again, since `$AI$` was shown (to be) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EK$`, `$LM$` is thus also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$MN$` - that is to say, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LP$` with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$LP$` and `$PN$`.
* Hence, `$LP$` is also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$PN$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Thus, `$LP$` and `$PN$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* So, I say that they also contain a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* For since `$EK$` was shown (to be) a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], and is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$LP$` and `$PN$`, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$LP$` and `$PN$` is thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Hence, `$LP$` and `$PN$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and which contain a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* Thus, `$LN$` is the [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.75]][bookofproofs$2169].
* And it is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$`.
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$` is the [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
