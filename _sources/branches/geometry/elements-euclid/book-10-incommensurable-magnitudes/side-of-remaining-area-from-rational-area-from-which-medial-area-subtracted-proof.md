* For let the [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] `$BD$` have been subtracted from the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) `$BC$`.
* I say that one of two [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) arise (as) the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the remaining (area), `$EC$` - either an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], or a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FG$` have been laid out, and let the right-angled [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$GH$`, equal to `$BC$`, have been applied to `$FG$`, and let `$GK$`, equal to `$DB$`, have been subtracted (from `$GH$`).
* Thus, the remainder `$EC$` is equal to `$LH$`.
* Therefore, since `$BC$` is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area), and `$BD$` a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], and `$BC$` (is) equal to `$GH$`, and `$BD$` to `$GK$`, `$GH$` is thus a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area), and `$GK$` a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* And they are applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FG$`.
* Thus, `$FH$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114], and `$FK$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* Thus, `$FH$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FK$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* `$FH$` and `$FK$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$KH$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167], and `$KF$` an attachment to it.
* So, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$HF$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FK$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) either [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095], or not ([commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), (in length with `$HF$`).
* First, let the square (on it) be (greater) by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (in length with `$HF$`).
* And the whole of `$HF$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FG$`.
* Thus, `$KH$` is a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] [ [Def. 10.1] ][bookofproofs$1095].
* And the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of an (area) contained by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.91]][bookofproofs$2185].
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$LH$` - that is to say, (of) `$EC$` - is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* And if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$HF$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FK$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($HF$), and (since) the whole of `$FH$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FG$`, `$KH$` is a [fourth apotome][bookofproofs$2094] [[Prop. 10.14]][bookofproofs$2108].
* And the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of an (area) contained by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [fourth apotome][bookofproofs$2094] is a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.94]][bookofproofs$2188].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
