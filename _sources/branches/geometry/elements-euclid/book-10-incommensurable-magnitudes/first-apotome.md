### (Definition 11 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Given a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], if the square on the whole is greater than the ([square][bookofproofs$909] on a [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) attached (to the apotome) by the (square) on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with (the whole), and the whole is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), then let the (apotome) be called a **first apotome**.

### Modern Formulation

The **first apotome** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is `\[\alpha-\alpha\,\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}},\]`
where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
