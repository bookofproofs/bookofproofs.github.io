> And if neither of (the whole or the attached [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the whole is greater than (the square on) the attached ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) by the (square) on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with (the whole), then let the (apotome) be called a **third apotome**.


### Modern Formulation

The **third apotome** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is `\[\sqrt{\alpha}\,\left(1-\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}}\right),\]`

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
