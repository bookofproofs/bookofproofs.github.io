### (Proposition 79 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> (Only) one [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, can be attached to an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* Let `$AB$` be an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], with `$BC$` (so) attached to it.
* `$AC$` and `$CB$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* I say that another [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, cannot be attached to `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

In other words, 

`\[\alpha - \sqrt{\beta} = \gamma - \sqrt{\delta}\]` has only one solution: i.e., `\[\gamma=\alpha\quad\text{ and }\quad\delta=\beta,\]` where `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
Likewise, `\[\sqrt{\alpha} - \sqrt{\beta} =\sqrt{\gamma}-\sqrt{\delta}\]` has only one solution: i.e., `\[\gamma=\alpha\quad\text{ and }\quad\delta=\beta.\]`

### Notes

This proposition corresponds to [[Prop. 10.42]][bookofproofs$2136], with minus signs instead of plus signs.
