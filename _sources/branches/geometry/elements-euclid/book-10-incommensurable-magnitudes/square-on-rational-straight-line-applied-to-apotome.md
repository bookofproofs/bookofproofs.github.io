### (Proposition 113 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), applied to an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], produces as breadth a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] whose terms are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the terms of the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], and in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945]. Moreover, the created [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] has the same order as the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* Let `$A$` be a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and `$BD$` an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* And let the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$KH$` be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`, such that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$`, applied to the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] `$BD$`, produces `$KH$` as breadth.
* I say that `$KH$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] whose terms are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the terms of `$BD$`, and in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945], and, moreover, that `$KH$` has the same order as `$BD$`.
