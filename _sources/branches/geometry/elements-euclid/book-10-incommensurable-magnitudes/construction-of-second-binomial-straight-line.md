### (Proposition 49 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find a [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$AC$` and `$CB$` be laid down such that their sum `$AB$` has to `$BC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], and does not have to `$AC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] [ [Prop. 10.28 lem. I] ][bookofproofs$6474].
* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$D$` be laid down.
* And let `$EF$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$D$`.
* `$EF$` is thus a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* So, let it also have been contrived that as the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$CA$` (is) to `$AB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* Thus, `$FG$` is also a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And since the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$CA$` does not have to `$AB$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$EF$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* `$EF$` and `$FG$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$EG$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, we must show that (it is) also a [second (binomial][bookofproofs$2086] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation

If the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has [unit][bookofproofs$2314] length then the length of a [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is `\[\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}}}+\alpha,\]`

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

This, and the [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092], whose length according to [[Prop. 10.86]][bookofproofs$2180] is `\[\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}}}-\alpha,\]` are the roots of the quadratic function `\[x^2- \frac{2\,\alpha}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}}}\,x+\frac{\alpha^2\,\beta^{\,2}}{1-\beta^{\,2}}=0, \]`

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
