* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes, and let one of them, `$A$`, be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with some other (magnitude), `$C$`.
* I say that the remaining (magnitude), `$B$`, is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$C$`.

* For if `$B$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$C$`, but `$A$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`, `$A$` is thus also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$C$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* But, (it is) also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (with `$C$`).
* The very thing (is) [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$B$` is not [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$C$`.
* Thus, (it is) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
* Thus, if two magnitudes are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095], and so on ....
