### Euclid's Formulation

> If an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* For let the area `$AC$` be contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and the [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`, which has been divided into its (component) terms at `$E$`, such that `$AE$` is the greater term.
* So I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AC$` is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].

### Modern Formulation

If the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has [unit][bookofproofs$2314] length then this proposition states that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is the square root of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial area][bookofproofs$6462]: i.e., a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has a length 
`\[\alpha\,(\sqrt{1+\beta}+1)\]` 
whose [square root][bookofproofs$46] can be written `\[\rho\,\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\delta^{2}}+\delta}{2\,(1+\delta^{2})}}+\rho\,\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\delta^{2}}-\delta}{2\,(1+\delta^{2})}},\]` 
where 
`\[\rho=\sqrt{\alpha\,(1+\delta^{2})}\quad\text{ and }\quad\delta^{2}=\beta.\]` 
This is the length of the square root of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial area][bookofproofs$6462] (see [[Prop. 10.40]][bookofproofs$2134]), since `$\rho, \delta,\alpha,\beta$` are all [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
