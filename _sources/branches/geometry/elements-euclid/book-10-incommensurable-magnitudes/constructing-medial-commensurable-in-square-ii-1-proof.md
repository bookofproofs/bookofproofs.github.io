* And, first of all, (let us prove) that the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CBD$` [is] equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$`.

* For since `$AD$` has been drawn from the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] in a [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431], [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the base, `$ABD$` and `$ADC$` are thus [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] (which are) similar to the whole, `$ABC$`, and to one another [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994].
* And since triangle `$ABC$` is similar to triangle `$ABD$`, thus as `$CB$` is to `$BA$`, so `$BA$` (is) to `$BD$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CBD$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* So, for the same (reasons), the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BCD$` is also equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`.
* And since if a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is drawn from the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] in a right-angled triangle, [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the base, the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] so) drawn is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to the pieces of the base [ [Prop. 6.8 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]3, thus as `$BD$` is to `$DA$`, so `$AD$` (is) to `$DC$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$DC$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DA$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* I also say that the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BC$` and `$AD$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BA$` and `$AC$`.
* For since, as we said, `$ABC$` is similar to `$ABD$`, thus as `$BC$` is to `$CA$`, so `$BA$` (is) to `$AD$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BC$` and `$AD$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BA$` and `$AC$` [[Prop. 6.16]][bookofproofs$2002].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
