### (Proposition 51 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$AC$` and `$CB$` be laid down such that `$AB$` does not have to `$BC$`, or to `$AC$` either, the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] [ [Prop. 10.28 lem. I] ][bookofproofs$6474].
* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$D$` be laid down.
* And let `$EF$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$D$`.
* Thus, `$EF$` is also a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let it have been contrived that as the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* Thus, `$FG$` is also a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And since `$BA$` does not have to `$AC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$EF$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Thus, `$EF$` and `$FG$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Hence, `$EG$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [fourth (binomial][bookofproofs$2088] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation

If the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has [unit][bookofproofs$2314] length then the length of a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is `\[\alpha+\frac \alpha{\sqrt{1+\beta}},\]` 

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes


This, and the [fourth apotome][bookofproofs$2094], whose length according to [[Prop. 10.88]][bookofproofs$2182] is `\[\alpha-\frac \alpha{\sqrt{1+\beta}}\]`  are the roots of the quadratic function `\[x^2- 2\,\alpha\,x+\frac{\alpha^2\,\beta}{1+\beta}=0,\]`

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
