* For let the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] `$AC$` have been enclosed by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$BC$` (which are) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095].
* I say that `$AC$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].

* For let the square `$AD$` have been described on `$AB$`.
* `$AD$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* And since `$AB$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`, and `$AB$` is equal to `$BD$`, `$BD$` is thus [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`.
* And as `$BD$` is to `$BC$`, so `$DA$` (is) to `$AC$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$DA$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$DA$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$AC$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* Thus, the ... by [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] ... [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095], and so on ....
