* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` be four [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], (such that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* And let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$B$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$`, and let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$` be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$D$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$F$`.
* I say that `$A$` is either [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$E$`, and `$C$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$F$`, or `$A$` is [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$E$`, and `$C$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$F$`.

* For since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, thus as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$` [[Prop. 6.22]][bookofproofs$2008].
* But the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$E$` and `$B$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`, and the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$D$` and `$F$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$`.
* Thus, as the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$E$` and `$B$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`, so the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$D$` and `$F$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$`.
* Thus, via [separation][bookofproofs$1954], as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$F$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$` [[Prop. 5.17]][bookofproofs$1974].
* Thus, also, as `$E$` is to `$B$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$D$` [[Prop. 6.22]][bookofproofs$2008].
* Thus, inversely, as `$B$` is to `$E$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$F$` [ [Prop. 5.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]1.
* But, as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$C$` also (is) to `$D$`.
* Thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$A$` is to `$E$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$F$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* Therefore, `$A$` is either [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$E$`, and `$C$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$F$`, or `$A$` is [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$E$`, and `$C$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$F$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Thus, if, and so on ....
