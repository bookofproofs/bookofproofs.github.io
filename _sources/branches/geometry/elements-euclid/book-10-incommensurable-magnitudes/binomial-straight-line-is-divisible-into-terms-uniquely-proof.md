* Let `$AB$` be a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which has been divided into its (component) terms at `$C$`.
* `$AC$` and `$CB$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* I say that `$AB$` cannot be divided at another [point][bookofproofs$631] into two [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.

* For, if possible, let it also have been divided at `$D$`, such that `$AD$` and `$DB$` are also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* So, (it is) clear that `$AC$` is not the same as `$DB$`.
* For, if possible, let it be (the same).
* So, `$AD$` will also be the same as `$CB$`.
* And as `$AC$` will be to `$CB$`, so `$BD$` (will be) to `$DA$`.
* And `$AB$` will (thus) also be divided at `$D$` in the same (manner) as the division at `$C$`.
* The very opposite was assumed.
* Thus, `$AC$` is not the same as `$DB$`.
* So, on account of this, [points][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` and `$D$` are not equally far from the [point][bookofproofs$631] of bisection.
* Thus, by whatever (amount the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` differs from (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$`, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` also differs from twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by this (same amount) - on account of both (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$`, plus twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`, and (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$`, plus twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`, being equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` [[Prop. 2.4]][bookofproofs$1017].
* But, (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` differs from (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* For (they are) both [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (areas).
* Thus, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` also differs from twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area, despite both) being [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* The very thing is [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* For a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] cannot exceed a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) [[Prop. 10.26]][bookofproofs$2120].
* Thus, a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) cannot be divided (into its component terms) at different [points][bookofproofs$631].
* Thus, (it can be so divided) at one [point][bookofproofs$631] only.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
