> And if neither of the terms is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] previously) laid out then let (the whole [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) be called a **third binomial** ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation

The **third binomial** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is `\[\sqrt{\alpha}\,\left(1+\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}}\right),\]` 

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
