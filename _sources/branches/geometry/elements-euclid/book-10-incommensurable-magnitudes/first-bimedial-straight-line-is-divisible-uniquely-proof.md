* Let `$AB$` be a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which has been divided at `$C$`, such that `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, (and) containing a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) [[Prop. 10.37]][bookofproofs$2131].
* I say that `$AB$` cannot be (so) divided at another [point][bookofproofs$631].

* For, if possible, let it also have been divided at `$D$`, such that `$AD$` and `$DB$` are also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, (and) containing a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* Since, therefore, by whatever (amount) twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` differs from twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`, (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` differs from (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` by this (same amount) [ [Prop. 10.41 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6477].
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` differs from twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* For (they are) both [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (areas).
* (The sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` thus differs from (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area, despite both) being [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).
* The very thing is [absurd][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 10.26]][bookofproofs$2120].
* Thus, a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) cannot be divided into its (component) terms at different [points][bookofproofs$631].
* Thus, (it can be so divided) at one [point][bookofproofs$631] only.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
