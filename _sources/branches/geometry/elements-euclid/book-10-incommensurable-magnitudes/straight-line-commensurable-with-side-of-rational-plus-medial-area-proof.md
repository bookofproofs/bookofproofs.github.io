* Let `$AB$` be the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], and let `$CD$` be [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* We must show that `$CD$` is also the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].

* Let `$AB$` have been divided into its (component) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] at `$E$`.
* `$AE$` and `$EB$` are thus [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.40]][bookofproofs$2134].
* And let the same construction have been made as in the previous (propositions).
* So, similarly, we can show that `$CF$` and `$FD$` are also [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], and that the sum of the (squares) on `$AE$` and `$EB$` (is) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of the (squares) on `$CF$` and `$FD$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$`.
* And hence the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` and `$FD$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$CD$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] [[Prop. 10.40]][bookofproofs$2134].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
