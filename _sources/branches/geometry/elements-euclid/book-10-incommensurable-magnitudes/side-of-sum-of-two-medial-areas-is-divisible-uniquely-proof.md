* Let `$AB$` be [the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas)] which has been divided at `$C$`, such that `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and, moreover, [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of the (squares) on ($AC$ and `$CB$`) [[Prop. 10.41]][bookofproofs$2135].
* I say that `$AB$` cannot be divided at another [point][bookofproofs$631] fulfilling the prescribed (conditions).

* For, if possible, let it have been divided at `$D$`, such that `$AC$` is again manifestly not the same as `$DB$`, but `$AC$` (is), by hypothesis, greater.
* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$` be laid down.
* And let `$EG$`, equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$`, and `$HK$`, equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`, have been applied to `$EF$`.
* Thus, the whole of `$EK$` is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` [[Prop. 2.4]][bookofproofs$1017].
* So, again, let `$EL$`, equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$`, have been applied to `$EF$`.
* Thus, the remainder - twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` - is equal to the remainder, `$MK$`.
* And since the sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` was assumed (to be) [medial][bookofproofs$2115], `$EG$` is also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`.
* `$HE$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$HN$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$`.
* And since the sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`, `$EG$` is thus also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GN$`.
* Hence, `$EH$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$HN$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they are (both) [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$EH$` and `$HN$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$EN$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which has been divided (into its component terms) at `$H$` [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, similarly, we can show that it has also been (so) divided at `$M$`.
* And `$EH$` is not the same as `$MN$`.
* Thus, a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) has been divided (into its component terms) at different [points][bookofproofs$631].
* The very thing is [absurd][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 10.42]][bookofproofs$2136].
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) cannot be divided (into its component terms) at different [points][bookofproofs$631].
* Thus, it can be (so) divided at one [[point][bookofproofs$631]] only.
