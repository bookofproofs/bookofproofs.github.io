* Let `$AB$` be an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* I say that `$AB$` is not the same as a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130].

* For, if possible, let it be (the same).
* And let a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DC$` be laid down.
* And let the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] `$CE$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$DE$` as breadth.
* Therefore, since `$AB$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], `$DE$` is a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] [[Prop. 10.97]][bookofproofs$2191].
* Let `$EF$` be an attachment to it.
* Thus, `$DF$` and `$FE$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DF$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FE$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($DF$), and `$DF$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DC$` [ [Def. 10.10] ][bookofproofs$2090].
* Again, since `$AB$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130], `$DE$` is thus a [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] [[Prop. 10.60]][bookofproofs$2154].
* Let ($DE$) have been divided into its (component) terms at `$G$`, and let `$DG$` be the greater term.
* Thus, `$DG$` and `$GE$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DG$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GE$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($DG$), and the greater (term) `$DG$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DC$` [ [Def. 10.5] ][bookofproofs$2085].
* Thus, `$DF$` is also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DG$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* The remainder `$GF$` is thus [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DF$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* Therefore, since `$DF$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GF$`, and `$DF$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], `$GF$` is thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Therefore, since `$DF$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GF$`, `$DF$` (is) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$`.
* Thus, `$FG$` is also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* `$GF$` and `$FE$` [are] thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$EG$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* But, (it is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] is not the same as a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
