### (Proposition 63 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> The [square][bookofproofs$909] on a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) produces as breadth a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).[^1]

* Let `$AB$` be a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) having been divided at `$C$`, such that `$AC$` is greater than `$CB$`, and (let) `$DE$` (be) a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$DF$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$DE$`, producing `$DG$` as breadth.
* I say that `$DG$` is a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)

[^1]: In other words, the square of a [major][bookofproofs$2133] is a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088]. See [[Prop. 10.57]][bookofproofs$2151] (translator's note).
