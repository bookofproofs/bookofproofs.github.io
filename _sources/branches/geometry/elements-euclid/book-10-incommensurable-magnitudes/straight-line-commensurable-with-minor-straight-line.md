### (Proposition 105 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* For let `$AB$` be a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and (let) `$CD$` (be) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$CD$` is also a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
