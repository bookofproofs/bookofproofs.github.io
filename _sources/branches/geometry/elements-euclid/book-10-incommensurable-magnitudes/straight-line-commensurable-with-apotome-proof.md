* Let `$AB$` be an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], and let `$CD$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$CD$` is also an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], and (is) the same in order as `$AB$`.

* For since `$AB$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], let `$BE$` be an attachment to it.
* Thus, `$AE$` and `$EB$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* And let it have been contrived that the (ratio) of `$BE$` to `$DF$` is the same as the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$AB$` to `$CD$` [[Prop. 6.12]][bookofproofs$1998].
* Thus, also, as one is to one, (so) all [are] to all [[Prop. 5.12]][bookofproofs$1969].
* And thus as the whole `$AE$` is to the whole `$CF$`, so `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$`.
* And `$AB$` (is) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$`.
* `$AE$` (is) thus also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CF$`, and `$BE$` with `$DF$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$AE$` and `$BE$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$CF$` and `$FD$` are also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* `$CD$` is thus an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* So, I say that (it is) also the same in order as `$AB$`.
* Therefore, since as `$AE$` is to `$CF$`, so `$BE$` (is) to `$DF$`, thus, alternately, as `$AE$` is to `$EB$`, so `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* So, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$EB$` either by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095], or by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AE$).
* Therefore, if the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$EB$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AE$) then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` will also be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FD$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($CF$) [[Prop. 10.14]][bookofproofs$2108].
* And if `$AE$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with a (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then so (is) `$CF$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106], and if `$BE$` (is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), so (is) `$DF$`, and if neither of `$AE$` or `$EB$` (are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), neither (are) either of `$CF$` or `$FD$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And if the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is greater [than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$EB$`] by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AE$) then the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` will also be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FD$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($CF$) [[Prop. 10.14]][bookofproofs$2108].
* And if `$AE$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with a (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), so (is) `$CF$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106], and if `$BE$` (is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), so (is) `$DF$`, and if neither of `$AE$` or `$EB$` (are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), neither (are) either of `$CF$` or `$FD$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Thus, `$CD$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], and (is) the same in order[^1] as `$AB$` [ [Def. 10.11] ][bookofproofs$2091], [ [Def. 10.12] ][bookofproofs$2092], [ [Def. 10.13] ][bookofproofs$2093], [ [Def. 10.14] ][bookofproofs$2094], [ [Def. 10.15] ][bookofproofs$6445], [ [Def. 10.16] ][bookofproofs$6446].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: Euclid's expression "(not) being the same in order" means that the resulting irrational number is "(not) of the same kind" as that irrational number, with which it is commensurable.
