* Let `$AB$` be the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas), having been divided at `$C$`.
* And let `$DE$` be a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let the ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$DF$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$DE$`, producing `$DG$` as breadth.
* I say that `$DG$` is a [sixth binomial][bookofproofs$2090] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For let the same construction be made as in the previous (propositions).
* And since `$AB$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas), having been divided at `$C$`, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are thus [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and, moreover, the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [[Prop. 10.41]][bookofproofs$2135].
* Hence, according to what has been previously demonstrated, `$DL$` and `$MF$` are each [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And they are applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$DM$` and `$MG$` are each [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since the sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`, `$DL$` is thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$MF$`.
* Thus, `$DM$` (is) also [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$MG$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* `$DM$` and `$MG$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$DG$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [sixth (binomial][bookofproofs$2090] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* So, similarly (to the previous propositions), we can again show that the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DKM$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MN$`, and that `$DK$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KM$`.
* And so, for the same (reasons), the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DM$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$MG$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($DM$) [[Prop. 10.18]][bookofproofs$2112].
* And neither of `$DM$` and `$MG$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$DG$` is a [sixth binomial][bookofproofs$2090] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.10] ][bookofproofs$2090].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
