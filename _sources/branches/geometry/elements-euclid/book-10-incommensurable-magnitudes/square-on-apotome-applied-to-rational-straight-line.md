### (Proposition 97 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] as breadth.

* Let `$AB$` be an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], and `$CD$` a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let `$CE$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$CF$` as breadth.
* I say that `$CF$` is a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091].
