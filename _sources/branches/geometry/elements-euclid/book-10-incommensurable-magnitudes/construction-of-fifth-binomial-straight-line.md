### (Proposition 52 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] [straight line][bookofproofs$645].

* Let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$AC$` and `$CB$` be laid down such that `$AB$` does not have to either of them the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] [ [Prop. 10.28 lem. II] ][bookofproofs$6475].
* And let some [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$D$` be laid down.
* And let `$EF$` be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [in length] with `$D$`.
* Thus, `$EF$` (is) a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let it have been contrived that as `$CA$` (is) to `$AB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* And `$CA$` does not have to `$AB$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$EF$` and `$FG$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Thus, `$EG$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [fifth (binomial][bookofproofs$2089] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation

If the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has [unit][bookofproofs$2314] length then the length of a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is `\[\alpha\,(\sqrt{1+\beta}+1),\]` 

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes


This, and the [fifth apotome][bookofproofs$6445], whose length according to [[Prop. 10.89]][bookofproofs$2183] is `\[\alpha\,(\sqrt{1+\beta}-1),\]` are the roots of the quadratic function `\[x^2- 2\,\alpha\,\sqrt{1+\beta}\,x+\alpha^2\,\beta=0,\]`

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
