### (Definition 10 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> And if neither (term is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), a **sixth (binomial** [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation

The **sixth binomial** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is `\[\sqrt{\alpha}+\sqrt{\beta},\]` 
where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
