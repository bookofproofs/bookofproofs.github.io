* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes.
* I say that `$A$` does not have to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315].

* For if `$A$` has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] then `$A$` will be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* But it is not.
* Thus, `$A$` does not have to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315].
* Thus, [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] do not have to one another, and so on ....
