* Let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$`, and the three [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$E$`, `$BC$`, and `$CD$`, not having to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], be laid down.
* Furthermore, let `$CB$` also not have to `$BD$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* And let it have been contrived that as `$E$` (is) to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$`, and as `$BC$` (is) to `$CD$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* Therefore, since as `$E$` is to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (is) thus [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$FG$` is also a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And since `$E$` does not have to `$BC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` thus does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$A$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Again, since as `$BC$` is to `$CD$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) thus [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$GH$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since `$BC$` does not have to `$CD$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` thus does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] has to (some) [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$FG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And both are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$FG$` and `$GH$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$FH$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [sixth (apotome) ][bookofproofs$6446].

* For since as `$E$` is to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$`, and as `$BC$` (is) to `$CD$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$`, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$E$` is to `$CD$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* And `$E$` does not have to `$CD$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` does not have to the (square) `$GH$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* `$A$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Thus, neither of `$FG$` and `$GH$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$`.
* Therefore, let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$K$` be that (area) by which the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` [ [Prop. 10.13 lem.] ][bookofproofs$2371].
* Therefore, since as `$BC$` is to `$CD$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$`, thus, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], as `$CB$` is to `$BD$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$K$` [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2.
* And `$CB$` does not have to `$BD$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$K$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* `$FG$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$K$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GH$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$K$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GH$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($FG$).
* And neither of `$FG$` and `$GH$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$`.
* Thus, `$FH$` is a [sixth apotome][bookofproofs$6446] [ [Def. 10.16] ][bookofproofs$6446].
* Thus, the [sixth apotome][bookofproofs$6446] `$FH$` has been found.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
