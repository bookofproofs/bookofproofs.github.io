* For let the area `$AC$` be contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and by the [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`.
* I say that [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AC$` is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [binomial][bookofproofs$2130].

* For since `$AD$` is a [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), let it have been divided into its (component) terms at `$E$`, and let `$AE$` be the greater term.
* So, (it is) clear that `$AE$` and `$ED$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$ED$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AE$), and that `$AE$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` (first) laid out [ [Def. 10.5] ][bookofproofs$2085].
* So, let `$ED$` have been cut in half at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`.
* And since the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$ED$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AE$), thus if a ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the lesser (term) - that is to say, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` - falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, is applied to the greater (term) `$AE$`, then it divides it into (terms which are) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] [[Prop. 10.17]][bookofproofs$2111].
* Therefore, let the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GE$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$`, have been applied to `$AE$`.
* `$AG$` is thus [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EG$`.
* And let `$GH$`, `$EK$`, and `$FL$` have been drawn from ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$G$`, `$E$`, and `$F$` (respectively), [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$AB$` or `$CD$`.
* And let the square `$SN$`, equal to the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AH$`, have been constructed, and (the square) `$NQ$`, equal to (the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$GK$` [[Prop. 2.14]][bookofproofs$1028].
* And let `$MN$` be laid down so as to be [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$NO$`.
* `$RN$` is thus also [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$NP$`.
* And let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$SQ$` have been completed.
* `$SQ$` is thus a [square][bookofproofs$909] [ [Prop. 10.53 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6478].
* And since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GE$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$`, thus as `$AG$` is to `$EF$`, so `$FE$` (is) to `$EG$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* And thus as `$AH$` (is) to `$EL$`, (so) `$EL$` (is) to `$KG$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$EL$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$AH$` and `$GK$`.
* But, `$AH$` is equal to `$SN$`, and `$GK$` (is) equal to `$NQ$`.
* `$EL$` is thus [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$SN$` and `$NQ$`.
* And `$MR$` is also [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to the same - (namely), `$SN$` and `$NQ$` [ [Prop. 10.53 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6478].
* `$EL$` is thus equal to `$MR$`.
* Hence, it is also equal to `$PO$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959].
* And `$AH$` plus `$GK$` is equal to `$SN$` plus `$NQ$`.
* Thus, the whole of `$AC$` is equal to the whole of `$SQ$` - that is to say, to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$MO$`.
* Thus, `$MO$` (is) the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (area) `$AC$`.
* I say that `$MO$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* For since `$AG$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GE$`, `$AE$` is also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$AG$` and `$GE$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* And `$AE$` was also assumed (to be) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AG$` and `$GE$` are also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And `$AB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* `$AG$` and `$GE$` are thus each also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$AH$` and `$GK$` are each [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (areas), and `$AH$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GK$` [[Prop. 10.19]][bookofproofs$2113].
* But, `$AH$` is equal to `$SN$`, and `$GK$` to `$NQ$`.
* `$SN$` and `$NQ$` - that is to say, the (squares) on `$MN$` and `$NO$` (respectively) - are thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] and [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
* And since `$AE$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$ED$`, but `$AE$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AG$`, and `$DE$` (is) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$`, `$AG$` (is) thus also [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Hence, `$AH$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EL$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* But, `$AH$` is equal to `$SN$`, and `$EL$` to `$MR$`.
* Thus, `$SN$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$MR$`.
* But, as `$SN$` (is) to `$MR$`, (so) `$PN$` (is) to `$NR$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* `$PN$` is thus [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$NR$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$PN$` (is) equal to `$MN$`, and `$NR$` to `$NO$`.
* Thus, `$MN$` is [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$NO$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MN$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$NO$`, and each (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* `$MN$` and `$NO$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$MO$` is (both) a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130], and the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$AC$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
