### Euclid's Formulation

> If four magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], and the first is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the second, then the third will also be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the fourth. And if the first is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the second, then the third will also be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the fourth.
* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` be four [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] magnitudes, (such that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* And let `$A$` be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` will also be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$D$`.
* And so let `$A$` be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` will also be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$D$`.
