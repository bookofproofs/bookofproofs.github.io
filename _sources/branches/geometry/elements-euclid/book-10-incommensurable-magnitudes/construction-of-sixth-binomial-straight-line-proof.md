* Let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$AC$` and `$CB$` be laid down such that `$AB$` does not have to each of them the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* And let `$D$` also be another [number][bookofproofs$2315], which is not [square][bookofproofs$2326], and does not have to each of `$BA$` and `$AC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either [ [Prop. 10.28 lem. I] ][bookofproofs$6474].
* And let some [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$E$` be laid down.
* And let it have been contrived that as `$D$` (is) to `$AB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` (is) [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And `$E$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$FG$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since `$D$` does not have to `$AB$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` thus does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$E$` (is) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* So, again, let it have be contrived that as `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) thus [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$HG$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HG$` (is) thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$HG$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since `$BA$` does not have to `$AC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$FG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Thus, `$FG$` and `$GH$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$FH$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, we must show that (it is) also a [sixth (binomial][bookofproofs$2090] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For since as `$D$` is to `$AB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$`, and also as `$BA$` is to `$AC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$`, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$D$` is to `$AC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* And `$D$` does not have to `$AC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* `$E$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And ($E$) was also shown (to be) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$`.
* Thus, `$FG$` and `$GH$` are each [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$E$`.
* And since as `$BA$` is to `$AC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) thus greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Therefore, let (the sum of) the (squares) on `$GH$` and `$K$` be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$`.
* Thus, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], as `$AB$` (is) to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$K$` [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2.
* And `$AB$` does not have to `$BC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Hence, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$K$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$FG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$K$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` is thus greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GH$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($FG$).
* And `$FG$` and `$GH$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and neither of them is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$E$` (previously) laid down.
* Thus, `$FH$` is a [sixth binomial][bookofproofs$2090] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.10] ][bookofproofs$2090].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
