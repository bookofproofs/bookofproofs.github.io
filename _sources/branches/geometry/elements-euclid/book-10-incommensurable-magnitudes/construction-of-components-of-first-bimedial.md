### (Proposition 27 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find (two) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), containing a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area), (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Let the two [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$` and `$B$`, (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, be laid down.
* And let `$C$` - [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) to `$A$` and `$B$` - have been taken [[Prop. 6.13]][bookofproofs$1999].
* And let it be contrived that as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$` [[Prop. 6.12]][bookofproofs$1998].
