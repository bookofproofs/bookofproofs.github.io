### (Proposition 56 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [third binomial][bookofproofs$2087] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132].
* For let the area `$ABCD$` be contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and by the [third binomial][bookofproofs$2087] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`, which has been divided into its (component) terms at `$E$`, of which `$AE$` is the greater.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AC$` is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132].

### Modern Formulation

If the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has [unit][bookofproofs$2314] length then this proposition states that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [third binomial][bookofproofs$2087] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is a [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]: i.e., a [third binomial][bookofproofs$2087] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has a length 
`\[\sqrt{\alpha}\,\left(1+\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}}\right),\]` 
whose [square root][bookofproofs$46] can be written 
`\[\rho\,\left(\alpha^{1/4}+\frac{\sqrt \delta}{\alpha^{1/4}}\right),\]` 
where 
`\[\rho=\sqrt{\frac {1+\beta}2}\quad\text{ and }\quad\delta=\alpha\,\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}.\]`

This is the length of a [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] (see [[Prop. 10.38]][bookofproofs$2132]), since `$\rho, \delta,\alpha,\beta$` are all [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
