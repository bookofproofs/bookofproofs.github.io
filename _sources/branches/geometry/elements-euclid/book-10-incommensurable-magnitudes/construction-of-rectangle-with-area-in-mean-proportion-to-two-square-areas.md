### (Lemma to Proposition 53 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Let `$AB$` and `$BC$` be two squares, and let them be laid down such that `$DB$` is [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$BE$`. `$FB$` is, thus, also [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$BG$`. And let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AC$` have been completed. I say that `$AC$` is a square, and that `$DG$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$AB$` and `$BC$`, and, moreover, `$DC$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
