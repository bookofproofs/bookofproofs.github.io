* For let the two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$AB$` and `$BC$`, [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, (and) containing a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area), be laid down together.
* I say that the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), `$AC$`, is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083].

* For since `$AB$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`, (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is thus also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [see previous proposition].
* And, via [composition][bookofproofs$1953], (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` - that is, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [[Prop. 2.4]][bookofproofs$1017] - is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.16]][bookofproofs$2110].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083] - for `$AB$` and `$BC$` were assumed to enclose a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` (is) [irrational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$AC$` (is) [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084] - let it be called a **first bimedial** ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]). 
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
