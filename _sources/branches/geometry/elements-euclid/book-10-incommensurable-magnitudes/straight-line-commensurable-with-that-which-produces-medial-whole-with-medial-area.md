### (Proposition 107 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole is itself also a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.
* Let `$AB$` be a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole, and let `$CD$` be [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$CD$` is also a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.
