### Euclid's Formulation

> The [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (which are) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* For let the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] `$AC$` have been enclosed by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$BC$` (which are) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095].
* I say that `$AC$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
