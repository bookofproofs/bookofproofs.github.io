### (Proposition 13 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two magnitudes are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095], and one of them is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with some magnitude, then the remaining (magnitude) will also be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with it.

* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes, and let one of them, `$A$`, be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with some other (magnitude), `$C$`.
* I say that the remaining (magnitude), `$B$`, is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$C$`.
