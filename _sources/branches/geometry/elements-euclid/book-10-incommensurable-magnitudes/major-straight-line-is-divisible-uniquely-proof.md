* Let `$AB$` be a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which has been divided at `$C$`, so that `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CB$` [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CD$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.39]][bookofproofs$2133].
* I say that `$AB$` cannot be (so) divided at another [point][bookofproofs$631].

* For, if possible, let it also have been divided at `$D$`, such that `$AD$` and `$DB$` are also [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And since, by whatever (amount the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` differs from (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$`, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` also differs from twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by this (same amount).
* But, (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` exceeds (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* For (they are) both [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (areas).
* Thus, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` also exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area), (despite both) being [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 10.26]][bookofproofs$2120].
* Thus, a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) cannot be divided (into its component terms) at different [points][bookofproofs$631].
* Thus, it can only be (so) divided at the same ([point][bookofproofs$631]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
