### (Proposition 102 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole, applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces a [sixth apotome][bookofproofs$6446] as breadth.
* Let `$AB$` be that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole, and `$CD$` a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let `$CE$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$CF$` as breadth.
* I say that `$CF$` is a [sixth apotome][bookofproofs$6446].
