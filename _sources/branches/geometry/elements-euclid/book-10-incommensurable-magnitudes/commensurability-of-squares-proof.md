* For let `$A$` and `$B$` be ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095].
* I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` has to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].

* For since `$A$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`, `$A$` thus has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] [[Prop. 10.5]][bookofproofs$2099].
* Let it have (that) which `$C$` (has) to `$D$`.
* Therefore, since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* But the (ratio) of the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` is the square of the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$A$` to `$B$`.
* For similar figures are in the [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] of (their) corresponding sides [ [Prop. 6.20 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]5.
* And the (ratio) of the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$` to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$` is the square of the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of the [ [number] ][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$` to the [ [number] ][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$`.
* For there exists one [number][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to two [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326], and (one) [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] has to the (other) square [number] a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] with respect to (that) the side (of the former has) to the side (of the latter) [[Prop. 8.11]][bookofproofs$2030].
* And, thus, as the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`, so the [square [number] ][bookofproofs$2326] on the [ (number) ][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$` (is) to the [square [number] ][bookofproofs$2326] on the [ [number] ][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$`.[^1]
* And so let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` be to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` as the [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] on `$C$` (is) to the [square] (number) on `$D$`.
* I say that `$A$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.
* For since as the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is to the [square] on `$B$`, so the [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] on `$C$` (is) to the [square] (number) on `$D$`.
* But, the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` is the square of the (ratio) of `$A$` to `$B$` [ [Prop. 6.20 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]5.
* And the (ratio) of the [square [number] ][bookofproofs$2326] on the [ [number] ][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$` to the [square [number] ][bookofproofs$2326] on the [ [number] ][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$` is the square of the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of the [ [number] ][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$` to the [ [number] ][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$` [[Prop. 8.11]][bookofproofs$2030].
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so the [ [number] ][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$` also (is) to the [ [number] ][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$`.
* `$A$`, thus, has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$` has to the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$`.
* Thus, `$A$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$` " [Prop. 10.6] ":https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/magnitudes-with-rational-ratio-are-commensurable/.[^2]
* And so let `$A$` be [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.
* I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` does not have to the [square] on `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* For if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` has to the [square] on `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] then `$A$` will be [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.
* But it is not.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` does not have to the [square] on the `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* So, again, let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` not have to the [square] on `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* I say that `$A$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.
* For if `$A$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$` then the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` will have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* But it does not have (such a ratio).
* Thus, `$A$` is not [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.
* Thus, (squares) on ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095], and so on ....
