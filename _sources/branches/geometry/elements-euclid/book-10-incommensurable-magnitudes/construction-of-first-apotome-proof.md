* Let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$` be laid down.
* And let `$BG$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$A$`.
* `$BG$` is thus also a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let two [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326] `$DE$` and `$EF$` be laid down, and let their difference `$FD$` be not square [ [Prop. 10.28 lem. I] ][bookofproofs$6474].
* Thus, `$ED$` does not have to `$DF$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* And let it have been contrived that as `$ED$` (is) to `$DF$`, so the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` (is) to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$GC$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$GC$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since `$ED$` does not have to `$DF$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` thus does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$BG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GC$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And they are both [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$BG$` and `$GC$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$BC$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [first (apotome][bookofproofs$2091]).

* Let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$` be that (area) by which the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$` [ [Prop. 10.13 lem.] ][bookofproofs$2371].
* And since as `$ED$` is to `$FD$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$`, thus, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], as `$DE$` is to `$EF$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$` [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2.
* And `$DE$` has to `$EF$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) square-number (has) to (some) square-number.
* For each is a [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$` also has to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, `$BG$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$H$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GC$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$GC$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BG$).
* And the whole, `$BG$`, is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$`.
* Thus, `$BC$` is a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] [ [Def. 10.11] ][bookofproofs$2091].
* Thus, the [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] `$BC$` has been found.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to find.
