* For let an area, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$CD$`, have been contained by the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] `$AB$`, and the [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] `$CD$`, of which let the greater term be `$CE$`.
* And let the terms of the [binomial][bookofproofs$2130], `$CE$` and `$ED$`, be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the terms of the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], `$AF$` and `$FB$` (respectively), and in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945].
* And let the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$CD$` be `$G$`.
* I say that `$G$` is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$H$` be laid down.
* And let (some [rectangle][bookofproofs$909]), equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$KL$` as breadth.
* Thus, `$KL$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], of which let the terms, `$KM$` and `$ML$`, be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the terms of the [binomial][bookofproofs$2130], `$CE$` and `$ED$` (respectively), and in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] [[Prop. 10.112]][bookofproofs$2206].
* But, `$CE$` and `$ED$` are also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AF$` and `$FB$` (respectively), and in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945].
* Thus, as `$AF$` is to `$FB$`, so `$KM$` (is) to `$ML$`.
* Thus, alternately, as `$AF$` is to `$KM$`, so `$BF$` (is) to `$LM$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* Thus, the remainder `$AB$` is also to the remainder `$KL$` as `$AF$` (is) to `$KM$` [[Prop. 5.19]][bookofproofs$1976].
* And `$AF$` (is) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KM$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* `$AB$` is thus also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KL$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And as `$AB$` is to `$KL$`, so the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CD$` and `$AB$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CD$` and `$KL$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CD$` and `$AB$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CD$` and `$KL$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CD$` and `$KL$` (is) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CD$` and `$AB$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$H$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$G$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CD$` and `$AB$`.
* The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$G$` is thus [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$H$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$G$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* `$G$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And it is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CD$` and `$AB$`.
* Thus, if an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], and a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] whose terms are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with, and in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as, the terms of the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
