* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` be four [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] magnitudes, (such that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* And let `$A$` be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` will also be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$D$`.

* For since `$A$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`, `$A$` thus has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] [[Prop. 10.5]][bookofproofs$2099].
* And as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* Thus, `$C$` also has to `$D$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315].
* Thus, `$C$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$D$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And so let `$A$` be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` will also be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$D$`.
* For since `$A$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`, `$A$` thus does not have to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] [[Prop. 10.7]][bookofproofs$2101].
* And as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* Thus, `$C$` does not have to `$D$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] either.
* Thus, `$C$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$D$` [[Prop. 10.8]][bookofproofs$2102].
* Thus, if four magnitudes, and so on ....
