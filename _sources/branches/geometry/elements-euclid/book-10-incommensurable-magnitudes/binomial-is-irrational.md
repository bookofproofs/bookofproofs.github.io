### Euclid's Formulation

> If two [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only are added together then the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] - let it be called a **binomial** ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).[^1]

* For let the two [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$AB$` and `$BC$`, (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, be laid down together.
* I say that the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), `$AC$`, is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083].

### Modern Formulation

Thus, a **binomial** [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has a length expressible as 

`\[1 +\sqrt{\delta}\]` 

or, more generally, 

`\[\rho\left(1+\sqrt{\delta}\right),\]`

 where `$\rho$` and `$\delta$` are [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

The binomial and the corresponding [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], whose length is expressible as 

`\[1 -\sqrt{\delta},\]` 

(see [Prop 10.73][bookofproofs$2167]), are the positive roots of the quartic `\[x^4-2\left(1+\delta\right)x^2 + \left(1-\delta\right)^2 = 0.\]`
