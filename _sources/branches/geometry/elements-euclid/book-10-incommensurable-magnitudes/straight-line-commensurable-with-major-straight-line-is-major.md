### (Proposition 68 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is itself also [major][bookofproofs$2133].
* Let `$AB$` be a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and let `$CD$` be [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$CD$` is a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
