### (Proposition 50 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find a [third binomial][bookofproofs$2087] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$AC$` and `$CB$` be laid down such that their sum `$AB$` has to `$BC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], and does not have to `$AC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* And let some other non-[square number][bookofproofs$2326] `$D$` also be laid down, and let it not have to each of `$BA$` and `$AC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* And let some [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$E$` be laid down, and let it have been contrived that as `$D$` (is) to `$AB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And `$E$` is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$FG$` is also a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And since `$D$` does not have to `$AB$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] has to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* `$E$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* So, again, let it have been contrived that as the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And `$FG$` (is) a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$GH$` (is) also a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And since `$BA$` does not have to `$AC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HG$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$FG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* `$FG$` and `$GH$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$FH$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [third (binomial][bookofproofs$2087] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation

If the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has [unit][bookofproofs$2314] length then the length of a [third binomial][bookofproofs$2087] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is `\[\sqrt{\alpha}\,\left(1+\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}}\right),\]` 

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

This, and the [third apotome][bookofproofs$2093], whose length according to [[Prop. 10.87]][bookofproofs$2181] is `\[\sqrt{\alpha}\,\left(1-\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}}\right),\]` are the roots of the quadratic function  `\[x^2- 2\,\sqrt{\alpha}\,x+\alpha\,\beta^{\,2}=0,\]`

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
