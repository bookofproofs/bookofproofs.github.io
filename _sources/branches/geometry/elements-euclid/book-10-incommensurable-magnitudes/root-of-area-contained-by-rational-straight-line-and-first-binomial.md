### Euclid's Formulation

> If an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [binomial][bookofproofs$2130].
* For let the area `$AC$` be contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and by the [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`.
* I say that [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AC$` is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [binomial][bookofproofs$2130].

### Modern Formulation

If the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has [unit][bookofproofs$2314] length then this proposition states that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]: i.e., a [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has a length `\[\alpha+\alpha\,\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}},\]` whose [square root][bookofproofs$46] can be written `\[\rho\,(1+\sqrt{\delta}),\]` where `\[\rho=\sqrt{\frac{\alpha\,(1+\beta)}2}\quad\text{ and }\quad\delta=\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta.}\]` This is the length of a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] (see [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130]), since `$\rho, \delta,\alpha,\beta$` are all [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
