* For, if possible, let the [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] `$AB$` exceed the [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] `$AC$` by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) `$DB$`.

* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$` be laid down.
* And let the rectangular [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FH$`, equal to `$AB$`, have been applied to to `$EF$`, producing `$EH$` as breadth.
* And let `$FG$`, equal to `$AC$`, have been cut off (from `$FH$`).
* Thus, the remainder `$BD$` is equal to the remainder `$KH$`.
* And `$DB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$KH$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Therefore, since `$AB$` and `$AC$` are each [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and `$AB$` is equal to `$FH$`, and `$AC$` to `$FG$`, `$FH$` and `$FG$` are thus each also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And they are applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`.
* Thus, `$HE$` and `$EG$` are each [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since `$DB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and is equal to `$KH$`, `$KH$` is thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And ($KH$) is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`.
* `$GH$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* But, `$EG$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$`.
* Thus, `$EG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And as `$EG$` is to `$GH$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$EG$` and `$GH$` [ [Prop. 10.13 lem.] ][bookofproofs$2371].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$EG$` and `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* But, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` and `$GH$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$EG$`.
* For ($EG$ and `$GH$` are) both [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$EG$` and `$GH$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$EG$` and `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* For (the former) is double the latter.
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$EG$` and `$GH$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$EG$` and `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And thus the sum of the (squares) on `$EG$` and `$GH$` plus twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$EG$` and `$GH$`, that is the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EH$` [[Prop. 2.4]][bookofproofs$1017], is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$EG$` and `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.16]][bookofproofs$2110].
* And the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$EG$` and `$GH$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EH$` is irrational [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* Thus, `$EH$` is irrational [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* But, (it is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] does not exceed a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
