> Given a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and a binomial ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which has been divided into its (component) terms, of which the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater term is larger than (the square on) the lesser by the (square) on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with (the greater) then, if the greater term is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] previously) laid out, let [the whole] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) be called a **first binomial** ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation

The **first binomial** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is `\[\alpha+\alpha\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}},\]` 
where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
