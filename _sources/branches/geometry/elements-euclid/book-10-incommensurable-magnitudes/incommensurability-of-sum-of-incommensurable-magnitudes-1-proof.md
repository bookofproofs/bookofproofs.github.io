* For let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AD$`, falling short by the square figure `$DB$`, have been applied to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.
* I say that `$AD$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.

* And it is immediately obvious.
* For since `$DB$` is a square, `$DC$` is equal to `$CB$`.
* And `$AD$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CD$` - that is to say, by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* Thus, if ... to some [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and so on ....
