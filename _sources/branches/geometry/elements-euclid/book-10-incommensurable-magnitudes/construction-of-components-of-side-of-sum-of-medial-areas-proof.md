* Let the two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, be laid out containing a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], such that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$BC$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AB$) [[Prop. 10.32]][bookofproofs$2126].
* And let the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$ADB$` have been drawn on `$AB$`.
* And let the remainder (of the figure) be generated similarly to the above (proposition).
* And since `$AF$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FB$` [[Prop. 10.18]][bookofproofs$2112], `$AD$` is also [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with `$DB$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], the sum of the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` (is) thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911], [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AF$` and `$FB$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on each of `$BE$` and `$DF$`, `$BE$` is thus equal to `$DF$`.
* Thus, `$BC$` (is) double `$FD$`.
* And hence the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is double the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$FD$`.
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$FD$` (is) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` [ [Prop. 10.32 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6476].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` (is) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And since `$AB$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`, and `$CB$` (is) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BE$`, `$AB$` (is) thus also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BE$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And hence the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BE$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* But the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$FD$` - that is to say, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` - is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BE$`.
* Thus, the sum of the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`.
* Thus, two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AD$` and `$DB$`, (which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], have been found, making the sum of the (squares) on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and, moreover, [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them.[^1] 
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: `$AD$` and `$DB$` have lengths `$k'^{1/4}\sqrt{[1+k/(1+k^2)^{1/2}]/2}$` and `$k'^{1/4}\sqrt{[1-k/(1+k^2)^{1/2}]/2}$` times that of `$AB$`, respectively, where `$k$` and `$k'$` are defined in the footnote to [[Prop. 10.32]][bookofproofs$2126] (translator's note).
