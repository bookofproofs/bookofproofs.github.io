### (Proposition 84 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Only one [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with the whole, and (together) with the whole makes the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and, moreover, [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of the (squares) on them, can be attached to that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.

* Let `$AB$` be a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole, `$BC$` being (so) attached to it.
* Thus, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], fulfilling the (other) aforementioned (conditions) [[Prop. 10.78]][bookofproofs$2172].
* I say that a(nother) ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) fulfilling the aforementioned (conditions) cannot be attached to `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

In other words, `\[\beta^{1/4}\sqrt{\frac{1+\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}}-\beta^{1/4}\sqrt{\frac{1-\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}}=\gamma^{1/4}\sqrt{\frac{1+\delta}{2\sqrt{1+\delta^2}}} - \gamma^{1/4}\sqrt{\frac{1-\delta}{2\sqrt{1+\delta^2}}}\]` has only one solution: i.e., `\[\delta=\alpha\quad\text{ and }\quad\gamma=\beta,\]`

where `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

This proposition corresponds to [[Prop. 10.47]][bookofproofs$2141], with minus signs instead of plus signs.
