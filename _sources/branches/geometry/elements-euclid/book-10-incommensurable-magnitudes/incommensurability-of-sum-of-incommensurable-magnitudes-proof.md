* For let the two [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes `$AB$` and `$BC$` be laid down together.
* I say that that the whole `$AC$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$AB$` and `$BC$`.

* For if `$CA$` and `$AB$` are not [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] then some magnitude will measure [them].
* If possible, let it (so) measure (them), and let it be `$D$`.
* Therefore, since `$D$` measures (both) `$CA$` and `$AB$`, it will thus also measure the remainder `$BC$`.
* And it also measures `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$D$` measures (both) `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` and `$BC$` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [ [Def. 10.1] ][bookofproofs$1095].
* But they were also assumed (to be) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, some magnitude cannot measure (both) `$CA$` and `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$CA$` and `$AB$` are [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [ [Def. 10.1] ][bookofproofs$1095].
* So, similarly, we can show that `$AC$` and `$CB$` are also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
* Thus, `$AC$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* And so let `$AC$` be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with one of `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* So let it, first of all, be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$AB$` and `$BC$` are also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
* For if they are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] then some magnitude will measure them.
* Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be `$D$`.
* Therefore, since `$D$` measures (both) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, it will thus also measure the whole `$AC$`.
* And it also measures `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$D$` measures (both) `$CA$` and `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$CA$` and `$AB$` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [ [Def. 10.1] ][bookofproofs$1095].
* But they were also assumed (to be) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, some magnitude cannot measure (both) `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` and `$BC$` are [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [ [Def. 10.1] ][bookofproofs$1095].
* Thus, if two\ldots magnitudes, and so on ....
