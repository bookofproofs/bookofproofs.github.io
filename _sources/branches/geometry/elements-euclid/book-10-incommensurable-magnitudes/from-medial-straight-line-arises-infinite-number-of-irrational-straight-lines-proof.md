* Let `$A$` be a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* I say that an infinite (series) of [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) can be created from `$A$`, and that none of them is the same as any of the preceding ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).

* Let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$B$` be laid down.
* And let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$` be equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$B$` and `$A$`.
* Thus, `$C$` is irrational [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* For an (area contained) by an [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] and a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* And ($C$ is) not the same as any of the preceding ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* For the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on none of the preceding ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) as breadth.
* So, again, let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$` be equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$B$` and `$C$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$D$` is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* `$D$` is thus irrational [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* And ($D$ is) not the same as any of the preceding ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* For the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on none of the preceding ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces `$C$` as breadth.
* So, similarly, this arrangement being advanced to infinity, it is clear that an infinite (series) of [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) can be created from a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and that none of them is the same as any of the preceding ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
