### (Proposition 34 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
