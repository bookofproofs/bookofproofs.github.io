* Let `$A$` and `$BC$` be two unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], of which (let) `$BC$` (be) the greater.
* And let a ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) equal to the fourth [part] of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the lesser, `$A$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, have been applied to `$BC$`.
* And let it be the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BDC$`.
* And let `$BD$` be [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DC$`.
* I say that that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than the (square on) `$A$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BC$).

* For, similarly, by the same construction as before, we can show that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than the (square on) `$A$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FD$`.
* Therefore, it must be shown that `$BC$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DF$`.
* For since `$BD$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DC$`, `$BC$` is thus also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.16]][bookofproofs$2110].
* But, `$DC$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of `$BF$` and `$DC$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And, thus, `$BC$` is [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of `$BF$` and `$DC$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Hence, `$BC$` is also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the remainder `$FD$` [[Prop. 10.16]][bookofproofs$2110].
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than the (square on) `$A$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FD$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than the (square on) `$A$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BC$).
* So, again, let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` be greater than the (square on) `$A$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BC$).
* And let a ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) equal to the fourth [part] of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, have been applied to `$BC$`.
* And let it be the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$DC$`.
* It must be shown that `$BD$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DC$`.
* For, similarly, by the same construction, we can show that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FD$`.
* But, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BC$).
* Thus, `$BC$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FD$`.
* Hence, `$BC$` is also [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the remaining sum of `$BF$` and `$DC$` [[Prop. 10.16]][bookofproofs$2110].
* But, the sum of `$BF$` and `$DC$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DC$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* Thus, `$BC$` is also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DC$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Hence, via [separation][bookofproofs$1954], `$BD$` is also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DC$` [[Prop. 10.16]][bookofproofs$2110].
* Thus, if there are two ... [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and so on ....
