* For let the two magnitudes `$A$` and `$B$` not have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315].
* I say that the magnitudes `$A$` and `$B$` are [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].

* For if they are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095], `$A$` will have to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] [[Prop. 10.5]][bookofproofs$2099].
* But it does not have (such a ratio).
* Thus, the magnitudes `$A$` and `$B$` are [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
* Thus, if two magnitudes ... to one another, and so on ....
