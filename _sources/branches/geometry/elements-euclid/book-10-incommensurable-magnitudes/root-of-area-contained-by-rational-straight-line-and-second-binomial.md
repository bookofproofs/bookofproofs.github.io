### (Proposition 55 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131].
* For let the area `$ABCD$` be contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and by the [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AC$` is a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).\

### Modern Formulation

If the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has [unit][bookofproofs$2314] length then this proposition states that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]: i.e., a [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has a length `\[\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}}}+\alpha,\]` whose [square root][bookofproofs$46] can be written `\[\rho\,(\delta^{1/4}+\delta^{3/4}),\]` where `\[\rho=\sqrt{\frac{k(1+\beta)}{2(1-\beta)}}\quad\text{ and }\quad\delta=\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}.\]`
This is the length of a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] (see [[Prop. 10.37]][bookofproofs$2131]), since `$\rho, \delta,\alpha,\beta$` are all [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
