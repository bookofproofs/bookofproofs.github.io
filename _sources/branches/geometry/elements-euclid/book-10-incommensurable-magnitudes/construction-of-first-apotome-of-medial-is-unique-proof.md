* For let `$AB$` be a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and let `$BC$` be (so) attached to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, containing a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) - (namely, that contained) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 10.74]][bookofproofs$2168].
* I say that a(nother) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, and contains a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) with the whole, cannot be attached to `$AB$`.

* For, if possible, let `$DB$` also be (so) attached to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AD$` and `$DB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, containing a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) - (namely, that) contained by `$AD$` and `$DB$` [[Prop. 10.74]][bookofproofs$2168].
* And since by whatever (area) the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` also exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by this (same area).
* For [again] both exceed by the same (area) - (namely), the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* Thus, alternately, by whatever (area) the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` exceeds the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$`, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` also exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by this (same area).
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* For both (are) [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (areas).
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` also exceeds the (sum of the) [squares] on `$AC$` and `$CB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* For both are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109], [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462], and a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] cannot exceed a(nother) [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) [[Prop. 10.26]][bookofproofs$2120].
* Thus, only one [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, and contains a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) with the whole, can be attached to a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
