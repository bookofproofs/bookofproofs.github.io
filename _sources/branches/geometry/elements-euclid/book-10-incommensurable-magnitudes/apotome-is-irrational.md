### Euclid's Formulation

> If a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, is subtracted from a(nother) [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then the remainder is an irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]). Let it be called an **apotome**.

* For let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BC$`, which [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, have been subtracted from the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$`.
* I say that the remainder `$AC$` is that irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called an **apotome**.

### Modern Formulation

An **apotome** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is expressible as 

`\[1 -\sqrt{\delta},\]` 

for some [positive rational number][bookofproofs$1076] `\(\delta\)`. See also [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
