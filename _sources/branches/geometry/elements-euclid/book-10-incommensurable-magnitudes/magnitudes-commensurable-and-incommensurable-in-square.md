> (Two) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are *commensurable in square[^1]* when the squares on them are measured by the same area, but (are) **incommensurable (in square)** when no area admits to be a common measure of the squares on them.

### Modern Formulation

Two [segments][bookofproofs$645] of lengths `\(\alpha > 0\)` and `\(\beta > 0\)` are called 
 **commensurable in square**, if there exists a figure of area `\(\gamma\)` being an [aliquot part][bookofproofs$2316] of the [square][bookofproofs$909] areas `\(\alpha^2\)` and `\(\beta^2\)`, i.e. such that `\[\alpha^2=p\gamma,\quad\beta^2=q\gamma\]`
for some [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `\(p > 0\)` and `\(q > 0\)`.

Equivalently, the segments are commensurable in square, if the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of their squares is a [rational number][bookofproofs$1033], formally,
`\[\frac{\alpha^2}{\beta^2}=\frac{p\gamma}{q\gamma}=\frac pq.\]`

If `\(\alpha,\beta\)` are not commensurable in square, we call them **incommensurable in square**.

[^1]: Literally, "in power" (translator's note)
