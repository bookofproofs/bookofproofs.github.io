* Let `$AB$` be the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] which has been divided at `$C$`, so that `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.40]][bookofproofs$2134].
* I say that `$AB$` cannot be (so) divided at another [point][bookofproofs$631].

* For, if possible, let it also have been divided at `$D$`, so that `$AD$` and `$DB$` are also [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Therefore, since by whatever (amount) twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` differs from twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`, (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` also differs from (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` by this (same amount).
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* (The sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` thus also exceeds (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area), (despite both) being [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 10.26]][bookofproofs$2120].
* Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] cannot be divided (into its component terms) at different [points][bookofproofs$631].
* Thus, it can be (so) divided at one [point][bookofproofs$631] (only).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
