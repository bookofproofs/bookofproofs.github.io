### (Lemma to Proposition 13 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> For two given unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], to find by (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) which ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] is) larger than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the lesser.
* Let `$AB$` and `$C$` be the two given unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and let `$AB$` be the greater of them.
* So it is required to find by (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) which ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$C$`.

### Modern Formulation

That is, if `$\alpha$` and `$\beta$` are the [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] denoting the lengths of two given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], with `$\alpha > \beta$`, to find a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] of length `$\gamma$` such that `$\alpha^2=\beta^2+\gamma^2$`. Similarly, we can also find `$\gamma$` such that `$\gamma^2=\alpha^2+\beta^2$`.
