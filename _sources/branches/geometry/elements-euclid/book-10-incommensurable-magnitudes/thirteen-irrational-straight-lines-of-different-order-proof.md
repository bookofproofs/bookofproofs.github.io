* For the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) to which (the area) is applied [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] [[Prop. 10.97]][bookofproofs$2191].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] [[Prop. 10.98]][bookofproofs$2192].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [third apotome][bookofproofs$2093] [[Prop. 10.99]][bookofproofs$2193].
* And [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [fourth apotome][bookofproofs$2094] [[Prop. 10.100]][bookofproofs$2194].
* And [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) produces a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole, applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [fifth apotome][bookofproofs$6445] [[Prop. 10.101]][bookofproofs$2195].
* And [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] produces a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole, applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth a [sixth apotome][bookofproofs$6446] [[Prop. 10.102]][bookofproofs$2196].
* Therefore, since the aforementioned breadths differ from the first (breadth), and from one another - from the first, because it is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and from one another since they are not the same in order[^1] - clearly, the [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) themselves also differ from one another.
* And since it has been shown that an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] is not the same as a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] [[Prop. 10.111]][bookofproofs$2205], and (that) the ([irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) after the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], being applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produce as breadth, each according to its own (order), apotomes, and (that) the ([irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) after the [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] themselves also (produce as breadth), according (to their) order, [binomial][bookofproofs$2130]s, the ([irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) after the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] are thus different, and the ([irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) after the [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] (are also) different, so that there are, in order, 13 [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) in all:
   * [Medial][bookofproofs$2115],
   * [Binomial][bookofproofs$2130],
   * [First bimedial][bookofproofs$2131],
   * [Second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132],
   * [Major][bookofproofs$2133],
   * [Square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462],
   * [Square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas),
   * [Apotome][bookofproofs$2167],
   * [First apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115],
   * [Second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115],
   * [Minor][bookofproofs$2170],
   * That which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) produces a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole,
   * That which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] produces a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.

[^1]: Euclid's expression "(not) being the same in order" means that the resulting irrational number is "(not) of the same kind" as that irrational number, with which it is commensurable.
