* Let `$AB$` be a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and let `$CD$` be [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$CD$` is a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* Let `$AB$` have been divided (into its component terms) at `$E$`.
* `$AE$` and `$EB$` are thus [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.39]][bookofproofs$2133].
* And let (the) same (things) have been contrived as in the previous (propositions).
* And since as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$AE$` (is) to `$CF$` and `$EB$` to `$FD$`, thus also as `$AE$` (is) to `$CF$`, so `$EB$` (is) to `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* And `$AB$` (is) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$AE$` and `$EB$` (are) also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CF$` and `$FD$`, respectively [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And since as `$AE$` is to `$CF$`, so `$EB$` (is) to `$FD$`, also, alternately, as `$AE$` (is) to `$EB$`, so `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973], and thus, via [composition][bookofproofs$1953], as `$AB$` is to `$BE$`, so `$CD$` (is) to `$DF$` [[Prop. 5.18]][bookofproofs$1975].
* And thus as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DF$` [[Prop. 6.20]][bookofproofs$2006].
* So, similarly, we can also show that as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$`.
* And thus as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) to (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AE$` and `$EB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` (is) to (the sum of) the (squares) on `$CF$` and `$FD$`.
* And thus, alternately, as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$`, so (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AE$` and `$EB$` (is) to (the sum of) the (squares) on `$CF$` and `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$CD$`.
* Thus, (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AE$` and `$EB$` (is) also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with (the sum of) the (squares) on `$CF$` and `$FD$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And the (squares) on `$AE$` and `$EB$` (added) together are [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* The (squares) on `$CF$` and `$FD$` (added) together (are) thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* So, similarly, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$`.
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Therefore, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$` (is) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* `$CF$` and `$FD$` are thus ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107], simultaneously making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* The whole, `$CD$`, is thus that irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called [major][bookofproofs$2133] [[Prop. 10.39]][bookofproofs$2133].
* Thus, a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with a [major][bookofproofs$2133] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is [major][bookofproofs$2133].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
