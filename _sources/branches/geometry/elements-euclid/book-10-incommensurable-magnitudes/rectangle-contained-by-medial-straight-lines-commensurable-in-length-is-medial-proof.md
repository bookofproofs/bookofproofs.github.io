* For let the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] `$AC$` be contained by the [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$BC$` (which are) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095].
* I say that `$AC$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115].

* For let the square `$AD$` have been described on `$AB$`.
* `$AD$` is thus [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [see previous footnote].
* And since `$AB$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`, and `$AB$` (is) equal to `$BD$`, `$DB$` is thus also [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`.
* Hence, `$DA$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$DA$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$AC$` (is) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
