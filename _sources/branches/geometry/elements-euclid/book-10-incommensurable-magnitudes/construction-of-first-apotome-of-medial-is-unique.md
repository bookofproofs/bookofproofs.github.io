### (Proposition 80 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Only one [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, and contains a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) with the whole, can be attached to a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For let `$AB$` be a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and let `$BC$` be (so) attached to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, containing a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) - (namely, that contained) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 10.74]][bookofproofs$2168].
* I say that a(nother) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, and contains a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) with the whole, cannot be attached to `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

In other words, the [first apotome of a medial straight line][bookofproofs$2168] is unique, i.e. `\[\alpha^{1/4} - \alpha^{3/4} = \beta^{1/4} - \beta^{3/4}\]` has only one solution: i.e., 
`\[\beta=\alpha,\]`
where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

This proposition corresponds to [[Prop. 10.43]][bookofproofs$2137], with minus signs instead of plus signs.
