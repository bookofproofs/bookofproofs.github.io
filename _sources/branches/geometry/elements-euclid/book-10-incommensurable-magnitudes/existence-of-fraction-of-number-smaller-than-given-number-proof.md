* Let `$AB$` and `$C$` be two unequal magnitudes, of which (let) `$AB$` (be) the greater.
* I say that if (a part) greater than half is subtracted from `$AB$`, and (if a part) greater than half (is subtracted) from the remainder, and (if) this happens continually, then some magnitude will (eventually) be left which will be less than the magnitude `$C$`.

* For `$C$`, when multiplied (by some number), will sometimes be greater than `$AB$` [ [Def. 5.4] ][bookofproofs$6441].
* Let it have been (so) multiplied.
* And let `$DE$` be (both) a [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of `$C$`, and greater than `$AB$`.
* And let `$DE$` have been divided into the (divisions) `$DF$`, `$FG$`, `$GE$`, equal to `$C$`.
* And let `$BH$`, (which is) greater than half, have been subtracted from `$AB$`.
* And (let) `$HK$`, (which is) greater than half, (have been subtracted) from `$AH$`.
* And let this happen continually, until the divisions in `$AB$` become equal in number to the divisions in `$DE$`.
* Therefore, let the divisions (in `$AB$`) be `$AK$`, `$KH$`, `$HB$`, being equal in number to `$DF$`, `$FG$`, `$GE$`.
* And since `$DE$` is greater than `$AB$`, and `$EG$`, (which is) less than half, has been subtracted from `$DE$`, and `$BH$`, (which is) greater than half, from `$AB$`, the remainder `$GD$` is thus greater than the remainder `$HA$`.
* And since `$GD$` is greater than `$HA$`, and the half `$GF$` has been subtracted from `$GD$`, and `$HK$`, (which is) greater than half, from `$HA$`, the remainder `$DF$` is thus greater than the remainder `$AK$`.
* And `$DF$` (is) equal to `$C$`.
* `$C$` is thus also greater than `$AK$`.
* Thus, `$AK$` (is) less than `$C$`.
* Thus, the magnitude `$AK$`, which is less than the lesser laid out magnitude `$C$`, is left over from the magnitude `$AB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
*  -  (The theorem) can similarly be proved even if the (parts) subtracted are halves.
