* Let `$AB$` be a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole, `$BC$` being (so) attached to it.
* Thus, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], fulfilling the (other) aforementioned (conditions) [[Prop. 10.78]][bookofproofs$2172].
* I say that a(nother) ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) fulfilling the aforementioned (conditions) cannot be attached to `$AB$`.

* For, if possible, let `$BD$` be (so) attached.
* Hence, `$AD$` and `$DB$` are also ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` and `$DB$` (added) together [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and, moreover, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` [[Prop. 10.78]][bookofproofs$2172].
* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$` be laid down.
* And let `$EG$`, equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$`, have been applied to `$EF$`, producing `$EM$` as breadth.
* And let `$HG$`, equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`, have been applied to `$EF$`, producing `$HM$` as breadth.
* Thus, the remaining [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is equal to `$EL$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* Thus, `$AB$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$EL$`.
* Again, let `$EI$`, equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$`, have been applied to `$EF$`, producing `$EN$` as breadth.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is also equal to `$EL$`.
* Thus, the remaining twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` [is] equal to `$HI$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* And since the sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and is equal to `$EG$`, `$EG$` is thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`, producing `$EM$` as breadth.
* `$EM$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* Again, since twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and is equal to `$HG$`, `$HG$` is thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`, producing `$HM$` as breadth.
* `$HM$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`, `$EG$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$HG$`.
* Thus, `$EM$` is also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$MH$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they are both [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$EM$` and `$MH$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$EH$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167], with `$HM$` attached to it.
* So, similarly, we can show that `$EH$` is again an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], with `$HN$` attached to it.
* Thus, different [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), which are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, are attached to an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* The very thing was shown (to be) impossible [[Prop. 10.79]][bookofproofs$2173].
* Thus, another [straight line][bookofproofs$645] cannot be (so) attached to `$AB$`.
* Thus, only one [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with the whole, and (together) with the whole makes the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them (added) together [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and, moreover, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them, can be attached to `$AB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
