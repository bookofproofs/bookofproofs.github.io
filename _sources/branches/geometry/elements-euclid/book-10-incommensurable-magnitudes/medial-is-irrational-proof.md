* For let the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] `$AC$` be contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$BC$` (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* I say that `$AC$` is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083], and its [square root][bookofproofs$46] is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] - let it be called **medial**.

* For let the square `$AD$` have been described on `$AB$`.
* `$AD$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* And since `$AB$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`.
* For they were assumed to be [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* And `$AB$` (is) equal to `$BD$`.
* `$DB$` is thus also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`.
* And as `$DB$` is to `$BC$`, so `$AD$` (is) to `$AC$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$DA$` [is] [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$DA$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$AC$` is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* Hence, its [square root][bookofproofs$46] [that is to say, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the square equal to it] is also [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084] - let it be called **medial**.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
