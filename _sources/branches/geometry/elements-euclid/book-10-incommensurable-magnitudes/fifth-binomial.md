> And if the lesser (term is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), a **fifth (binomial** [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation

The **fifth binomial** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is `\[\alpha\,(\sqrt{1+\beta}+1),\]`

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
