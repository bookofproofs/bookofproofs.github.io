### (Proposition 7 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> [Incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes do not have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315].
* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes.
* I say that `$A$` does not have to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315].
