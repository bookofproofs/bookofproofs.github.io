### (Proposition 53 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find a [sixth binomial][bookofproofs$2090] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$AC$` and `$CB$` be laid down such that `$AB$` does not have to each of them the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* And let `$D$` also be another [number][bookofproofs$2315], which is not [square][bookofproofs$2326], and does not have to each of `$BA$` and `$AC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either [ [Prop. 10.28 lem. I] ][bookofproofs$6474].
* And let some [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$E$` be laid down.
* And let it have been contrived that as `$D$` (is) to `$AB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` (is) [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And `$E$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$FG$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since `$D$` does not have to `$AB$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$` thus does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$E$` (is) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* So, again, let it have be contrived that as `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) thus [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$HG$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HG$` (is) thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$HG$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since `$BA$` does not have to `$AC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$FG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Thus, `$FG$` and `$GH$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$FH$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, we must show that (it is) also a [sixth (binomial][bookofproofs$2090] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

### Modern Formulation

If the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has [unit][bookofproofs$2314] length then the length of a [sixth binomial][bookofproofs$2090] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is `\[\sqrt{\alpha}+\sqrt{\beta},\]` 

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes


This, and the [sixth apotome][bookofproofs$6446], whose length according to  [[Prop. 10.90]][bookofproofs$2184] is `\[\sqrt{\alpha}-\sqrt{\beta},\]` are the roots of the quadratic function `\[x^2- 2\,\sqrt{\alpha}\,x+(\alpha-\beta)=0,\]`
where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
