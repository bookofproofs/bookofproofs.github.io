* Let `$AB$` and `$C$` be the two given unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and let `$AB$` be the greater of them.
* So it is required to find by (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) which ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$C$`.

* Let the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$ADB$` have been described on `$AB$`.
* And let `$AD$`, equal to `$C$`, have been [inserted into it][bookofproofs$1012] [[Prop. 4.1]][bookofproofs$1925].
* And let `$DB$` have been joined.
* So (it is) clear that the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ADB$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911], and that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$AD$` - that is to say, (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$C$` - by (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$DB$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And, similarly, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on) two given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] is also found likeso.
* Let `$AD$` and `$DB$` be the two given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* And let it be necessary to find the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on) them.
* For let them have been laid down such as to encompass a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] - (namely), that (angle encompassed) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`.
* And let `$AB$` have been joined.
* (It is) again clear that `$AB$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on) `$AD$` and `$DB$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
