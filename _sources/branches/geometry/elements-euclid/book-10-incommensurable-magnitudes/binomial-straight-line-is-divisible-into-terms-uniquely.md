### Euclid's Formulation

> A [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) can be divided into its (component) terms at one [point][bookofproofs$631] only.
* Let `$AB$` be a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which has been divided into its (component) terms at `$C$`.
* `$AC$` and `$CB$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* I say that `$AB$` cannot be divided at another [point][bookofproofs$631] into two [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.

### Modern Formulation

 
In other words, 
`\[\alpha + \sqrt{\beta} = \gamma + \sqrt{\delta}\]` has only one solution: i.e., `\[\gamma=\alpha\quad\text{ and }\quad\delta=\beta,\]` where `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
Likewise, `\[\sqrt{\alpha} + \sqrt{\beta} =\sqrt{\gamma}+\sqrt{\delta}\]` has only one solution: i.e., `\[\gamma=\alpha\quad\text{ and }\quad\delta=\beta,\]` or, equivalently, 
`\[\gamma=\beta\quad\text{ and }\quad\delta=\alpha.\]`

### Notes

This proposition corresponds to [[Prop. 10.79]][bookofproofs$2173], with plus signs instead of minus signs.
