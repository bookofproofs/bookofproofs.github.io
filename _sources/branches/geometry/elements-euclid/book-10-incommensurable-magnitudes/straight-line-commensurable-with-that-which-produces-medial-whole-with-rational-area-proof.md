* Let `$AB$` be a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole, and (let) `$CD$` (be) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$CD$` is also a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (whole).

* For let `$BE$` be an attachment to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AE$` and `$EB$` are ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` and `$EB$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.77]][bookofproofs$2171].
* And let the same construction have been made (as in the previous propositions).
* So, similarly to the previous (propositions), we can show that `$CF$` and `$FD$` are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$AE$` and `$EB$`, and the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` and `$EB$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` and `$FD$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$`.
* Hence, `$CF$` and `$FD$` are also ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` and `$FD$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* `$CD$` is thus a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole [[Prop. 10.77]][bookofproofs$2171].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
