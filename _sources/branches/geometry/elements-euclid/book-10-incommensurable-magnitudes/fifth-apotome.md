### (Definition 15 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> And if the attached ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095]), a **fifth (apotome)**.

### Modern Formulation

The **fifth apotome** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is `\[\alpha\,(\sqrt{1+\beta}-1),\]` 

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
