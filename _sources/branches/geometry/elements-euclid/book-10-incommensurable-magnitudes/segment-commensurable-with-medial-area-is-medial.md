### (Corollary to Proposition 23 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> And (it is) clear, from this, that an (area) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with a **medial area** is [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
### Modern Formulation

A **medial area** is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on some [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]. Hence, a **medial area** is expressible as  `\[\left(\frac pq\right)^{1/2},\]` for some [rational number][bookofproofs$1033] `$p/q$`. And an area, which is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with a medial area is itself [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
