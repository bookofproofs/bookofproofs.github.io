### (Corollary to Proposition 111 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> The [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] and the [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) after it are neither the same as a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) nor (the same) as one another.
(In particular,) there are, in order, 13 (different)[^1] [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) in all:
   * [Medial][bookofproofs$2115],
   * [Binomial][bookofproofs$2130],
   * [First bimedial][bookofproofs$2131],
   * [Second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132],
   * [Major][bookofproofs$2133],
   * [Square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462],
   * [Square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas),
   * [Apotome][bookofproofs$2167],
   * [First apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115],
   * [Second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115],
   * [Minor][bookofproofs$2170],
   * That which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) produces a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole,
   * That which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] produces a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.

### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)

[^1]: Euclid's expression "(not) being the same in order" means that the resulting irrational number is "(not) of the same kind" as that irrational number, with which it is commensurable.
