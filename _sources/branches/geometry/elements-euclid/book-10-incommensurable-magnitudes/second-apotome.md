### (Definition 12 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> And if the attached ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the whole is greater than (the square on) the attached ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) by the (square) on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with (the whole), then let the (apotome) be called a **second apotome**.

### Modern Formulation


The **second apotome** is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] whose length is 
 `\[\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}}}-\alpha,\]`


where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
