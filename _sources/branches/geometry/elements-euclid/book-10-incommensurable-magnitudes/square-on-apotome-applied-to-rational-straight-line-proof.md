* Let `$AB$` be an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], and `$CD$` a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let `$CE$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$CF$` as breadth.
* I say that `$CF$` is a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091].

* For let `$BG$` be an attachment to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AG$` and `$GB$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* And let `$CH$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$`, and `$KL$`, (equal) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$`, have been applied to `$CD$`.
* Thus, the whole of `$CL$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$`, of which `$CE$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`.
* The remainder `$FL$` is thus equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* Let `$FM$` have been cut in half at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`.
* And let `$NO$` have been drawn through `$N$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$FO$` and `$LN$` are each equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`.
* And since the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and `$DM$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$`, `$DM$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And it has been applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$`, producing `$CM$` as breadth.
* Thus, `$CM$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* Again, since twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and `$FL$` (is) equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`, `$FL$` (is) thus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$`, producing `$FM$` as breadth.
* `$FM$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115], the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` is thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`.
* And `$CL$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$`, and `$FL$` to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`.
* `$DM$` is thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FL$`.
* And as `$DM$` (is) to `$FL$`, so `$CM$` is to `$FM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* `$CM$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FM$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And both are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$CM$` and `$MF$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$CF$` is thus an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [first (apotome) ][bookofproofs$2091].
* For since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to the (squares) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473], and `$CH$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$`, and `$KL$` equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$`, and `$NL$` to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`, `$NL$` is thus also [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$CH$` and `$KL$`.
* Thus, as `$CH$` is to `$NL$`, so `$NL$` (is) to `$KL$`.
* But, as `$CH$` (is) to `$NL$`, so `$CK$` is to `$NM$`, and as `$NL$` (is) to `$KL$`, so `$NM$` is to `$KM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CK$` and `$KM$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$NM$` - that is to say, to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FM$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$GB$`, `$CH$` [is] also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KL$`.
* And as `$CH$` (is) to `$KL$`, so `$CK$` (is) to `$KM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* `$CK$` is thus [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KM$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Therefore, since `$CM$` and `$MF$` are two unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CK$` and `$KM$`, equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FM$`, has been applied to `$CM$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, and `$CK$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KM$`, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CM$` is thus greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$MF$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($CM$) [[Prop. 10.17]][bookofproofs$2111].
* And `$CM$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$CF$` is a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] [ [Def. 10.15] ][bookofproofs$6445].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] as breadth.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
