* Let `$AB$` be a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole, and let `$CD$` be [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$CD$` is also a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.

* For let `$BE$` be an attachment to `$AB$`.
* And let the same construction have been made (as in the previous propositions).
* Thus, `$AE$` and `$EB$` are ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and, further, the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [[Prop. 10.78]][bookofproofs$2172].
* And, as was shown (previously), `$AE$` and `$EB$` are [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CF$` and `$FD$` (respectively), and the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` and `$EB$` with the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CF$` and `$FD$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FD$`.
* Thus, `$CF$` and `$FD$` are also ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and, further, the sum of the [squares] on them [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them.
* Thus, `$CD$` is a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole [[Prop. 10.78]][bookofproofs$2172].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
