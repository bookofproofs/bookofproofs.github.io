* For let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BC$`, which [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, have been subtracted from the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$`.
* I say that the remainder `$AC$` is that irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called an **apotome**.

* For since `$AB$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`, and as `$AB$` is to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* But, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And, inasmuch as the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CA$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021], the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is thus also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the remaining [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107], [[Prop. 10.16]][bookofproofs$2110].
* And the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* `$AC$` is thus an irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* And let it be called an **apotome**.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
