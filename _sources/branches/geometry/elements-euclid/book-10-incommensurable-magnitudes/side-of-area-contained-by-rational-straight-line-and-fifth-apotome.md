### (Proposition 95 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [fifth apotome][bookofproofs$6445] then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.
* For let the area `$AB$` have been contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$` and the [fifth apotome][bookofproofs$6445] `$AD$`.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AB$` is that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.
