> Those magnitudes measured by the same measure are said (to be) **commensurable (in length)**, but (those) of which no (magnitude) admits to be a common measure (are said to be) **incommensurable (in length)**.

### Modern Formulation

Two [segments][bookofproofs$645] of lengths `\(\alpha > 0\)` and `\(\beta > 0\)` are called 
 **commensurable (in length)**, if there exists a segment of length `\(\gamma\)` being an [aliquot part][bookofproofs$2316] of both,  `\(\alpha\)` and `\(\beta\)`, i.e. such that `\[\alpha=p\gamma,\quad\beta=q\gamma\]`
for some [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `\(p > 0\)` and `\(q > 0\)`.

Equivalently, the segments are commensurable, if their [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] is a [rational number][bookofproofs$1033], formally,
`\[\frac{\alpha}\beta=\frac{p\gamma}{q\gamma}=\frac pq.\]`

If `\(\alpha,\beta\)` are not commensurable, we call them **incommensurable (in length)**.
