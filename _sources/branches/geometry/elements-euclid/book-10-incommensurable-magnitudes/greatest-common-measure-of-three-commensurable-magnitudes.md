### (Proposition 4 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find the greatest common measure of three given [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes.
* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` be the three given [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes.
* So it is required to find the greatest common measure of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
