### (Proposition 64 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> The [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) produces as breadth a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).[^1]

* Let `$AB$` be the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] having been divided into its (component) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] at `$C$`, such that `$AC$` is greater.
* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$` be laid down.
* And let the ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$DF$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$DE$`, producing `$DG$` as breadth.
* I say that `$DG$` is a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] [straight line][bookofproofs$645].

### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)

[^1]: In other words, the square of the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus [medial][bookofproofs$2115] is a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089]. See [[Prop. 10.58]][bookofproofs$2152] (translator's note).
