* Let `$AB$` be a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole, and let `$BC$` be (so) attached to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], fulfilling the (other) proscribed (conditions) [[Prop. 10.77]][bookofproofs$2171].
* I say that another ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) fulfilling the same (conditions) cannot be attached to `$AB$`.

* For, if possible, let `$BD$` be (so) attached (to `$AB$`).
* Thus, `$AD$` and `$DB$` are also [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], fulfilling the (other) prescribed (conditions) [[Prop. 10.77]][bookofproofs$2171].
* Therefore, analogously to the (propositions) before this, since by whatever (area) the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` exceeds the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$`, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` also exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by this (same area).
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* For they are (both) [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (areas).
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` also exceeds the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* For both are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) [[Prop. 10.26]][bookofproofs$2120].
* Thus, another [straight line][bookofproofs$645] cannot be attached to `$AB$`, which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with the whole, and fulfills the (other) aforementioned (conditions) with the whole.
* Thus, only one (such [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) can be (so) attached.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
