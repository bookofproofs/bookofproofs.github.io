* Let `$AB$` be a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) having been divided into its (component) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) at `$C$`, of which `$AC$` (is) the greater.
* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$` be laid down.
* And let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$DF$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$DE$`, producing `$DG$` as breadth.
* I say that `$DG$` is a [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For let the same construction have been made as in the (proposition) before this.
* And since `$AB$` is a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), having been divided at `$C$`, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are thus [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and containing a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) [[Prop. 10.37]][bookofproofs$2131].
* Hence, the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` are also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$DL$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109], [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* And it has been applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`.
* `$MD$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* Again, since twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], `$MF$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$ML$`.
* Thus, `$MG$` [is] also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$ML$` - that is to say, with `$DE$` [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* `$DM$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$MG$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And they are [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* `$DM$` and `$MG$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$DG$` is thus a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, we must show that (it is) also a [second (binomial][bookofproofs$2086] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* For since (the sum of) the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is greater than twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 10.59]][bookofproofs$2153], `$DL$` (is) thus also greater than `$MF$`.
* Hence, `$DM$` (is) also (greater) than `$MG$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$CB$`, `$DH$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KL$`.
* Hence, `$DK$` is also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DKM$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MN$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DM$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$MG$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($DM$) [[Prop. 10.17]][bookofproofs$2111].
* And `$MG$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$DG$` is a [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.6] ][bookofproofs$2086].
