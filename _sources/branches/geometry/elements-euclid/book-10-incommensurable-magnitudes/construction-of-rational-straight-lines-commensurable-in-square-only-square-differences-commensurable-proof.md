* For let some [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` be laid down, and two [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326], `$CD$` and `$DE$`, such that the difference between them, `$CE$`, is not [square][bookofproofs$2326] [ [Prop. 10.28 lem. I] ][bookofproofs$6474].
* And let the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$AFB$` have been drawn on `$AB$`.
* And let it be contrived that as `$DC$` (is) to `$CE$`, so the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` (is) to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* And let `$FB$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$`, so `$DC$` (is) to `$CE$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` thus has to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$DC$` (has) to the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$CE$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$AF$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$AF$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since `$DC$` does not have to `$CE$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` thus does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] has to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$AB$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AF$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Thus, the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BA$` and `$AF$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* And since as `$DC$` [is] to `$CE$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$`, thus, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], as `$CD$` (is) to `$DE$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$` [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2, [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911], [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And `$CD$` has to `$DE$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` also has to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] has to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* `$AB$` is thus [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BF$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AF$` and `$FB$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$AF$` by (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$BF$`, (which is) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AB$).
* Thus, two [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$BA$` and `$AF$`, [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, have been found such that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater, `$AB$`, is larger than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the lesser, `$AF$`, by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$`, (which is) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AB$).[^1]
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: `$BA$` and `$AF$` have lengths `$1$` and `$\sqrt{1-\rho^2}$` times that of `$AB$`, respectively, where `$\rho=\sqrt{DE/CD}$` for some rational number `\(\rho\)` (translator's note)
