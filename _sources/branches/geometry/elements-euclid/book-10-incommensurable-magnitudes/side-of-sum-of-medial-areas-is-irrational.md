### (Proposition 41 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and, moreover, [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them, are added together then the whole [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is irrational - let it be called the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).
* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$` and `$BC$`, [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], (and) fulfilling the prescribed (conditions), be laid down together [[Prop. 10.35]][bookofproofs$2129].
* I say that `$AC$` is irrational.

### Modern Formulation

Thus, the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) has a length expressible as 
`\[\beta^{1/4}\left(\sqrt{\frac 12+\frac{\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}} +\sqrt{\frac 12-\frac{\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}}\right)\]`
for some [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076] `\(\alpha,\beta\)`. 

### Notes

This and the corresponding irrational with a minus sign[^1], whose length is expressible as 
`\[\beta^{1/4}\left(\sqrt{\frac 12+\frac{\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}} -\sqrt{\frac 12-\frac{\alpha}{2\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}}\right)\]` (see [[Prop. 10.78]][bookofproofs$2172]), are the positive roots of the quartic 
`\[x^4-2\sqrt{\beta}x^2+ \frac{\beta\alpha^2}{1+\alpha^2}= 0.\]`

[^1]: Euclid calls it "that which makes with a medial (area) a medial whole"  (see [[Prop. 10.78]][bookofproofs$2172]).
