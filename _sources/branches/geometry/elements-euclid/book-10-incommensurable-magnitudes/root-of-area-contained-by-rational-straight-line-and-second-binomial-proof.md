* For let the area `$ABCD$` be contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and by the [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AC$` is a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).\

* For since `$AD$` is a [second binomial][bookofproofs$2086] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), let it have been divided into its (component) terms at `$E$`, such that `$AE$` is the greater term.
* Thus, `$AE$` and `$ED$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$ED$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AE$), and the lesser term `$ED$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$` [ [Def. 10.6] ][bookofproofs$2086].
* Let `$ED$` have been cut in half at `$F$`.
* And let the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AGE$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$`, have been applied to `$AE$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure.
* `$AG$` (is) thus [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GE$` [[Prop. 10.17]][bookofproofs$2111].
* And let `$GH$`, `$EK$`, and `$FL$` have been drawn through ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$G$`, `$E$`, and `$F$` (respectively), [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* And let the square `$SN$`, equal to the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AH$`, have been constructed, and the square `$NQ$`, equal to `$GK$`.
* And let `$MN$` be laid down so as to be [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$NO$`.
* Thus, `$RN$` [is] also [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$NP$`.
* And let the square `$SQ$` have been completed.
* So, (it is) clear from what has been previously demonstrated [ [Prop. 10.53 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6478] that `$MR$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$SN$` and `$NQ$`, and (is) equal to `$EL$`, and that `$MO$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area `$AC$`.
* So, we must show that `$MO$` is a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
Since `$AE$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$ED$`, and `$ED$` (is) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`, `$AE$` (is) thus [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And since `$AG$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EG$`, `$AE$` is also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$AG$` and `$GE$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* But, `$AE$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AG$` and `$GE$` are also (both) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Thus, `$BA$`, `$AG$`, and ($BA$, and) `$GE$` are (pairs of) [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* And, hence, each of `$AH$` and `$GK$` is a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Hence, each of `$SN$` and `$NQ$` is also a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* Thus, `$MN$` and `$NO$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* And since `$AG$` (is) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GE$`, `$AH$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GK$` - that is to say, `$SN$` with `$NQ$` - that is to say, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MN$` with the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$NO$` [hence, `$MN$` and `$NO$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082]] [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And since `$AE$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$ED$`, but `$AE$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AG$`, and `$ED$` [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$`, `$AG$` (is) thus [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Hence, `$AH$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EL$` - that is to say, `$SN$` with `$MR$` - that is to say, `$PN$` with `$NR$` - that is to say, `$MN$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$NO$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* But `$MN$` and `$NO$` have also been shown to be [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) which are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082].
* Thus, `$MN$` and `$NO$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* So, I say that they also contain a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* For since `$DE$` was assumed (to be) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$AB$` and `$EF$`, `$EF$` (is) thus also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EK$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And they (are) each [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$EL$` - that is to say, `$MR$` - (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.19]][bookofproofs$2113].
* And `$MR$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$MNO$`.
* And if two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, which contain a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area), are added together, then the whole is (that) irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] [[Prop. 10.37]][bookofproofs$2131].
* Thus, `$MO$` is a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
