### (Proposition 46 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> The [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] can be divided (into its component terms) at one [point][bookofproofs$631] only.

* Let `$AB$` be the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] plus a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] which has been divided at `$C$`, so that `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.40]][bookofproofs$2134].
* I say that `$AB$` cannot be (so) divided at another [point][bookofproofs$631].

### Modern Formulation

In other words, `\[\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}+\alpha}{2\,(1+\alpha^2)}} + \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}-\alpha}{2\,(1+\alpha^2)}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\beta^2}+\beta}{2\,(1+\beta^2)}} + \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\beta^2}-\beta}{2\,(1+\beta^2)}}\]` has only one solution: i.e., `\[\beta=\alpha,\]`

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

This proposition corresponds to [[Prop. 10.83]][bookofproofs$2177], with plus signs instead of minus signs.
