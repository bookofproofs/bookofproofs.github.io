* For let the [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CB$`, which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, `$AB$`, and which contains with the whole, `$AB$`, the [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, have been subtracted from the [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.28]][bookofproofs$2122].
* I say that the remainder `$AC$` is an irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Let it be called a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DI$` be laid down.
* And let `$DE$`, equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$`, have been applied to `$DI$`, producing `$DG$` as breadth.
* And let `$DH$`, equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, have been applied to `$DI$`, producing `$DF$` as breadth.
* The remainder `$FE$` is thus equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* And since the (squares) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] and [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (with one another), `$DE$` (is) thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109], [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DI$`, producing `$DG$` as breadth.
* Thus, `$DG$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DI$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* Again, since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* And it is equal to `$DH$`.
* Thus, `$DH$` is also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it has been applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DI$`, producing `$DF$` as breadth.
* `$DF$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DI$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since `$AB$` and `$BC$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, `$AB$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* But, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* Thus, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And `$DE$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$`, and `$DH$` to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* Thus, `$DE$` [is] [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DH$`.
* And as `$DE$` (is) to `$DH$`, so `$GD$` (is) to `$DF$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$GD$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DF$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they are both [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$GD$` and `$DF$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$FG$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* And `$DI$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And the (area) contained by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] and an irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is irrational [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114], and its [square root][bookofproofs$46] is irrational.
* And `$AC$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$FE$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` is an irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* And let it be called the [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
