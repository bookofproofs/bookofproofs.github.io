### (Proposition 6 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two magnitudes have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to (some) [number][bookofproofs$2315] then the magnitudes will be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095].

* For let the two magnitudes `$A$` and `$B$` have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$` (has) to the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$E$`.
* I say that the magnitudes `$A$` and `$B$` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
