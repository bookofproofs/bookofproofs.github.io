* Let `$AB$` be a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), having been divided into its (component) terms at `$C$`, such that `$AC$` is the greater term.
* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$` be laid down.
* And let the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$DEFG$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$DE$`, producing `$DG$` as breadth.
* I say that `$DG$` is a [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For let `$DH$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`, and `$KL$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$`, have been applied to `$DE$`.
* Thus, the remaining twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` is equal to `$MF$` [[Prop. 2.4]][bookofproofs$1017].
* Let `$MG$` have been cut in half at `$N$`, and let `$NO$` have been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [to each of `$ML$` and `$GF$`].
* `$MO$` and `$NF$` are thus each equal to once the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ACB$`.
* And since `$AB$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), having been divided into its (component) terms at `$C$`, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* Thus, the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with one another.
* And hence the sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` (is [rational][bookofproofs$2083]) [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109], and is equal to `$DL$`.
* Thus, `$DL$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`.
* `$DM$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$` [[Prop. 10.20]][bookofproofs$2114].
* Again, since `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` - that is to say, `$MF$` - is thus [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$ML$`.
* `$MG$` is thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$ML$` - that is to say, with `$DE$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And `$MD$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$DM$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$MG$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And they are [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* `$DM$` and `$MG$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$DG$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, we must show that (it is) also a [first (binomial][bookofproofs$2085] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ACB$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CB$` [ [Prop. 10.53 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6478], `$MO$` is thus also [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$DH$` and `$KL$`.
* Thus, as `$DH$` is to `$MO$`, so `$MO$` (is) to `$KL$` - that is to say, as `$DK$` (is) to `$MN$`, (so) `$MN$` (is) to `$MK$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DK$` and `$KM$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MN$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$CB$`, `$DH$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KL$`.
* Hence, `$DK$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And since (the sum of) the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is greater than twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [ [Prop. 10.59 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6479], `$DL$` (is) thus also greater than `$MF$`.
* Hence, `$DM$` is also greater than `$MG$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DK$` and `$KM$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MN$` - that is to say, to one quarter the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MG$`.
* And `$DK$` (is) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KM$`.
* And if there are two unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and a ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the lesser, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, is applied to the greater, and divides it into (parts which are) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095], then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater is larger than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the lesser by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the greater [[Prop. 10.17]][bookofproofs$2111].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DM$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$MG$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($DM$).
* And `$DM$` and `$MG$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And `$DM$`, which is the greater term, is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$DG$` is a [first binomial][bookofproofs$2085] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.5] ][bookofproofs$2085].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
