### (Proposition 37 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, which contain a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area), are added together then the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] - let it be called a **first bimedial**[^1] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* For let the two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$AB$` and `$BC$`, [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, (and) containing a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area), be laid down together.
* I say that the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), `$AC$`, is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083].

### Modern Formulation

Thus, a **first bimedial** [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has a length expressible as `\[\delta^{1/4}+\delta^{3/4},\]`

for some  [positive rational number][bookofproofs$1076] `\(\delta\)`.

### Notes

The first bimedial and the corresponding [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115], whose length is expressible as 

`\[\delta^{1/4} - \delta^{3/4},\]`

(see [Prop. 10.74][bookofproofs$2168]), are the positive roots of the quartic `\[x^4-2\,\delta\sqrt{\delta} x^2+ \delta\left(1-\delta\right)^2 = 0.\]`


[^1]: Literally, "first from two medials" (translator's note).
