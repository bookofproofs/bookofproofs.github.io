### (Proposition 10 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)[^1]

> To find two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with a given [straight line][bookofproofs$645], the one [ (incommensurable) in length][bookofproofs$1095] only, the other also [ (incommensurable) in square][bookofproofs$2082].
* Let `$A$` be the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* So it is required to find two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$A$`, the one [ (incommensurable) in length][bookofproofs$1095] only, the other also [ (incommensurable) in square][bookofproofs$2082].
