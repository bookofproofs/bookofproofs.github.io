### (Proposition 3 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find the greatest common measure of two given [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes.

* Let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be the two given magnitudes, of which (let) `$AB$` (be) the lesser.
* So, it is required to find the greatest common measure of `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
