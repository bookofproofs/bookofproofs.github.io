### (Proposition 17 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If there are two unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and a ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the lesser, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, is applied to the greater, and divides it into (parts which are) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095], then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater will be larger than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the lesser by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [in length] with the greater. And if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater is larger than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the lesser by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [in length] with the greater, and a ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) equal to the fourth (part) of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the lesser, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, is applied to the greater, then it divides it into (parts which are) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095].
* Let `$A$` and `$BC$` be two unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], of which (let) `$BC$` (be) the greater.
* And let a ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the lesser, `$A$` - that is, (equal) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on half of `$A$` - falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, have been applied to `$BC$`.
* And let it be the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$DC$` [see previous lemma].
* And let `$BD$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DC$`.
* I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than the (square on) `$A$` by (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BC$).
* And so let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` be greater than the (square on) `$A$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BC$).
* And let a ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) equal to the fourth (part) of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, have been applied to `$BC$`.
* And let it be the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$DC$`.
* It must be shown that `$BD$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DC$`.

### Modern Formulation

This proposition states that if `\[\alpha\,x-x^2=\frac{\beta^2}4,\]` (where `$\alpha=BC$`, `$x=DC$`, and `$\beta=A$`), then `\[\alpha\quad\text{ and }\quad\sqrt{\alpha^2-\beta^2}\]` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] when `\[\alpha-x\quad\text{ and }\quad x\]` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095], and vice versa.
