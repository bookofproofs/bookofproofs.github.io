* Let `$AB$` be a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and let `$BC$` be (so) attached to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.76]][bookofproofs$2170].
* I say that another another [straight line][bookofproofs$645] fulfilling the same (conditions) cannot be attached to `$AB$`.

* For, if possible, let `$BD$` be (so) attached (to `$AB$`).
* Thus, `$AD$` and `$DB$` are also ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], fulfilling the (other) aforementioned (conditions) [[Prop. 10.76]][bookofproofs$2170].
* And since by whatever (area) the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` exceeds the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$`, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` also exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by this (same area) [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* And the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` and `$DB$` exceeds the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* For both are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (areas).
* Thus, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` also exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* For both are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) [[Prop. 10.26]][bookofproofs$2120].
* Thus, only one [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with the whole, and (with the whole) makes the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them (added) together [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], can be attached to a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
