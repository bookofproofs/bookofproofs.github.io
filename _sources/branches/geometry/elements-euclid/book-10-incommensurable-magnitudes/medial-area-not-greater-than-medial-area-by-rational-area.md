### (Proposition 26 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] does not exceed a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).

### Modern Formulation

In other words, a [positive rational number][bookofproofs$1076] `\(\delta\)` is never a difference of square roots of two other positive rational numbers `$\alpha$` and `$\beta$`, formally `\[\sqrt{\alpha}-\sqrt{\beta}\neq \delta\]`
