* Let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` be laid out, and let the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) have been cut into unequal parts at each of the ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$C$` and `$D$`. 
* And let `$AC$` be assumed (to be) greater than `$DB$`. 
* I say that (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is greater than (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$`.

* For let `$AB$` have been cut in half at `$E$`.
* And since `$AC$` is greater than `$DB$`, let `$DC$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remainder `$AD$` is greater than the remainder `$CB$`.
* And `$AE$` (is) equal to `$EB$`.
* Thus, `$DE$` (is) less than `$EC$`.
* Thus, [points][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` and `$D$` are not equally far from the [point][bookofproofs$631] of bisection.
* And since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EC$`, is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EB$` [[Prop. 2.5]][bookofproofs$1019], but, moreover, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DE$`, is also equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EB$` [[Prop. 2.5]][bookofproofs$1019], the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EC$`, is thus equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DE$`.
* And, of these, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DE$` is less than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EC$`.
* And, thus, the remaining ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` is less than the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`.
* And, hence, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` is less than twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`.
* And thus the remaining sum of the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is greater than the sum of the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$`.[^1] 
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: Since, `$AC^{2}+CB^{2}+2\,AC\,CB=AD^{2}+DB^{2}+2\,AD\,DB = AB^{\,2}$` (translator's note).
