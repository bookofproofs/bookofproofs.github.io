### (Proposition 59 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If an area is [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [sixth binomial][bookofproofs$2090] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) then the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).
* For let the area `$ABCD$` be contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and the [sixth binomial][bookofproofs$2090] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`, which has been divided into its (component) terms at `$E$`, such that `$AE$` is the greater term.
* So, I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$AC$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of (the sum of) two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas).

### Modern Formulation

If the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has [unit][bookofproofs$2314] length then this proposition states that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of a [sixth binomial][bookofproofs$2090] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is the square root of the sum of two [medial area][bookofproofs$6462]: i.e., a [sixth binomial][bookofproofs$2090] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has a length 
`\[\sqrt{\alpha}+\sqrt{\beta}\]` 
whose [square root][bookofproofs$46] can be written 
`\[\alpha^{1/4}\left(\sqrt{\frac 12+\frac{\delta}{2\sqrt{1+\delta^2}}}+\sqrt{\frac 12-\frac{\delta}{2\sqrt{1+\delta^2}}}\right),\]`
where 
`\[\delta^2=\frac{\alpha-\beta}\beta.\]` 
This is the length of the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of the sum of two [medial area][bookofproofs$6462] (see [[Prop. 10.41]][bookofproofs$2135]).
