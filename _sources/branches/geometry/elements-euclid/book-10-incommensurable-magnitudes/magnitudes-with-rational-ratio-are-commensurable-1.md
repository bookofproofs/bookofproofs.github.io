### (Corollary to Proposition 6 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So it is clear, from this, that if there are two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], like `$D$` and `$E$`, and a [straight line][bookofproofs$645], like `$A$`, then it is possible to contrive that as the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$` (is) to the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$E$`, so the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] (is) to (another) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] (i.e., `$F$`). And if the [mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3, (say) `$B$`, is taken of `$A$` and `$F$`, then as `$A$` is to `$F$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (will be) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`. That is to say, as the first (is) to the third, so the (figure) on the first (is) to the similar, and similarly described, (figure) on the second [ [Prop. 6.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]4. But, as `$A$` (is) to `$F$`, so the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$` is to the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$E$`. Thus, it has also been contrived that as the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$` (is) to the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$E$`, so the (figure) on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$A$` (is) to the (similar figure) on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$B$`. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
