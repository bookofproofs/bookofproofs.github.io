* Let the two [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, be laid out such that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater, `$AB$`, is larger than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the lesser, `$BC$`, by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AB$) [[Prop. 10.30]][bookofproofs$2124].
* And let `$BC$` have been cut in half at `$D$`.
* And let a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on either of `$BD$` or `$DC$`, (and) falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, have been applied to `$AB$` [[Prop. 6.28]][bookofproofs$2014], and let it be the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AEB$`.
* And let the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$AFB$` have been drawn on `$AB$`.
* And let `$EF$` have been drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$`.
* And let `$AF$` and `$FB$` have been joined.[^1]

* And since `$AB$` and `$BC$` are [two] unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$BC$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AB$).
* And a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], equal to one quarter of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` - that is to say, (equal) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on half of it - (and) falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, has been applied to `$AB$`, and makes the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AEB$`.
* `$AE$` is thus [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EB$` [[Prop. 10.18]][bookofproofs$2112].
* And as `$AE$` is to `$EB$`, so the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BA$` and `$AE$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BE$`.
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BA$` and `$AE$` (is) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BE$` to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$` [ [Prop. 10.32 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6476].
* The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$` is thus in[commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$FB$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Thus, `$AF$` and `$FB$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082].
* And since `$AB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Hence, the sum of the (squares) on `$AF$` and `$FB$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And, again, since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EB$` was assumed (to be) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`, `$FE$` is thus equal to `$BD$`.
* Thus, `$BC$` is double `$FE$`.
* And hence the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$EF$` (is) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$EF$` (is) equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AF$` and `$FB$` [ [Prop. 10.32 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6476].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AF$` and `$FB$` (is) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them was also shown (to be) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AF$` and `$FB$`, (which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], have been found, making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: `$AF$` and `$FB$` have lengths `$\sqrt{[1+k/(1+k^2)^{1/2}]/2}$` and `$\sqrt{[1-k/(1+k^2)^{1/2}]/2}$` times that of `$AB$`, respectively, where `$k$` is defined in the footnote to [[Prop. 10.30]][bookofproofs$2124] (translator's note)
