* For let the two [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] magnitudes `$AB$` and `$BC$` be laid down together.
* I say that the whole `$AC$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$AB$` and `$BC$`.

* For since `$AB$` and `$BC$` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095], some magnitude will measure them.
* Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be `$D$`.
* Therefore, since `$D$` measures (both) `$AB$` and `$BC$`, it will also measure the whole `$AC$`.
* And it also measures `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* Thus, `$D$` measures `$AB$`, `$BC$`, and `$AC$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with each of `$AB$` and `$BC$` [ [Def. 10.1] ][bookofproofs$1095].
* And so let `$AC$` be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$AB$` and `$BC$` are also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
* For since `$AC$` and `$AB$` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095], some magnitude will measure them.
* Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be `$D$`.
* Therefore, since `$D$` measures (both) `$CA$` and `$AB$`, it will thus also measure the remainder `$BC$`.
* And it also measures `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$D$` will measure (both) `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` and `$BC$` are [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [ [Def. 10.1] ][bookofproofs$1095].
* Thus, if two magnitudes, and so on ....
