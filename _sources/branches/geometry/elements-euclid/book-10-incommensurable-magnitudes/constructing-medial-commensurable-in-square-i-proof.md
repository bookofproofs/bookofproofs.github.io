* Let two [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$A$` and `$B$`, [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, be laid out, such that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater `$A$` is larger than the ([square][bookofproofs$909] on the) lesser `$B$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($A$) [[Prop. 10.29]][bookofproofs$2123].
* And let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$` be equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$B$`.
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by) `$A$` and `$B$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$` (is) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$C$` (is) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* And let the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$C$` and `$D$` be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$C$` and `$D$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$B$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473], but the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$B$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$C$` and `$D$` to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`, thus as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$C$` and `$D$`.
* And as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$C$` and `$D$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473].
* And thus as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* And `$A$` is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with `$B$`.
* Thus, `$C$` (is) also [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with `$D$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$C$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$D$` (is) also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.23]][bookofproofs$2117].
* And since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, (so) `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$B$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($A$), the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$` is thus also greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$D$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($C$) [[Prop. 10.14]][bookofproofs$2108].
* Thus, two [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$C$` and `$D$`, [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, (and) containing a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area), have been found.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$D$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with ($C$).[^1]
* So, similarly, (the proposition) can also be demonstrated for (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (in length with `$C$`), provided that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`) by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($A$) [[Prop. 10.30]][bookofproofs$2124].[^2]

[^1]: `$C$` and `$D$` have lengths `$(1-k^2)^{1/4}$` and `$(1-k^2)^{3/4}$` times that of `$A$`, respectively, where `$k$` is defined in the footnote to [[Prop. 10.29]][bookofproofs$2123] (translator's note).

[^2]:  `$C$` and `$D$` would have lengths `$1/(1+k^2)^{1/4}$` and `$1/(1+k^2)^{3/4}$` times that of `$A$`, respectively, where `$k$` is defined in the footnote to [[Prop. 10.30]][bookofproofs$2124] (translator's note).
