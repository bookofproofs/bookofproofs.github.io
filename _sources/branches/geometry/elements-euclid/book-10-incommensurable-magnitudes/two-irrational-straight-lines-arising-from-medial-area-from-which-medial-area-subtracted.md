### (Proposition 110 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the whole, being subtracted from a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462], the two remaining [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) arise (as) the ([square root][bookofproofs$46] of the area) - either a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), or that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.
* For, as in the previous figures, let the [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] `$BD$`, [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the whole, have been subtracted from the [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] `$BC$`.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$EC$` is one of two [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) - either a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), or that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.
