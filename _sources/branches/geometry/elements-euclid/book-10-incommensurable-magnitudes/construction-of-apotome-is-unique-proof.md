* Let `$AB$` be an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], with `$BC$` (so) attached to it.
* `$AC$` and `$CB$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* I say that another [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, cannot be attached to `$AB$`.

* For, if possible, let `$BD$` be (so) attached (to `$AB$`).
* Thus, `$AD$` and `$DB$` are also [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* And since by whatever (area) the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` also exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by this (same area).
* For both exceed by the same (area) - (namely), the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* Thus, alternately, by whatever (area) the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` exceeds the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$`, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` [also] exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by this (same area).
* And the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` exceeds the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* For both (are) [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (areas).
* Thus, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` also exceeds twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* For both are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] (areas) [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115], and a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] cannot exceed a(nother) [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) [[Prop. 10.26]][bookofproofs$2120].
* Thus, another [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, cannot be attached to `$AB$`.
* Thus, only one [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, can be attached to an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
