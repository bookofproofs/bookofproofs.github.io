* Let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$AC$` and `$CB$` be laid down such that `$AB$` does not have to either of them the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] [ [Prop. 10.28 lem. II] ][bookofproofs$6475].
* And let some [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$D$` be laid down.
* And let `$EF$` be [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [in length] with `$D$`.
* Thus, `$EF$` (is) a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let it have been contrived that as `$CA$` (is) to `$AB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* And `$CA$` does not have to `$AB$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$EF$` and `$FG$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Thus, `$EG$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [fifth (binomial][bookofproofs$2089] [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For since as `$CA$` is to `$AB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$`, inversely, as `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` [ [Prop. 5.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]1.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GF$` (is) greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Therefore, let (the sum of) the (squares) on `$EF$` and `$H$` be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GF$`.
* Thus, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], as the [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$AB$` is to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GF$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$` [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2.
* And `$AB$` does not have to `$BC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$H$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$FG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$H$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Hence, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$FE$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($FG$).
* And `$GF$` and `$FE$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* And the lesser term `$EF$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] previously) laid down, `$D$`.
* Thus, `$EG$` is a [fifth binomial][bookofproofs$2089] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]). 
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
