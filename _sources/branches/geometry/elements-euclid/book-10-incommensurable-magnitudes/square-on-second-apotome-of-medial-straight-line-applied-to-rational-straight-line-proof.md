* Let `$AB$` be the [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and `$CD$` a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And let `$CE$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$CF$` as breadth.
* I say that `$CF$` is a [third apotome][bookofproofs$2093].

* For let `$BG$` be an attachment to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AG$` and `$GB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, containing a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] [[Prop. 10.75]][bookofproofs$2169].
* And let `$CH$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$`, have been applied to `$CD$`, producing `$CK$` as breadth.
* And let `$KL$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BG$`, have been applied to `$KH$`, producing `$KM$` as breadth.
* Thus, the whole of `$CL$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` [and the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115]].
* `$CL$` (is) thus also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109], [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* And it has been applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$`, producing `$CM$` as breadth.
* Thus, `$CM$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since the whole of `$CL$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$`, of which `$CE$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, the remainder `$LF$` is thus equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* Therefore, let `$FM$` have been cut in half at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`.
* And let `$NO$` have been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$FO$` and `$NL$` are each equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`.
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` (is) [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$FL$` is also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`, producing `$FM$` as breadth.
* `$FM$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since `$AG$` and `$GB$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, `$AG$` [is] thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GB$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* But, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$AG$`, and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`.
* The (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` is thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* But, `$CL$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AG$` and `$GB$`, and `$FL$` is equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`.
* Thus, `$CL$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FL$`.
* And as `$CL$` (is) to `$FL$`, so `$CM$` is to `$FM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* `$CM$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FM$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they are both [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$CM$` and `$MF$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$CF$` is thus an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [third (apotome) ][bookofproofs$2093].
* For since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$GB$`, `$CH$` (is) thus also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KL$`.
* Hence, `$CK$` (is) also ([commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095]) with `$KM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to the (squares) on `$AG$` and `$GB$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473], and `$CH$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$`, and `$KL$` equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GB$`, and `$NL$` equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AG$` and `$GB$`, `$NL$` is thus also [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$CH$` and `$KL$`.
* Thus, as `$CH$` is to `$NL$`, so `$NL$` (is) to `$KL$`.
* But, as `$CH$` (is) to `$NL$`, so `$CK$` is to `$NM$`, and as `$NL$` (is) to `$KL$`, so `$NM$` (is) to `$KM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, as `$CK$` (is) to `$MN$`, so `$MN$` is to `$KM$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CK$` and `$KM$` is equal to the [[ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MN$` - that is to say, to the] fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FM$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* Therefore, since `$CM$` and `$MF$` are two unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and (some area), equal to the fourth part of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FM$`, has been applied to `$CM$`, falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure, and divides it into [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (parts), the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CM$` is thus greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$MF$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($CM$) [[Prop. 10.17]][bookofproofs$2111].
* And neither of `$CM$` and `$MF$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$`.
* `$CF$` is thus a [third apotome][bookofproofs$2093] [ [Def. 10.13] ][bookofproofs$2093].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces a [third apotome][bookofproofs$2093] as breadth.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
