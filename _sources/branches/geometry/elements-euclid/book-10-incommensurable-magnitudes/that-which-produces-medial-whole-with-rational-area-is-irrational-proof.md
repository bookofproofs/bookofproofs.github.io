* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`, which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with `$AB$`, and fulfils the (other) prescribed (conditions), have been subtracted from the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.34]][bookofproofs$2128].
* I say that the remainder `$AC$` is the aforementioned [irrational][bookofproofs$2084] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For since the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [rational][bookofproofs$2083], the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021], [[Prop. 10.16]][bookofproofs$2110].
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is [irrational][bookofproofs$2084].
* Thus, `$AC$` is an irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* And let it be called that which makes with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
