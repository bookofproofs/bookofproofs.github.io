### (Proposition 81 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Only one [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, and contains a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] with the whole, can be attached to a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* Let `$AB$` be a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), with `$BC$` (so) attached to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, containing a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] - (namely, that contained) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 10.75]][bookofproofs$2169].
* I say that a(nother) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, and contains a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] with the whole, cannot be attached to `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

In other words, 

`\[\alpha^{1/4}-\frac{\beta^{1/2}}{\alpha^{1/4}} = \gamma^{1/4}-\frac{\delta^{1/2}}{\gamma^{1/4}}\]` has only one solution: i.e., `\[\gamma=\alpha\quad\text{ and }\quad \delta=\beta,\]`
 where `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

This proposition corresponds to [[Prop. 10.44]][bookofproofs$2138], with minus signs instead of plus signs.
