### Euclid's Formulation

> A ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) "commensurable (in length) > A ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and (is) the same in order[^1].

* Let `$AB$` be an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and let `$CD$` be [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`.
* I say that `$CD$` is also an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and (is) the same in order as `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)

[^1]: Euclid's expression "(not) being the same in order" means that the resulting irrational number is "(not) of the same kind" as that irrational number, with which it is commensurable.
