### (Proposition 112 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)[^1]

> The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), applied to a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), produces as breadth an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] whose terms are [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the terms of the [binomial][bookofproofs$2130], and, furthermore, in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945]. Moreover, the created apotome will have the same order as the [binomial][bookofproofs$2130].
* Let `$A$` be a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and `$BC$` a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), of which let `$DC$` be the greater term.
* And let the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BC$` and `$EF$` be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`.
* I say that `$EF$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] whose terms are [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CD$` and `$DB$`, and in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945], and, moreover, that `$EF$` will have the same order as `$BC$`.

[^1]: Heiberg considers this proposition, and the succeeding ones, to be relatively early interpolations into the original text (translator's note).
