### (Proposition 14 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If four [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the first is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the second by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [in length] with the first, then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the third will also be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the fourth by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [in length] with the third. And if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the first is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the second by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [in length] with the first, then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the third will also be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) the fourth by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] [in length] with the third. 

* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` be four [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], (such that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* And let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$B$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$E$`, and let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$` be greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$D$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$F$`.
* I say that `$A$` is either [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$E$`, and `$C$` is also [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$F$`, or `$A$` is [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$E$`, and `$C$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$F$`.
