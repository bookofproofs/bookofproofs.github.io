> These things being assumed, it is proved that there exist an infinite multitude of [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] commensurable and incommensurable with an assigned [straight line][bookofproofs$645] - those [ (commensurable and incommensurable) in length][bookofproofs$1095] only, and those also [ (commensurable or incommensurable) in square][bookofproofs$2082])[^1]. Therefore, let the assigned [straight line][bookofproofs$645] be called **rational**. And (let) the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) commensurable with it, either in length and square, or in square only, (also be called) rational. But let the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) incommensurable with it be called *irrational.*[^2]

### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)

[^1]:  To be more exact, straight lines can either be commensurable in square only, incommensurable in length only, or commensurable/incommensurable in both length and square, with an assigned straight line (translator's note).

[^2]:  Let the length of the assigned straight line be unity. Then rational straight lines have lengths expressible as `\(k\)` or `\(\sqrt{k}\)`, depending on whether the lengths are commensurable in length, or in square only, respectively, with unity. All other straight lines are irrational (translator's note).
