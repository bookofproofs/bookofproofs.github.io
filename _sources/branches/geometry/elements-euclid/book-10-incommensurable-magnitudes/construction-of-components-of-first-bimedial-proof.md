* Let the two [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$` and `$B$`, (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, be laid down.
* And let `$C$` - [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) to `$A$` and `$B$` - have been taken [[Prop. 6.13]][bookofproofs$1999].
* And let it be contrived that as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$` [[Prop. 6.12]][bookofproofs$1998].
* And since the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$` and `$B$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$B$` - that is to say, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$C$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003] - is thus [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].

* Thus, `$C$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* And since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, [so] `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, and `$A$` and `$B$` [are] [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, `$C$` and `$D$` are thus also [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$C$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* Thus, `$D$` is also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.23]][bookofproofs$2117].
* Thus, `$C$` and `$D$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* I say that they also contain a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area).
* For since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, thus, alternately, as `$A$` is to `$C$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$D$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* But, as `$A$` (is) to `$C$`, (so) `$C$` (is) to `$B$`.
* And thus as `$C$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$D$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$C$` and `$D$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$C$` and `$D$` [is] also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, (two) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$C$` and `$D$`), containing a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area), (which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, have been found.[^1] 
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: `$C$` and `$D$` have lengths `$\rho^{1/4}$` and `$\rho^{3/4}$` times that of `$A$`, respectively, where the length of `$B$` is `$\rho^{1/2}$` times that of `$A$`, for some rational number `\(\rho\)` (translator's note)
