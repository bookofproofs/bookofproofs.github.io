### (Proposition 87 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find a [third apotome][bookofproofs$2093].
* Let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$A$` be laid down.
* And let the three [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$E$`, `$BC$`, and `$CD$`, not having to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], be laid down.
* And let `$CB$` have to `$BD$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* And let it have been contrived that as `$E$` (is) to `$BC$`, so the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (is) to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$`, and as `$BC$` (is) to `$CD$`, so the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` [ [Prop. 10.6 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6460].
* Therefore, since as `$E$` is to `$BC$`, so the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (is) to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$`, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` is thus [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$FG$` is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And since `$E$` does not have to `$BC$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` thus does not have to the [square] on `$FG$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$A$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FG$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Again, since as `$BC$` is to `$CD$`, so the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$`, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` is thus [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$GH$` is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* And since `$BC$` does not have to `$CD$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` thus does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Thus, `$FG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GH$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And both are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* `$FG$` and `$GH$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$FH$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* So, I say that (it is) also a [third (apotome) ][bookofproofs$2093].

### Modern Formulation

This proposition proves that the [third apotome][bookofproofs$2093] has length 
`\[\sqrt{\alpha}\,\left(1-\sqrt{1-\beta^{\,2}}\right),\]`


where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
