> And let the square on the assigned [straight line][bookofproofs$645] be called **rational**. And (let areas) commensurable with it (also be called) **rational**. But (let areas) incommensurable with it (be called) **irrational**, and (let) their square-roots[^1] (also be called) **irrational** - the sides themselves, if the (areas) are squares, and the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) describing squares equal to them, if the (areas) are some other rectilinear (figure).[^2]

### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)

[^1]:  The square-root of an area is the length of the side of an equal area square. (translator's note).

[^2]:  The area of the square on the assigned straight line is unity. Rational areas are expressible as `\(k\)`. All other areas are irrational. Thus, squares whose sides are of rational length have rational areas, and vice versa (translator's note).
