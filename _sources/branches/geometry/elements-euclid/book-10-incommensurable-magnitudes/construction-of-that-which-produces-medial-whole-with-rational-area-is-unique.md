### (Proposition 83 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Only one [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] with the whole, and (together) with the whole makes the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], can be attached to that ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole.
* Let `$AB$` be a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which with a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) makes a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] whole, and let `$BC$` be (so) attached to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], fulfilling the (other) proscribed (conditions) [[Prop. 10.77]][bookofproofs$2171].
* I say that another ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) fulfilling the same (conditions) cannot be attached to `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

In other words, `\[\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}+\alpha}{2\,(1+\alpha^2)}} - \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}-\alpha}{2\,(1+\alpha^2)}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\beta^2}+\beta}{2\,(1+\beta^2)}} - \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\beta^2}-\beta}{2\,(1+\beta^2)}}\]` has only one solution: i.e., `\[\beta=\alpha,\]`

where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

This proposition corresponds to [[Prop. 10.46]][bookofproofs$2140], with minus signs instead of plus signs.
