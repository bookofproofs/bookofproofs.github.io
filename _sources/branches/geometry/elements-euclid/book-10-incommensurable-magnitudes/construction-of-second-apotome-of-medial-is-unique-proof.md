* Let `$AB$` be a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), with `$BC$` (so) attached to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, containing a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] - (namely, that contained) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 10.75]][bookofproofs$2169].
* I say that a(nother) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, and contains a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] with the whole, cannot be attached to `$AB$`.

* For, if possible, let `$BD$` be (so) attached.
* Thus, `$AD$` and `$DB$` are also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, containing a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] - (namely, that contained) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` [[Prop. 10.75]][bookofproofs$2169].
* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$` be laid down.
* And let `$EG$`, equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$`, have been applied to `$EF$`, producing `$EM$` as breadth.
* And let `$HG$`, equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`, have been subtracted (from `$EG$`), producing `$HM$` as breadth.
* The remainder `$EL$` is thus equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* Hence, `$AB$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$EL$`.
* So, again, let `$EI$`, equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` have been applied to `$EF$`, producing `$EN$` as breadth.
* And `$EL$` is also equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`.
* Thus, the remainder `$HI$` is equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* And since `$AC$` and `$CB$` are (both) [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is equal to `$EG$`.
* Thus, `$EG$` is also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109], [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`, producing `$EM$` as breadth.
* Thus, `$EM$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* Again, since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` is also [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [ [Prop. 10.23 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6462].
* And it is equal to `$HG$`.
* Thus, `$HG$` is also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`, producing `$HM$` as breadth.
* Thus, `$HM$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* And since `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, `$AC$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CB$`.
* And as `$AC$` (is) to `$CB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* But, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$AC$`, and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* And `$EG$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* And `$GH$` is equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* Thus, `$EG$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$HG$`.
* And as `$EG$` (is) to `$HG$`, so `$EM$` is to `$HM$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$EM$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$MH$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And they are both [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$EM$` and `$MH$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$EH$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167], and `$HM$` (is) attached to it.
* So, similarly, we can show that `$HN$` (is) also ([commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with `$EN$` and is) attached to ($EH$).
* Thus, different [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], which are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, are attached to an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 10.79]][bookofproofs$2173].
* Thus, only one [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [straight line][bookofproofs$645], which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, and contains a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] with the whole, can be attached to a [second apotome][bookofproofs$2092] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
