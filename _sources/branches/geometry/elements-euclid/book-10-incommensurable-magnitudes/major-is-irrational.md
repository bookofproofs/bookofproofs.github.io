### (Proposition 39 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] contained) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], are added together then the whole [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is irrational - let it be called a **major** ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$` and `$BC$`, [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], and fulfilling the prescribed (conditions), be laid down together [[Prop. 10.33]][bookofproofs$2127].
* I say that `$AC$` is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083].

### Modern Formulation

Thus, a **major** [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has a length expressible as 
`\[\sqrt{\left(1+\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}}\right)\frac 12} + \sqrt{\left(1-\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}}\right)\frac 12}\]`

for some [positive rational number][bookofproofs$1076] `\(\rho\)`. 

### Notes

The major and the corresponding [minor][bookofproofs$2170], (see [Prop. 10.76][bookofproofs$2170]),  whose length is expressible as

`\[\sqrt{\left(1+\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}}\right)\frac 12} - \sqrt{\left(1-\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}}\right)\frac 12}\]`

are the positive roots of the quartic 
`\[x^4-2\,x^2+ \rho^2/(1+\rho^2) = 0.\]`
