* Let `$AB$` be a [second bimedial][bookofproofs$2132] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which has been divided at `$C$`, so that `$AC$` and `$BC$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, (and) containing a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462] [[Prop. 10.38]][bookofproofs$2132].
* So, (it is) clear that `$C$` is not (located) at the [point][bookofproofs$631] of bisection, since ($AC$ and `$BC$`) are not [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095].
* I say that `$AB$` cannot be (so) divided at another [point][bookofproofs$631].

* For, if possible, let it also have been (so) divided at `$D$`, so that `$AC$` is not the same as `$DB$`, but `$AC$` (is), by hypothesis, greater.
* So, (it is) clear that (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` is also less than (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$`, as we showed above [ [Prop. 10.41 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6477].
* And `$AD$` and `$DB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, (and) containing a [medial (area) ][bookofproofs$6462].
* And let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$` be laid down.
* And let the rectangular [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EK$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, have been applied to `$EF$`.
* And let `$EG$`, equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$`, have been cut off (from `$EK$`).
* Thus, the remainder, `$HK$`, is equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 2.4]][bookofproofs$1017].
* So, again, let `$EL$`, equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` - which was shown (to be) less than (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` - have been cut off (from `$EK$`).
* And, thus, the remainder, `$MK$`, (is) equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`.
* And since (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [medial][bookofproofs$2115], `$EG$` (is) thus [also] [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EF$`.
* Thus, `$EH$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$` [[Prop. 10.22]][bookofproofs$2116].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$HN$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$`.
* And since `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, `$AC$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$CB$`.
* And as `$AC$` (is) to `$CB$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [ [Prop. 10.21 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6473].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* But, (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$AC$`.
* For, `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And thus (the sum of) the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* But, `$EG$` is equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$`, and `$HK$` equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* Thus, `$EG$` is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$HK$`.
* Hence, `$EH$` is also [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$HN$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And (they are) [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$EH$` and `$HN$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* And if two [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only are added together then the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is that irrational called [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] [[Prop. 10.36]][bookofproofs$2130].
* Thus, `$EN$` is a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which has been divided (into its component terms) at `$H$`.
* So, according to the same (reasoning), `$EM$` and `$MN$` can be shown (to be) [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* And `$EN$` will (thus) be a [binomial][bookofproofs$2130] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which has been divided (into its component terms) at the different ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$H$` and `$M$` (which is absurd [[Prop. 10.42]][bookofproofs$2136]).
* And `$EH$` is not the same as `$MN$`, since (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` is greater than (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$`.
* But, (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` is greater than twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` [ [Prop. 10.59 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6479].
* Thus, (the sum of) the (squares) on `$AC$` and `$CB$` - that is to say, `$EG$` - is also much greater than twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$` - that is to say, `$MK$`.
* Hence, `$EH$` is also greater than `$MN$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$EH$` is not the same as `$MN$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
