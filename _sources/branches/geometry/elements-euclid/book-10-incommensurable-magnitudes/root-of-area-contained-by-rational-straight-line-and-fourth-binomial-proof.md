* For let the area `$AC$` be contained by the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and the [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`, which has been divided into its (component) terms at `$E$`, of which let `$AE$` be the greater.
* I say that the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of `$AC$` is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [major][bookofproofs$2133].

* For since `$AD$` is a [fourth binomial][bookofproofs$2088] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), `$AE$` and `$ED$` are thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is greater than (the [square][bookofproofs$909] on) `$ED$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($AE$), and `$AE$` [is] [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$` [ [Def. 10.8] ][bookofproofs$2088].
* Let `$DE$` have been cut in half at `$F$`, and let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] (contained by) `$AG$` and `$GE$`, equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$`, (and falling short by a [square][bookofproofs$909] figure) have been applied to `$AE$`.
* `$AG$` is thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GE$` [[Prop. 10.18]][bookofproofs$2112].
* Let `$GH$`, `$EK$`, and `$FL$` have been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AB$`, and let the rest (of the construction) have been made the same as the (proposition) before this.
* So, it is clear that `$MO$` is the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AC$`.
* So, we must show that `$MO$` is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [major][bookofproofs$2133].
* Since `$AG$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EG$`, `$AH$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$GK$` - that is to say, `$SN$` with `$NQ$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* Thus, `$MN$` and `$NO$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082].
* And since `$AE$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$`, `$AK$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [[Prop. 10.19]][bookofproofs$2113].
* And it is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$MN$` and `$NO$`.
* Thus, the sum of the (squares) on `$MN$` and `$NO$` [is] also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since `$DE$` [is] [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107] - that is to say, with `$EK$` - but `$DE$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EF$`, `$EF$` (is) thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$EK$` [[Prop. 10.13]][bookofproofs$2107].
* Thus, `$EK$` and `$EF$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* `$LE$` - that is to say, `$MR$` - (is) thus [medial][bookofproofs$2115] [[Prop. 10.21]][bookofproofs$2115].
* And it is contained by `$MN$` and `$NO$`.
* The ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$MN$` and `$NO$` is thus [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And the [sum] of the (squares) on `$MN$` and `$NO$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and `$MN$` and `$NO$` are [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082].
* And if two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (which are) [incommensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082], making the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on them [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by them [medial][bookofproofs$2115], are added together, then the whole is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [major][bookofproofs$2133] [[Prop. 10.39]][bookofproofs$2133].
* Thus, `$MO$` is the irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) called [major][bookofproofs$2133].
* And (it is) the [square root][bookofproofs$46] of area `$AC$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
