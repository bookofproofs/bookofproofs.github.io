* For let the [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BC$`, which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with `$AB$`, and which makes with `$AB$` the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, have been subtracted from the [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` [[Prop. 10.27]][bookofproofs$2121].
* I say that the remainder `$AC$` is an irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Let it be called the [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* For since `$AB$` and `$BC$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is also [medial][bookofproofs$2115].
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* The (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) thus [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* Thus, twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is also [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with the remaining [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021], since if the whole is [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with one of the (constituent magnitudes) then the original magnitudes will also be [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095] (with one another) [[Prop. 10.16]][bookofproofs$2110].
* And twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is irrational.
* Thus, `$AC$` is an irrational ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* Let it be called a *first apotome":[bookofproofs$2091] of a [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
