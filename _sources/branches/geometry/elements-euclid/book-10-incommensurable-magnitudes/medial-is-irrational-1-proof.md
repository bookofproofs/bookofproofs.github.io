* Let `$FE$` and `$EG$` be two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* I say that as `$FE$` is to `$EG$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$FE$` and `$EG$`.

* For let the square `$DF$` have been described on `$FE$`.
* And let `$GD$` have been completed.
* Therefore, since as `$FE$` is to `$EG$`, so `$FD$` (is) to `$DG$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], and `$FD$` is the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$`, and `$DG$` the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DE$` and `$EG$` - that is to say, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$FE$` and `$EG$` - thus as `$FE$` is to `$EG$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$FE$` and `$EG$`.
* And also, similarly, as the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$GE$` and `$EF$` is to the (square on) `$EF$` - that is to say, as `$GD$` (is) to `$FD$` - so `$GE$` (is) to `$EF$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
