### (Proposition 9 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> [Squares][bookofproofs$909] on [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (which are) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326]. And squares having to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] will also have sides (which are) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095]. But [squares][bookofproofs$909] on [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (which are) [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] do not have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326]. And squares not having to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] will not have sides (which are) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] either.
* For let `$A$` and `$B$` be ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095].
* I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` has to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* And so let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` be to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` as the [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] on `$C$` (is) to the [square] (number) on `$D$`.
* I say that `$A$` is [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.
* And so let `$A$` be [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.
* I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` does not have to the [square] on `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* So, again, let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$` not have to the [square] on `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1948] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* I say that `$A$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$B$`.
