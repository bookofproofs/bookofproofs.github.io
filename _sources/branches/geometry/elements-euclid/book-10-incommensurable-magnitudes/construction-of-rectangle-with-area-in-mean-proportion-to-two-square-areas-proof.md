* For since `$DB$` is equal to `$BF$`, and `$BE$` to `$BG$`, the whole of `$DE$` is thus equal to the whole of `$FG$`.
* But `$DE$` is equal to each of `$AH$` and `$KC$`, and `$FG$` is equal to each of `$AK$` and `$HC$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* Thus, `$AH$` and `$KC$` are also equal to `$AK$` and `$HC$`, respectively.
* Thus, the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AC$` is equilateral.
* And (it is) also right-angled.
* Thus, `$AC$` is a square.
* And since as `$FB$` is to `$BG$`, so `$DB$` (is) to `$BE$`, but as `$FB$` (is) to `$BG$`, so `$AB$` (is) to `$DG$`, and as `$DB$` (is) to `$BE$`, so `$DG$` (is) to `$BC$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], thus also as `$AB$` (is) to `$DG$`, so `$DG$` (is) to `$BC$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, `$DG$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* So I also say that `$DC$` [is] [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$AC$` and `$CB$`.

* For since as `$AD$` is to `$DK$`, so `$KG$` (is) to `$GC$`.
* For [they are] respectively equal.
* And, via [composition][bookofproofs$1953], as `$AK$` (is) to `$KD$`, so `$KC$` (is) to `$CG$` [[Prop. 5.18]][bookofproofs$1975].
* But as `$AK$` (is) to `$KD$`, so `$AC$` (is) to `$CD$`, and as `$KC$` (is) to `$CG$`, so `$DC$` (is) to `$CB$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, also, as `$AC$` (is) to `$DC$`, so `$DC$` (is) to `$BC$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, `$DC$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* Which (is the very thing) it was prescribed to show.
