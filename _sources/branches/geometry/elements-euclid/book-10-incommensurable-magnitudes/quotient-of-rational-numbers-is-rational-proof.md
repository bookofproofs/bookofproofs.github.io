* For let the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) `$AC$` have been applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$`, producing the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BC$` as breadth.
* I say that `$BC$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BA$`.

* For let the square `$AD$` have been described on `$AB$`.
* `$AD$` is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* And `$AC$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* `$DA$` is thus [commensurable][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AC$`.
* And as `$DA$` is to `$AC$`, so `$DB$` (is) to `$BC$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$DB$` is also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$` [[Prop. 10.11]][bookofproofs$2105].
* And `$DB$` (is) equal to `$BA$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` (is) also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BC$`.
* And `$AB$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$BC$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and [commensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$AB$` [ [Def. 10.3] ][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, if a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) is applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and so on ....
