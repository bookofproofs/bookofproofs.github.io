### (Proposition 43 from Book 10 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) can be divided (into its component terms) at one [point][bookofproofs$631] only.

* Let `$AB$` be a [first bimedial][bookofproofs$2131] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which has been divided at `$C$`, such that `$AC$` and `$CB$` are [medial][bookofproofs$2115] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only, (and) containing a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (area) [[Prop. 10.37]][bookofproofs$2131].
* I say that `$AB$` cannot be (so) divided at another [point][bookofproofs$631].

### Modern Formulation

In other words, `\[\alpha^{1/4} + \alpha^{3/4} = \beta^{1/4} + \beta^{3/4}\]` has only one solution: i.e., 
`\[\beta=\alpha,\]`
where `\(\alpha,\beta\)` denote [positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076].
### Notes

This proposition corresponds to [[Prop. 10.80]][bookofproofs$2174], with plus signs instead of minus signs.
