* For let the square `$CDEB$` have been described on `$CB$` [[Prop. 1.46]][bookofproofs$965], and let `$ED$` have been drawn through to `$F$`, and let `$AF$` have been drawn through `$A$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$CD$` or `$BE$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* So the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AE$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AD$` and the (square) `$CE$`.
* And `$AE$` is the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* For it is contained by `$AB$` and `$BE$`, and `$BE$` (is) equal to `$BC$`.
* And `$AD$` (is) the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* For `$DC$` (is) equal to `$CB$`.
* And `$DB$` (is) the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$`.
* Thus, the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AC$` and `$CB$`, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$`.
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut at random then the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and one of the pieces (of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), is equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by (both of) the pieces, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the aforementioned piece.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
