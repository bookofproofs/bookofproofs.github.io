* For since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$CB$` has been cut, at random, at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$D$`, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$` and `$BD$` is thus equal to twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CB$` and `$BD$`, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$` [[Prop. 2.7]][bookofproofs$1021].
* Let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DA$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$`, `$BD$`, and `$DA$` is equal to twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CB$` and `$BD$`, and the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` and `$DC$`.
* But, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$BD$` and `$DA$`.
* For the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$D$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` (is) equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DC$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$CB$` and `$BA$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`, and twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CB$` and `$BD$`.
* So the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` alone is less than the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$` and `$BA$` by twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CB$` and `$BD$`.
* Thus, in [acute-angled][bookofproofs$6426] [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side subtending the [acute angle][bookofproofs$6426] is less than the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the sides containing the acute angle by twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by one of the sides around the acute angle, to which a [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) falls, and the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) cut off inside (the triangle) by the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) towards the [acute angle][bookofproofs$6426].
* (Which is) the very thing it 	was required to show.
