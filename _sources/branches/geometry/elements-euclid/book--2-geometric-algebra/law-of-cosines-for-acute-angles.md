### (Proposition 13 from Book 2 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In [acute-angled][bookofproofs$6426] [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side subtending the [acute angle][bookofproofs$6426] is less than the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the sides containing the acute angle by twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by one of the sides around the acute angle, to which a [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) falls, and the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) cut off inside (the triangle) by the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) towards the [acute angle][bookofproofs$6426].

* Let `$ABC$` be an [acute-angled][bookofproofs$6426] triangle, having the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$B$` acute.
* And let `$AD$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.12]][bookofproofs$760].
* I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is less than the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$` and `$BA$`, by twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CB$` and `$BD$`.

### Modern Formulation

Algebraically, this proposition states that in an acute triangle 
`\[AC^{\,2} = AB^{\,2} + BC^{\,2} +2\,BD\, BC.\]`

Note that this is a special case for the **law of cosines**: `\[AC^{\,2} = AB^{\,2} + BC^{\,2} -2\,AB\, BC\,\cos {ABC},\]` when `$ABC$` is an [acute angle][bookofproofs$6426], since `\[\cos {ABC} = BD / AB.\]`
