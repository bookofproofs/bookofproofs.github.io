* For let `$CE$` have been drawn from ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$C$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759], and let it be made equal to each of `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let `$EA$` and `$EB$` have been joined.
* And let `$DF$` have been drawn through ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$D$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$EC$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and (let) `$FG$` (have been drawn) through ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$F$`, ([parallel][bookofproofs$788]) to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* And let `$AF$` have been joined.
* And since `$AC$` is equal to `$CE$`, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EAC$` is also equal to the (angle) `$AEC$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* And since the (angle) at `$C$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], the (sum of the) remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] (of triangle `$AEC$`), `$EAC$` and `$AEC$`, is thus equal to one [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* And they are equal.
* Thus, ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$CEA$` and `$CAE$` are each half a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* So, for the same (reasons), ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$CEB$` and `$EBC$` are also each half a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the whole (angle) `$AEB$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And since `$GEF$` is half a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], and `$EGF$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] - for it is equal to the internal and opposite (angle) `$ECB$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915] - the remaining (angle) `$EFG$` is thus half a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, angle `$GEF$` [is] equal to `$EFG$`.
* So the side `$EG$` is also equal to the (side) `$GF$` [[Prop. 1.6]][bookofproofs$743].
* Again, since the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$B$` is half a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], and (angle) `$FDB$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] - for again it is equal to the internal and opposite (angle) `$ECB$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915] - the remaining (angle) `$BFD$` is half a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$B$` (is) equal to `$DFB$`.
* So the side `$FD$` is also equal to the side `$DB$` [[Prop. 1.6]][bookofproofs$743].
* And since `$AC$` is equal to `$CE$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` (is) also equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CE$` is double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EA$` is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CE$`.
* For angle `$ACE$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EA$` is double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`.
* Again, since `$EG$` is equal to `$GF$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` (is) also equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GF$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$EG$` and `$GF$` is double the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$GF$`.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` and `$GF$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` is double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GF$`.
* And `$GF$` (is) equal to `$CD$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` is double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EA$` is also double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` and `$EF$` is double the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CD$`.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AE$` and `$EF$`.
* For the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$AEF$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$` is double the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CD$`.
* And the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DF$` (is) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$`.
* For the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$D$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DF$` is double the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CD$`.
* And `$DF$` (is) equal to `$DB$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` and `$DB$` is double the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CD$`.
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut into equal and unequal (pieces) then the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the unequal pieces of the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is double the (sum of the) [square][bookofproofs$909] on half (the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and (the square) on the (difference) between the (equal and unequal) pieces.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
