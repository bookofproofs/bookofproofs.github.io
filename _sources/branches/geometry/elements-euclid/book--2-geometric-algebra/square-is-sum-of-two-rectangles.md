### (Proposition 2 from Book 2 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut at random then the (sum of the) [rectangle(s) ][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and each of the pieces (of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the whole.
* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` have been cut, at random, at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`.
* I say that the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$BA$` and `$AC$`, is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

With `\(a=AB\)`, `\(b=AC\)`, `\(C=CB\)`, we have `$a=b+c$`, in which case this proposition is a geometric version of the algebraic identity: `\[a=b+c\Rightarrow a\,b+a\,c=a^2.\]`
