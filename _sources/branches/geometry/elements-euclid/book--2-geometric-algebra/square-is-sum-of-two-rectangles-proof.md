* For let the square `$ADEB$` have been described on `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.46]][bookofproofs$965], and let `$CF$` have been drawn through `$C$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$AD$` or `$BE$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* So the (square) `$AE$` is equal to the ([rectangles][bookofproofs$909]) `$AF$` and `$CE$`.
* And `$AE$` is the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`.
* And `$AF$` (is) the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BA$` and `$AC$`.
* For it is contained by `$DA$` and `$AC$`, and `$AD$` (is) equal to `$AB$`.
* And `$CE$` (is) the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* For `$BE$` (is) equal to `$AB$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BA$` and `$AC$`, plus the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`.
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut at random then the (sum of the) [rectangle(s) ][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and each of the pieces (of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the whole.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
