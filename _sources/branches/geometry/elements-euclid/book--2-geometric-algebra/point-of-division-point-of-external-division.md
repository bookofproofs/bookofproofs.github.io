If a point `\(C\)` is taken on a segment `\(\overline{AB}\)`, point `\(C\)` is called the **point of division** between segments `\(\overline{AC}\)` and `\(\overline{CB}\)`. We also say that the segment `\(\overline{AB}\)` is **divided at the point** `\(C\)`. 

If the segment `\(\overline{AB}\)` is extended to point `\(C\)`, then point `\(C\)` is called a **point of external division**.
