* For let the square `$CEFD$` have been described on `$CD$` [[Prop. 1.46]][bookofproofs$965], and let `$DE$` have been joined, and let `$BG$` have been drawn through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$EC$` or `$DF$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and let `$KM$` have been drawn through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$AB$` or `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and finally let `$AK$` have been drawn through `$A$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$CL$` or `$DM$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* Therefore, since `$AC$` is equal to `$CB$`, ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AL$` is also equal to ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$CH$` [[Prop. 1.36]][bookofproofs$945].
* But, ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$CH$` is equal to ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$HF$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959].
* Thus, ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AL$` is also equal to ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$HF$`.
* Let ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$CM$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the whole ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AM$` is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$NOP$`.
* But, `$AM$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`.
* For `$DM$` is equal to `$DB$`.
* Thus, [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$NOP$` is also equal to the [[rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]] by `$AD$` and `$DB$`.
* Let `$LG$`, which is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$`, have been added to both.
* Thus, the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AD$` and `$DB$`, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$`, is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$NOP$` and the (square) `$LG$`.
* But the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$NOP$` and the (square) `$LG$` is (equivalent to) the whole square `$CEFD$`, which is on `$CD$`.
* Thus, the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AD$` and `$DB$`, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$`, is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$`.
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut in half, and any [straight line][bookofproofs$645] added to it [straight-on][bookofproofs$649], then the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) with the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) having being added, and the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) having being added, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on half (of the original [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the sum of half (of the original [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) having been added.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
