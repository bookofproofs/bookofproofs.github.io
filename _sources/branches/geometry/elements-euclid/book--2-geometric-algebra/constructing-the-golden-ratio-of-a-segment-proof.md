* For let the square `$ABDC$` have been described on `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.46]][bookofproofs$965], and let `$AC$` have been cut in half at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757], and let `$BE$` have been joined.
* And let `$CA$` have been drawn through to ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$F$`, and let `$EF$` be made equal to `$BE$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736].
* And let the square `$FH$` have been described on `$AF$` [[Prop. 1.46]][bookofproofs$965], and let `$GH$` have been drawn through to ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$K$`.
* I say that `$AB$` has been cut at `$H$` such as to make the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BH$` equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AH$`.
* For since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` has been cut in half at `$E$`, and `$FA$` has been added to it, the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CF$` and `$FA$`, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$`, is thus equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` [[Prop. 2.6]][bookofproofs$1020].
* And `$EF$` (is) equal to `$EB$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FA$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$`, is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EB$`.
* But, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$BA$` and `$AE$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EB$`.
* For the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$A$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FA$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$`, is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$BA$` and `$AE$`.
* Let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remaining [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CF$` and `$FA$` is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`.
* And `$FK$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CF$` and `$FA$`.
* For `$AF$` (is) equal to `$FG$`.
* And `$AD$` (is) the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$FK$` is equal to the (square) `$AD$`.
* Let ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AK$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remaining (square) `$FH$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$HD$`.
* And `$HD$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BH$`.
* For `$AB$` (is) equal to `$BD$`.
* And `$FH$` (is) the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AH$`.
* Thus, the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BH$` is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$HA$`.
* Thus, the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` has been cut at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$H$` such as to make the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BH$` equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$HA$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
