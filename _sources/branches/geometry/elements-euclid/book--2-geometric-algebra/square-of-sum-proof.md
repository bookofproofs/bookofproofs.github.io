* For let the square `$ADEB$` have been described on `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.46]][bookofproofs$965], and let `$BD$` have been joined, and let `$CF$` have been drawn through `$C$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$AD$` or `$EB$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and let `$HK$` have been drawn through `$G$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$AB$` or `$DE$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* And since `$CF$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AD$`, and `$BD$` has fallen across them, the external angle `$CGB$` is equal to the internal and opposite (angle) `$ADB$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* But, `$ADB$` is equal to `$ABD$`, since the side `$BA$` is also equal to `$AD$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* Thus, angle `$CGB$` is also equal to `$GBC$`.
* So the side `$BC$` is equal to the side `$CG$` [[Prop. 1.6]][bookofproofs$743].
* But, `$CB$` is equal to `$GK$`, and `$CG$` to `$KB$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* Thus, `$GK$` is also equal to `$KB$`.
* Thus, `$CGKB$` is equilateral.
* So I say that (it is) also right-angled.
* For since `$CG$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BK$` [and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$CB$` has fallen across them], the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$KBC$` and `$GCB$` are thus equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* But `$KBC$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$BCG$` (is) also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* So the opposite ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$CGK$` and `$GKB$` are also [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* Thus, `$CGKB$` is right-angled.
* And it was also shown (to be) equilateral.
* Thus, it is a square.
* And it is on `$CB$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$HF$` is also a square.
* And it is on `$HG$`, that is to say [on] `$AC$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* Thus, the squares `$HF$` and `$KC$` are on `$AC$` and `$CB$` (respectively).
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AG$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$GE$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959].
* And `$AG$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* For `$GC$` (is) equal to `$CB$`.
* Thus, `$GE$` is also equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangles][bookofproofs$909]) `$AG$` and `$GE$` are equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* And `$HF$` and `$CK$` are the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CB$` (respectively).
* Thus, the four (figures) `$HF$`, `$CK$`, `$AG$`, and `$GE$` are equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$BC$`, and twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* But, the (figures) `$HF$`, `$CK$`, `$AG$`, and `$GE$` are (equivalent to) the whole of `$ADEB$`, which is the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CB$`, and twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut at random then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the pieces (of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the pieces.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
