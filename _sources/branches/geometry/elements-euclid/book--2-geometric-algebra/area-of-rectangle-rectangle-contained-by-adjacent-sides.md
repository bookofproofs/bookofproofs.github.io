> Any [rectangular][bookofproofs$653] [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] is said to be **contained** by the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] containing the [right angle][bookofproofs$653]. 

### Modern Formulation

A [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] is said to be **contained** by any two adjacent sides. Thus, the rectangle `\(\boxdot{ABCD}\)` is said to be contained by `\(\overline{AB}\)`, `\(\overline{AD}\)`, or by `\(\overline{AB}\)`, `\(\overline{BC}\)`, etc.

The area of a rectangle contained by two sides is denoted by the product of their lengths. Thus, the area of the rectangle  `\(\boxdot{ABCD}\)` is `\(\overline{AB}\cdot \overline{AD}\)`, or `\(\overline{AB}\cdot \overline{BC}\)`, etc.
