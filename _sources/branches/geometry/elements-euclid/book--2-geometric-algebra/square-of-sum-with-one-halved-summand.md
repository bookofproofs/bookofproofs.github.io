### (Proposition 6 from Book 2 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut in half, and any [straight line][bookofproofs$645] added to it [straight-on][bookofproofs$649], then the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) with the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) having being added, and the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) having being added, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on half (of the original [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the sum of half (of the original [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) having been added.
* For let any [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` have been cut in half at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, and let any [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$` have been added to it [straight-on][bookofproofs$649].
* I say that the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AD$` and `$DB$`, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$`, is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$`.

### Modern Formulation

Algebraically, with `\(a:=AB\)` and `\(b:=BD\)`, the proposition states that 
`\[\left(\frac a2\right)^2+(a+b)b=\left(\frac a2+b\right)^2.\]`
