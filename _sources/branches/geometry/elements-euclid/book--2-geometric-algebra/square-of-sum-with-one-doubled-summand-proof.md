* For let `$BD$` have been produced in a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] [with the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`], and let `$BD$` be made equal to `$CB$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let the square `$AEFD$` have been described on `$AD$` [[Prop. 1.46]][bookofproofs$965], and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn double.
* Therefore, since `$CB$` is equal to `$BD$`, but `$CB$` is equal to `$GK$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933], and `$BD$` to `$KN$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933], `$GK$` is thus also equal to `$KN$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$QR$` is equal to `$RP$`.
* And since `$BC$` is equal to `$BD$`, and `$GK$` to `$KN$`, (square) `$CK$` is thus also equal to (square) `$KD$`, and (square) `$GR$` to (square) `$RN$` [[Prop. 1.36]][bookofproofs$945].
* But, (square) `$CK$` is equal to (square) `$RN$`.
* For (they are) complements in the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CP$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959].
* Thus, (square) `$KD$` is also equal to (square) `$GR$`.
* Thus, the four (squares) `$DK$`, `$CK$`, `$GR$`, and `$RN$` are equal to one another.
* Thus, the four (taken together) are quadruple (square) `$CK$`.
* Again, since `$CB$` is equal to `$BD$`, but `$BD$` (is) equal to `$BK$` - that is to say, `$CG$` - and `$CB$` is equal to `$GK$` - that is to say, `$GQ$` - `$CG$` is thus also equal to `$GQ$`.
* And since `$CG$` is equal to `$GQ$`, and `$QR$` to `$RP$`, ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AG$` is also equal to ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$MQ$`, and ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$QL$` to ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$RF$` [[Prop. 1.36]][bookofproofs$945].
* But, ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$MQ$` is equal to ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$QL$`.
* For (they are) complements in the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ML$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959].
* Thus, ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AG$` is also equal to ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$RF$`.
* Thus, the four ([rectangles][bookofproofs$909]) `$AG$`, `$MQ$`, `$QL$`, and `$RF$` are equal to one another.
* Thus, the four (taken together) are quadruple ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AG$`.
* And it was also shown that the four (squares) `$CK$`, `$KD$`, `$GR$`, and `$RN$` (taken together are) quadruple (square) `$CK$`.
* Thus, the eight (figures taken together), which comprise the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$STU$`, are quadruple ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AK$`.
* And since `$AK$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BD$`, for `$BK$` (is) equal to `$BD$`, four times the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BD$` is quadruple ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AK$`.
* But the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$STU$` was also shown (to be equal to) quadruple ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AK$`.
* Thus, four times the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BD$` is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$STU$`.
* Let `$OH$`, which is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`, have been added to both.
* Thus, four times the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BD$`, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`, is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$STU$`, and the (square) `$OH$`.
* But, the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$STU$` and the (square) `$OH$` is (equivalent to) the whole square `$AEFD$`, which is on `$AD$`.
* Thus, four times the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BD$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`, is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$`.
* And `$BD$` (is) equal to `$BC$`.
* Thus, four times the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`, is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$`, that is to say the square described on `$AB$` and `$BC$`, as on one (complete [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut at random then four times the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and one of the pieces (of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the remaining piece, is equal to the square described on the whole and the former piece, as on one (complete [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
