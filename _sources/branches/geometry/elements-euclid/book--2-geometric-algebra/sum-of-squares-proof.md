* For let the square `$ADEB$` have been described on `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.46]][bookofproofs$965], and let the (rest of) the figure have been drawn.
* Therefore, since ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AG$` is equal to ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$GE$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959], let the (square) `$CF$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the whole ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AF$` is equal to the whole ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$CE$`.
* Thus, ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AF$` plus ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$CE$` is double ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AF$`.
* But, ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AF$` plus ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$CE$` is the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$KLM$`, and the square `$CF$`.
* Thus, the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$KLM$`, and the square `$CF$`, is double the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AF$`.
* But double the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AF$` is also twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* For `$BF$` (is) equal to `$BC$`.
* Thus, the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$KLM$`, and the square `$CF$`, are equal to twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* Let `$DG$`, which is the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`, have been added to both.
* Thus, the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$KLM$`, and the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$BG$` and `$GD$`, are equal to twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`.
* But, the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$KLM$` and the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$BG$` and `$GD$` is (equivalent to) the whole of `$ADEB$` and `$CF$`, which are the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$` (respectively).
* Thus, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is equal to twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BC$`, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`.
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut at random then the sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and one of the pieces (of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), is equal to twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the whole, and the said piece, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the remaining piece.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
