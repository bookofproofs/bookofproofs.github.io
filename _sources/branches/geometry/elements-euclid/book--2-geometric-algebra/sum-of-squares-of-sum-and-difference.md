### (Proposition 9 from Book 2 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut into equal and unequal (pieces) then the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the unequal pieces of the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is double the (sum of the) [square][bookofproofs$909] on half (the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and (the square) on the (difference) between the (equal and unequal) pieces.
* For let any [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` have been cut - equally at `$C$`, and unequally at `$D$`.
* I say that the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` and `$DB$` is double the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CD$`.

### Modern Formulation

Algebraically, with `\(a=AC\)` and `\(b=CD\)`, this proposition states that 

`\[(a+b)^{2}+(a-b)^{2}=2(a^2+b^2).\]`
