### (Proposition 4 from Book 2 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut at random then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the pieces (of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the pieces.
* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` have been cut, at random, at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$C$`.
* I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CB$`, and twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.

### Modern Formulation

With `\(a=AC\)` and `\(b=CB\)`, this proposition is a geometric version of the algebraic identity: `\[(a+b)^2 = a^2+2\,a\,b+b^2.\]`

See also [binomial theorem][bookofproofs$1397] for `$n=2.$`
