### (Proposition 14 from Book 2 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To construct a [square][bookofproofs$909] equal to a given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687].
* Let `$A$` be the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687].
* So it is required to construct a [square][bookofproofs$909] equal to the [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$A$`.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to construct a square with the area equal to the area of a given an arbitrary convex `\(n\)`-sided figure.
