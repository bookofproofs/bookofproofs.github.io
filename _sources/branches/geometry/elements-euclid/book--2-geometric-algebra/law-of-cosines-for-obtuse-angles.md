### (Proposition 12 from Book 2 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In [obtuse-angled triangles][bookofproofs$6431], the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side subtending the [obtuse][bookofproofs$689] angle is greater than the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the sides containing the [obtuse angle][bookofproofs$689] by twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by one of the sides around the obtuse angle, to which a [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) falls, and the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) cut off outside (the triangle) by the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) towards the [obtuse angle][bookofproofs$689].
* Let `$ABC$` be an [obtuse-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431], having the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` obtuse.
* And let `$BD$` be drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$`, [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$CA$` produced [[Prop. 1.12]][bookofproofs$760].
* I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is greater than the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` and `$AC$`, by twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CA$` and `$AD$`.

### Modern Formulation

Algebraically, this proposition states that in an obtuse triangle 
`\[BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2  + 2\,AD\,AC.\]`

Note that this is a special case for the **law of cosines**: `\[BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 -2\,AB\,AC\,\cos {BAC},\]` when `$BAC$` is an [obtuse angle][bookofproofs$689], since `\[\cos {BAC} = - AD / AB.\]`
