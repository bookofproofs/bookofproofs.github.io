> And in any parallelogrammic figure, let any one whatsoever of the parallelograms about its diagonal, (taken) with its two complements, be called[^1] a **gnomon**.

### Modern Formulation

In a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$907] `\(\boxdot{ABCD}\)` let `\(\overline{AB}\parallel\overline{CD}\parallel\overline{A_1B_2}\)` and `\(\overline{AD}\parallel\overline{BC}\parallel\overline{B_1C_1}\)`, like shown in the following figure:

Then the four possible **gnomons** of the parallelogram are the gray-marked polygons:

![gnomon_1](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/gnomon_1.jpg?raw=true)



![gnomon_2](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/gnomon_2.jpg?raw=true)


![gnomon_3](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/gnomon_3.jpg?raw=true)



[^1]: The name "gnomon" was probably chosen by Euclid because the figures in the parallelogram called gnomons are similar to the part of a sundial that casts a shadow:
