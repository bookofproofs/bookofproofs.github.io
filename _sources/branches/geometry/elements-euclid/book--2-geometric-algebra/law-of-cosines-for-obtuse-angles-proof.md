* For since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$CD$` has been cut, at random, at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$` is thus equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CA$` and `$AD$`, and twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CA$` and `$AD$` [[Prop. 2.4]][bookofproofs$1017].
* Let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DB$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$CD$` and `$DB$` is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CA$`, `$AD$`, and `$DB$`, and twice the [[rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]] by `$CA$` and `$AD$`.
* But, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$CD$` and `$DB$`.
* For the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$D$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DB$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$` is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CA$` and `$AB$`, and twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CA$` and `$AD$`.
* So the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$` is greater than the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$CA$` and `$AB$` by twice the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CA$` and `$AD$`.
* Thus, in [obtuse-angled triangles][bookofproofs$6431], the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side subtending the obtuse angle is greater than the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the sides containing the [obtuse angle][bookofproofs$689] by twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by one of the sides around the obtuse angle, to which a [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) falls, and the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) cut off outside (the triangle) by the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) towards the [obtuse angle][bookofproofs$689].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
