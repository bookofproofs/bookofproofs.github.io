* For let the right-angled [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BD$`, equal to the [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$A$`, have been constructed [[Prop. 1.45]][bookofproofs$963].
* Therefore, if `$BE$` is equal to `$ED$` then that (which) was prescribed has taken place.
* For the square `$BD$`, equal to the [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$A$`, has been constructed.
* And if not, then one of the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BE$` or `$ED$` is greater (than the other).
* Let `$BE$` be greater, and let it have been produced to `$F$`, and let `$EF$` be made equal to `$ED$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736].
* And let `$BF$` have been cut in half at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$G$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757].
* And, with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$G$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] one of the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$GB$` or `$GF$`, let the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$BHF$` have been drawn.
* And let `$DE$` have been produced to `$H$`, and let `$GH$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BF$` has been cut - equally at `$G$`, and unequally at `$E$` - the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$BE$` and `$EF$`, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$`, is thus equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$GF$` [[Prop. 2.5]][bookofproofs$1019].
* And `$GF$` (is) equal to `$GH$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BE$` and `$EF$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GE$`, is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$`.
* And the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$HE$` and `$EG$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GH$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BE$` and `$EF$`, plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GE$`, is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$HE$` and `$EG$`.
* Let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$GE$` have been taken from both.
* Thus, the remaining [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$BE$` and `$EF$` is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EH$`.
* But, `$BD$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BE$` and `$EF$`.
* For `$EF$` (is) equal to `$ED$`.
* Thus, the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BD$` is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$HE$`.
* And `$BD$` (is) equal to the [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$A$`.
* Thus, the [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$A$` is also equal to the square (which) can be described on `$EH$`.
* Thus, a square - (namely), that (which) can be described on `$EH$` - has been constructed, equal to the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$A$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
