* For let `$BF$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759], and let `$BG$` be made equal to `$A$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let `$GH$` have been drawn through ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$G$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and let `$DK$`, `$EL$`, and `$CH$` have been drawn through ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$D$`, `$E$`, and `$C$` (respectively), [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BG$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* So the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$BH$` is equal to the ([rectangles][bookofproofs$909]) `$BK$`, `$DL$`, and `$EH$`.
* And `$BH$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$BC$`.
* For it is contained by `$GB$` and `$BC$`, and `$BG$` (is) equal to `$A$`.
* And `$BK$` (is) the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$BD$`.
* For it is contained by `$GB$` and `$BD$`, and `$BG$` (is) equal to `$A$`.
* And `$DL$` (is) the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$DE$`.
* For `$DK$`, that is to say `$BG$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933], (is) equal to `$A$`.
* Similarly, `$EH$` (is) also the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$EC$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$BC$` is equal to the ([rectangles][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$BD$`, by `$A$` and `$DE$`, and, finally, by `$A$` and `$EC$`.
* Thus, if there are two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and one of them is cut into any number of pieces whatsoever, then the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] is equal to the (sum of the) [rectangles][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the uncut ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and every one of the pieces (of the cut [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
