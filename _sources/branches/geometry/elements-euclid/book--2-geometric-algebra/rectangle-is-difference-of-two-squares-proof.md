* For let the square `$CEFB$` have been described on `$CB$` [[Prop. 1.46]][bookofproofs$965], and let `$BE$` have been joined, and let `$DG$` have been drawn through `$D$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$CE$` or `$BF$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and again let `$KM$` have been drawn through `$H$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$AB$` or `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and again let `$AK$` have been drawn through `$A$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$CL$` or `$BM$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* And since the complement `$CH$` is equal to the complement `$HF$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959], let the (square) `$DM$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the whole ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$CM$` is equal to the whole ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$DF$`.
* But, ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$CM$` is equal to ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AL$`, since `$AC$` is also equal to `$CB$` [[Prop. 1.36]][bookofproofs$945].
* Thus, ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AL$` is also equal to ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$DF$`.
* Let ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$CH$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the whole ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$AH$` is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$NOP$`.
* But, `$AH$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`.
* For `$DH$` (is) equal to `$DB$`.
* Thus, the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$NOP$` is also equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DB$`.
* Let `$LG$`, which is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$`, have been added to both.
* Thus, the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$NOP$` and the (square) `$LG$` are equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AD$` and `$DB$`, and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$`.
* But, the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$NOP$` and the (square) `$LG$` is (equivalent to) the whole square `$CEFB$`, which is on `$CB$`.
* Thus, the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AD$` and `$DB$`, plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$`, is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$`.
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut into equal and unequal (pieces) then the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the unequal pieces of the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the (difference) between the (equal and unequal) pieces, is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on half (of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
