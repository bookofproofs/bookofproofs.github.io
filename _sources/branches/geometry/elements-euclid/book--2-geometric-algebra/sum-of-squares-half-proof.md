* For let `$CE$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759], and let it be made equal to each of `$AC$` and `$CB$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let `$EA$` and `$EB$` have been joined.
* And let `$EF$` have been drawn through `$E$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AD$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and let `$FD$` have been drawn through `$D$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CE$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* And since some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$` falls across the [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$EC$` and `$FD$`, the (internal [angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$CEF$` and `$EFD$` are thus equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* Thus, `$FEB$` and `$EFD$` are less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) produced from (internal [angles][bookofproofs$650] whose sum is) less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] meet together [ [Post. 5] ][bookofproofs$939].
* Thus, being produced in the direction of `$B$` and `$D$`, the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$EB$` and `$FD$` will meet.
* Let them have been produced, and let them meet together at `$G$`, and let `$AG$` have been joined.
* And since `$AC$` is equal to `$CE$`, angle `$EAC$` is also equal to (angle) `$AEC$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* And the (angle) at `$C$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$EAC$` and `$AEC$` [are] each half a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$CEB$` and `$EBC$` are also each half a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$AEB$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And since `$EBC$` is half a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], `$DBG$` (is) thus also half a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.15]][bookofproofs$782].
* And `$BDG$` is also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* For it is equal to `$DCE$`.
* For (they are) alternate ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$DGB$` is half a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$DGB$` is equal to `$DBG$`.
* So side `$BD$` is also equal to side `$GD$` [[Prop. 1.6]][bookofproofs$743].
* Again, since `$EGF$` is half a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], and the (angle) at `$F$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], for it is equal to the opposite (angle) at `$C$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933], the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$FEG$` is thus half a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EGF$` (is) equal to `$FEG$`.
* So the side `$GF$` is also equal to the side `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.6]][bookofproofs$743].
* And since [$EC$ is equal to `$CA$`] the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EC$` is [also] equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CA$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$EC$` and `$CA$` is double the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CA$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EA$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$EC$` and `$CA$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EA$` is double the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`.
* Again, since `$FG$` is equal to `$EF$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FG$` is also equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$GF$` and `$FE$` is double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$GF$` and `$FE$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` is double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$`.
* And `$EF$` (is) equal to `$CD$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` is double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$`.
* But it was also shown that the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EA$` (is) double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` and `$EG$` is double the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CD$`.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` and `$EG$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` is double the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AC$` and `$CD$`.
* And the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AD$` and `$DG$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AG$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the (sum of the) [squares] on `$AD$` and `$DG$` is double the (sum of the) [squares] on `$AC$` and `$CD$`.
* And `$DG$` (is) equal to `$DB$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the) [squares] on `$AD$` and `$DB$` is double the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` and `$CD$`.
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut in half, and any [straight line][bookofproofs$645] added to it [straight-on][bookofproofs$649], then the sum of the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) with the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) having been added, and the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) having been added, is double the (sum of the square) on half (the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and the square described on the sum of half (the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) having been added, as on one (complete [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
