### (Proposition 1 from Book 2 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If there are two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and one of them is cut into any number of pieces whatsoever, then the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] is equal to the (sum of the) [rectangles][bookofproofs$909] contained by the uncut ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and every one of the pieces (of the cut [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Let `$A$` and `$BC$` be the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and let `$BC$` be cut, at random, at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` and `$E$`.
* I say that the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] contained by `$A$` and `$BC$` is equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909](s) contained by `$A$` and `$BD$`, by `$A$` and `$DE$`, and, finally, by `$A$` and `$EC$`.

### Modern Formulation

Algebraically and more generally, with `$a=A=BF,$` `$b=BD,$` `$c=DE,$` and `$d=EC,$` this proposition is a geometric version of the algebraic identity: `\[a \,(b+c+d+\cdots) = a\,b + a\,c + a\,d + \cdots.\]`
