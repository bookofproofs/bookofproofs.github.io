### (Corollary to Proposition 16 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So, from this, (it is) manifest that a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of a [circle][bookofproofs$690], from its extremity, touches the [circle][bookofproofs$690] [and that the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] touches the [circle][bookofproofs$690] at a single [point][bookofproofs$631], in as much as it was also shown that a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) meeting (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) at two ([points][bookofproofs$631]) falls inside it [[Prop. 3.2]][bookofproofs$1061] (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

### Modern Formulation

A [straight line][bookofproofs$645] [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to a [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of a [circle][bookofproofs$690] and going through one of its ends is obviously a [tangent][bookofproofs$1853], i.e. it has only one [point][bookofproofs$631] in common with the circle.
