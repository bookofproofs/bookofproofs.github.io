### (Proposition 26 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850], equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [stand upon][bookofproofs$6435] equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] whether they are standing at the [center][bookofproofs$6428] or at the [circumference][bookofproofs$690].
* Let `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` be [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850], and within them let `$BGC$` and `$EHF$` be equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] at the [center][bookofproofs$6428], and `$BAC$` and `$EDF$` (equal [angles][bookofproofs$650]) at the [circumference][bookofproofs$690].
* I say that [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BKC$` is equal to [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ELF$`.

### Modern Formulation

Let two given [circles][bookofproofs$690] be [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] and let some of its [inscribed angles][bookofproofs$6434] be congruent ($\angle{BAC}=\angle{EDF}$) or some of its [central angles][bookofproofs$2360] be congruent ($\angle{BGC}=\angle{EHF}$) be congruent. Then the corresponding [arcs][bookofproofs$1852] are also congruent ($BKC=ELF$).
