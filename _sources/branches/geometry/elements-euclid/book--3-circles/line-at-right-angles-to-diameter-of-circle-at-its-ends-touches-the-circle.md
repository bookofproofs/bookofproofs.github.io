### (Proposition 16 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of a [circle][bookofproofs$690], from its end, will fall outside the [circle][bookofproofs$690]. And another [straight line][bookofproofs$645] cannot be inserted into the space between the (aforementioned) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] and the [circumference][bookofproofs$690]. And the [angle][bookofproofs$650] of the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] is greater than any [acute][bookofproofs$6426] [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] whatsoever, and the remaining (angle is) less (than any [acute][bookofproofs$6426] [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650]).

* Let `$ABC$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690] around the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$D$` and the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$AB$`.
* I say that the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) drawn from `$A$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759], from its end, will fall outside the [circle][bookofproofs$690].

### Modern Formulation

A [straight line][bookofproofs$645] ($AE$) going through the endpoint ($A$) of a diameter ($\overline{AB}$) of a given circle is [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to this diameter and lies outside the circle.

Moreover:

* if `$\alpha$` is the angle[^1] between `$AE$` and the line of the circumference of the circle at the point `$A,$` 
* and if `$\beta$` is the angle[^1] between the diameter `$\overline{AB}$` and the line of the circumference of the circle at the point `$A$`.

Then for any [acute][bookofproofs$6426] [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] `$\gamma$` the following holds: `$\alpha < \gamma < \beta.$`

[^1]: Please note that the angles `$\alpha$` and `$\beta$` are not rectilinear but formed between a straight line (a tangent respectively a diameter) and a curved line (the circumference of the circle).
