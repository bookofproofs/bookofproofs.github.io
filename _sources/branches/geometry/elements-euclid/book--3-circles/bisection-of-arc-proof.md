* Let `$ADB$` be the given [circumference][bookofproofs$690].
* So it is required to cut [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ADB$` in half.
* Let `$AB$` have been joined, and let it have been cut in half at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$C$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757].
* And let `$CD$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759].
* And let `$AD$`, and `$DB$` have been joined.

* And since `$AC$` is equal to `$CB$`, and `$CD$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$`, `$CD$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BC$`, `$CD$` (respectively).
* And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ACD$` (is) equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BCD$`.
* For (they are) each [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the base `$AD$` is equal to the base `$DB$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] cut off equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690], the greater ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] being equal) to the greater, and the lesser to the lesser [[Prop. 1.28]][bookofproofs$913].
* And the [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$AD$` and `$DB$` are each less than a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430].
* Thus, [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$AD$` (is) equal to [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$DB$`.
* Thus, the given [circumference][bookofproofs$690] has been cut in half at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.[^1]

[^1]: It has been shown that an [arc][bookofproofs$1852] can be bisected (editor's note).
