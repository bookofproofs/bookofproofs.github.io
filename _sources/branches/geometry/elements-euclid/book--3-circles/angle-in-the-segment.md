> And the **angle in a segment** is the [angle][bookofproofs$650] contained by the joined [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], when any [point][bookofproofs$631] is taken on the circumference of a segment, and [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are joined from it to the ends of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is the base of the segment.

### Modern Formulation

An **inscribed angle** is the angle `$\alpha$` contained by the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joining the ends of the [arc][bookofproofs$1855] `$AB$` with any point on the circumference of a [segment of the circle][bookofproofs$1852].
