* For (if) not then, if possible, let it fall outside (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), like `$AEB$` (in the figure).
* And let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and let it be (at [point][bookofproofs$631]) `$D$`.
* And let `$DA$` and `$DB$` have been joined, and let `$DFE$` have been drawn through.
* Therefore, since `$DA$` is equal to `$DB$`, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DAE$` (is) thus also equal to `$DBE$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* And since in triangle `$DAE$` the one side, `$AEB$`, has been produced, angle `$DEB$` (is) thus greater than `$DAE$` [[Prop. 1.16]][bookofproofs$784].
* And `$DAE$` (is) equal to `$DBE$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* Thus, `$DEB$` (is) greater than `$DBE$`.
* And the greater angle is subtended by the greater side [[Prop. 1.19]][bookofproofs$793].
* Thus, `$DB$` (is) greater than `$DE$`.
* And `$DB$` (is) equal to `$DF$`.
* Thus, `$DF$` (is) greater than `$DE$`, the lesser than the greater.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining `$A$` to `$B$` will not fall outside the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* So, similarly, we can show that neither (will it fall) on the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] itself.
* Thus, (it will fall) inside (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]).
* Thus, if two [points][bookofproofs$631] are taken at random on the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of a [circle][bookofproofs$690] then the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining the [points][bookofproofs$631] will fall inside the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
