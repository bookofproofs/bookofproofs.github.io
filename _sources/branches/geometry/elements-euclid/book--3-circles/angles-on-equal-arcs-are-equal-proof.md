* For if `$BGC$` is unequal to `$EHF$`, one of them is greater.
* Let `$BGC$` be greater, and let the (angle) `$BGK$`, equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EHF$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BG$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` on it [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* But equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] (in [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850]) [stand upon][bookofproofs$6435] equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690], when they are at the [centers][bookofproofs$6428] [[Prop. 3.26]][bookofproofs$1906].
* Thus, [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BK$` (is) equal to [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$EF$`.
* But, `$EF$` is equal to `$BC$`.
* Thus, `$BK$` is also equal to `$BC$`, the lesser to the greater.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BGC$` is not unequal to `$EHF$`.
* Thus, (it is) equal.
* And the (angle) at `$A$` is half `$BGC$`, and the (angle) at `$D$` half `$EHF$` [[Prop. 3.20]][bookofproofs$1900].
* Thus, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$A$` (is) also equal to the (angle) at `$D$`.
* Thus, in [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850], [angles][bookofproofs$650] standing upon equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] are equal to one another, whether they are standing at the [center][bookofproofs$6428] or at the [circumference][bookofproofs$690].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^1]

[^1]: It has been shown that in [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] [circles][bookofproofs$690] the equality of [arcs][bookofproofs$1852] ($BC=EF$) leads to the congruence of the corresponding [inscribed angles][bookofproofs$6434] ($\angle{BAC}=\angle{EDF}$) and the congruence of the corresponding [central angles][bookofproofs$2360] ($\angle{BGC}=\angle{EHF}$) (editor's note).
