* For if not, let `$FG$` have been drawn from `$F$`, [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$DE$` [[Prop. 1.12]][bookofproofs$760].
* Therefore, since angle `$FGC$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], (angle) `$FCG$` is thus acute [[Prop. 1.17]][bookofproofs$789].
* And the greater angle is subtended by the greater side [[Prop. 1.19]][bookofproofs$793].
* Thus, `$FC$` (is) greater than `$FG$`.
* And `$FC$` (is) equal to `$FB$`.
* Thus, `$FB$` (is) also greater than `$FG$`, the lesser than the greater.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$FG$` is not [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$DE$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that neither (is) any other ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) except `$FC$`.
* Thus, `$FC$` is [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$DE$`.
* Thus, if some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] touches a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and some (other) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is joined from the [center][bookofproofs$6428] (of the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) to the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact, then the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) so joined will be [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the [tangent][bookofproofs$1853].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^1]

[^1]: It has been shown that if a [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] and a [radius][bookofproofs$690] of a given circle intersect, then they are [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] (editor's note).
