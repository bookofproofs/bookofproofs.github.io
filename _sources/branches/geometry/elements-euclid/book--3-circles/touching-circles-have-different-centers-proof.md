* For, if possible, let `$F$` be (the common [center][bookofproofs$6428]), and let `$FC$` have been joined, and let `$FEB$` have been drawn through (the two [circles][bookofproofs$690]), at random.
* Therefore, since [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, `$FC$` is equal to `$FB$`.
* Again, since [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$CDE$`, `$FC$` is equal to `$FE$`.
* But `$FC$` was shown (to be) equal to `$FB$`.
* Thus, `$FE$` is also equal to `$FB$`, the lesser to the greater.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` is not the (common) [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` and `$CDE$`.
* Thus, if two [circles][bookofproofs$690] [touch one another][bookofproofs$1851] then they will not have the same [center][bookofproofs$6428].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
