* For let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and let it be (at [point][bookofproofs$631]) `$E$`, and let `$EA$` and `$EB$` have been joined.
* And since `$AF$` is equal to `$FB$`, and `$FE$` (is) common, two (sides of triangle `$AFE$`) [are] equal to two (sides of triangle `$BFE$`).
* And the base `$EA$` (is) equal to the base `$EB$`.
* Thus, angle `$AFE$` is equal to angle `$BFE$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* And when a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] stood upon (another) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] makes adjacent [angles][bookofproofs$650] (which are) equal to one another, each of the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [ [Def. 1.10] ][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$AFE$` and `$BFE$` are each [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$`, which is through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] and cuts in half the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$`, which is not through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], also cuts ($AB$) at [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And so let `$CD$` cut `$AB$` at [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* I say that it also cuts ($AB$) in half.
* That is to say, that `$AF$` is equal to `$FB$`.
* For, with the same construction, since `$EA$` is equal to `$EB$`, angle `$EAF$` is also equal to `$EBF$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* And the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] `$AFE$` is also equal to the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] `$BFE$`.
* Thus, `$EAF$` and `$EFB$` are two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having two [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to two [angles][bookofproofs$650], and one side equal to one side - (namely), their common (side) `$EF$`, subtending one of the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650].
* Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the (corresponding) remaining sides [[Prop. 1.26]][bookofproofs$905].
* Thus, `$AF$` (is) equal to `$FB$`.
* Thus, in a [circle][bookofproofs$690], if any [straight line][bookofproofs$645] through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] cuts in half any [straight line][bookofproofs$645] not through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] then it also cuts it at [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And (conversely) if it cuts it at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] then it also cuts it in half.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
