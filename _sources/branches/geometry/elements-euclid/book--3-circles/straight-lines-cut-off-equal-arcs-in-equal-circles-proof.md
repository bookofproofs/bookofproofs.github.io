* For let the [centers][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circles][bookofproofs$690], `$K$` and `$L$`, have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and let `$AK$`, `$KB$`, `$DL$`, and `$LE$` have been joined.
* And since ($ABC$ and `$DEF$`) are [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850], their [radii][bookofproofs$690] are also equal [ [Def. 3.1] ][bookofproofs$1850].
* So the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AK$`, `$KB$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DL$`, `$LE$` (respectively).
* And the base `$AB$` (is) equal to the base `$DE$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$AKB$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DLE$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* And equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [stand upon][bookofproofs$6435] equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690], when they are at the [centers][bookofproofs$6428] [[Prop. 3.26]][bookofproofs$1906].
* Thus, [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$AGB$` (is) equal to `$DHE$`.
* And the whole [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` is also equal to the whole [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$DEF$`.
* Thus, the remaining [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ACB$` is also equal to the remaining [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$DFE$`.
* Thus, in [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850], equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] cut off equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690], the greater ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] being equal) to the greater, and the lesser to the lesser.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^1]

[^1]: It has been shown that [arcs][bookofproofs$1852] are [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] in [congruent circles][bookofproofs$1850], if [segments][bookofproofs$645] with equal lengths connect their endpoints (editor's note).
