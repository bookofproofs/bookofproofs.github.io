* For let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and let it be (at [point][bookofproofs$631]) `$F$`.
* And let `$BF$` and `$FD$` have been joined.
* And since angle `$BFD$` is at the [center][bookofproofs$6428], and `$BAD$` at the [circumference][bookofproofs$690], and they have the same [circumference][bookofproofs$690] base `$BCD$`, angle `$BFD$` is thus double `$BAD$` [[Prop. 3.20]][bookofproofs$1900].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$BFD$` is also double `$BED$`.
* Thus, `$BAD$` (is) equal to `$BED$`.
* Thus, in a [circle][bookofproofs$690], [angles][bookofproofs$650] in the same [segment][bookofproofs$1852] are equal to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^1] 

[^1]: It has been shown that the [inscribed angles][bookofproofs$6434] standing upon the same [arc][bookofproofs$6435] are equal (editor's note).
