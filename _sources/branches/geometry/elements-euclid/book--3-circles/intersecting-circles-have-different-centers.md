### (Proposition 5 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [circles][bookofproofs$690] cut one another then they will not have the same [center][bookofproofs$6428].
* For let the two [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` and `$CDG$` cut one another at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` and `$C$`.
* I say that they will not have the same [center][bookofproofs$6428].

### Modern Formulation

If two circles [intersect][bookofproofs$1851], then their [centers][bookofproofs$6428] are different.
