* Let `$ABC$` be the given [segment of a circle][bookofproofs$1852].
* So it is required to complete the [circle][bookofproofs$690] for segment `$ABC$`, the very one of which it is a [segment][bookofproofs$1852].
* For let `$AC$` have been cut in half at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$D$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757], and let `$DB$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AC$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759].
* And let `$AB$` have been joined.

* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABD$` is surely either greater than, equal to, or less than (angle) `$BAD$`.
* First of all, let it be greater.
   * And Let [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BAE$`, equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABD$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BA$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` on it [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
   * And let `$DB$` have been drawn through to `$E$`, and let `$EC$` have been joined.
   * Therefore, since angle `$ABE$` is equal to `$BAE$`, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EB$` is thus also equal to `$EA$` [[Prop. 1.6]][bookofproofs$743].
   * And since `$AD$` is equal to `$DC$`, and `$DE$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`, `$DE$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$`, `$DE$`, respectively.
   * And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ADE$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$CDE$`.
   * For each (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
   * Thus, the base `$AE$` is equal to the base `$CE$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
   * But, `$AE$` was shown (to be) equal to `$BE$`.
   * Thus, `$BE$` is also equal to `$CE$`.
   * Thus, the three ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AE$`, `$EB$`, and `$EC$` are equal to one another.
   * Thus, if a [circle][bookofproofs$690] is drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$E$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] one of `$AE$`, `$EB$`, or `$EC$`, it will also go through the remaining [points][bookofproofs$631] (of the segment), and the (associated [circle][bookofproofs$690]) will have been completed [[Prop. 3.9]][bookofproofs$1889].
   * Thus, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] has been completed from the given [segment of a circle][bookofproofs$1852].
   * And (it is) clear that the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$ABC$` is less than a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430], because the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$E$` happens to lie outside it.
* And, similarly, even if angle `$ABD$` is equal to `$BAD$`, 
   * (since) `$AD$` becomes equal to each of `$BD$` [[Prop. 1.6]][bookofproofs$743] and `$DC$`, the three ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DA$`, `$DB$`, and `$DC$` will be equal to one another.
   * And [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` will be the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the completed [circle][bookofproofs$690].
   * And `$ABC$` will manifestly be a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430].
* And if `$ABD$` is less than `$BAD$`, 
   * and we construct (angle `$BAE$`), equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABD$`, on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BA$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` on it [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897], then the [center][bookofproofs$6428] will fall on `$DB$`, inside the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$ABC$`.
   * And segment `$ABC$` will manifestly be greater than a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430].
   * Thus, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] has been completed from the given [segment of a circle][bookofproofs$1852].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
