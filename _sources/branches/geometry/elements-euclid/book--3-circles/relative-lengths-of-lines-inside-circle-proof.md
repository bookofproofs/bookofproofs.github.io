* For let `$BE$`, `$CE$`, and `$GE$` have been joined.
* And since for every [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] (any) two sides are greater than the remaining (side) [[Prop. 1.20]][bookofproofs$795], `$EB$` and `$EF$` is thus greater than `$BF$`.
* And `$AE$` (is) equal to `$BE$` [thus, `$BE$` and `$EF$` is equal to `$AF$`].
* Thus, `$AF$` (is) greater than `$BF$`.
* Again, since `$BE$` is equal to `$CE$`, and `$FE$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BE$`, `$EF$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$CE$`, `$EF$` (respectively).
* But, angle `$BEF$` (is) also greater than [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$CEF$`.[^1] Thus, the base `$BF$` is greater than the base `$CF$`.
* Thus, the base `$BF$` is greater than the base `$CF$` [[Prop. 1.24]][bookofproofs$899].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$CF$` is also greater than `$FG$`.
* Again, since `$GF$` and `$FE$` are greater than `$EG$` [[Prop. 1.20]][bookofproofs$795], and `$EG$` (is) equal to `$ED$`, `$GF$` and `$FE$` are thus greater than `$ED$`.
* Let `$EF$` have been taken from both.
* Thus, the remainder `$GF$` is greater than the remainder `$FD$`.
* Thus, `$FA$` (is) the greatest ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), `$FD$` the least, and `$FB$` (is) greater than `$FC$`, and `$FC$` than `$FG$`.
I also say that from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` only two equal ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) will radiate towards (the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of) [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, (one) on each (side) of the least ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FD$`.
* For let the (angle) `$FEH$`, equal to angle `$GEF$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` on it [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897], and let `$FH$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since `$GE$` is equal to `$EH$`, and `$EF$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$GE$`, `$EF$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$HE$`, `$EF$` (respectively).
* And angle `$GEF$` (is) equal to angle `$HEF$`.
* Thus, the base `$FG$` is equal to the base `$FH$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* So I say that another ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) equal to `$FG$` will not radiate towards (the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of) the [circle][bookofproofs$690] from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`.
* For, if possible, let `$FK$` (so) radiate.
* And since `$FK$` is equal to `$FG$`, but `$FH$` [is equal] to `$FG$`, `$FK$` is thus also equal to `$FH$`, the nearer to the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] equal to the further away.
* The very thing (is) impossible.
* Thus, another ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) equal to `$GF$` will not radiate from the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` towards (the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of) the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* Thus, (there is) only one (such [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, if some [point][bookofproofs$631], which is not the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], is taken on the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and some [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] radiate from the [point][bookofproofs$631] towards the ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the) [circle][bookofproofs$690], then the greatest ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) will be that on which the [center][bookofproofs$6428] (lies), and the least the remainder (of the same [diameter][bookofproofs$6429]).
* And for the others, a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) nearer to the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] is always greater than a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) further away.
* And only two equal ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) will radiate from the same [point][bookofproofs$631] towards the ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the) [circle][bookofproofs$690], (one) on each (side) of the least ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
