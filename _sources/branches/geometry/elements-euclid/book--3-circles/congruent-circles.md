> **Equal** [circles][bookofproofs$690] are ([circles][bookofproofs$690]) whose [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] are equal, or whose (distances) from the [centers][bookofproofs$6428] (to the circumferences) are equal (i.e., whose [radii][bookofproofs$690] are equal).

### Modern Formulation

Two [circles][bookofproofs$690] `\(\odot AB\)` and `\(\odot CD\)` are called [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] (written `\(\odot AB\cong\odot CD\)`), if their radii are equal, otherwise they are **unequal** (written `\(\odot AB\neq  CD\)`).

### Examples

In the following figure, we have the following congruences: `\(\odot AB\cong\odot A_1B_1\)` and `\(\odot A_2B_2\cong\odot A_3B_3\)`, however, `\(\odot AB\ncong\odot A_2B_2\)`.
