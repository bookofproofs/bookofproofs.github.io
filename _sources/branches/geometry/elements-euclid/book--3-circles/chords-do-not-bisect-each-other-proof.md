* For, if possible, let them cut one another in half, such that `$AE$` is equal to `$EC$`, and `$BE$` to `$ED$`.
* And let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and let it be (at [point][bookofproofs$631]) `$F$`, and let `$FE$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], `$FE$`, cuts in half some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] not through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], `$AC$`, it also cuts it at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.3]][bookofproofs$1865].
* Thus, `$FEA$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Again, since some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$FE$` cuts in half some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$`, it also cuts it at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.3]][bookofproofs$1865].
* Thus, `$FEB$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* But `$FEA$` was also shown (to be) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$FEA$` (is) equal to `$FEB$`, the lesser to the greater.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$AC$` and `$BD$` do not cut one another in half.
* Thus, in a [circle][bookofproofs$690], if two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], which are not through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], cut one another then they do not cut one another in half.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
