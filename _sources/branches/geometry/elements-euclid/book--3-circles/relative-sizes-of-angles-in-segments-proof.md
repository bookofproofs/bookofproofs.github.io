* Let `$AE$` have been joined, and let `$BA$` have been drawn through to `$F$`.
* And since `$BE$` is equal to `$EA$`, angle `$ABE$` is also equal to `$BAE$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* Again, since `$CE$` is equal to `$EA$`, `$ACE$` is also equal to `$CAE$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* Thus, the whole [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` is equal to the two ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$ABC$` and `$ACB$`.
* And `$FAC$`, (which is) external to triangle `$ABC$`, is also equal to the two [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` and `$ACB$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` (is) also equal to `$FAC$`.
* Thus, (they are) each [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [ [Def. 1.10] ][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` in the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$BAC$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And since the two [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` and `$BAC$` of triangle `$ABC$` are less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.17]][bookofproofs$789], and `$BAC$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], angle `$ABC$` is thus less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And it is in [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$ABC$`, (which is) greater than a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430].
* And since `$ABCD$` is a [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] within a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and for [quadrilaterals][bookofproofs$687] within [circles][bookofproofs$690] the (sum of the) opposite [angles][bookofproofs$650] is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.22]][bookofproofs$1902] [[angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` and `$ADC$` are thus equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653]], and (angle) `$ABC$` is less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* The remaining [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ADC$` is thus greater than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And it is in [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$ADC$`, (which is) less than a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430].
* I also say that the [angle][bookofproofs$650] of the greater segment, (namely) that contained by the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$`, is greater than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And the [angle][bookofproofs$650] of the lesser segment, (namely) that contained by the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$AD[C]$` and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$`, is less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And this is immediately apparent.
* For since the (angle contained by) the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$BA$` and `$AC$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], the (angle) contained by the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` is thus greater than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Again, since the (angle contained by) the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` and `$AF$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], the (angle) contained by the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$AD[C]$` and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$CA$` is thus less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, in a [circle][bookofproofs$690], the [angle][bookofproofs$650] in a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], and that in a greater segment (is) less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], and that in a lesser [segment] (is) greater than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And, further, the [[angle] of a segment][bookofproofs$1855] greater (than a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430]) [is] greater than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], and the [[angle] of a segment][bookofproofs$1855] less (than a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430]) is less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^1]

[^1]: It has been shown that an [angle inscribed][bookofproofs$6434] in a [segment][bookofproofs$1852] equal a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] is [right][bookofproofs$653], a segment that is smaller than a semicircle is [obtuse][bookofproofs$689], and a segment that is greater than a semicircle is [acute][bookofproofs$6426] (editor's note).
