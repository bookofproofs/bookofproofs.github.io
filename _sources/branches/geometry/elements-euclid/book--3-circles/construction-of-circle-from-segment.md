### (Proposition 25 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> For a given [segment of a circle][bookofproofs$1852], to complete the [circle][bookofproofs$690], the very one of which it is a [segment][bookofproofs$1852].

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to extend a given [segment of a circle][bookofproofs$1852] to the original circle, [circle][bookofproofs$690] of which it is.
