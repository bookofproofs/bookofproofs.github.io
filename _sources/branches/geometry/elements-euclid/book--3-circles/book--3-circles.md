In the 3rd Book, Euclid continues with the development of plane geometry, focusing on the theory of circles. This book contains some basic insights about the plane geometry of circles. For instance:

* [Prop. 3.02][bookofproofs$1061] identifies the circle as a convex figure.
* If two circles cut each other, then they do not have the same center ([Prop. 3.05][bookofproofs$1867]).
* If two circles touch another, then the straight line through their centers goes also through the point, at which they touch another ([Prop. 3.11][bookofproofs$1891] and [Prop. 3.12][bookofproofs$1892]).
* The central angle is the double size of the inscribed angle ([Prop. 3.20][bookofproofs$1900]).
* The [inscribed angles][bookofproofs$6434] joining the ends of the same arc are equal ([Prop. 3.21][bookofproofs$1901]).
* The intersecting chord theorem ([Prop. 3.35][bookofproofs$1915]).
* The tangent secant theorem ([Prop. 3.36][bookofproofs$1916] and [Prop. 3.37][bookofproofs$1917]).

Moreover, this book contains the following compass and ruler constructions:

* Finding the center of a given circle ([Prop. 3.01][bookofproofs$1058]),
* Construction of a tangent to a given circle ([Prop. 3.17][bookofproofs$1897]),
* Construction of a circle from its segment ([Prop. 3.25][bookofproofs$1905]),
* Bisection of an arc ([Prop. 3.30][bookofproofs$1910]),
* Construction of an arbitrary circular segment ([Prop. 3.33][bookofproofs$1913] and [Prop. 3.34][bookofproofs$1914]).
