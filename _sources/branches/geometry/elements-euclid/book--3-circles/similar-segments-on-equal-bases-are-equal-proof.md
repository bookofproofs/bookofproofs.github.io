* For if the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$AEB$` is applied to the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$CFD$`, and [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` is placed on ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$C$`, and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` on `$CD$`, then [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` will also coincide with [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, on account of `$AB$` being equal to `$CD$`.
* And if `$AB$` coincides with `$CD$` then the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$AEB$` will also coincide with `$CFD$`.
* For if the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` coincides with `$CD$`, and the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$AEB$` does not coincide with `$CFD$`, then it will surely either fall inside it, outside (it),[^1] or it will miss like `$CGD$` (in the figure), and a [circle][bookofproofs$690] (will) cut (another) [circle][bookofproofs$690] at more than two [points][bookofproofs$631].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 3.10]][bookofproofs$1890].
* Thus, if the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` is applied to `$CD$`, the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$AEB$` cannot not also coincide with `$CFD$`.
* Thus, it will coincide, and will be equal to it [ [C.N. 4] ][bookofproofs$2781].
* Thus, [similar segments][bookofproofs$2783] of [circles][bookofproofs$690] on equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are equal to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^2]

[^1]: Both, this possibility and the previous one, are precluded by [[Prop. 3.23]][bookofproofs$1903] (translator's note).

[^2]: It has been shown that [similar segments][bookofproofs$2783] are [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] if their bases are equal in length (editor's note).
