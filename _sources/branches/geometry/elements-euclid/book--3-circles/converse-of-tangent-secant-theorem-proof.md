* For let `$DE$` have been drawn touching `$ABC$` [[Prop. 3.17]][bookofproofs$1897], and let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` have been found, and let it be (at) `$F$`.
* And let `$FE$`, `$FB$`, and `$FD$` have been joined.
* (Angle) `$FED$` is thus a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.18]][bookofproofs$1898].
* And since `$DE$` [touches circle][bookofproofs$1853] `$ABC$`, and `$DCA$` cuts (it), the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DC$` is thus equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DE$` [[Prop. 3.36]][bookofproofs$1916].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DC$` was also equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DB$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DE$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DB$`.
* Thus, `$DE$` (is) equal to `$DB$`.
* And `$FE$` is also equal to `$FB$`.
* So the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`, `$EF$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DB$`, `$BF$` (respectively).
* And their base, `$FD$`, is common.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DEF$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DBF$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* And `$DEF$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$DBF$` (is) also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And `$FB$` produced is a [diameter][bookofproofs$6429], And a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to a [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of a [circle][bookofproofs$690], at its extremity, [touches][bookofproofs$1853] the [circle][bookofproofs$690] [ [Prop. 3.16 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6449].
* Thus, `$DB$` [touches circle][bookofproofs$1853] `$ABC$`.
* Similarly, (the same thing) can be shown, even if the [center][bookofproofs$6428] happens to be on `$AC$`.
* Thus, if some [point][bookofproofs$631] is taken outside a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] radiate from the [point][bookofproofs$631] towards the [circle][bookofproofs$690], and one of them cuts the [circle][bookofproofs$690], and the (other) meets (it), and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) cutting (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), and the (part of it) cut off outside (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), between the [point][bookofproofs$631] and the convex [circumference][bookofproofs$690], is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) meeting (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), then the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) meeting (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) will [touch][bookofproofs$1853] the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^1]

[^1]: It has been shown that if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$DB$` intersects with a [secant][bookofproofs$1012] `$DA$` of a given circle in `$D$` and this secant cuts the circle at the points `$C$` and `$A$` such that `$|\overline{DC}|<|\overline{DA}|$` and `$|\overline{DC}|\cdot |\overline{DA}|=|\overline{DB}|^2,$` then `$DB$` is a [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] `$DB$` touching the circle at `$D.$`
