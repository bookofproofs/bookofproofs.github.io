### (Proposition 34 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To cut off a [segment][bookofproofs$1852], accepting an [angle][bookofproofs$650] equal to a given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650], from a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* Let `$ABC$` be the given [circle][bookofproofs$690], and `$D$` the given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650].
* So it is required to cut off a [segment][bookofproofs$1852], accepting an [angle][bookofproofs$650] equal to the given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] `$D$`, from the given [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to construct [segment of a circle][bookofproofs$1852], such that its [inscribed angle][bookofproofs$6434] ($\angle{CAB}$) is equal to a given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] ($\angle D$) and its vertex ($A$) is located on this segment.
