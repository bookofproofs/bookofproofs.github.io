* For, if possible, let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` cut the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$DEF$` at more than two [points][bookofproofs$631], `$B$`, `$G$`, `$F$`, and `$H$`.
* And `$BH$` and `$BG$` being joined, let them (then) have been cut in half at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$K$` and `$L$` (respectively).
* And `$KC$` and `$LM$` being drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$BH$` and `$BG$` from `$K$` and `$L$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759], let them (then) have been drawn through to [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` and `$E$` (respectively).

* Therefore, since in [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` cuts some (other) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BH$` in half, and at [right angles][bookofproofs$653], the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` is thus on `$AC$` [ [Prop. 3.1 corr.] ][bookofproofs$1060].
* Again, since in the same [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$NO$` cuts some (other [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BG$` in half, and at [right angles][bookofproofs$653], the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` is thus on `$NO$` [ [Prop. 3.1 corr.] ][bookofproofs$1060].
* And it was also shown (to be) on `$AC$`.
* And the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` and `$NO$` meet at no other ([point][bookofproofs$631]) than `$P$`.
* Thus, [point][bookofproofs$631] `$P$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that `$P$` is also the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$DEF$`.
* Thus, two [circles][bookofproofs$690] cutting one another, `$ABC$` and `$DEF$`, have the same [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$P$`.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 3.5]][bookofproofs$1867].
* Thus, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] does not cut a(nother) [circle][bookofproofs$690] at more than two [points][bookofproofs$631].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
