* For let the [centers][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circles][bookofproofs$690] have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and let them be (at) `$K$` and `$L$`.
* And let `$BK$`, `$KC$`, `$EL$`, and `$LF$` have been joined.
* And since the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BGC$` is equal to the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$EHF$`, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BKC$` is also equal to (angle) `$ELF$` [[Prop. 3.27]][bookofproofs$1907].
* And since the [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` are equal, their [radii][bookofproofs$690] are also equal [ [Def. 3.1] ][bookofproofs$1850].
* So the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BK$`, `$KC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$EL$`, `$LF$` (respectively).
* And they contain equal [angles][bookofproofs$650].
* Thus, the base `$BC$` is equal to the base `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, in [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850], equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] subtend equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^1]

[^1]: It has been shown that the [segments][bookofproofs$645] ($\overline{BC}$, `$\overline{EF}$`) connecting the endpoints of two [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] [arcs][bookofproofs$1852] in two [congruent circles][bookofproofs$1850] have equal lengths (editor's note).
