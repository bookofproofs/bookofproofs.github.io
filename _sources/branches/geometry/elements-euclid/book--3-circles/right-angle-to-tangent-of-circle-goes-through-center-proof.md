* For (if) not, if possible, let `$F$` be (the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), and let `$CF$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$DE$` [touches][bookofproofs$1853] the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, and `$FC$` has been joined from the [center][bookofproofs$6428] to the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact, `$FC$` is thus [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$DE$` [[Prop. 3.18]][bookofproofs$1898].
* Thus, `$FCE$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And `$ACE$` is also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$FCE$` is equal to `$ACE$`, the lesser to the greater.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$F$` is not the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that neither is any ([point][bookofproofs$631]) other (than one) on `$AC.$` Thus, if some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] touches a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is drawn from the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [tangent][bookofproofs$1853], then the [center][bookofproofs$6428] (of the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) will be on the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) so drawn.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
