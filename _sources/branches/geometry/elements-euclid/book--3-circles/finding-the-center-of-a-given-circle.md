### (Proposition 1 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].

* Let `$ABC$` be the given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* So it is required to find the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.
* Let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` have been drawn through ($ABC$), at random, and let ($AB$) have been cut in half at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` [[Prop. 1.9]][bookofproofs$755].
* And let `$DC$` have been drawn from `$D$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759].
* And let ($CD$) have been drawn through to `$E$`.
* And let `$CE$` have been cut in half at `$F$` [[Prop. 1.9]][bookofproofs$755].
* I say that ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$F$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [[circle][bookofproofs$690]] `$ABC$`.
