* In fact, if `$AC$` and `$BD$` are through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] (as in the first diagram from the left), so that `$E$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, then (it is) clear that, `$AE$`, `$EC$`, `$DE$`, and `$EB$` being equal, the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AE$` and `$EC$` is also equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$DE$` and `$EB$`.
* So let `$AC$` and `$DB$` not be though the [center][bookofproofs$6428] (as in the second diagram from the left), and let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of `$ABCD$` have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and let it be (at) `$F$`.
* And let `$FG$` and `$FH$` have been drawn from `$F$`, [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` and `$DB$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.12]][bookofproofs$760].
* And let `$FB$`, `$FC$`, and `$FE$` have been joined.
* And since some [straight line][bookofproofs$645], `$GF$`, through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], cuts at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] some (other) [straight line][bookofproofs$645], `$AC$`, not through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], then it also cuts it in half [[Prop. 3.3]][bookofproofs$1865].
* Thus, `$AG$` (is) equal to `$GC$`.
* Therefore, since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` is cut equally at `$G$`, and unequally at `$E$`, the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AE$` and `$EC$` plus the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` is thus equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GC$` [[Prop. 2.5]][bookofproofs$1019].
* Let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GF$` have been added [to both].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EC$` plus the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$GE$` and `$GF$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$CG$` and `$GF$`.
* But, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$EG$` and `$GF$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968], and the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FC$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$CG$` and `$GF$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EC$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FC$`.
* And `$FC$` (is) equal to `$FB$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EC$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FB$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DE$` and `$EB$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FB$`.
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EC$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` was also shown (to be) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FB$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AE$` and `$EC$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DE$` and `$EB$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$`.
* Let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` have been taken from both.
* Thus, the remaining [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AE$` and `$EC$` is equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$DE$` and `$EB$`.
* Thus, if two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] in a [circle][bookofproofs$690] cut one another then the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the pieces of one is equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the pieces of the other.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^1]

[^1]: It has been shown that in a circle the segments built by two intersecting [chords][bookofproofs$1012] can be used to construct rectangles with equal areas (editor's note).
