> A [straight line][bookofproofs$645] said to **touch a circle** is any (straight line) which, meeting the [circle][bookofproofs$690] and being produced, does not cut the circle.

### Modern Formulation

A [segment, ray, or straight line][bookofproofs$645] is called a **tangent to the circle** (or is said to **touch a circle**) when it intersects the circumference of a [circle][bookofproofs$690]  at exactly one [point][bookofproofs$631].
The point where the tangent to the circle touches the circumference is called the **point of intersection**.
