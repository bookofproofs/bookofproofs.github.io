* For being joined, let `$AE$` have been drawn through to `$F$`.
* Therefore, since `$EA$` is equal to `$EB$`, angle `$EAB$` (is) also equal to `$EBA$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EAB$` and `$EBA$` is double (angle) `$EAB$`.
* And `$BEF$` (is) equal to `$EAB$` and `$EBA$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, `$BEF$` is also double `$EAB$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$FEC$` is also double `$EAC$`.
* Thus, the whole [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BEC$` is double the whole [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$`.
* So let another ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) have been inflected, and let there be another angle, `$BDC$`.
* And `$DE$` being joined, let it have been produced to `$G$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$GEC$` is double `$EDC$`, of which `$GEB$` is double `$EDB$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BEC$` is double the (remaining angle) `$BDC$`.
* Thus, in a [circle][bookofproofs$690], the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at the [center][bookofproofs$6428] is double that at the [circumference][bookofproofs$690], when [the [angles][bookofproofs$650]] have the same [circumference][bookofproofs$690] base.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^1] 

[^1]: It has been shown that the [central angle][bookofproofs$2360] is double the [inscribed angle][bookofproofs$6434] (editor's note).
