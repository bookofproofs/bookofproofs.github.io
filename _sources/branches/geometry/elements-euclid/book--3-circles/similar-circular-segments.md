> **Similar segments** of [circles][bookofproofs$690] are those accepting equal [angles][bookofproofs$650], or in which the [angles][bookofproofs$650] are equal to one another.

### Modern Formulation

If we are given two circles with [circular segments][bookofproofs$1852] `\(AB\)` and `\(A_1B_1\)` such that the [angles `\(\alpha\)` in the respective circular segments][bookofproofs$1855] are equal, then the segments `\(AB\)` and `\(A_1B_1\)` are [similar][bookofproofs$2782].

Also, of the angles `\(\beta\)` contained by the [chords][bookofproofs$1012] `\(\overline{AB}\)`, `\(\overline{A_1B_1}\)` of the respective segments and the straight line connecting one endpoint of these chords  (without loss of generality `\(B\)`, `\(B_1\)`) and some points of the circumferences of the circles `\(C\)` and `\(C_1\)`, then  the segments `\(AB\)` and `\(A_1B_1\)` are [similar][bookofproofs$2782].
