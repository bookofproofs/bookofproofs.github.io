> In a [circle][bookofproofs$690], [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are said to be **equally far from the center** when the [perpendiculars drawn][bookofproofs$760] to them from the [center][bookofproofs$6428] are equal.

### Modern Formulation

[Chords][bookofproofs$1012] are said to be **equally distant from the center** (or **equally far from the center**), if the [perpendiculars constructed to them from the center][bookofproofs$760] are [equal in length, i.e. congruent][bookofproofs$2781].
### Example

In the following figure, the chords `\(\overline{AB}\)` and `\(\overline{CD}\)` are equally distant from the center, because the segments perpendicular to the chords have the same length `\(a\)` (i.e. they are congruent):
