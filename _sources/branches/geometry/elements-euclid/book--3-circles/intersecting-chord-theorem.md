### (Proposition 35 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] in a [circle][bookofproofs$690] cut one another then the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the pieces of one is equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the pieces of the other.

* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` and `$BD$`, in the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, cut one another at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`.
* I say that the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AE$` and `$EC$` is equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$DE$` and `$EB$`.

### Modern Formulation

If in a circle two [chords][bookofproofs$1012] `$\overline{AC},$` `$\overline{BD}$` intersect at the point `$E$` and let the lengths of [segments][bookofproofs$645] be defined by `$|\overline{AE}|$`, `$|\overline{EC}|$`,  `$|\overline{DE}|$`, and `$|\overline{EB}|.$` Then the respective rectangles built from these segments have equal areas, i.e. 
`$$|\overline{AE}|\cdot|\overline{EC}|=|\overline{DE}\cdot|\overline{EB}|.$$`
