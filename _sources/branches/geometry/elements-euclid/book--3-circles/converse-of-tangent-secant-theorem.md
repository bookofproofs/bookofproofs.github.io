### (Proposition 37 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If some [point][bookofproofs$631] is taken outside a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] radiate from the [point][bookofproofs$631] towards the [circle][bookofproofs$690], and one of them cuts the [circle][bookofproofs$690], and the (other) meets (it), and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) cutting (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), and the (part of it) cut off outside (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), between the [point][bookofproofs$631] and the convex [circumference][bookofproofs$690], is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) meeting (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), then the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) meeting (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) will [touch][bookofproofs$1853] the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* For let some [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` have been taken outside [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, and let two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$DCA$` and `$DB$`, radiate from `$D$` towards [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, and let `$DCA$` cut the [circle][bookofproofs$690], and let `$DB$` meet (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]).
* And let the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DC$` be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DB$`.
* I say that `$DB$` [touches circle][bookofproofs$1853] `$ABC$`.

### Modern Formulation

If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$DB$` intersects with a [secant][bookofproofs$1012] `$DA$` of a given circle in `$D$` and this secant cuts the circle at the points `$C$` and `$A$` such that for the lengths [segments][bookofproofs$645] fulfill the inequality `$|\overline{DC}|<|\overline{DA}|$`, and if `$|\overline{DC}|\cdot |\overline{DA}|=|\overline{DB}|^2,$` then `$DB$` is a [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] `$DB$` touching the circle at `$D.$`
