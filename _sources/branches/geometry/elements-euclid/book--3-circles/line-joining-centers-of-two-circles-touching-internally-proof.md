* For (if) not then, if possible, let it fall like `$FGH$` (in the figure), and let `$AF$` and `$AG$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since `$AG$` and `$GF$` is greater than `$FA$`, that is to say `$FH$` [[Prop. 1.20]][bookofproofs$795], let `$FG$` have been taken from both.
* Thus, the remainder `$AG$` is greater than the remainder `$GH$`.
* And `$AG$` (is) equal to `$GD$`.
* Thus, `$GD$` is also greater than `$GH$`, the lesser than the greater.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining `$F$` to `$G$` will not fall outside (one [circle][bookofproofs$690] but inside the other).
* Thus, it will fall upon the [point][bookofproofs$631] of union (of the [circles][bookofproofs$690]) at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`.
* Thus, if two [circles][bookofproofs$690] [touch one another][bookofproofs$1851] internally, [and their [centers][bookofproofs$6428] are found], then the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining their [centers][bookofproofs$6428], [being produced], will fall upon the [point][bookofproofs$631] of union of the [circles][bookofproofs$690].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
