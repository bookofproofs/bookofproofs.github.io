### (Proposition 27 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850], [angles][bookofproofs$650] standing upon equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] are equal to one another, whether they are standing at the [center][bookofproofs$6428] or at the [circumference][bookofproofs$690].
* For let the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BGC$` and `$EHF$` at the [centers][bookofproofs$6428] `$G$` and `$H$`, and the ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$BAC$` and `$EDF$` at the [circumferences][bookofproofs$690], [stand upon][bookofproofs$6435] the equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$BC$` and `$EF$`, in the [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850] `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` (respectively).
* I say that [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BGC$` is equal to (angle) `$EHF$`, and `$BAC$` is equal to `$EDF$`.

### Modern Formulation

Let two given [circles][bookofproofs$690] be [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] and let some of its [arcs][bookofproofs$1852] be also congruent ($BC=EF$). Then the corresponding [inscribed angles][bookofproofs$6434] are also congruent ($\angle{BAC}=\angle{EDF}$) and the corresponding [central angles][bookofproofs$2360] are also congruent ($\angle{BGC}=\angle{EHF}$) are also congruent. 

This is the converse of the [Prop. 3.26][bookofproofs$1906].
