### (Corollary to Proposition 1 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So, from this, (it is) manifest that if any [straight line][bookofproofs$645] in a [circle][bookofproofs$690] cuts any (other) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] in half, and at [right angles][bookofproofs$653], then the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] is on the former ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]). (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.


### Modern Formulation

The [straight line][bookofproofs$645] which [bisects][bookofproofs$757] any [chord][bookofproofs$1012] of a circle [perpendicularly][bookofproofs$653] passes through the [center of the circle][bookofproofs$6428].
