* `$[D]CA$` is surely either through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], or not.
* Let it first of all be through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], and let `$F$` be the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, and let `$FB$` have been joined.
* Thus, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$FBD$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.18]][bookofproofs$1898].
* And since [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` is cut in half at `$F$`, let `$CD$` have been added to it.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DC$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FC$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FD$` [[Prop. 2.6]][bookofproofs$1020].
* And `$FC$` (is) equal to `$FB$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DC$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FB$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FD$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FD$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$FB$` and `$BD$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DC$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FB$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$FB$` and `$BD$`.
* Let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FB$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remaining ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DC$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] `$DB$`.
* And so let `$DCA$` not be through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, and let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$E$` have been found, and let `$EF$` have been drawn from `$E$`, [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$AC$` [[Prop. 1.12]][bookofproofs$760].
* And let `$EB$`, `$EC$`, and `$ED$` have been joined.
* (Angle) `$EBD$` (is) thus a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.18]][bookofproofs$1898].
* And since some [straight line][bookofproofs$645], `$EF$`, through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], cuts some (other) [straight line][bookofproofs$645], `$AC$`, not through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], at [right angles][bookofproofs$653], it also cuts it in half [[Prop. 3.3]][bookofproofs$1865].
* Thus, `$AF$` is equal to `$FC$`.
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` is cut in half at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`, let `$CD$` have been added to it.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DC$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FC$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FD$` [[Prop. 2.6]][bookofproofs$1020].
* Let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DC$` plus the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$CF$` and `$FE$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$FD$` and `$FE$`.
* But the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EC$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$CF$` and `$FE$`.
* For [angle] `$EFC$` [is] a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$ED$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$DF$` and `$FE$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DC$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EC$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$ED$`.
* And `$EC$` (is) equal to `$EB$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DC$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EB$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$ED$`.
* And the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$EB$` and `$BD$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$ED$`.
* For `$EBD$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DC$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EB$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$EB$` and `$BD$`.
* Let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EB$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remaining ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AD$` and `$DC$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`.
* Thus, if some [point][bookofproofs$631] is taken outside a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] radiate from it towards the [circle][bookofproofs$690], and (one) of them cuts the [circle][bookofproofs$690], and (the other) touches (it), then the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) cutting (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), and the (part of it) cut off outside (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), between the [point][bookofproofs$631] and the convex [circumference][bookofproofs$690], will be equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] (line).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^1]

[^1]: It has been shown that if from a point `$D$` outside a given circle, a [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] `$DB$` touching the circle at `$D$` is drawn and a [secant][bookofproofs$1012] goes through `$D$` and cuts this circle at the points `$C$` and `$A$` such that `$|\overline{DC}|<|\overline{DA|},$` then `$|\overline{DC}|\cdot |\overline{DA}|=|\overline{DB}|^2$` (editor's note).
