* That is to say, that [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FBD$` is equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] constructed in [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$BAD$`, and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EBD$` is equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] constructed in [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$DCB$`.
* For let `$BA$` have been drawn from `$B$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759].
* And let the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` have been taken at random on the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BD$`.
* And let `$AD$`, `$DC$`, and `$CB$` have been joined.
* And since some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$` [touches][bookofproofs$1853] the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$`, and `$BA$` has been drawn from the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [tangent][bookofproofs$1853], the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` is thus on `$BA$` [[Prop. 3.19]][bookofproofs$1899].
* Thus, `$BA$` is a [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ADB$`, being in a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430], is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911].
* Thus, the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] (of triangle `$ADB$`) `$BAD$` and `$ABD$` are equal to one [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* And `$ABF$` is also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$ABF$` is equal to `$BAD$` and `$ABD$`.
* Let `$ABD$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remaining [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DBF$` is equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAD$` in the alternate [segment of the circle][bookofproofs$1852].
* And since `$ABCD$` is a [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] in a [circle][bookofproofs$690], (the sum of) its opposite [angles][bookofproofs$650] is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.22]][bookofproofs$1902].
* And `$DBF$` and `$DBE$` is also equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.13]][bookofproofs$763].
* Thus, `$DBF$` and `$DBE$` is equal to `$BAD$` and `$BCD$`, of which `$BAD$` was shown (to be) equal to `$DBF$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$DBE$` is equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DCB$` in the alternate segment `$DCB$` of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* Thus, if some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] touches a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and some (other) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is drawn across, from the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact into the [circle][bookofproofs$690], cutting the [circle][bookofproofs$690] (in two), then those [angles][bookofproofs$650] the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) makes with the [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] will be equal to the [angles][bookofproofs$650] in the alternate [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^1]

[^1]: It has been shown that if a [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$909] ($\boxdot{ABCD}$) is [inscribed][bookofproofs$1920] in the [circle][bookofproofs$690] and one of its sides ($\overline{BA}$) is its [diameter][bookofproofs$6429], the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$` cuts the circle and the [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] `$EF$` touches the circle at the point `$B,$` then the [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] are equal `$\angle{FBD}=\angle{BAD}$` and `$ \angle{DBE}=\angle{DCB}.$`
