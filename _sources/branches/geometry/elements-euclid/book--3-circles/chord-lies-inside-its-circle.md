### (Proposition 2 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [points][bookofproofs$631] are taken at random on the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of a [circle][bookofproofs$690] then the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining the [points][bookofproofs$631] will fall inside the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* Let `$ABC$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and let two [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` and `$B$` have been taken at random on its [circumference][bookofproofs$690].
* I say that the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining `$A$` to `$B$` will fall inside the [circle][bookofproofs$690].

### Modern Formulation

The circle is a convex figure. In particular, if any two points are chosen from the circumference of a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and a straight line is constructed on these points, then: 

1. The [segment][bookofproofs$645] between the endpoints on the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] is a **chord** (i.e. its points are located inside the circle).
1. The [segment][bookofproofs$645] between the endpoints on the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] is a **chord** (i.e. its points are located inside the circle).
