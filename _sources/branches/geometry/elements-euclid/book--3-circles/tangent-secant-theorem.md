### (Proposition 36 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If some [point][bookofproofs$631] is taken outside a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] radiate from it towards the [circle][bookofproofs$690], and (one) of them cuts the [circle][bookofproofs$690], and the (other) touches (it), then the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) cutting (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), and the (part of it) cut off outside (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), between the [point][bookofproofs$631] and the convex [circumference][bookofproofs$690], will be equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] (line).
* For let some [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` have been taken outside [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, and let two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$DC[A]$` and `$DB$`, radiate from `$D$` towards [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.
* And let `$DCA$` cut [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, and let `$BD$` touch (it).
* I say that the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AD$` and `$DC$` is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DB$`.

### Modern Formulation

Let, from a point `$D$` outside a given circle, a [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] `$DB$` touching the circle at `$D$` be drawn and let a [secant][bookofproofs$1012] go through `$D$` and cut this circle at the points `$C$` and `$A$` such that for the lengths [segments][bookofproofs$645] the inequality `$|\overline{DC}|<|\overline{DA}|$` holds. Then `$$|\overline{DC}|\cdot |\overline{DA}|=|\overline{DB}|^2.$$`
