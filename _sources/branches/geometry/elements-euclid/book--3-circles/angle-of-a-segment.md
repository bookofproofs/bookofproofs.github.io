> And the **angle of a segment** is that contained by a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] and a [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of a [circle][bookofproofs$690].

### Modern Formulation

An **arc** is one of the two parts into which a [secant][bookofproofs$1012] divides the [circumference][bookofproofs$690]. The larger is called the **major conjugate arc**, and the smaller is called the **minor conjugate arc**.
