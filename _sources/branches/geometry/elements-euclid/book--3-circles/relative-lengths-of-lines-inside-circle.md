### (Proposition 7 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If some [point][bookofproofs$631], which is not the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], is taken on the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and some [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] radiate from the [point][bookofproofs$631] towards the ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the) [circle][bookofproofs$690], then the greatest ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) will be that on which the [center][bookofproofs$6428] (lies), and the least the remainder (of the same [diameter][bookofproofs$6429]). And for the others, a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) nearer[^1] to the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] is always greater than a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) further away. And only two equal ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) will radiate from the [point][bookofproofs$631] towards the ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the) [circle][bookofproofs$690], (one) on each (side) of the least ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Let `$ABCD$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and let `$AD$` be its [diameter][bookofproofs$6429], and let some [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`, which is not the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], have been taken on `$AD$`.
* Let `$E$` be the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* And let some [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$FB$`, `$FC$`, and `$FG$`, radiate from `$F$` towards (the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of) [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`.
* I say that `$FA$` is the greatest ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), `$FD$` the least, and of the others, `$FB$` (is) greater than `$FC$`, and `$FC$` than `$FG$`.

### Modern Formulation

If a point `$F$` is located on the diameter ($\overline{AD}$) of a given circle and is not its center ($E$), then if we connect this point `$F$` to all points of the circumference, we get a infinite family of segments, among which exactly one is the longest (let it be `$\overline{FA}$` with the length `$\beta$`), exactly one is the shortest (let it be `$\overline{FD}$` with the length `$\alpha$`) and all other (infinitely many) segments are located on both sides of the diameter, and their lengths `$\gamma$` take all values between `$ \alpha\le \gamma\le \beta$`. Moreover, among these infinitely many segments there are exactly two segments with the same length `$\gamma$`, namely those which lie symmetrically with respect to the diameter `$\overline{AD}.$`
