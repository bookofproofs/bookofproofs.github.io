* For (if) not then, if possible, let it fall inside, like `$CA$` (in the figure), and let `$DC$` have been joined.
Since `$DA$` is equal to `$DC$`, angle `$DAC$` is also equal to angle `$ACD$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* And `$DAC$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$ACD$` (is) also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* So, in triangle `$ACD$`, the two [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$DAC$` and `$ACD$` are equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 1.17]][bookofproofs$789].
* Thus, the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$BA$`, will not fall inside the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* So, similarly, we can show that neither (will it fall) on the [circumference][bookofproofs$690].
* Thus, (it will fall) outside (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]).
* Let it fall like `$AE$` (in the figure).
* So, I say that another [straight line][bookofproofs$645] cannot be inserted into the space between the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AE$` and the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CHA$`.
* For, if possible, let it be inserted like `$FA$` (in the figure), and let `$DG$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$FA$` [[Prop. 1.12]][bookofproofs$760].
* And since `$AGD$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], and `$DAG$` (is) less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], `$AD$` (is) thus greater than `$DG$` [[Prop. 1.19]][bookofproofs$793].
* And `$DA$` (is) equal to `$DH$`.
* Thus, `$DH$` (is) greater than `$DG$`, the lesser than the greater.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, another [straight line][bookofproofs$645] cannot be inserted into the space between the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] ($AE$) and the [circumference][bookofproofs$690].
* And I also say that the semi-circular angle contained by the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BA$` and the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CHA$` is greater than any [acute][bookofproofs$6426] [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] whatsoever, and the remaining (angle) contained by the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CHA$` and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AE$` is less than any [acute][bookofproofs$6426] [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] whatsoever.
* For if any [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] is greater than the (angle) contained by the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BA$` and the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CHA$`, or less than the (angle) contained by the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CHA$` and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AE$`, then a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] can be inserted into the space between the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CHA$` and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AE$` - anything which will make (an [angle][bookofproofs$650]) contained by [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] greater than the [angle][bookofproofs$650] contained by the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BA$` and the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CHA$`, or less than the (angle) contained by the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CHA$` and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AE$`.
* But (such a [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) cannot be inserted.
* Thus, an [acute (angle) ][bookofproofs$6426] contained by [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] cannot be greater than the [angle][bookofproofs$650] contained by the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BA$` and the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CHA$`, neither (can it be) less than the (angle) contained by the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CHA$` and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AE$`.
