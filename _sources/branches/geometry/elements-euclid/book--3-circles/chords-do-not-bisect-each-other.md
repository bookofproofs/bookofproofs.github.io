### (Proposition 4 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In a [circle][bookofproofs$690], if two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], which are not through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], cut one another then they do not cut one another in half.
* Let `$ABCD$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and within it, let two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AC$` and `$BD$`, which are not through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], cut one another at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$E$`.
* I say that they do not cut one another in half.

### Modern Formulation

Let `$AC$` und `$BD$` be [chords][bookofproofs$1012], which do not go through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of a given circle. If `$AC$` and `$BD$` cut one another, then they do not [bisect][bookofproofs$757] each other.
