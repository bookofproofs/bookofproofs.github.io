### (Proposition 12 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [circles][bookofproofs$690] [touch one another][bookofproofs$1851] externally then the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) joining their [centers][bookofproofs$6428] will go through the [point][bookofproofs$631] of union.

* For let two [circles][bookofproofs$690], `$ABC$` and `$ADE$`, [touch one another][bookofproofs$1851] externally at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, and let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$F$` of `$ABC$` have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and (the [center][bookofproofs$6428]) `$G$` of `$ADE$` [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058].
* I say that the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining `$F$` to `$G$` will go through the [point][bookofproofs$631] of union at `$A$`.

### Modern Formulation

If two circles [touch][bookofproofs$1851] one another externally at a point `$A$`, then the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] going through their [centers][bookofproofs$6428] goes also through `$A$`.
