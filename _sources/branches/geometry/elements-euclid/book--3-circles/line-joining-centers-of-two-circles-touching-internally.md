### (Proposition 11 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [circles][bookofproofs$690] [touch one another][bookofproofs$1851] internally, and their [centers][bookofproofs$6428] are found, then the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining their [centers][bookofproofs$6428], being produced, will fall upon the [point][bookofproofs$631] of union of the [circles][bookofproofs$690].

* For let two [circles][bookofproofs$690], `$ABC$` and `$ADE$`, [touch one another][bookofproofs$1851] internally at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, and let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$F$` of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and (the [center][bookofproofs$6428]) `$G$` of ([circle][bookofproofs$690]) `$ADE$` [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058].
* I say that the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining `$G$` to `$F$`, being produced, will fall on `$A$`.

### Modern Formulation

If two circles [touch][bookofproofs$1851] one another internally at a point `$A$`, then the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] going through their [centers][bookofproofs$6428] goes also through `$A$`.
