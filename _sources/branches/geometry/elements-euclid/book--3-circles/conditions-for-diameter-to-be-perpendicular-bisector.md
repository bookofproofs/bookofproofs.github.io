### (Proposition 3 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In a [circle][bookofproofs$690], if any [straight line][bookofproofs$645] through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] cuts in half any [straight line][bookofproofs$645] not through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] then it also cuts it at [right angles][bookofproofs$653]. And (conversely) if it cuts it at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] then it also cuts it in half.
* Let `$ABC$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and, within it, let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], `$CD$`, cut in half some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] not through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], `$AB$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`.
* I say that ($CD$) also cuts ($AB$) at [right angles][bookofproofs$653].

### Modern Formulation

Let `$AB$` be a [chord][bookofproofs$1012], which does not go through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$E$` of a given circle and let `$CD$` be its  [diameter][bookofproofs$6429], i.e. it goes through the center `$E.$` 

Then `$CD$` [bisects][bookofproofs$757] `$AB$` if and only if `$CD\perp AB,$` i.e. both are [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653].
