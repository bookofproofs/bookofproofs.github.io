* For, if possible, let the two similar and unequal [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of [circles][bookofproofs$690], `$ACB$` and `$ADB$`, have been constructed on the same side of the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.
* And let `$ACD$` have been drawn through (the segments), and let `$CB$` and `$DB$` have been joined.

* Therefore, since segment `$ACB$` is [similar to segment][bookofproofs$2783] `$ADB$`, and [similar segments][bookofproofs$2783] of [circles][bookofproofs$690] are those accepting equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [ [Def. 3.11] ][bookofproofs$2783], angle `$ACB$` is thus equal to `$ADB$`, the external to the internal.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 1.16]][bookofproofs$784].
* Thus, two similar and unequal [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of [circles][bookofproofs$690] cannot be constructed on the same side of the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
