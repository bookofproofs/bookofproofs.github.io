* Let `$EF$` have been drawn touching `$ABC$` at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$`.[^1] And Let [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$FBC$`, equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$D$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$FB$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` on it [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* Therefore, since some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$` [touches][bookofproofs$1853] the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, and `$BC$` has been drawn across (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) from the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact `$B$`, angle `$FBC$` is thus equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] constructed in the alternate segment `$BAC$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* But, `$FBC$` is equal to `$D$`.
* Thus, the (angle) in the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$BAC$` is also equal to [angle] `$D$`.
* Thus, the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$BAC$`, accepting an [angle][bookofproofs$650] equal to the given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] `$D$`, has been cut off from the given [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.[^2]

[^1]: Presumably, by finding the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of `$ABC$` [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], drawing a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] between the [center][bookofproofs$6428] and [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$`, and then drawing `$EF$` through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the aforementioned [straight line][bookofproofs$645] [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759] (translator's note).

[^2]: It has been shown that it is possible to construct [segment of a circle][bookofproofs$1852], such that its [inscribed angle][bookofproofs$6434] is equal to a given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] and its vertex is located on this segment.
