* For the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] radiating towards the convex (part of the) [circumference][bookofproofs$690], `$HLKG$`, the least is the one between the [point][bookofproofs$631] and the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$AG$`, (namely) `$DG$`, and a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) nearer to the least ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DG$` is always less than one farther away, (so that) `$DK$` (is less) than `$DL$`, and `$DL$` than than `$DH$`.
* For let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and let it be (at [point][bookofproofs$631]) `$M$` [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058].
* And let `$ME$`, `$MF$`, `$MC$`, `$MK$`, `$ML$`, and `$MH$` have been joined.
* And since `$AM$` is equal to `$EM$`, let `$MD$` have been added to both.
* Thus, `$AD$` is equal to `$EM$` and `$MD$`.
* But, `$EM$` and `$MD$` is greater than `$ED$` [[Prop. 1.20]][bookofproofs$795].
* Thus, `$AD$` is also greater than `$ED$`.
* Again, since `$ME$` is equal to `$MF$`, and `$MD$` (is) common, the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$EM$`, `$MD$` are thus equal to `$FM$`, `$MD$`.
* And angle `$EMD$` is greater than [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FMD$`.[^1] Thus, the base `$ED$` is greater than the base `$FD$` [[Prop. 1.24]][bookofproofs$899].
* So, similarly, we can show that `$FD$` is also greater than `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$AD$` (is) the greatest ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and `$DE$` (is) greater than `$DF$`, and `$DF$` than `$DC$`.
* And since `$MK$` and `$KD$` is greater than `$MD$` [[Prop. 1.20]][bookofproofs$795], and `$MG$` (is) equal to `$MK$`, the remainder `$KD$` is thus greater than the remainder `$GD$`.
* So `$GD$` is less than `$KD$`.
* And since in triangle `$MLD$`, the two internal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$MK$` and `$KD$` were constructed on one of the sides, `$MD$`, then `$MK$` and `$KD$` are thus less than `$ML$` and `$LD$` [[Prop. 1.21]][bookofproofs$893].
* And `$MK$` (is) equal to `$ML$`.
* Thus, the remainder `$DK$` is less than the remainder `$DL$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that `$DL$` is also less than `$DH$`.
* Thus, `$DG$` (is) the least ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and `$DK$` (is) less than `$DL$`, and `$DL$` than `$DH$`.
I also say that only two equal ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) will radiate from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` towards (the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of) the [circle][bookofproofs$690], (one) on each (side) on the least ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), `$DG$`.
* Let the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DMB$`, equal to angle `$KMD$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$MD$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$M$` on it [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897], and let `$DB$` have been joined.
* And since `$MK$` is equal to `$MB$`, and `$MD$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$KM$`, `$MD$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BM$`, `$MD$`, respectively.
* And angle `$KMD$` (is) equal to angle `$BMD$`.
* Thus, the base `$DK$` is equal to the base `$DB$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* So I say that another ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) equal to `$DK$` will not radiate towards the ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the) [circle][bookofproofs$690] from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`.
* For, if possible, let (such a [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) radiate, and let it be `$DN$`.
* Therefore, since `$DK$` is equal to `$DN$`, but `$DK$` is equal to `$DB$`, then `$DB$` is thus also equal to `$DN$`, (so that) a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) nearer to the least ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DG$` [is] equal to one further away.
* The very thing was shown (to be) impossible.
* Thus, not more than two equal ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) will radiate towards (the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of) [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, (one) on each side of the least ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DG$`.
* Thus, if some [point][bookofproofs$631] is taken outside a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and some [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are drawn from the [point][bookofproofs$631] to the ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the) [circle][bookofproofs$690], one of which (passes) through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], the remainder (being) random, then for the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] radiating towards the concave (part of the) [circumference][bookofproofs$690], the greatest is that (passing) through the [center][bookofproofs$6428].
* For the others, a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) nearer to the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] is always greater than one further away.
* For the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] radiating towards the convex (part of the) [circumference][bookofproofs$690], the least is that between the [point][bookofproofs$631] and the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429].
* For the others, a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) nearer to the least ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is always less than one further away.
* And only two equal ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) will radiate from the [point][bookofproofs$631] towards the ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the) [circle][bookofproofs$690], (one) on each (side) of the least ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
