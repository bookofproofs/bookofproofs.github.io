* For let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABDC$`[^1] have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and let it be (at) `$E$`.
* And let `$EF$` and `$EG$` have been drawn from ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$E$`, [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$` and `$CD$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.12]][bookofproofs$760].
* And let `$AE$` and `$EC$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since some [straight line][bookofproofs$645], `$EF$`, through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] (of the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), cuts some (other) [straight line][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$`, not through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], at [right angles][bookofproofs$653], it also cuts it in half [[Prop. 3.3]][bookofproofs$1865].
* Thus, `$AF$` (is) equal to `$FB$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` (is) double `$AF$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$CD$` is also double `$CG$`.
* And `$AB$` is equal to `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$AF$` (is) also equal to `$CG$`.
* And since `$AE$` is equal to `$EC$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` (is) also equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EC$`.
* But, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AF$` and `$EF$` (is) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$`.
* For the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$F$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$EG$` and `$GC$` (is) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EC$`.
* For the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$G$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AF$` and `$FE$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$CG$` and `$GE$`, of which the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CG$`.
* For `$AF$` is equal to `$CG$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` is equal to the (remaining square) on `$EG$`.
* Thus, `$EF$` (is) equal to `$EG$`.
* And [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] in a [circle][bookofproofs$690] are said to be [equally far from the center][bookofproofs$1854] when [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) which are drawn to them from the [center][bookofproofs$6428] are equal [ [Def. 3.4] ][bookofproofs$1854].
* Thus, `$AB$` and `$CD$` are [equally far from the center][bookofproofs$1854].
* So, let the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$CD$` be [equally far from the center][bookofproofs$1854].
* That is to say, let `$EF$` be equal to `$EG$`.
* I say that `$AB$` is also equal to `$CD$`.
* For, with the same construction, we can, similarly, show that `$AB$` is double `$AF$`, and `$CD$` (double) `$CG$`.
* And since `$AE$` is equal to `$CE$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$`.
* But, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$EF$` and `$FA$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$EG$` and `$GC$` (is) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CE$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$EF$` and `$FA$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$EG$` and `$GC$`, of which the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$`.
* For `$EF$` (is) equal to `$EG$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$` is equal to the (remaining square) on `$CG$`.
* Thus, `$AF$` (is) equal to `$CG$`.
* And `$AB$` is double `$AF$`, and `$CD$` double `$CG$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` (is) equal to `$CD$`.
* Thus, in a [circle][bookofproofs$690], equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [equally far from the center][bookofproofs$1854], and ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) which are [equally far from the center][bookofproofs$1854] are equal to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^2]

[^1]: The Greek text has "$ABCD$", which is obviously a mistake (translator's note).

[^2]: It has been shown that two [chords][bookofproofs$1012] in a [circle][bookofproofs$690] are equal in length if and only if they are [equally far][bookofproofs$1854] from the [center of the circle][bookofproofs$64] (editor's note).
