* For let `$AB$` and `$BC$` have been joined, and (then) have been cut in half at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` and `$F$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757].
* And `$ED$` and `$FD$` being joined, let them have been drawn through to [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$`, `$K$`, `$H$`, and `$L$`.
* Therefore, since `$AE$` is equal to `$EB$`, and `$ED$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AE$`, `$ED$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BE$`, `$ED$` (respectively).
* And the base `$DA$` (is) equal to the base `$DB$`.
* Thus, angle `$AED$` is equal to angle `$BED$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* Thus, [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$AED$` and `$BED$` (are) each [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [ [Def. 1.10] ][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$GK$` cuts `$AB$` in half, and at [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And since, if some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] in a [circle][bookofproofs$690] cuts some (other) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] in half, and at [right angles][bookofproofs$653], then the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] is on the former ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [ [Prop. 3.1 corr.] ][bookofproofs$1060], the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] is thus on `$GK$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` is also on `$HL$`.
* And the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$GK$` and `$HL$` have no common ([point][bookofproofs$631]) other than [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`.
* Thus, [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.
* Thus, if some [point][bookofproofs$631] is taken inside a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and more than two equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] radiate from the [point][bookofproofs$631] towards the ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the) [circle][bookofproofs$690], then the [point][bookofproofs$631] taken is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
