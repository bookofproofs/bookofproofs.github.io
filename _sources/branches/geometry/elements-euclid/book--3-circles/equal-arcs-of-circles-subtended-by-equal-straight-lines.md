### (Proposition 29 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850], equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] subtend equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690].

* Let `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` be [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850], and within them let the equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$BGC$` and `$EHF$` have been cut off.
* And let the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$` and `$EF$` have been joined.
* I say that `$BC$` is equal to `$EF$`.

### Modern Formulation

The [segments][bookofproofs$645] ($\overline{BC}$, `$\overline{EF}$`) have equal lengths, if they connect the endpoints of two [arcs][bookofproofs$1852] being [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] in [congruent circles][bookofproofs$1850].
