> [Circles][bookofproofs$690] said to **touch one another** are any (circles) which, meeting one another, do not cut one another.

### Modern Formulation


[Circles][bookofproofs$690] are said to **touch one another** when they intersect at exactly one [point][bookofproofs$631]. There are two types of contact:
1. When a circle `\(\odot AB\)` is external to another circle `\(\odot EB\)`, we say that the circle `\(\odot AB\)` touches the circle `\(\odot EB\)` **externally at the point** `\(B\)`.
1. When one circle  `\(\odot DC\)` is internal to another circle `\(\odot EC\)`, we say that the circle `\(\odot DC\)` touches the circle `\(\odot EC\)` **internally at the point** `\(C\)`.

When circles **intersect at two points**, the intersection may be referred to as a **cut**.
