* For (if) not then, if possible, let `$G$` (be the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), and let `$GA$`, `$GD$`, and `$GB$` have been joined.
* And since `$AD$` is equal to `$DB$`, and `$DG$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$`, `$DG$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BD$`, `$DG$`,[^1] respectively.
* And the base `$GA$` is equal to the base `$GB$`.
* For (they are both) [radii][bookofproofs$690].
* Thus, angle `$ADG$` is equal to angle `$GDB$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* And when a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] stood upon (another) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] make adjacent [angles][bookofproofs$650] (which are) equal to one another, each of the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [ [Def. 1.10] ][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$GDB$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And `$FDB$` is also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$FDB$` (is) equal to `$GDB$`, the greater to the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$G$` is not the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that neither is any other ([point][bookofproofs$631]) except `$F$`.
* Thus, [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [[circle][bookofproofs$690]] `$ABC$`.

[^1]: The Greek text has "$GD$, `$DB$`", which is obviously a mistake (translator's note).
