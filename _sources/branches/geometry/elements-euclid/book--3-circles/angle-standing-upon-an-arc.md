> And when the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] containing an [angle][bookofproofs$650] cut off some [circumference][bookofproofs$690], the angle is said to **stand upon** that ([circumference][bookofproofs$690]).

### Modern Formulation 

We say that the [inscribed angle][bookofproofs$6434] `$\alpha$` **stands upon** the [arc][bookofproofs$1855] `$AB$`, if it is contained by the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joining the ends of the [arc][bookofproofs$1855] `$AB$` with any point on the circumference of a [segment of the circle][bookofproofs$1852].
