### (Proposition 17 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To draw a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] [touching][bookofproofs$1853] a given [circle][bookofproofs$690] from a given [point][bookofproofs$631].
* Let `$A$` be the given [point][bookofproofs$631], and `$BCD$` the given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* So it is required to draw a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] [touching][bookofproofs$1853] [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$BCD$` from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to construct a [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] to a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
