### (Proposition 8 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If some [point][bookofproofs$631] is taken outside a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and some [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are drawn from the [point][bookofproofs$631] to the ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the) [circle][bookofproofs$690], one of which (passes) through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], the remainder (being) random, then for the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] radiating towards the concave (part of the) [circumference][bookofproofs$690], the greatest is that (passing) through the [center][bookofproofs$6428]. For the others, a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) nearer[^1] to the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] is always greater than one further away. For the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] radiating towards the convex (part of the) [circumference][bookofproofs$690], the least is that between the [point][bookofproofs$631] and the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429]. For the others, a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) nearer to the least ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is always less than one further away. And only two equal ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) will radiate from the [point][bookofproofs$631] towards the ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the) [circle][bookofproofs$690], (one) on each (side) of the least ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).

* Let `$ABC$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and let some [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` have been taken outside `$ABC$`, and from it let some [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$DA$`, `$DE$`, `$DF$`, and `$DC$`, have been drawn through (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), and let `$DA$` be through the [center][bookofproofs$6428].
* I say that for the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] radiating towards the concave (part of the) [circumference][bookofproofs$690], `$AEFC$`, the greatest is the one (passing) through the [center][bookofproofs$6428], (namely) `$AD$`, and (that) `$DE$` (is) greater than `$DF$`, and `$DF$` than `$DC$`.

### Modern Formulation

In the family of (infinitely many) segments connecting a point outside a circle ($D$) with all the points of its circumference there is exactly one, which is the longest (let it be `$\overline{DA}$` with the length `$\beta$`), and there is exactly one, which is the shortest (let it be `$\overline{DG}$` with the length `$\alpha$`). Both, the longest `$\overline{DA}$` and the shortest `$\overline{DG},$` lie on the same straight line `$DA$`, on which also the center of the circle ($M$) is located. Moreover, all other segments of this family have lengths `$\gamma$` with a value between `$\alpha\le\gamma\le\beta$` and there are exatly two of them having the same length `$\gamma$`, namely those lying symmetrically with respect to the straight line `$DA.$`
