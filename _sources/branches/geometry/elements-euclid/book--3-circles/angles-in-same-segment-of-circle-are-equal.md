### (Proposition 21 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In a [circle][bookofproofs$690], [angles][bookofproofs$650] in the same [segment][bookofproofs$1852] are equal to one another.
* Let `$ABCD$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and let `$BAD$` and `$BED$` be [angles][bookofproofs$650] in the same [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$BAED$`.
* I say that [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BAD$` and `$BED$` are equal to one another.

### Modern Formulation

The [inscribed angles][bookofproofs$6434] joining the ends of the same arc are equal.
