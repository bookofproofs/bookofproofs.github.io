* For (if) not then, if possible, let it go like `$FCDG$` (in the figure), and let `$AF$` and `$AG$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, `$FA$` is equal to `$FC$`.
* Again, since [point][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ADE$`, `$GA$` is equal to `$GD$`.
* And `$FA$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$FC$`.
* Thus, the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FA$` and `$AG$` are equal to the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FC$` and `$GD$`.
* So the whole of `$FG$` is greater than `$FA$` and `$AG$`.
* But, (it is) also less [[Prop. 1.20]][bookofproofs$795].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining `$F$` to `$G$` cannot not go through the [point][bookofproofs$631] of union at `$A$`.
* Thus, (it will go) through it.
* Thus, if two [circles][bookofproofs$690] [touch one another][bookofproofs$1851] externally then the [[straight line][bookofproofs$645]] joining their [centers][bookofproofs$6428] will go through the [point][bookofproofs$631] of union.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
