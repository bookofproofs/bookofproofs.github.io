### (Proposition 22 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> For [quadrilaterals][bookofproofs$687] within [circles][bookofproofs$690], the (sum of the) opposite [angles][bookofproofs$650] is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Let `$ABCD$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and let `$ABCD$` be a [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] within it.
* I say that the (sum of the) opposite [angles][bookofproofs$650] is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].

### Modern Formulation

In a [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] built upon four [secants][bookofproofs$1012] of a given [circle][bookofproofs$690], the sum of the opposite angles is `$180^\circ$`.
