### (Proposition 32 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] touches a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and some (other) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is drawn across, from the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact into the [circle][bookofproofs$690], cutting the [circle][bookofproofs$690] (in two), then those [angles][bookofproofs$650] the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) makes with the [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] will be equal to the [angles][bookofproofs$650] in the alternate [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].

* For let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$` [touch][bookofproofs$1853] the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$`, and let some (other) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` into the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, cutting it (in two).
* I say that the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BD$` makes with the [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] `$EF$` will be equal to the [angles][bookofproofs$650] in the alternate [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].

### Modern Formulation

In a [circle][bookofproofs$690], let `$\overline{BA}$` be its [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] and `$\boxdot{ABCD}$` be a [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$909] [inscribed][bookofproofs$1920] in the circle and let a [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] `$EF$` touch the circle at the point `$B$` and let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$` cut the circle (see figure). Then following [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] are equal:
`$$\angle{FBD}=\angle{BAD},\quad  \angle{DBE}=\angle{DCB}.$$`
