### (Proposition 14 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In a [circle][bookofproofs$690], equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [equally far from the center][bookofproofs$1854], and ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) which are [equally far from the center][bookofproofs$1854] are equal to one another.
* Let `$ABDC$`[^1] be a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] within it.
* I say that `$AB$` and `$CD$` are [equally far from the center][bookofproofs$1854].

### Modern Formulation

Two [chords][bookofproofs$1012] in a [circle][bookofproofs$690] are equal in length if and only if they are [equally far][bookofproofs$1854] from the [center of the circle][bookofproofs$6428].
[^1]: The Greek text has "$ABCD$", which is obviously a mistake (translator's note).
