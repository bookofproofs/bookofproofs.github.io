> And (that [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is said to be **further (from the center)** on which the greater [perpendicular falls][bookofproofs$760] (from the [center][bookofproofs$6428]).

### Modern Formulation

We say that a [chords][bookofproofs$1012] is at **greater distance from the center** (or **further from the center**) than the other, if the its perpendicular drawn from the center has a greater length than the other.

### Example

In the following figure, the chord `\(\overline{CD}\)` is further from the center than the chord `\(\overline{AB}\)`:
