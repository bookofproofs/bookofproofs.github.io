* Let `$AC$` and `$BD$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since the three [angles][bookofproofs$650] of any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] are equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924], the three [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$CAB$`, `$ABC$`, and `$BCA$` of triangle `$ABC$` are thus equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And `$CAB$` (is) equal to `$BDC$`.
* For they are in the same [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$BADC$` [[Prop. 3.21]][bookofproofs$1901].
* And `$ACB$` (is equal) to `$ADB$`.
* For they are in the same [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$ADCB$` [[Prop. 3.21]][bookofproofs$1901].
* Thus, the whole of `$ADC$` is equal to `$BAC$` and `$ACB$`.
* Let `$ABC$` have been added to both.
* Thus, `$ABC$`, `$BAC$`, and `$ACB$` are equal to `$ABC$` and `$ADC$`.
* But, `$ABC$`, `$BAC$`, and `$ACB$` are equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$ABC$` and `$ADC$` are also equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Similarly, we can show that [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BAD$` and `$DCB$` are also equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, for [quadrilaterals][bookofproofs$687] within [circles][bookofproofs$690], the (sum of the) opposite [angles][bookofproofs$650] is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^1] 

[^1]: It has been shown, in a [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] built upon four [secants][bookofproofs$1012], the sum of the opposite angles is twice the size of [right angle][bookofproofs$653] (editor's note).
