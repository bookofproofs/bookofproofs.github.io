### (Proposition 6 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [circles][bookofproofs$690] [touch one another][bookofproofs$1851] then they will not have the same [center][bookofproofs$6428].
* For let the two [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` and `$CDE$` [touch one another][bookofproofs$1851] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`.
* I say that they will not have the same [center][bookofproofs$6428].

### Modern Formulation

If two circles [touch one another][bookofproofs$1851], then they have different [centers][bookofproofs$6428].
