* For, if possible, let [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABDC$`[^1] touch [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EBFD$` - first of all, internally - at more than one [point][bookofproofs$631], `$D$` and `$B$`.
* And let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$G$` of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABDC$` have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and (the [center][bookofproofs$6428]) `$H$` of `$EBFD$` [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058].
* Thus, the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) joining `$G$` and `$H$` will fall on `$B$` and `$D$` [[Prop. 3.11]][bookofproofs$1891].
* Let it fall like `$BGHD$` (in the figure).

* And since [point][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABDC$`, `$BG$` is equal to `$GD$`.
* Thus, `$BG$` (is) greater than `$HD$`.
* Thus, `$BH$` (is) much greater than `$HD$`.
* Again, since [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EBFD$`, `$BH$` is equal to `$HD$`.
* But it was also shown (to be) much greater than it.
* The very thing (is) [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] [does not touch a(nother) ][bookofproofs$1851] [circle][bookofproofs$690] internally at more than one [point][bookofproofs$631].
* So, I say that neither (does it touch) externally (at more than one [point][bookofproofs$631]).
* For, if possible, let [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ACK$` touch [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABDC$` externally at more than one [point][bookofproofs$631], `$A$` and `$C$`.
* And let `$AC$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since two [points][bookofproofs$631], `$A$` and `$C$`, have been taken at random on the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of each of the [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$ABDC$` and `$ACK$`, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining the [points][bookofproofs$631] will fall inside each ([circle][bookofproofs$690]) [[Prop. 3.2]][bookofproofs$1061].
* But, it fell inside `$ABDC$`, and outside `$ACK$` [ [Def. 3.3] ][bookofproofs$1851].
* The very thing (is) [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] [does not touch a(nother) ][bookofproofs$1851] [circle][bookofproofs$690] externally at more than one [point][bookofproofs$631].
* And it was shown that neither (does it) internally.
* Thus, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] [does not touch a(nother) ][bookofproofs$1851] [circle][bookofproofs$690] at more than one [point][bookofproofs$631], whether they touch internally or externally.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
