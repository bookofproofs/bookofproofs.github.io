### (Proposition 28 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850], equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] cut off equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690], the greater ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] being equal) to the greater, and the lesser to the lesser.
* Let `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` be [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850], and let `$AB$` and `$DE$` be equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] in these [circles][bookofproofs$690], cutting off the greater [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$ACB$` and `$DFE$`, and the lesser ([circumferences][bookofproofs$690]) `$AGB$` and `$DHE$` (respectively).
* I say that the greater [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ACB$` is equal to the greater [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$DFE$`, and the lesser [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$AGB$` to (the lesser) `$DHE$`.

### Modern Formulation

The [arcs][bookofproofs$1852] are [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] (the longer ones `${ACB}\cong {DFE}$` and the shorter ones `${AGB}\cong {DHE}$`) if [segments][bookofproofs$645] with equal lengths ($|\overline{AB} | = | \overline{DE} |$) connect their endpoints in [congruent circles][bookofproofs$1850].
