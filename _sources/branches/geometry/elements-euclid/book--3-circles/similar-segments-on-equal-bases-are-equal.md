### (Proposition 24 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> [Similar segments][bookofproofs$2783] of [circles][bookofproofs$690] on equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are equal to one another.
* For let `$AEB$` and `$CFD$` be [similar segments][bookofproofs$2783] of [circles][bookofproofs$690] on the equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$CD$` (respectively).
* I say that [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$AEB$` is equal to segment `$CFD$`.

### Modern Formulation

[Similar segments][bookofproofs$2783] are [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] if their bases are equal in length.
