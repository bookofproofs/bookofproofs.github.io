* For let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$E$` of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and let `$AE$` have been joined.
* And let (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) `$AFG$` have been drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$E$` and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$EA$`.
* And let `$DF$` have been drawn from from ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$D$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$EA$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759].
* And let `$EF$` and `$AB$` have been joined.
* I say that the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` has been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` [touching][bookofproofs$1853] [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$BCD$`.
* For since `$E$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$BCD$` and `$AFG$`, `$EA$` is thus equal to `$EF$`, and `$ED$` to `$EB$`.
* So the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AE$`, `$EB$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FE$`, `$ED$` (respectively).
* And they contain a common angle at `$E$`.
* Thus, the base `$DF$` is equal to the base `$AB$`, and triangle `$DEF$` is equal to triangle `$EBA$`, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] (are equal) to the (corresponding) remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, (angle) `$EDF$` (is) equal to `$EBA$`.
* And `$EDF$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$EBA$` (is) also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And `$EB$` is a [radius][bookofproofs$690].
* And a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of a [circle][bookofproofs$690], from its extremity, [touches][bookofproofs$1853] the [circle][bookofproofs$690] [ [Prop. 3.16 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6449].
* Thus, `$AB$` [touches circle][bookofproofs$1853] `$BCD$`.
* Thus, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` has been drawn touching the given [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$BCD$` from the given [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
