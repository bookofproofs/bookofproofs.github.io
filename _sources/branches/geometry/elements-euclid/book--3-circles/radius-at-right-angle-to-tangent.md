### (Proposition 18 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] touches a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and some (other) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is joined from the [center][bookofproofs$6428] (of the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) to the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact, then the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) so joined will be [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the [tangent][bookofproofs$1853].
* For let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$DE$` [touch][bookofproofs$1853] the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, and let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$F$` of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and let `$FC$` have been joined from `$F$` to `$C$`.
* I say that `$FC$` is [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$DE$`.

### Modern Formulation

If a [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] and a [radius][bookofproofs$690] of a given circle intersect, then they are [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653].
