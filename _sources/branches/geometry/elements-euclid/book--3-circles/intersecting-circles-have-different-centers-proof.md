* For, if possible, let `$E$` be (the common [center][bookofproofs$6428]), and let `$EC$` have been joined, and let `$EFG$` have been drawn through (the two [circles][bookofproofs$690]), at random.
* And since [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, `$EC$` is equal to `$EF$`.
* Again, since [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$CDG$`, `$EC$` is equal to `$EG$`.
* But `$EC$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$EF$`.
* Thus, `$EF$` is also equal to `$EG$`, the lesser to the greater.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` is not the (common) [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` and `$CDG$`.
* Thus, if two [circles][bookofproofs$690] cut one another then they will not have the same [center][bookofproofs$6428].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.[^1]

[^1]: It has been shown that if two circles [intersect][bookofproofs$1851], then their [centers][bookofproofs$6428] are different (editor's note).
