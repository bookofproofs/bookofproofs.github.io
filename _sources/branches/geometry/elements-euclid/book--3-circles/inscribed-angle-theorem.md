### (Proposition 20 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In a [circle][bookofproofs$690], the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at the [center][bookofproofs$6428] is double that at the [circumference][bookofproofs$690], when the [angles][bookofproofs$650] have the same [circumference][bookofproofs$690] base.
* Let `$ABC$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and let `$BEC$` be an [angle][bookofproofs$650] at its [center][bookofproofs$6428], and `$BAC$` (one) at (its) [circumference][bookofproofs$690].
* And let them have the same [circumference][bookofproofs$690] base `$BC$`.
* I say that [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BEC$` is double (angle) `$BAC$`.

### Modern Formulation

The [central angle][bookofproofs$2360] is double the [inscribed angle][bookofproofs$6434].
