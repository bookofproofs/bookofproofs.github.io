* For let `$BC$` and `$EF$` have been joined.
* And since [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` are equal, their [radii][bookofproofs$690] are equal.
* So the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BG$`, `$GC$` (are) equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$EH$`, `$HF$` (respectively).
* And the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$G$` (is) equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$H$`.
* Thus, the base `$BC$` is equal to the base `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And since the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$A$` is equal to the (angle) at `$D$`, the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$BAC$` is thus similar to the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$EDF$` [ [Def. 3.11] ][bookofproofs$2783].
* And they are on equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] [$BC$ and `$EF$`].
* And [similar segments][bookofproofs$2783] of [circles][bookofproofs$690] on equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are equal to one another [[Prop. 3.24]][bookofproofs$1904].
* Thus, segment `$BAC$` is equal to (segment) `$EDF$`.
* And the whole [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` is also equal to the whole [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$DEF$`.
* Thus, the remaining [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BKC$` is equal to the (remaining) [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ELF$`.
* Thus, in [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850], equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [stand upon][bookofproofs$6435] equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690], whether they are standing at the [center][bookofproofs$6428] or at the [circumference][bookofproofs$690].
* (Which is) the very thing which it was required to show[^1]. 

[^1]: It has been shown that the [congruence][bookofproofs$2781] of [inscribed angles][bookofproofs$6434] `$\angle{BAC}=\angle{EDF}$` or of [central angles][bookofproofs$2360] `$\angle{BGC}=\angle{EHF}$` leads to the congruence of congruent [arcs][bookofproofs$1852] `$BKC=ELF$` (editor's note).
