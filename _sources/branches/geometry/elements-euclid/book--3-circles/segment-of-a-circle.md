> A **segment of a circle** is the figure contained by a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] and a [circumference of a circle][bookofproofs$690].
### Modern Formulation

A **segment of a circle** is a [figure][bookofproofs$687] bounded by a [chord][bookofproofs$1012] and an [arc][bookofproofs$1012] of a [circle][bookofproofs$690], whose endpoints are the endpoints of the chord.

Please note that each chord generates two segments, because there are two arcs whose endpoints are the endpoints of the chord. Which segment is meant, shall be made clear from the context.
