### (Proposition 15 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In a [circle][bookofproofs$690], a [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] (is) the greatest ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and for the others, a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) nearer to the [center][bookofproofs$6428] is always greater than one further away.
* Let `$ABCD$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and let `$AD$` be its [diameter][bookofproofs$6429], and `$E$` (its) [center][bookofproofs$6428].
* And let `$BC$` be nearer to the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$AD$`,[^1] and `$FG$` further away.
* I say that `$AD$` is the greatest ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), and `$BC$` (is) greater than `$FG$`.

### Modern Formulation

The longest [chord][bookofproofs$1012] in a [circle][bookofproofs$690] is its [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$\beta$`. All chords in a circle have lengths `$\gamma$` with `$0 < \gamma \le \beta$`. The chords are the longer the [nearer they are][bookofproofs$1854] to the [center][bookofproofs$6428].  

[^1]: Euclid should have said "to the [center][bookofproofs$6428]", rather than to the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$AD$`, since `$BC$`, `$AD$` and `$FG$` are not necessarily [parallel][bookofproofs$788] (translator's note).
