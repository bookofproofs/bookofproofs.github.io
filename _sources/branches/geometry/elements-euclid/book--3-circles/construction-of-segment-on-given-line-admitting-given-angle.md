### (Proposition 33 from Book 3 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To draw a [segment of a circle][bookofproofs$1852], accepting an [angle][bookofproofs$650] equal to a given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650], on a given [straight line][bookofproofs$645].

* Let `$AB$` be the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and `$C$` the given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650].
* So it is required to draw a [segment of a circle][bookofproofs$1852], accepting an [angle][bookofproofs$650] equal to `$C$`, on the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to construct [segment of a circle][bookofproofs$1852], such that its [inscribed angle][bookofproofs$6434] (in the three illustrated cases above the respective angles `$\angle{ABE}$`, `$\angle{AEB}$`, and `$\angle{AHB}$`) is equal to a given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] (in the three illustrated cases above the respective [acute][bookofproofs$6426] `$\angle{C}$` , [right][bookofproofs$653]  `$\angle{C}$`, and [obtuse][bookofproofs$689]  `$\angle{C}$`) and its legs are adjacent to a given [chord][bookofproofs$1012] ($\overline{AB}$) of this circle.
