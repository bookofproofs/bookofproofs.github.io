* So the [angle] `$C$` is surely either [acute][bookofproofs$6426], a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], or [obtuse][bookofproofs$689].
* First of all, let it be [acute][bookofproofs$6426].
   * And, as in the first diagram (from the left), Let [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BAD$`, equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$C$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631]. A (on it) [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
   * Thus, `$BAD$` is also [acute][bookofproofs$6426].
   * Let `$AE$` have been drawn, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$DA$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759].
   * And let `$AB$` have been cut in half at `$F$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757].
   * And let `$FG$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759].
   * And let `$GB$` have been joined.
   * And since `$AF$` is equal to `$FB$`, and `$FG$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AF$`, `$FG$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BF$`, `$FG$` (respectively).
   * And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$AFG$` (is) equal to [angle] `$BFG$`.
   * Thus, the base `$AG$` is equal to the base `$BG$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
   * Thus, the [circle][bookofproofs$690] drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$G$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$GA$`, will also go through `$B$` (as well as `$A$`).
   * Let it have been drawn, and let it be (denoted) `$ABE$`.
   * And let `$EB$` have been joined.
   * Therefore, since `$AD$` is at the extremity of [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$AE$`, (namely, [point][bookofproofs$631]) `$A$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AE$`, the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$` thus [touches][bookofproofs$1853] the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABE$` [ [Prop. 3.16 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6449].
   * Therefore, since some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AD$` [touches][bookofproofs$1853] the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABE$`, and some (other) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` has been drawn across from the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact `$A$` into [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABE$`, angle `$DAB$` is thus equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$AEB$` in the alternate [segment of the circle][bookofproofs$1852] [[Prop. 3.32]][bookofproofs$1912].
   * But, `$DAB$` is equal to `$C$`.
   * Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$C$` is also equal to `$AEB$`.
   * Thus, a [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$AEB$` of a [circle][bookofproofs$690], accepting the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$AEB$` (which is) equal to the given (angle) `$C$`, has been drawn on the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.
* And so let `$C$` be a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
   * And let it again be necessary to draw a [segment of a circle][bookofproofs$1852] on `$AB$`, accepting an [angle][bookofproofs$650] equal to the right-[angle] `$C$`.
   * Let the (angle) `$BAD$` [again] have been constructed, equal to the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] `$C$` [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897], as in the second diagram (from the left).
   * And let `$AB$` have been cut in half at `$F$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757].
   * And let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$AEB$` have been drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$F$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] either `$FA$` or `$FB$`.
   * Thus, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AD$` [touches][bookofproofs$1853] the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABE$`, on account of the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$A$` being a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [ [Prop. 3.16 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6449].
   * And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAD$` is equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] in [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$AEB$`.
   * For (the latter angle), being in a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430], is also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911].
   * But, `$BAD$` is also equal to `$C$`.
   * Thus, the (angle) in (segment) `$AEB$` is also equal to `$C$`.
   * Thus, a [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$AEB$` of a [circle][bookofproofs$690], accepting an [angle][bookofproofs$650] equal to `$C$`, has again been drawn on `$AB$`.
* And so let [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$C$` be [obtuse][bookofproofs$689].
   * And Let [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BAD$`, equal to ($C$), have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` (on it) [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897], as in the third diagram (from the left).
   * And let `$AE$` have been drawn, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AD$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759].
   * And let `$AB$` have again been cut in half at `$F$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757].
   * And let `$FG$` have been drawn, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757].
   * And let `$GB$` have been joined.
   * And again, since `$AF$` is equal to `$FB$`, and `$FG$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AF$`, `$FG$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BF$`, `$FG$` (respectively).
   * And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$AFG$` (is) equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BFG$`.
   * Thus, the base `$AG$` is equal to the base `$BG$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
   * Thus, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] of [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$G$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$GA$`, being drawn, will also go through `$B$` (as well as `$A$`).
   * Let it go like `$AEB$` (in the third diagram from the left).
   * And since `$AD$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$AE$`, at its extremity, `$AD$` thus [touches circle][bookofproofs$1853] `$AEB$` [ [Prop. 3.16 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6449].
   * And `$AB$` has been drawn across (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) from the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact `$A$`.
   * Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAD$` is equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] constructed in the alternate segment `$AHB$` of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] [[Prop. 3.32]][bookofproofs$1912].
   * But, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAD$` is equal to `$C$`.
   * Thus, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] in [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$AHB$` is also equal to `$C$`.
   * Thus, a [segment][bookofproofs$1852] `$AHB$` of a [circle][bookofproofs$690], accepting an [angle][bookofproofs$650] equal to `$C$`, has been drawn on the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.[^1]

[^1]: It has been shown that it is possible to construct [segment of a circle][bookofproofs$1852], such that its [inscribed angle][bookofproofs$6434] is equal to a given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] and its legs are adjacent to a given [chord][bookofproofs$1012] of a circle.
