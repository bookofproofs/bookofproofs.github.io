> And a **sector of a circle** is the figure contained by the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] surrounding an [angle][bookofproofs$650], and the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] cut off by them, when the angle is constructed at the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of a [circle][bookofproofs$690].


### Modern Formulation

A **circular sector** is the [figure][bookofproofs$687] contained by two [radii of a circle][bookofproofs$690] and the [arch][bookofproofs$1012] between them. The angle `$\angle{BAC}$` is called a **central angle**.

Please note that each pair of different radii generates two circular sectors because there are two arcs whose endpoints are the endpoints of the radii. Which sector is meant, shall be made clear from the context.
