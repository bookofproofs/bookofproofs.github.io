### (Proposition 2 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To place a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] equal to a given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] at a given [point][bookofproofs$631] (as an extremity).

* Let `$A$` be the given [point][bookofproofs$631], and `$BC$` the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* So it is required to place a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` equal to the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`.

### Modern Formulation

Given an arbitrary point `\(A\)` and an arbitrary segment `\(\overline{BC}\)`, it is possible to construct a segment `\(\overline{AF}\)` such that its length is equal to the length of `\(\overline{BC}\)`.
