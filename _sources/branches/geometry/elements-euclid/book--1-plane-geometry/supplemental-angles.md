If a [segment][bookofproofs$645] `\(\overline{AC}\)` stands on another segment `\(\overline{DB}\)`, like shown in the following figure:


![Fig5p1p4](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/Fig5p1p4.jpg?raw=true)


then the formed angles `\(\angle{BAC}\)` and `\(\angle{CAD}\)` are called **supplemental**.
