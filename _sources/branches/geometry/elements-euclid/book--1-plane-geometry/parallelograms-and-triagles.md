### (Proposition 41 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] has the same base as a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], and is between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788], then the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] is double (the area) of the triangle.

* For let [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` have the same base `$BC$` as triangle `$EBC$`, and let it be between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788], `$BC$` and `$AE$`.
* I say that [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` is double (the area) of triangle `$BEC$`.

### Modern Formulation

If a parallelogram (`\(\boxdot{ABCD}\)`) and a triangle (`\(\triangle{EBC}\)`) stand on the same base (`\(\overline{BC}\)`) and between the same parallels (`\(\overline{AE}\)`, `\(\overline{BC}\)`), then the parallelogram is double the area of the triangle.
