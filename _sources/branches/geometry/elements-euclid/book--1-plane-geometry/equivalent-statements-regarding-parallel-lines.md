Suppose two straight lines are intersected by a third straight line at one and only one point. The two straight lines are parallel if and only if any one of these three properties hold: 

1. corresponding alternate angles are equal;
1. exterior angles equal their corresponding interior angles;
1. exterior angles equal their corresponding interior angles;
