> And the extremities of a [surface][bookofproofs$646] are [lines][bookofproofs$636].
### Modern Definition

Given two [surfaces][bookofproofs$646] `\(s\)` and `\(t\)` with  `\(s\cap t=g\)`, where `\(g\)` is a [line][bookofproofs$636], we say that `\(s\)` and `\(t\)` **intersect at the line** `\(g\)`. 

If `\(s\cap t=\{g_1,g_2,\ldots\}\)`, where `\(g_1,g_2,\ldots\)` are all lines, we say that `\(s\)` and `\(t\)` **intersect at the lines** `\(g_1,g_2,\ldots\)`. 

If `\(s\cap t=\emptyset\)`, we say that `\(s\)` and `\(t\)` **do not intersect**.
