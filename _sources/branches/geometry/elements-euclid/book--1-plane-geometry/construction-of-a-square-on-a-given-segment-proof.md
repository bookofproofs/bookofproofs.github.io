* Let `$AC$` have been drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` from the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` on it [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759], and let `$AD$` have been made equal to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736].
* And let `$DE$` have been drawn through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and let `$BE$` have been drawn through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AD$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* Thus, `$ADEB$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909].
* Therefore, `$AB$` is equal to `$DE$`, and `$AD$` to `$BE$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* But, `$AB$` is equal to `$AD$`.
* Thus, the four (sides) `$BA$`, `$AD$`, `$DE$`, and `$EB$` are equal to one another.
* Thus, the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ADEB$` is equilateral.
* So I say that (it is) also right-angled.
* For since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AD$` falls across the [parallels][bookofproofs$788] `$AB$` and `$DE$`, the (sum of the) [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BAD$` and `$ADE$` is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* But `$BAD$` (is a) [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$ADE$` (is) also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* And for [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figures, the opposite sides and [angles][bookofproofs$650] are equal to one another [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* Thus, each of the opposite [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABE$` and `$BED$` (are) also [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$ADEB$` is right-angled.
* And it was also shown (to be) equilateral.
* Thus, ($ADEB$) is a square [ [Def. 1.22] ][bookofproofs$909].
* And it is described on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
