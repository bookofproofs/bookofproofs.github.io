> A **boundary** is that which is the extremity of something. 

### Modern Definition

Let `\(c\)` be a [figure][bookofproofs$687] of a [plane][bookofproofs$647] `\(p\)`[^1]. A [point][bookofproofs$631] `\(A\)` is called a **boundary point** of `\(c\)`, if every[^2] [circle][bookofproofs$690] with the centre at `\(A\)` and a radius `\(r > 0\)` has points in common with the figure `\(c\)` and with `\(p\setminus c\)` (i.e. the everything in the plane `\(p\)` except the figure `\(c\)`:


![boundary_1](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/boundary_1.jpg?raw=true)


The set of all boundary points of `\(c\)` is called the **boundary** of the figure `\(c\)` and denoted by `\(\delta c\)`.

[^1]: e.g. a circle

[^2]: Requiring "every" circle means that it does not matter how small we chose the radius `\(r\)` of that circle, as far as it still equals some small positive number.
