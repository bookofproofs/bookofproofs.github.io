* Let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BEFG$`, equal to the triangle `$C$`, have been constructed in the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EBG$`, which is equal to `$D$` [[Prop. 1.42]][bookofproofs$957].
* And let it have been placed so that `$BE$` is [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$AB$`.[^1] 
* And let `$FG$` have been drawn through to `$H$`, and let `$AH$` have been drawn through A [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$BG$` or `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and let `$HB$` have been joined.
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$HF$` falls across the [parallels][bookofproofs$788] `$AH$` and `$EF$`, the (sum of the) [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$AHF$` and `$HFE$` is thus equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* Thus, (the sum of) `$BHG$` and `$GFE$` is less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) produced to infinity from (internal [angles][bookofproofs$650] whose sum is) less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] meet together [ [Post. 5] ][bookofproofs$939].
* Thus, being produced, `$HB$` and `$FE$` will meet together.
* Let them have been produced, and let them meet together at `$K$`.
* And let `$KL$` have been drawn through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$K$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$EA$` or `$FH$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* And let `$HA$` and `$GB$` have been produced to [points][bookofproofs$631] `$L$` and `$M$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$HLKF$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], and `$HK$` its diagonal.
* And `$AG$` and `$ME$` (are) [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909], and `$LB$` and `$BF$` the so-called complements, about `$HK$`.
* Thus, `$LB$` is equal to `$BF$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959].
* But, `$BF$` is equal to triangle `$C$`.
* Thus, `$LB$` is also equal to `$C$`.
* Also, since angle `$GBE$` is equal to `$ABM$` [[Prop. 1.15]][bookofproofs$782], but `$GBE$` is equal to `$D$`, `$ABM$` is thus also equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$D$`.
* Thus, the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$LB$`, equal to the given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$C$`, has been applied to the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` in the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABM$`, which is equal to `$D$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

[^1]: This can be achieved using [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897], and [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921] (translator's note).
