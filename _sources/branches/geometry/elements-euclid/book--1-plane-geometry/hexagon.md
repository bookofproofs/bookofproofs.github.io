A **hexagon** is a [convex][bookofproofs$6287] [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] with 6 sides and 6 vertices.

A hexagon is called **equilateral**, if all of its sides are [congruent][bookofproofs$2781].
A hexagon is called **equiangular**, if all of its angles are congruent.

### Example

The following figure shows an equilateral and equiangular hexagon (above) as well as a general hexagon (below).
