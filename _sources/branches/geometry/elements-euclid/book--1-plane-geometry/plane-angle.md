> And a **plane angle** is the inclination of the [lines][bookofproofs$636] to one another, when two lines in a [plane][bookofproofs$647] meet one another and are not lying in a [straight line][bookofproofs$645].

### Modern Definition

When two [lines][bookofproofs$636] meet in a [plane][bookofproofs$647] in a [point][bookofproofs$631], then we say that the lines build a **plane angle**.
