> And when the [lines][bookofproofs$636] containing the [plane angle][bookofproofs$6425] are [straight][bookofproofs$645] then the angle is called **rectilinear**.

### Modern Definition

Let `\(\overline{P Q}\)` and `\(\overline{Q R}\)` be two given [segments][bookofproofs$645]  [^1], which meet in the [point][bookofproofs$631] `\(Q\)`. The inclination of `\(\overline{PQ}\)` and `\(\overline{QR}\)`, is called a **rectilinear angle**, or simply an **angle**. The point `\(Q\)` is called the **vertex** of the angle and the segments are called its **legs**.

[^1]: This definition holds when we replace the term "segments" by "straight lines" or "rays".

### Please note the following important notation convention used in this adaptation of Euclid's “Elements”:

In order to avoid ambiguities in notation, given a drawing of an angle, we think of an angle as an __oriented rotation of its legs around its vertex__, and always assume that this rotation is **counter clockwise oriented**. With this in our mind, in this adaptation of Euclid's “Elements”, we always denote all angles __beginning with the leg, where the thought rotation starts, and ending with the leg, where the thought rotation stops__! In order to demonstrate this principle, consider the following figure:


![angle](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/angle.jpg?raw=true)


To denote the smaller angle, we write `\(\angle{PQR}\)`, because the leg `\(\overline{PQ}\)` is being rotated around the vertex `\(Q\)` to the leg `\(\overline{QR}\)`. To denote the bigger angle, we write `\(\angle{RQP}\)`, because the leg `\(\overline{RQ}\)` is being rotated around the vertex `\(Q\)` to the leg `\(\overline{QP}\)`.
