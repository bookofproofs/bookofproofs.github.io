### (Common Notion 3 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> _And if equal things are subtracted from equal things then the remainders are equal._

### Modern Formulation

Since `$x-a=x-b$` is equivalent to `$x+(-a)=x+(-b)$`, this is only a special case of [the previous lemma][bookofproofs$6421]. In Ancient mathematics, subtraction was considered as a separate operation rather than a special case of addition.
