* Let `$BC$` have been cut in half at `$E$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757], and let `$AE$` have been joined.
* And let (angle) `$CEF$`, equal to angle `$D$`, have been constructed at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EC$` [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* And let `$AG$` have been drawn through `$A$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$EC$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and let `$CG$` have been drawn through `$C$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* Thus, `$FECG$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909].
* And since `$BE$` is equal to `$EC$`, triangle `$ABE$` is also equal to triangle `$AEC$`.
* For they are on the equal bases, `$BE$` and `$EC$`, and between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788], `$BC$` and `$AG$` [[Prop. 1.38]][bookofproofs$949].
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is double (the area) of triangle `$AEC$`.
* And [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FECG$` is also double (the area) of triangle `$AEC$`.
* For it has the same base as ($AEC$), and is between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788] as ($AEC$) [[Prop. 1.41]][bookofproofs$955].
* Thus, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FECG$` is equal to triangle `$ABC$`.
* ($FECG$) also has the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$CEF$` equal to the given (angle) `$D$`.
* Thus, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FECG$`, equal to the given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`, has been constructed in the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$CEF$`, which is equal to `$D$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
