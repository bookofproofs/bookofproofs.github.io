> And when a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] stood upon (another) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] makes adjacent [angles][bookofproofs$650] (which are) equal[^1] to one another, each of the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] is a **right angle**, and the former [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is called a **perpendicular** to that upon which it stands.


### Modern Definition

When one [segment][bookofproofs$645] `\(\overline{AC}\)` stands on another segment `\(\overline{DB}\)` such that the [angles][bookofproofs$650]  `\(\angle{BAC}\)` and `\(\angle{CAD}\)` are [congruent][bookofproofs$2781], then both angles are called **right angles**, and their legs (e.g. segments, straight lines or rays) are called **perpendicular** to each other.

For any two perpendicular segments `\(\overline{AC}\)` and `\(\overline{DB}\)` we write `\(\overline{AC}\perp\overline{DB}\)`.
 
[^1]: The word "equal" is an intuitive definition used by Euclid about 2,200 years ago. In modern mathematics, one would first define what "equal" angles actually mean. This could, for instance, be accomplished by defining the operation *counter-clockwise rotation* of a given segment `\(\overline{BA}\)` around a fixed point `\(A\)` and the traditional degree apportionment of a full rotation (identified with the perigon `$= 360^\circ$`), which was already introduced by the Ancient Babylonians. Two angles would be equal if they have the same portion of the perigon, measured in degrees. Another possibility is to talk about congruence.
