* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` have been joined from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` to [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` [ [Post. 1] ][bookofproofs$692], and let the [equilateral triangle][bookofproofs$688] `$DAB$` have been been constructed upon it [[Prop. 1.1]][bookofproofs$693].
* And let the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AE$` and `$BF$` have been produced in a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] with `$DA$` and `$DB$` (respectively) [ [Post. 2] ][bookofproofs$734].
* And let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$CGH$` with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$B$` and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$BC$` have been drawn [ [Post. 3] ][bookofproofs$694], and again let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$GKL$` with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$D$` and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$DG$` have been drawn [ [Post. 3] ][bookofproofs$694].
* Therefore, since the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) `$CGH$`, `$BC$` is equal to `$BG$` [ [Def. 1.15] ][bookofproofs$690].
* Again, since the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$GKL$`, `$DL$` is equal to `$DG$` [ [Def. 1.15] ][bookofproofs$690].
* And within these, `$DA$` is equal to `$DB$`.
* Thus, the remainder `$AL$` is equal to the remainder `$BG$` [ [C.N. 3] ][bookofproofs$6422].
* But `$BC$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$BG$`.
* Thus, `$AL$` and `$BC$` are each equal to `$BG$`.
* But things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another [ [C.N. 1] ][bookofproofs$6420].
* Thus, `$AL$` is also equal to `$BC$`.
* Thus, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AL$`, equal to the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`, has been placed at the given [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

fn1. This proposition admits of a number of different cases, depending on the relative positions of the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` and the line `$BC$`. In such situations, Euclid invariably only considers one particular case - usually, the most difficult - and leaves the remaining cases as exercises for the reader (translator's note).
