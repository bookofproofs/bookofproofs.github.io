### (Proposition 42 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To construct a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] equal to a given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] in a given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650].
* Let `$ABC$` be the given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], and `$D$` the given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650].
* So it is required to construct a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] equal to triangle `$ABC$` in the [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] `$D$`.

### Modern Formulation

Given an arbitrary acute angle (`\(D\)`) and an arbitrary triangle (`\(\triangle{ABC}\)`), it is possible to construct a parallelogram equal in area to the triangle, which also contains the given angle (`\(D=\angle{FEC}\)`)
