### (Proposition 25 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, but (one) has a base greater than the base (of the other), then (the former triangle) will also have the [angle][bookofproofs$650] encompassed by the equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] greater than the (corresponding) angle (in the latter).
* Let `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` be two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having the two sides `$AB$` and `$AC$` equal to the two sides `$DE$` and `$DF$`, respectively (That is), `$AB$` (equal) to `$DE$`, and `$AC$` to `$DF$`.
* And let the base `$BC$` be greater than the base `$EF$`.
* I say that angle `$BAC$` is also greater than `$EDF$`.

### Modern Formulation

If two triangles (`\(\triangle{ABC}\)`, `\(\triangle{DEF}\)`) have two sides of one triangle (`\(\overline{AB}\)`, `\(\overline{AC}\)`) respectively equal to two sides of the other (`\(\overline{DE}\)`, `\(\overline{DF}\)`), where the base of one `\((\overline{BC})\)` is greater than the base of the other `\((\overline{EF})\)`, then the angle `\((\angle{BAC})\)` contained by the sides of the triangle with the longer base `\((\triangle{ABC})\)` is greater in measure than the angle `\((\angle{EDF})\)` contained by the sides of the other triangle `\((\triangle{DEF})\)`. 

In shorter words, if `\(\overline{AB}=\overline{DE}\)`, `\(\overline{AC}=\overline{DF}\)`, and `\(\overline{BC} > \overline{EF}\)`, then `\(\angle{BAC} > \angle{EDF}\)`.[^1]
