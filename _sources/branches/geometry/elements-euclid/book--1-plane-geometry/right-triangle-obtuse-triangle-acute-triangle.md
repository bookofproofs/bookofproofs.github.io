> And further of the [trilateral figures][bookofproofs$687]: a *right-angled triangle* is that having a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], an *obtuse-angled* (triangle) that having an [obtuse angle][bookofproofs$689], and an *acute-angled* (triangle) that having three [acute angles][bookofproofs$6426].
### Modern definition

A [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] with:
* a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] is called *right-angled* (or **right**),
* one [obtuse angle][bookofproofs$689] is called *obtuse-angled* (or **obtuse**),
* three [acute angles][bookofproofs$6426] is called *acute-angled* (or **acute**).


### Notes

* Euclid implicitly renames the term "3-sided figure" to the term "triangle", and defines special kinds of triangles, without defining the general term "triangle". However, this term is used frequently in  Euclid's “Elements” in its general meaning.

### Examples

A right triangle:
