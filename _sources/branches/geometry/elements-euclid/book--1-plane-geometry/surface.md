> And a **surface** is that which has length and breadth only.


### Modern Definition


A **surface** (or a **curved surface**) `\(s\)` is a connected [subset][bookofproofs$552] of a [Euclidean metric space][bookofproofs$1206] `\(A\in\mathbb R^n\)`, `\(n\ge 2\)` such that taking away a [line][bookofproofs$636] `\(g\subset s\)`, and given any [point][bookofproofs$636] `\(A\in g\)` on the line `\(g\)` will disconnect a sufficiently small [neighborhood][bookofproofs$849] of `\(A\)` in `\(s\)`.
