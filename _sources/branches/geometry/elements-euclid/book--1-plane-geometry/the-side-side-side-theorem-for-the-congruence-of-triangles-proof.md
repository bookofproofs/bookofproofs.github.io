* For if triangle `$ABC$` is applied to triangle `$DEF$`, the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` being placed on [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$` on `$EF$`, then [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` will also coincide with `$F$`, on account of `$BC$` being equal to `$EF$`.
* So (because of) `$BC$` coinciding with `$EF$`, (the sides) `$BA$` and `$CA$` will also coincide with `$ED$` and `$DF$` (respectively).
* For if base `$BC$` coincides with base `$EF$`, but the sides `$AB$` and `$AC$` do not coincide with `$ED$` and `$DF$` (respectively), but miss like `$EG$` and `$GF$` (in the above figure), then we will have constructed upon the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645], two other [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] equal, respectively, to two (given) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and (meeting) at a different [point][bookofproofs$631] on the same side (of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), but having the same ends.
* But (such [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) cannot be constructed [[Prop. 1.7]][bookofproofs$751].
* Thus, the base `$BC$` being applied to the base `$EF$`, the sides `$BA$` and `$AC$` cannot coincide with `$ED$` and `$DF$` (respectively).
* Thus, they will coincide.
* So the angle `$BAC$` will also coincide with angle `$EDF$`, and will be equal to it [ [C.N. 4] ][bookofproofs$2781].
* Thus, if two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] have two sides equal to two side, respectively, and have the base equal to the base, then they will also have equal the [angles][bookofproofs$650] encompassed by the equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
