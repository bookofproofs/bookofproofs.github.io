Let `\(\angle{ABC}\)` and `\(\angle{PQR}\)` be two [angles][bookofproofs$650]. The **sum** of these angles `\[\angle{ABR}:=\angle{ABC} + \angle{PQR}\]` 
is the angle `\(\angle{ABR}\)`, if the leg `\(\overline{QP}\)` is applied to the leg `\(\overline{BC}\)`, such that the vertex `\(Q\)` falls on the vertex `\(B\)` and the leg `\(\overline{QR}\)` falls on the opposite side of `\(\overline{BC}\)` from `\(\overline{BA}\)`.

### Please note:

Since the sum of two angles is again an angle, we can sum more then two angles by adding each next angle to the previously built sum.
