* Let the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` be have been taken at random on `$AC$`, and let `$CE$` be made equal to `$CD$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let the [equilateral triangle][bookofproofs$688] `$FDE$` have been constructed on `$DE$` [[Prop. 1.1]][bookofproofs$693], and let `$FC$` have been joined.
* I say that the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$FC$` has been drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` from the given [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` on it.
* For since `$DC$` is equal to `$CE$`, and `$CF$` is common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DC$`, `$CF$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), `$EC$`, `$CF$`, respectively.
* And the base `$DF$` is equal to the base `$FE$`.
* Thus, the angle `$DCF$` is equal to the angle `$ECF$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753], and they are adjacent.
* But when a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] stood on a(nother) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] makes the adjacent [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to one another, each of the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] is a [ [Def. 1.10] ][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, each of the ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$DCF$` and `$FCE$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$CF$` has been drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` from the given [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` on it.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
