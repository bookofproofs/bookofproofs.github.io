### (Proposition 35 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> [Parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] which are on the same base and between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788] are equal[^1] to one another.
* Let `$ABCD$` and `$EBCF$` be [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] on the same base `$BC$`, and between the same parallels `$AF$` and `$BC$`.
* I say that `$ABCD$` is equal to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EBCF$`.

### Modern Formulation

Parallelograms on the same base (`\(\overline{BC}\)`) and between the same parallels (`\(\overline{AF}\)`, `\(\overline{BC}\)`) are equal in area.

[^1]: Here, for the first time, "equal" means "equal in area", rather than "congruent" (translator's note).
