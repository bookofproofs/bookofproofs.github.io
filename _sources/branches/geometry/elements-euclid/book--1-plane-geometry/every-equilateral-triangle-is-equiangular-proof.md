* If a triangle `$ABC$` is [equilateral][bookofproofs$688], then the sides `$AB$` and `$BC$` have equal lengths.
* From [Prop 1.05][bookofproofs$740] it follows that the angles `$\angle{ABC}$` and `$\angle{BCA}$` are equal.
* The same follows for the angles  `$\angle{ABC}$` and `$\angle{CAB}$`, since the sides `$AB$` and `$AC$` are equal.
* Thus, the triangle is equiangular.
