### (Proposition 16 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> For any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], when one of the sides is produced, the external angle is greater than each of the internal and opposite [angles][bookofproofs$650].
* Let `$ABC$` be a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], and let one of its sides `$BC$` have been produced to `$D$`.
* I say that the external angle `$ACD$` is greater than each of the internal and opposite [angles][bookofproofs$650], `$CBA$` and `$BAC$`.

### Modern Formulation

Construct `\(\triangle{ABC}\)` and extend any of its sides, e.g. `\(\overline{BC}\)`, to the segment `\(\overline{CD}\)`. Then the exterior angle `\(\gamma=\angle{DCA}\)` is greater than either of the interior non-adjacent angles `\(\alpha=\angle{CBA}\)` and `\(\beta=\angle{BAC}\)`.
