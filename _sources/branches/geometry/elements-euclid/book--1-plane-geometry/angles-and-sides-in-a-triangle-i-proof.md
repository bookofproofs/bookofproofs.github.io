* For since `$AC$` is greater than `$AB$`, let `$AD$` be made equal to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let `$BD$` have been joined.
* And since angle `$ADB$` is external to triangle `$BCD$`, it is greater than the internal and opposite (angle) `$DCB$` [[Prop. 1.16]][bookofproofs$784].
* But `$ADB$` (is) equal to `$ABD$`, since side `$AB$` is also equal to side `$AD$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* Thus, `$ABD$` is also greater than `$ACB$`.
* Thus, `$ABC$` is much greater than `$ACB$`.
* Thus, in any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], the greater side subtends the greater angle.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
