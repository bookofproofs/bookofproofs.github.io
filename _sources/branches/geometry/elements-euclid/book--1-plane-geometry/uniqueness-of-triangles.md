### (Proposition 7 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> On the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645], two other [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] equal, respectively, to two (given) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (which meet) cannot be constructed (meeting) at a different [point][bookofproofs$631] on the same side (of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), but having the same ends as the given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].

### Modern Formulation

Suppose two distinct triangles `\(\triangle{ABC}\)` and `\(\triangle{ABD}\)` share a common base `\(\overline{AB}\)` and lie on the same side of it. Also suppose that at one endpoint of the base, e.g. `\(A\)`, the two sides connecting to `\(A\)` are equal in length: `\(\overline{AC}=\overline{AD}\)`. Then the lengths of the sides connected to the other endpoint of the base (point `$B$`), are unequal in length:  `\(\overline{BC}\neq\overline{BD}\)`.
