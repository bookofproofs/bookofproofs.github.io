### (Proposition 1 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To construct an [equilateral triangle][bookofproofs$688] on a given finite [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* Let `$A$` be the given [point][bookofproofs$631], and `$BC$` the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* So it is required to place a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` equal to the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`.

### Modern Formulation

Given an arbitrary [segment][bookofproofs$645], it is possible to construct an [equilateral triangle][bookofproofs$688] on that segment.
