* For if not, ($BAC$) is certainly either equal to, or less than, ($EDF$).
* In fact, `$BAC$` is not equal to `$EDF$`.
* For then the base `$BC$` would also have been equal to the base `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* But it is not.
* Thus, angle `$BAC$` is not equal to `$EDF$`.
* Neither, indeed, is `$BAC$` less than `$EDF$`.
* For then the base `$BC$` would also have been less than the base `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.24]][bookofproofs$899].
* But it is not.
* Thus, angle `$BAC$` is not less than `$EDF$`.
* But it was shown that ($BAC$ is) not equal (to `$EDF$`) either.
* Thus, `$BAC$` is greater than `$EDF$`.
* Thus, if two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, but (one) has a base greater than the base (of the other), then (the former triangle) will also have the [angle][bookofproofs$650] encompassed by the equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] greater than the (corresponding) angle (in the latter).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
