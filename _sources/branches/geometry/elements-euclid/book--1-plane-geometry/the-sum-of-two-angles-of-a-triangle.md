### (Proposition 17 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> For any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], (the sum of) two [angles][bookofproofs$650] taken together in any (possible way) is less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].

* Let `$ABC$` be a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432].
* I say that (the sum of) two [angles][bookofproofs$650] of triangle `$ABC$` taken together in any (possible way) is less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].

### Modern Formulation

The sum of any two angles of a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] in the [plane][bookofproofs$647] is less than `$180^\circ.$`
