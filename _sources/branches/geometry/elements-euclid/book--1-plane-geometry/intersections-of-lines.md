> And the extremities of a [line][bookofproofs$636] are [points][bookofproofs$631].
### Modern Definition

Given two [lines][bookofproofs$636] `\(g\)` and `\(h\)` with `\(g\cap h=A\)`, where `\(A\)` is a [point][bookofproofs$631], we say that `\(g\)` and `\(h\)` **intersect at the point** `\(A\)`. 

If `\(g\cap h=\{A_1,A_2,\ldots\}\)`, where `\(A_1,A_2,\ldots\)` are all points, we say that `\(g\)` and `\(h\)` **intersect at the points** `\(A_1,A_2,\ldots\)`. 

If `\(g\cap h=\emptyset\)`, we say that `\(g\)` and `\(h\)` **do not intersect**.
