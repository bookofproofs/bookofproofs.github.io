* For since `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$`, and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$` has fallen across them, the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` and `$BCD$` are equal to one another [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* Again, since `$AC$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BD$`, and `$BC$` has fallen across them, the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ACB$` and `$CBD$` are equal to one another [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* So `$ABC$` and `$BCD$` are two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having the two [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` and `$BCA$` equal to the two ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$BCD$` and `$CBD$`, respectively, and one side equal to one side - the (one) by the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] and common to them, (namely) `$BC$`.
* Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the corresponding remaining (sides), and the remaining angle (equal) to the remaining angle [[Prop. 1.26]][bookofproofs$905].
* Thus, side `$AB$` is equal to `$CD$`, and `$AC$` to `$BD$`.
* Furthermore, angle `$BAC$` is equal to `$CDB$`.
* And since angle `$ABC$` is equal to `$BCD$`, and `$CBD$` to `$ACB$`, the whole (angle) `$ABD$` is thus equal to the whole (angle) `$ACD$`.
* And `$BAC$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$CDB$`.
* Thus, in [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figures the opposite sides and [angles][bookofproofs$650] are equal to one another.
* And, I also say that a diagonal cuts them in half.
* For since `$AB$` is equal to `$CD$`, and `$BC$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$`, `$BC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DC$`, `$CB$`[^1], respectively.
* And angle `$ABC$` is equal to angle `$BCD$`.
* Thus, the base `$AC$` (is) also equal to `$DB$`, and triangle `$ABC$` is equal to triangle `$BCD$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, the diagonal `$BC$` cuts the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ACDB$`[^2] in half.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
