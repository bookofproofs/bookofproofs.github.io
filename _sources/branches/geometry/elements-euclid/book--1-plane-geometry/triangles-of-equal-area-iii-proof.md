* For let `$AD$` have been joined.
* I say that `$AD$` and `$BC$` are [parallel][bookofproofs$788].
* For, if not, let `$AE$` have been drawn through [point][bookofproofs$631]. A [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and let `$EC$` have been joined.
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is equal to triangle `$EBC$`.
* For it is on the same base as it, `$BC$`, and between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788] [[Prop. 1.37]][bookofproofs$947].
* But `$ABC$` is equal to `$DBC$`.
* Thus, `$DBC$` is also equal to `$EBC$`, the greater to the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$AE$` is not [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BC$`.
* Similarly, we can show that neither (is) any other ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) than `$AD$`.
* Thus, `$AD$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BC$`.
* Thus, equal [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] which are on the same base, and on the same side, are also between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
