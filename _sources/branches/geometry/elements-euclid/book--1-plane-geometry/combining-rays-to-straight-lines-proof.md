* For if `$BD$` is not [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$BC$` then let `$BE$` be [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$CB$`.
* Therefore, since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` stands on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$CBE$`, the (sum of the) [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` and `$ABE$` is thus equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.13]][bookofproofs$763].
* But (the sum of) `$ABC$` and `$ABD$` is also equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, (the sum of [angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$CBA$` and `$ABE$` is equal to (the sum of [angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$CBA$` and `$ABD$` [ [C.N. 1] ][bookofproofs$6420].
* Let [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$CBA$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remainder `$ABE$` is equal to the remainder `$ABD$` [ [C.N. 3] ][bookofproofs$6422], the lesser to the greater.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$BE$` is not [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] with respect to `$CB$`.
* Similarly, we can show that neither (is) any other ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) than `$BD$`.
* Thus, `$CB$` is [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] with respect to `$BD$`.
* Thus, if two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], not lying on the same side, make adjacent [angles][bookofproofs$650] (whose sum is) equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] with some [straight line][bookofproofs$645], at a [point][bookofproofs$631] on it, then the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] will be [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] (with respect) to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
