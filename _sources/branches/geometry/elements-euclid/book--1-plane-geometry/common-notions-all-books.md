In this part of Book 1, Euclid provided some lemmata which he called "common notions". The lemmata were postulated, without being proven. To each lemma, we will provide modern formulations or refer to other contents of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>, where you can find the proofs.
