A geometrical magnitude which has three dimensions, that is, length, breadth, and thickness, is a solid; that which has two dimensions, such as length and breadth, is a surface; and that which has but one dimension is a line. But a point is neither a solid, nor a surface, nor a line; hence it has no dimensions â€” that is, it has neither length, breadth, nor thickness.

The modern definition of a [point][bookofproofs$631] is a [set-theoretic][bookofproofs$27] one. It is itself a set, which is an element of another set. Because a point contains no other elements and because of the [uniqueness of the empty set][bookofproofs$8013], for its own, it can be identified with the [empty set][bookofproofs$550]. Of course, there are "different" points in the plane, therefore they cannot be unique in the context of a set,
the elements of which they are, but from the set-theoretical point of view this is not problematic. According to the [axiom of extensionality][bookofproofs$551], a set is only determined by the elements it contains, not by the sets, elements of which it is. Therefore, there are "different" points in a plane only in the sense that we assign to the point different coordinates.
