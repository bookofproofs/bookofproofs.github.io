* For if `$AB$` is unequal to `$DE$` then one of them is greater.
* Let `$AB$` be greater, and let `$BG$` be made equal to `$DE$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let `$GC$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since `$BG$` is equal to `$DE$`, and `$BC$` to `$EF$`, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$GB$`, `$BC$`[^1] are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`, `$EF$`, respectively.
* And angle `$GBC$` is equal to angle `$DEF$`.
* Thus, the base `$GC$` is equal to the base `$DF$`, and triangle `$GBC$` is equal to triangle `$DEF$`, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the (corresponding) remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, `$GCB$` (is equal) to `$DFE$`.
* But, `$DFE$` was assumed (to be) equal to `$BCA$`.
* Thus, `$BCG$` is also equal to `$BCA$`, the lesser to the greater.
* The very thing (is) impossible.
* Thus, `$AB$` is not unequal to `$DE$`.
* Thus, (it is) equal.
* And `$BC$` is also equal to `$EF$`.
* So the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$`, `$BC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`, `$EF$`, respectively.
* And angle `$ABC$` is equal to angle `$DEF$`.
* Thus, the base `$AC$` is equal to the base `$DF$`, and the remaining angle `$BAC$` is equal to the remaining angle `$EDF$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* But, again, let the sides subtending the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] be equal: for instance, (let) `$AB$` (be equal) to `$DE$`.
* Again, I say that the remaining sides will be equal to the remaining sides. (That is) `$AC$` (equal) to `$DF$`, and `$BC$` to `$EF$`.
* Furthermore, the remaining angle `$BAC$` is equal to the remaining angle `$EDF$`.
* For if `$BC$` is unequal to `$EF$` then one of them is greater.
* If possible, let `$BC$` be greater.
* And let `$BH$` be made equal to `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let `$AH$` have been joined.
* And since `$BH$` is equal to `$EF$`, and `$AB$` to `$DE$`, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$`, `$BH$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`, `$EF$`, respectively.
* And the [angles][bookofproofs$650] they encompass (are also equal).
* Thus, the base `$AH$` is equal to the base `$DF$`, and the triangle `$ABH$` is equal to the triangle `$DEF$`, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the (corresponding) remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, angle `$BHA$` is equal to `$EFD$`.
* But, `$EFD$` is equal to `$BCA$`.
* So, in triangle `$AHC$`, the external angle `$BHA$` is equal to the internal and opposite angle `$BCA$`.
* The very thing (is) impossible [[Prop. 1.16]][bookofproofs$784].
* Thus, `$BC$` is not unequal to `$EF$`.
* Thus, (it is) equal.
* And `$AB$` is also equal to `$DE$`.
* So the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$`, `$BC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DE$`, `$EF$`, respectively.
* And they encompass equal [angles][bookofproofs$650].
* Thus, the base `$AC$` is equal to the base `$DF$`, and triangle `$ABC$` (is) equal to triangle `$DEF$`, and the remaining angle `$BAC$` (is) equal to the remaining angle `$EDF$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, if two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] have two [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to two [angles][bookofproofs$650], respectively, and one side equal to one side - in fact, either that by the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650], or that subtending one of the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] - then (the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432]) will also have the remaining sides equal to the (corresponding) remaining sides, and the remaining angle (equal) to the remaining angle.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: The Greek text has "$BG$, `$BC$`", which is obviously a mistake (translator's note).
