* For since angle `$BAC$` is greater than [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EDF$`, let (angle) `$EDG$`, equal to angle `$BAC$`, have been constructed at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$DE$` [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* And let `$DG$` be made equal to either of `$AC$` or `$DF$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let `$EG$` and `$FG$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since `$AB$` is equal to `$DE$` and `$AC$` to `$DG$`, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BA$`, `$AC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$ED$`, `$DG$`, respectively.
* Also the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` is equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EDG$`.
* Thus, the base `$BC$` is equal to the base `$EG$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Again, since `$DF$` is equal to `$DG$`, angle `$DGF$` is also equal to angle `$DFG$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* Thus, `$DFG$` (is) greater than `$EGF$`.
* Thus, `$EFG$` is much greater than `$EGF$`.
* And since triangle `$EFG$` has angle `$EFG$` greater than `$EGF$`, and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side [[Prop. 1.19]][bookofproofs$793], side `$EG$` (is) thus also greater than `$EF$`.
* But `$EG$` (is) equal to `$BC$`.
* Thus, `$BC$` (is) also greater than `$EF$`.
* Thus, if two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, but (one) has the [angle][bookofproofs$650] encompassed by the equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] greater than the (corresponding) angle (in the other), then (the former triangle) will also have a base greater than the base (of the latter).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
