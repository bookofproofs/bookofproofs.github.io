* For let `$BC$` have been produced to `$D$`.
* And since the angle `$ACD$` is external to triangle `$ABC$`, it is greater than the internal and opposite angle `$ABC$` [[Prop. 1.16]][bookofproofs$784].
* Let `$ACB$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the (sum of the [angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$ACD$` and `$ACB$` is greater than the (sum of the [angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$ABC$` and `$BCA$`.
* But, (the sum of) `$ACD$` and `$ACB$` is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.13]][bookofproofs$763].
* Thus, (the sum of) `$ABC$` and `$BCA$` is less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Similarly, we can show that (the sum of) `$BAC$` and `$ACB$` is also less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653], and further (that the sum of) `$CAB$` and `$ABC$` (is less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653]).
* Thus, for any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], (the sum of) two [angles][bookofproofs$650] taken together in any (possible way) is less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
