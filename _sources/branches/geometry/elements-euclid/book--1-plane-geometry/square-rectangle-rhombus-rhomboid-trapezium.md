> And further of the trilateral figures: a *right-angled triangle* is that having a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], an *obtuse-angled* (triangle) that having an [obtuse angle][bookofproofs$689], and an *acute-angled* (triangle) that having three [acute angles][bookofproofs$6426]. And of the [quadrilateral figures][bookofproofs$687]: a **square** is that which is [right-angled][bookofproofs$653], and equilateral, a **rectangle** that which is right-angled but not equilateral, a **rhombus** that which is equilateral but not right-angled, and a **rhomboid** that having opposite sides and angles equal to one another which is neither right-angled nor equilateral. And let quadrilateral figures besides these be called **trapezia**.


### Modern Definitions

A [4-sided figure][bookofproofs$687]  **quadrilateral**) is called:

* a **square**, if it has [right angles][bookofproofs$653] and its all sides are [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] (i.e. have equal length),

* a **rectangle**, if it has a right angles, but not all of its sides are [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] (i.e. have equal length),


![Fig5p5p55_1](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/Fig5p5p55_1.jpg?raw=true)


* a **rhombus**, if it all it sides are congruent but it has no right angles,


![Fig5p5p55_2](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/Fig5p5p55_2.jpg?raw=true)


* a **parallelogram** (or **rhomboid**), if it its opposite sides are congruent to one another, but it has no right angles,


![Fig5p5p55_3](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/Fig5p5p55_3.jpg?raw=true)


* a **trapezium**, if it has one pair of opposite sides [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to each other.
