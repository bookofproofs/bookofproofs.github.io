### (Proposition 9 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To cut a given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] in half.
* Let `$BAC$` be the given rectilinear angle.
* So it is required to cut it in half.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to bisect a given [angle][bookofproofs$650] `\(\angle{BAC}\)`.
