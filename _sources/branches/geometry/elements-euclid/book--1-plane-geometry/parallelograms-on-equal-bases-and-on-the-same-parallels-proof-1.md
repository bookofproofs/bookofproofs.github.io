* For let `$BE$` and `$CH$` have been joined.
* And since `$BC$` is equal to `$FG$`, but `$FG$` is equal to `$EH$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933], `$BC$` is thus equal to `$EH$`.
* And they are also [parallel][bookofproofs$788], and `$EB$` and `$HC$` join them.
* But ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) joining equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) on the same sides are (themselves) equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [[Prop. 1.33]][bookofproofs$931] [thus, `$EB$` and `$HC$` are also equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788]].
* Thus, `$EBCH$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933], and is equal to `$ABCD$`.
* For it has the same base, `$BC$`, as ($ABCD$), and is between the same parallels, `$BC$` and `$AH$`, as ($ABCD$) [[Prop. 1.35]][bookofproofs$943].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$EFGH$` is also equal to the same ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$EBCH$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* So that the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` is also equal to `$EFGH$`.
* Thus, [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] which are on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
