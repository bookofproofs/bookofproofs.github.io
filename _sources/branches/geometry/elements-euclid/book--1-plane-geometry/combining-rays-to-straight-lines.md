### (Proposition 14 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], not lying on the same side, make adjacent [angles][bookofproofs$650] (whose sum is) equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] with some [straight line][bookofproofs$645], at a [point][bookofproofs$631] on it, then the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] will be [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] (with respect) to one another.
* For let two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$` and `$BD$`, not lying on the same side, make adjacent [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` and `$ABD$` (whose sum is) equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] with some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` on it.
* I say that `$BD$` is straight-on with respect to `$CB$`.

### Modern Formulation

If at the endpoint of a ray `\(\overline BA \)` there exist two other rays `\(\overline BC \)`, `\(\overline BD \)` standing on opposite sides of that ray such that the sum of their adjacent angles is equal to two right angles `$\angle{DBA} + \angle{ABC}=2\cdot 90^\circ,$` then these two rays build a straight line `\(CD \)`.
