* For let `$CE$` have been drawn through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* And since `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CE$`, and `$AC$` has fallen across them, the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` and `$ACE$` are equal to one another [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* Again, since `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CE$`, and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$` has fallen across them, the external angle `$ECD$` is equal to the internal and opposite (angle) `$ABC$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* But `$ACE$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$BAC$`.
* Thus, the whole angle `$ACD$` is equal to the (sum of the) two internal and opposite ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$BAC$` and `$ABC$`.
* Let `$ACB$` have been added to both.
* Thus, (the sum of) `$ACD$` and `$ACB$` is equal to the (sum of the) three ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$ABC$`, `$BCA$`, and `$CAB$`.
* But, (the sum of) `$ACD$` and `$ACB$` is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.13]][bookofproofs$763].
* Thus, (the sum of) `$ACB$`, `$CBA$`, and `$CAB$` is also equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, in any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], (if) one of the sides (is) produced (then) the external angle is equal to the (sum of the) two internal and opposite ([angles][bookofproofs$650]), and the (sum of the) three internal [angles][bookofproofs$650] of the triangle is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
