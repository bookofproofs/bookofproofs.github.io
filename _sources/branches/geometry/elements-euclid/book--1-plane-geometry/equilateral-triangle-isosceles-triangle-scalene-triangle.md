> And of the [trilateral figures][bookofproofs$687]: an **equilateral triangle** is that having three equal sides, an **isosceles** (triangle) that having only two equal sides, and a **scalene** (triangle) that having three unequal sides.

### Modern definitions

A [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] is called:

* **equilateral**, if it has three [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] sides (equivalently, of which all sides are equal in length),
* **isosceles**, if it has two [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] sides (equivalently, with only two equal sides),
* **scalene**, if it has no [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] sides, (equivalently whose three sides are unequal in length).

### Notes

* Euclid implicitly renames the term "3-sided figure" to the term "triangle", and defines special kinds of triangles, without defining the general term "triangle". However, this term is used frequently in  Euclid's “Elements” in its general meaning.
* The term "equal" has two different meanings in Euclid's “Elements”: congruence and equality. In this case, "congruent sides" are meant. Alternatively, we could use "equal lengths of sides" rather than "equal sides".
