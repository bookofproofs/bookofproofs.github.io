* Let the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` and `$E$` have been taken at random on each of the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$CD$` and `$CE$` (respectively), and let `$DE$` have been joined.
* And let the triangle `$AFG$` have been constructed from three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are equal to `$CD$`, `$DE$`, and `$CE$`, such that `$CD$` is equal to `$AF$`, `$CE$` to `$AG$`, and further `$DE$` to `$FG$` [[Prop. 1.22]][bookofproofs$895].
* Therefore, since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DC$`, `$CE$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FA$`, `$AG$`, respectively, and the base `$DE$` is equal to the base `$FG$`, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DCE$` is thus equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FAG$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* Thus, the [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FAG$`, equal to the given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DCE$`, has been constructed at the (given) [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` on the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
