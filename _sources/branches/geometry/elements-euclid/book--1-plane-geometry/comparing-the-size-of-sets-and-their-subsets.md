### (Common Notion 5 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> __And the whole [is] greater than the part.__

### Modern Formulation (Proposal)[^1]

The cardinality of a set is greater than the cardinality of its subset.

[^1]: Today we know that this modern formulation is not true! It holds only for finite sets. In the time of Euclid, mathematicians and philosophers had only a vivid concept of "the whole" and "its part" which is totally different from contemporary set-theoretical concepts.
