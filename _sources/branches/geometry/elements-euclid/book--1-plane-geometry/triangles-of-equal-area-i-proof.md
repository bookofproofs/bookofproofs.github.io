* Let `$AD$` have been produced in both directions to `$E$` and `$F$`, and let the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BE$` have been drawn through `$B$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CA$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and let the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CF$` have been drawn through `$C$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BD$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* Thus, `$EBCA$` and `$DBCF$` are both [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909], and are equal.
* For they are on the same base `$BC$`, and between the same parallels `$BC$` and `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.35]][bookofproofs$943].
* And the triangle `$ABC$` is half of the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EBCA$`.
* For the diagonal `$AB$` cuts the latter in half [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* And the triangle `$DBC$` (is) half of the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$DBCF$`.
* For the diagonal `$DC$` cuts the latter in half [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* And the halves of equal things are equal to one another.][^1] Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is equal to triangle `$DBC$`.
* Thus, [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] which are on the same base and between the same parallels are equal to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: This is an additional common notion (translator's note).
