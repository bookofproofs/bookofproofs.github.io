* For if `$AGH$` is unequal to `$GHD$` then one of them is greater.
* Let `$AGH$` be greater.
* Let `$BGH$` have been added to both.
* Thus, (the sum of) `$AGH$` and `$BGH$` is greater than (the sum of) `$BGH$` and `$GHD$`.
* But, (the sum of) `$AGH$` and `$BGH$` is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.13]][bookofproofs$763].
* Thus, (the sum of) `$BGH$` and `$GHD$` is [also] less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* But ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) being produced to infinity from (internal [angles][bookofproofs$650] whose sum is) less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] meet together [ [Post. 5] ][bookofproofs$939].
* Thus, `$AB$` and `$CD$`, being produced to infinity, will meet together.
* But they do not meet, on account of them (initially) being assumed [parallel][bookofproofs$788] (to one another) [ [Def. 1.23] ][bookofproofs$788].
* Thus, `$AGH$` is not unequal to `$GHD$`.
* Thus, (it is) equal.
* But, `$AGH$` is equal to `$EGB$` [[Prop. 1.15]][bookofproofs$782].
* And `$EGB$` is thus also equal to `$GHD$`.
* Let `$BGH$` be added to both.
* Thus, (the sum of) `$EGB$` and `$BGH$` is equal to (the sum of) `$BGH$` and `$GHD$`.
* But, (the sum of) `$EGB$` and `$BGH$` is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.13]][bookofproofs$763].
* Thus, (the sum of) `$BGH$` and `$GHD$` is also equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] falling across [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] makes the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to one another, the external (angle) equal to the internal and opposite (angle), and the (sum of the) internal ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) on the same side equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
