### (Proposition 13 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] stood on a(nother)  [straight line][bookofproofs$645] makes [angles][bookofproofs$650], it will certainly either make two [right angles][bookofproofs$653], or [angles][bookofproofs$650] whose sum is) equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].

* For let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` stood on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$CD$` make the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$CBA$` and `$ABD$`.
* I say that the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$CBA$` and `$ABD$` are certainly either two [right angles][bookofproofs$653], or (have a sum) equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].

### Modern Formulation

If the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `\(AB\)` intersects the straight line `\(CD\)` at one and only one [point][bookofproofs$631] (`\(B\)`), then either `\(\angle{ABC}\)` and `\(\angle{DBA}\)` are right angles or the sum `\(\angle{ABC}+\angle{DBA}\)` equals the sum of two right angles.
