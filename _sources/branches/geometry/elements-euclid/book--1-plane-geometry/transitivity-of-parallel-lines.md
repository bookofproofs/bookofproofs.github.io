### (Proposition 30 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> ([Straight-lines][bookofproofs$645]) [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645] are also [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one another.

* Let each of the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$CD$` be [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$EF$`.
* I say that `$AB$` is also [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$`.

### Modern Formulation

Straight lines parallel to the same straight line are also parallel to one another, i.e. if `\(AB\parallel EF\)` and `\(EF\parallel CB\)` then `\(AB\parallel CB\)`.
