### (Proposition 38 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> [Triangles][bookofproofs$6432] which are on equal bases and between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788] are equal to one another.
* Let `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` be [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] on the equal bases `$BC$` and `$EF$`, and between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788] `$BF$` and `$AD$`.
* I say that triangle `$ABC$` is equal to triangle `$DEF$`.

### Modern Formulation

Triangles which stand on equal bases and in the same parallels are equal in area.
