* For since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AE$` stands on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$CD$`, making the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$CEA$` and `$AED$`, the (sum of the) [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$CEA$` and `$AED$` is thus equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.13]][bookofproofs$763].
* Again, since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$DE$` stands on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, making the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$AED$` and `$DEB$`, the (sum of the) [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$AED$` and `$DEB$` is thus equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.13]][bookofproofs$763].
* But (the sum of) `$CEA$` and `$AED$` was also shown (to be) equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, (the sum of) `$CEA$` and `$AED$` is equal to (the sum of) `$AED$` and `$DEB$` [ [C.N. 1] ][bookofproofs$6420].
* Let `$AED$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remainder `$CEA$` is equal to the remainder `$BED$` [ [C.N. 3] ][bookofproofs$6422].
* Similarly, it can be shown that `$CEB$` and `$DEA$` are also equal.
* Thus, if two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] cut one another then they make the vertically opposite [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
