* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$GK$` fall across ($AB$, `$CD$`, and `$EF$`).
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$GK$` has fallen across the [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$EF$`, (angle) `$AGK$` (is) thus equal to `$GHF$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* Again, since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$GK$` has fallen across the [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$` and `$CD$`, (angle) `$GHF$` is equal to `$GKD$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* But `$AGK$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$GHF$`.
* Thus, `$AGK$` is also equal to `$GKD$`.
* And they are alternate ([angles][bookofproofs$650]).
* Thus, `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$` [[Prop. 1.27]][bookofproofs$911].
* Thus, ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645] are also [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
