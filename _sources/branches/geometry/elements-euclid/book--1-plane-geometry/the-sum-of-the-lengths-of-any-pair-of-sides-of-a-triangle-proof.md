* (So), (the sum of) `$BA$` and `$AC$` (is greater) than `$BC$`, (the sum of) `$AB$` and `$BC$` than `$AC$`, and (the sum of) `$BC$` and `$CA$` than `$AB$`.
* For let `$BA$` have been drawn through to [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, and let `$AD$` be made equal to `$CA$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let `$DC$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since `$DA$` is equal to `$AC$`, the angle `$ADC$` is also equal to `$ACD$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* Thus, `$BCD$` is greater than `$ADC$`.
* And since `$DCB$` is a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] having the angle `$BCD$` greater than `$BDC$`, and the greater angle subtends the greater side [[Prop. 1.19]][bookofproofs$793], `$DB$` is thus greater than `$BC$`.
* But `$DA$` is equal to `$AC$`.
* Thus, (the sum of) `$BA$` and `$AC$` is greater than `$BC$`.
* Similarly, we can show that (the sum of) `$AB$` and `$BC$` is also greater than `$CA$`, and (the sum of) `$BC$` and `$CA$` than `$AB$`.
* Thus, in any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], (the sum of) two sides taken together in any (possible way) is greater than the remaining (side).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
