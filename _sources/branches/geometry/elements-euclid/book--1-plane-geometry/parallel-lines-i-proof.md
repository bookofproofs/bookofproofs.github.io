* For if not, being produced, `$AB$` and `$CD$` will certainly meet together: either in the direction of `$B$` and `$D$`, or (in the direction) of `$A$` and `$C$` [ [Def. 1.23] ][bookofproofs$788].
* Let them have been produced, and let them meet together in the direction of `$B$` and `$D$` at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$G$`.
* So, for the triangle `$GEF$`, the external angle `$AEF$` is equal to the interior and opposite (angle) `$EFG$`.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 1.16]][bookofproofs$784].
* Thus, being produced, `$AB$` and `$CD$` will not meet together in the direction of `$B$` and `$D$`.
* Similarly, it can be shown that neither (will they meet together) in (the direction of) `$A$` and `$C$`.
* But ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) meeting in neither direction are [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [ [Def. 1.23] ][bookofproofs$788].
* Thus, `$AB$` and `$CD$` are [parallel][bookofproofs$788].
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] falling across two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] makes the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to one another then the (two) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] will be [parallel][bookofproofs$788] (to one another).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
