### (Proposition 27 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] falling across two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] makes the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to one another then the (two) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] will be [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one another.
* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$`, falling across the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$CD$`, make the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$AEF$` and `$EFD$` equal to one another.
* I say that `$AB$` and `$CD$` are [parallel][bookofproofs$788].

### Modern Formulation

If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `\((EF)\)` intersects two straight lines `\((AB)\)`, `\((CD)\)` such that the [alternate angles][bookofproofs$910] are equal `\((\angle{AEF}=\angle{DFE})\)`, then these lines are [parallel][bookofproofs$788] `\((AB\parallel CD)\)`.
