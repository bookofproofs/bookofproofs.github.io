* For let `$BD$` have been drawn through to `$E$`.
* And since in any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] (the sum of any) two sides is greater than the remaining (side) [[Prop. 1.20]][bookofproofs$795], in triangle `$ABE$` the (sum of the) two sides `$AB$` and `$AE$` is thus greater than `$BE$`.
* Let `$EC$` have been added to both.
* Thus, (the sum of) `$BA$` and `$AC$` is greater than (the sum of) `$BE$` and `$EC$`.
* Again, since in triangle `$CED$` the (sum of the) two sides `$CE$` and `$ED$` is greater than `$CD$`, let `$DB$` have been added to both.
* Thus, (the sum of) `$CE$` and `$EB$` is greater than (the sum of) `$CD$` and `$DB$`.
* But, (the sum of) `$BA$` and `$AC$` was shown (to be) greater than (the sum of) `$BE$` and `$EC$`.
* Thus, (the sum of) `$BA$` and `$AC$` is much greater than (the sum of) `$BD$` and `$DC$`.
* Again, since in any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] the external angle is greater than the internal and opposite ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) [[Prop. 1.16]][bookofproofs$784], in triangle `$CDE$` the external angle `$BDC$` is thus greater than `$CED$`.
* Accordingly, for the same (reason), the external angle `$CEB$` of the triangle `$ABE$` is also greater than `$BAC$`.
* But, `$BDC$` was shown (to be) greater than `$CEB$`.
* Thus, `$BDC$` is much greater than `$BAC$`.
* Thus, if two internal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are constructed on one of the sides of a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], from its ends, the constructed ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) are less than the two remaining sides of the triangle, but encompass a greater [angle][bookofproofs$650].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
