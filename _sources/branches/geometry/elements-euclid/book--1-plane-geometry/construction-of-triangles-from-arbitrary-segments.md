### (Proposition 22 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To construct a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] from three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are equal to three given [[straight lines][bookofproofs$645]]. It is necessary for (the sum of) two (of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) taken together in any (possible way) to be greater than the remaining (one), [on account of the (fact that) in any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] (the sum of) two sides taken together in any (possible way) is greater than the remaining (one) [[Prop. 1.20]][bookofproofs$795] ].

* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` be the three given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], of which let (the sum of) two taken together in any (possible way) be greater than the remaining (one).
* (Thus), (the sum of) `$A$` and `$B$` (is greater) than `$C$`, (the sum of) `$A$` and `$C$` than `$B$`, and also (the sum of) `$B$` and `$C$` than `$A$`.
* So it is required to construct a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] from ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) equal to `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.

### Modern Formulation

If for three arbitrary segments `$A=\overline{DF}$`, `$B=\overline{FG}$`, and `$C=\overline{GH}$`, the sum of every two pairs of segments is greater than the length of the remaining segment, then it is possible[^1] to construct a triangle, whose three sides are respectively equal to the three segments.

[^1]: Please note that this is the conversion of the  [triangle inequality][bookofproofs$795].
