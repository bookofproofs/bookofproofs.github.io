* For let the square `$BDEC$` have been described on `$BC$`, and (the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) `$GB$` and `$HC$` on `$AB$` and `$AC$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.46]][bookofproofs$965].
* And let `$AL$` have been drawn through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$BD$` or `$CE$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* And let `$AD$` and `$FC$` have been joined.
* And since [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` and `$BAG$` are each [right angles][bookofproofs$653], then two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` and `$AG$`, not lying on the same side, make the adjacent [angles][bookofproofs$650] with some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BA$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` on it, (whose sum is) equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$CA$` is [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$AG$` [[Prop. 1.14]][bookofproofs$767].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$BA$` is also [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$AH$`.
* And since angle `$DBC$` is equal to `$FBA$`, for (they are) both [right angles][bookofproofs$653], let `$ABC$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the whole [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$DBA$` is equal to the whole [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$FBC$`.
* And since `$DB$` is equal to `$BC$`, and `$FB$` to `$BA$`, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DB$`, `$BA$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$CB$`, `$BF$`,[^1] respectively.
* And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DBA$` (is) equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FBC$`.
* Thus, the base `$AD$` [is] equal to the base `$FC$`, and the triangle `$ABD$` is equal to the triangle `$FBC$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BL$` [is] double (the area) of triangle `$ABD$`.
* For they have the same base, `$BD$`, and are between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788], `$BD$` and `$AL$` [[Prop. 1.41]][bookofproofs$955].
* And square `$GB$` is double (the area) of triangle `$FBC$`.
* For again they have the same base, `$FB$`, and are between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788], `$FB$` and `$GC$` [[Prop. 1.41]][bookofproofs$955].
* And the doubles of equal things are equal to one another.[^2] Thus, the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BL$` is also equal to the square `$GB$`.
* So, similarly, `$AE$` and `$BK$` being joined, the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CL$` can be shown (to be) equal to the square `$HC$`.
* Thus, the whole square `$BDEC$` is equal to the (sum of the) two squares `$GB$` and `$HC$`.
* And the square `$BDEC$` is described on `$BC$`, and the (squares) `$GB$` and `$HC$` on `$BA$` and `$AC$` (respectively).
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side `$BC$` is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the sides `$BA$` and `$AC$`.
* Thus, in [right-angled triangles][bookofproofs$6431], the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side subtending the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the sides surrounding the right-[angle].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: The Greek text has "$FB$, `$BC$`", which is obviously a mistake (translator's note).

[^2]: This is an additional common notion (translator's note).
