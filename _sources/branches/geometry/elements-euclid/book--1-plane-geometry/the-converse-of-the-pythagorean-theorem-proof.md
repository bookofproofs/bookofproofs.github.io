* For let `$AD$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759], and let `$AD$` have been made equal to `$BA$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let `$DC$` have been joined.
* Since `$DA$` is equal to `$AB$`, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DA$` is thus also equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`.[^1] Let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$DA$` and `$AC$` is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` and `$AC$`.
* But, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$` is equal to the (sum of the squares) on `$DA$` and `$AC$`.
* For angle `$DAC$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* But, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is equal to (sum of the squares) on `$BA$` and `$AC$`.
* For (that) was assumed.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$` is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$`.
* So side `$DC$` is also equal to (side) `$BC$`.
* And since `$DA$` is equal to `$AB$`, and `$AC$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DA$`, `$AC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BA$`, `$AC$`.
* And the base `$DC$` is equal to the base `$BC$`.
* Thus, angle `$DAC$` [is] equal to angle `$BAC$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* But `$DAC$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$BAC$` is also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on one of the sides of a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the remaining two sides of the triangle then the [angle][bookofproofs$650] contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: Here, use is made of the additional common notion that the squares of equal things are themselves equal. Later on, the inverse notion is used (translator's note).
