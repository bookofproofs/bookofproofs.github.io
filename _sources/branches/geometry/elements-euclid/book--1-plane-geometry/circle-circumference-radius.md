### Euclid's Formulation

> A **circle** is a [plane figure][bookofproofs$6427] contained by a single [line][bookofproofs$636] [which is called a **circumference**], (such that) all of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]  **radiating** towards [the circumference] from one [point][bookofproofs$631] amongst those lying inside the figure are [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] to one another.

### Modern Formulation

Let `\(A,B\)` be two different [points][bookofproofs$631] in a [plane][bookofproofs$647] `\(\mathcal P\)`, and let `\(d(A,B)\)` denote their [Euclidean distance][bookofproofs$631] (i.e. the length of the [segment][bookofproofs$645] `\(\overline{AB}\)`). A **circle** is a [plane figure][bookofproofs$687] consisting of points of the plane `\(D\)`, which have a smaller or equal distance from `\(A\)`, formally

`\[\text{Circle}:=\{D\in\mathcal P:~d(A,D)\le d(A,B)\}.\]`

Any segment `\(\overline{A,D}\)` with maximum possible distance `\(d(A,D)=d(A,B)\)` is called the **radius** of the circle.

The **circumference** of the circle is the [boundary][bookofproofs$907] of the circle, i.e. all points `\(D\)` in the plane, which have the maximum possible distance:

`\[\text{Circlumference}:=\{D\in\mathcal P:~d(A,D) = d(A,B)\}.\]`


### Example

A circle with a radius `\(\overline{AB}\)`. In the figure, one of the infinitely many points `\(D\)` with `\(d(A,D)\le d(A,B)\)` is marked.
