* Let the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$` have been cut in half at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$E$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757].
* And `$BE$` being joined, let it have been produced in a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] to ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$F$`.[^1] And let `$EF$` be made equal to `$BE$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let `$FC$` have been joined, and let `$AC$` have been drawn through to ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$G$`.
* Therefore, since `$AE$` is equal to `$EC$`, and `$BE$` to `$EF$`, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AE$`, `$EB$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$CE$`, `$EF$`, respectively.
* Also, angle `$AEB$` is equal to angle `$FEC$`, for (they are) vertically opposite [[Prop. 1.15]][bookofproofs$782].
* Thus, the base `$AB$` is equal to the base `$FC$`, and the triangle `$ABE$` is equal to the triangle `$FEC$`, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] subtended by the equal sides are equal to the corresponding remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, `$BAE$` is equal to `$ECF$`.
* But `$ECD$` is greater than `$ECF$`.
* Thus, `$ACD$` is greater than `$BAE$`.
* Similarly, by having cut `$BC$` in half, it can be shown (that) `$BCG$` - that is to say, `$ACD$` - (is) also greater than `$ABC$`.
* Thus, for any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], when one of the sides is produced, the external angle is greater than each of the internal and opposite [angles][bookofproofs$650].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: The implicit assumption that the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` lies in the interior of the angle `$ABC$` should be counted as an additional postulate (translator's note)
