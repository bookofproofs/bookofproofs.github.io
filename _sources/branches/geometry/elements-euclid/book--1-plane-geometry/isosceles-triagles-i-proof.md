* For let the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` have been taken at random on `$BD$`, and let `$AG$` have been cut off from the greater `$AE$`, equal to the lesser `$AF$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736].
* Also, let the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$FC$` and `$GB$` have been joined [ [Post. 1] ][bookofproofs$692].
* In fact, since `$AF$` is equal to `$AG$`, and `$AB$` to `$AC$`, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FA$`, `$AC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$GA$`, `$AB$`, respectively.
* They also encompass a common angle, `$FAG$`.
* Thus, the base `$FC$` is equal to the base `$GB$`, and the triangle `$AFC$` will be equal to the triangle `$AGB$`, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] subtendend by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738] (That is) `$ACF$` to `$ABG$`, and `$AFC$` to `$AGB$`.
* And since the whole of `$AF$` is equal to the whole of `$AG$`, within which `$AB$` is equal to `$AC$`, the remainder `$BF$` is thus equal to the remainder `$CG$` [ [C.N. 3] ][bookofproofs$6422].
* But `$FC$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$GB$`.
* So the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BF$`, `$FC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$CG$`, `$GB$`, respectively, and the angle `$BFC$` (is) equal to the angle `$CGB$`, and the base `$BC$` is common to them.
* Thus, the triangle `$BFC$` will be equal to the triangle `$CGB$`, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, `$FBC$` is equal to `$GCB$`, and `$BCF$` to `$CBG$`.
* Therefore, since the whole angle `$ABG$` was shown (to be) equal to the whole angle `$ACF$`, within which `$CBG$` is equal to `$BCF$`, the remainder `$ABC$` is thus equal to the remainder `$ACB$` [ [C.N. 3] ][bookofproofs$6422].
* And they are at the base of triangle `$ABC$`.
* And `$FBC$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$GCB$`.
* And they are under the base.
* Thus, for [isosceles triangles][bookofproofs$688], the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at the base are equal to one another, and if the equal sides are produced then the [angles][bookofproofs$650] under the base will be equal to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
