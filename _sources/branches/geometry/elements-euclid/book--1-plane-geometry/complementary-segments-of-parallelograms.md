### Euclid's Formulation

> For any [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], the complements of the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] about the diagonal are equal to one another.
* Let `$ABCD$` be a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], and `$AC$` its diagonal.
* And let `$EH$` and `$FG$` be the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] about `$AC$`, and `$BK$` and `$KD$` the so-called complements (about `$AC$`).
* I say that the complement `$BK$` is equal to the complement `$KD$`.

### Modern Formulation

Let `\(\boxdot{ABCD}\)` be a parallelogram with a diagonal `\(\overline{AC}\)` and let `\(K\)` be any point on that diagonal. Then segments, which are parallel to the sides of the parallelogram and pass through  `\(K\)`,  (specifically `\(\overline{EF}\)`, `\(\overline{GH}\)`) divide `\(\boxdot{ABCD}\)` into four smaller parallelograms: the two segments through which the diagonal does not pass (`\(\boxdot{EBGK}\)`, `\(\boxdot{HKFD}\)`) are called the **complements** of the other two (`\(\boxdot{AEKH}\)`, `\(\boxdot{KGCF}\)`). Moreover, the complements are equal in area: `\(\boxdot{EBGK}=\boxdot{HKFD}\)`.
