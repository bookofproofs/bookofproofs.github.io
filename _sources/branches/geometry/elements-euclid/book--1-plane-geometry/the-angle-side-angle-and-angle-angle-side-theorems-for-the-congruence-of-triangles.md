### (Proposition 26 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] have two [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to two [angles][bookofproofs$650], respectively, and one side equal to one side - in fact, either that by the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650], or that subtending one of the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] - then (the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432]) will also have the remaining sides equal to the [corresponding] remaining sides, and the remaining angle (equal) to the remaining angle.

* Let `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` be two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having the two [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` and `$BCA$` equal to the two ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$DEF$` and `$EFD$`, respectively. (That is) `$ABC$` (equal) to `$DEF$`, and `$BCA$` to `$EFD$`.
* And let them also have one side equal to one side.
* First of all, the (side) by the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650]. (That is) `$BC$` (equal) to `$EF$`.
* I say that they will have the remaining sides equal to the corresponding remaining sides. (That is) `$AB$` (equal) to `$DE$`, and `$AC$` to `$DF$`.
* And (they will have) the remaining angle (equal) to the remaining angle. (That is) `$BAC$` (equal) to `$EDF$`.

### Modern Formulation

If two triangles (`\(\triangle{ABC}\)`, `\(\triangle{DEF}\)`) have two angles of one (`\(\alpha:=\angle{BAC}\)`, `\(\beta:=\angle{ACB}\)`) respectively equal to two angles of the other (`\(\gamma:=\angle{EDF}\)`, `\(\delta:=\angle{DFE}\)`), and a side of one equal to a similarly placed side of the other (placed with regard to the angles), then both triangles are [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] `\[\triangle{ABC}\cong\triangle{DEF}.\]`

This proposition breaks down into two cases according to whether the equal sides are adjacent or opposite to the equal angles:

### Case 1: "ANGLE-SIDE-ANGLE" theorem for the congruence of triangles

If the side in question is the side between the two angles, then the triangles are congruent.

### Case 2: "ANGLE-ANGLE-SIDE" theorem for the congruence of triangles

If the side in question is not the side between the two angles, then the triangles are congruent.
