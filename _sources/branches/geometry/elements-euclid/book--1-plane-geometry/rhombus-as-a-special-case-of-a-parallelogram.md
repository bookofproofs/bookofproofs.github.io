If two adjacent sides of a parallelogram are equal in length, then all its sides are equal in length and it is a [rhombus][bookofproofs$909].

Equivalent definitions are:

* The diagonals of a parallelogram are perpendicular to each other.

* A diagonal of a parallelogram bisects the angles whose vertices it joins.
