* Let the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` have been taken at random on `$AB$`, and let `$AE$`, equal to `$AD$`, have been cut off from `$AC$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let `$DE$` have been joined.
* And let the [equilateral triangle][bookofproofs$688] `$DEF$` have been constructed upon `$DE$` [[Prop. 1.1]][bookofproofs$693], and let `$AF$` have been joined.
* I say that the angle `$BAC$` has been cut in half by the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AF$`.
* For since `$AD$` is equal to `$AE$`, and `$AF$` is common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DA$`, `$AF$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$EA$`, `$AF$`, respectively.
* And the base `$DF$` is equal to the base `$EF$`.
* Thus, angle `$DAF$` is equal to angle `$EAF$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* Thus, the given rectilinear angle `$BAC$` has been cut in half by the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AF$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
