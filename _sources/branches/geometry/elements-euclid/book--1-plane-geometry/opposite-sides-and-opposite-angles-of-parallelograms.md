### (Proposition 34 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figures the opposite sides and [angles][bookofproofs$650] are equal to one another, and a diagonal cuts them in half.
* Let `$ACDB$` be a [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figure, and `$BC$` its diagonal.
* I say that for [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ACDB$`, the opposite sides and [angles][bookofproofs$650] are equal to one another, and the diagonal `$BC$` cuts it in half.

### Modern Formulation

The opposite sides and the opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal to one another and either diagonal bisects the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$907]. In particular, the area of the parallelogram `\(\boxdot{ABDC}\)` is double the area of `\(\triangle{ACB}\)`, (respectively `\(\triangle{BCD}\)`).
