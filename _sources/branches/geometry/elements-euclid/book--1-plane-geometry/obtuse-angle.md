> An **obtuse angle** is one greater than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
### Modern Definition

Euclid's definition corresponds to today's formulation.

### Example

The angle `\(\angle{RQP}\)` (marked light-green) is obtuse.

In the following figure both angles `\(\angle{ABC}\)` and `\(\angle{CBA}\)` are obtuse.
