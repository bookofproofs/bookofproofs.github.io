* Extend the segments `\(\overline{BA}\)` and `\(\overline{CF}\)` to straight lines `\(BA\)` and `\(CF\)`. 
* Assume that `\(BA\)` and `\(CF\)` meet somewhere at a point `\(X\)`. Then, the triangle `\(\triangle{CAX}\)` would have an exterior angle `\(\angle{BAC}\)` equal to the interior angle `\(\angle{XCA}\)`, in [contradiction][bookofproofs$744] to [Prop 1.16][bookofproofs$784], according to which it must be greater than the interior angle.
* Therefore, the hypothesis `\(BA\)` and `\(CF\)` would meet at a point `\(X\)` must be false. In other words, the straight lines do not have any point in common and exist.
