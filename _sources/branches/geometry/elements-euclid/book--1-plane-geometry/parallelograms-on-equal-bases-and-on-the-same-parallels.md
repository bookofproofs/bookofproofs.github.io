### Euclid's Formulation

> [Parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] which are on equal bases and between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788] are equal to one another.
* Let `$ABCD$` and `$EFGH$` be [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] which are on the equal bases `$BC$` and `$FG$`, and (are) between the same parallels `$AH$` and `$BG$`.
* I say that the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` is equal to `$EFGH$`.

### Modern Formulation

Parallelograms (`\(\boxdot{ADCB}\)` , `\(\boxdot{EHGF}\)`) on equal bases (`\(\overline{BC}\)`, `\(\overline{FG}\)`) and standing between the same parallels (`\(\overline{AH}\)`, `\(\overline{BG}\)`) are equal in area.
