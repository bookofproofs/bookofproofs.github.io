### Euclid's Formulation

> To draw a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to a given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] from a given [point][bookofproofs$631] on it.

* Let `$AB$` be the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and `$C$` the given [point][bookofproofs$631] on it.
* So it is required to draw a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] from the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to construct a segment at a right angle to a given straight line `$AB$` from an arbitrary point `$C$` on the straight line.
