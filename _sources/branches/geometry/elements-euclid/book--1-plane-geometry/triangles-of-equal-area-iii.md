### (Proposition 39 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Equal [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] which are on the same base, and on the same side, are also between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788].
* Let `$ABC$` and `$DBC$` be equal [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] which are on the same base `$BC$`, and on the same side (of it).
* I say that they are also between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788].

### Modern Formulation

Triangles (`\(\triangle{BAC}\)`, `\(\triangle{BDC}\)`), which are equal in area and stand on the same base (`\(\overline{BC}\)`) and on the same side of the base also stand between the same parallels (`\(\overline{AD}\)`, `\(\overline{BC}\)`).
