### (Proposition 6 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a triangle has two [angles][bookofproofs$6425] equal to one another then the sides subtending the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] will also be equal to one another.

* Let `$ABC$` be a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] having the angle `$ABC$` equal to the angle `$ACB$`.
* I say that side `$AB$` is also equal to side `$AC$`.

### Modern Formulation

If a given triangle has two equal [angles][bookofproofs$650], then the sides opposite the two angles are equal in length (i.e., the triangle is isosceles).
