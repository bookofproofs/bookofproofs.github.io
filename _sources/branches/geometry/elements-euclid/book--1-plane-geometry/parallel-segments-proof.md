* Let `$BC$` have been joined.
* And since `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$`, and `$BC$` has fallen across them, the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` and `$BCD$` are equal to one another [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* And since `$AB$` is equal to `$CD$`, and `$BC$` is common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$`, `$BC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DC$`, `$CB$`.[^1] And the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` is equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BCD$`.
* Thus, the base `$AC$` is equal to the base `$BD$`, and triangle `$ABC$` is equal to triangle `$DCB$`[^2], and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] will be equal to the corresponding remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] subtended by the equal sides [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, angle `$ACB$` is equal to `$CBD$`.
* Also, since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`, (in) falling across the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` and `$BD$`, has made the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] ($ACB$ and `$CBD$`) equal to one another, `$AC$` is thus [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BD$` [[Prop. 1.27]][bookofproofs$911].
* And ($AC$) was also shown (to be) equal to ($BD$).
* Thus, [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joining equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) on the same sides are themselves also equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: The Greek text has "$BC$, `$CD$`", which is obviously a mistake (translator's note).

[^2]: The Greek text has "$DCB$", which is obviously a mistake (translator's note).
