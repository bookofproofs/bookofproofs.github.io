* Let `$DB$` have been joined, and let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FH$`, equal to the triangle `$ABD$`, have been constructed in the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$HKF$`, which is equal to `$E$` [[Prop. 1.42]][bookofproofs$957].
* And let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$GM$`, equal to the triangle `$DBC$`, have been applied to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$GH$` in the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$GHM$`, which is equal to `$E$` [[Prop. 1.44]][bookofproofs$961].
* And since angle `$E$` is equal to each of ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$HKF$` and `$GHM$`, (angle) `$HKF$` is thus also equal to `$GHM$`.
* Let `$KHG$` have been added to both.
* Thus, (the sum of) `$FKH$` and `$KHG$` is equal to (the sum of) `$KHG$` and `$GHM$`.
* But, (the sum of) `$FKH$` and `$KHG$` is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* Thus, (the sum of) `$KHG$` and `$GHM$` is also equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* So two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$KH$` and `$HM$`, not lying on the same side, make adjacent [angles][bookofproofs$650] with some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$GH$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$` on it, (whose sum is) equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$KH$` is [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$HM$` [[Prop. 1.14]][bookofproofs$767].
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$HG$` falls across the [parallels][bookofproofs$788] `$KM$` and `$FG$`, the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$MHG$` and `$HGF$` are equal to one another [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* Let `$HGL$` have been added to both.
* Thus, (the sum of) `$MHG$` and `$HGL$` is equal to (the sum of) `$HGF$` and `$HGL$`.
* But, (the sum of) `$MHG$` and `$HGL$` is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* Thus, (the sum of) `$HGF$` and `$HGL$` is also equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$FG$` is [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$GL$` [[Prop. 1.14]][bookofproofs$767].
* And since `$FK$` is equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$HG$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933], but also `$HG$` to `$ML$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933], `$KF$` is thus also equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$ML$` [[Prop. 1.30]][bookofproofs$919].
* And the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$KM$` and `$FL$` join them.
* Thus, `$KM$` and `$FL$` are equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] as well [[Prop. 1.33]][bookofproofs$931].
* Thus, `$KFLM$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909].
* And since triangle `$ABD$` is equal to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FH$`, and `$DBC$` to `$GM$`, the whole [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCD$` is thus equal to the whole [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$KFLM$`.
* Thus, the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$KFLM$`, equal to the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCD$`, has been constructed in the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FKM$`, which is equal to the given (angle) `$E$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

fn1. The proof is only given for a four-sided figure. However, the extension to many-sided figures is trivial (translator's note).
