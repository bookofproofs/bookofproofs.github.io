* For if triangle `$ABC$` is applied to triangle `$DEF$`,[^1] the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` being placed on the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` on `$DE$`, then the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` will also coincide with `$E$`, on account of `$AB$` being equal to `$DE$`.
* So (because of) `$AB$` coinciding with `$DE$`, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` will also coincide with `$DF$`, on account of the angle `$BAC$` being equal to `$EDF$`.
* So the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` will also coincide with the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`, again on account of `$AC$` being equal to `$DF$`.
* But, [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` certainly also coincided with [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, so that the base `$BC$` will coincide with the base `$EF$`.
* For if `$B$` coincides with `$E$`, and `$C$` with `$F$`, and the base `$BC$` does not coincide with `$EF$`, then two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] will encompass an area.
* The very thing[^2] is [impossible][bookofproofs$744] [ [Post. 1] ][bookofproofs$692].
* Thus, the base `$BC$` will coincide with `$EF$`, and will be equal to it [ [C.N. 4] ][bookofproofs$2781].
* So the whole triangle `$ABC$` will coincide with the whole triangle `$DEF$`, and will be equal to it [ [C.N. 4] ][bookofproofs$2781].
* And the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] will coincide with the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650], and will be equal to them [ [C.N. 4] ][bookofproofs$2781].
* (That is) `$ABC$` to `$DEF$`, and `$ACB$` to `$DFE$` [ [C.N. 4] ][bookofproofs$2781].
* Thus, if two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, and have the angle(s) enclosed by the equal [straight line][bookofproofs$645] equal, then they will also have the base equal to the base, and the triangle will be equal to the triangle, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: The application of one figure to another should be counted as an additional postulate (translator's note).

[^2]: Since [ [Post. 1] ][bookofproofs$692] implicitly assumes that the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining two given [points][bookofproofs$631] is unique (translator's note).
