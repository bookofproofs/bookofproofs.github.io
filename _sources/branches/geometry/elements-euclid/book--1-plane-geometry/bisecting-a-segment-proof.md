* Let the [equilateral triangle][bookofproofs$688] `$ABC$` have been constructed upon ($AB$) [[Prop. 1.1]][bookofproofs$693], and let the angle `$ACB$` have been cut in half by the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$CD$` [[Prop. 1.9]][bookofproofs$755].
* I say that the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` has been cut in half at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`.
* For since `$AC$` is equal to `$CB$`, and `$CD$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AC$`, `$CD$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BC$`, `$CD$`, respectively.
* And the angle `$ACD$` is equal to the angle `$BCD$`.
* Thus, the base `$AD$` is equal to the base `$BD$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, the given finite [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` has been cut in half at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$D$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
