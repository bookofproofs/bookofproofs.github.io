### (Proposition 24 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, but (one) has the [angle][bookofproofs$650] encompassed by the equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] greater than the (corresponding) angle (in the other), then (the former triangle) will also have a base greater than the base (of the latter).
* Let `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` be two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having the two sides `$AB$` and `$AC$` equal to the two sides `$DE$` and `$DF$`, respectively. (That is), `$AB$` (equal) to `$DE$`, and `$AC$` to `$DF$`.
* Let them also have the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$A$` greater than the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$D$`.
* I say that the base `$BC$` is also greater than the base `$EF$`.

### Modern Formulation

If in two triangles `\(\triangle{ABC}\)`, `\(\triangle{DEF}\)`  we have two pairs of sides in each triangle respectively equal to the other, (without loss of generality assume `\(\overline{AB}=\overline{DE}\)` and `\(\overline{AC}=\overline{DF}\)`), where the interior angle in one triangle is greater in measure than the interior angle of the other triangle (`\(\angle{BAC} > \angle{EDF}\)`), then the remaining sides of the triangles will be unequal in length; specifically, the triangle with the greater interior angle will have a greater side than the triangle with the lesser interior angle (`\(\overline{BC} > \overline{EF}\)`).
