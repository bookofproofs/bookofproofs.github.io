### Euclid's Formulation

> To draw a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to a given [straight line][bookofproofs$645], through a given [point][bookofproofs$631].
* Let `$A$` be the given [point][bookofproofs$631], and `$BC$` the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* So it is required to draw a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`, through the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`.

### Modern Formulation

Given a straight line `\(BC\)` and a point `\(A\)`, which does not lie on the line, it is possible to construct the straight line `\(EF\)`, which is parallel to `\(BC\)` and goes through the point `$A.$`
