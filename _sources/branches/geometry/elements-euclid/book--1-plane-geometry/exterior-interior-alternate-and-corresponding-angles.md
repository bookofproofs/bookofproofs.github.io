When a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] intersects two other straight lines at two distinct points, between them are eight [angles][bookofproofs$650] (see Fig.).

* Angles 1 and 2, 7 and 8 are called **exterior angles**; 
* Angles 3 and 4, 5 and 6 are called **interior angles**; 
* Angles 4 and 6, 3 and 5 are called **alternate angles**; 
* Angles 1 and 5, 2 and 6, 3 and 8, 4 and 7 are called **corresponding angles**.
