### (Proposition 44 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To apply a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] equal to a given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] to a given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] in a given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650].
* Let `$AB$` be the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645], `$C$` the given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], and `$D$` the given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650].
* So it is required to apply a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] equal to the given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$C$` to the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` in an [angle][bookofproofs$650] equal to (angle) `$D$`.

### Modern Formulation

Given an arbitrary triangle  (`\(\triangle{C}\)`), an arbitrary angle (`\(\angle{D}\)`), and an arbitrary segment (`\(\overline{AB}\)`), it is possible to construct a parallelogram (`\(\boxdot{FGBE}\)`) equal in area to the triangle `$\triangle{C}$` which contains the given angle `$\angle {D}=\angle{GBE}$` and has a side `$\overline{GB}$` equal in length to the given segment `$\overline{AB}$`.
