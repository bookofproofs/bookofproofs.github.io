### (Proposition 15 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] cut one another then they make the vertically opposite [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to one another.
* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$CD$` cut one another at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`.
* I say that angle `$AEC$` is equal to (angle) `$DEB$`, and (angle) `$CEB$` to (angle) `$AED$`.

### Modern Formulation

If two straight lines `\(AB\)` and `\(CD\)` intersect one another at one point `\(E\)`, their opposite angles are equal.
