### (Proposition 20 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], (the sum of) two sides taken together in any (possible way) is greater than the remaining (side).

* For let `$ABC$` be a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432].
* I say that in triangle `$ABC$` (the sum of) two sides taken together in any (possible way) is greater than the remaining (side).
