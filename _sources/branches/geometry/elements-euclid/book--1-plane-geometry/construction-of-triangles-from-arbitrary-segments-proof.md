* Let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$DE$` be set out, terminated at `$D$`, and infinite in the direction of `$E$`.
* And let `$DF$` made equal to `$A$`, and `$FG$` equal to `$B$`, and `$GH$` equal to `$C$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736].
* And let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$DKL$` have been drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$F$` and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$FD$`.
* Again, let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$KLH$` have been drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$G$` and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$GH$`.
* And let `$KF$` and `$KG$` have been joined.
* I say that the triangle `$KFG$` has been constructed from three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] equal to `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* For since [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$DKL$`, `$FD$` is equal to `$FK$`.
* But, `$FD$` is equal to `$A$`.
* Thus, `$KF$` is also equal to `$A$`.
* Again, since [point][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$LKH$`, `$GH$` is equal to `$GK$`.
* But, `$GH$` is equal to `$C$`.
* Thus, `$KG$` is also equal to `$C$`.
* And `$FG$` is also equal to `$B$`.
* Thus, the three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$KF$`, `$FG$`, and `$GK$` are equal to `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` (respectively).
* Thus, the triangle `$KFG$` has been constructed from the three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$KF$`, `$FG$`, and `$GK$`, which are equal to the three given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` (respectively).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
