* By [Prop 1.32][bookofproofs$924], the sum of all angles in a plane triangle is `$180^\circ.$`
* This holds for any two triangles in the plane.
* By hypothesis, the first triangle has sum of angles `$\alpha+\beta+\gamma_1=180^\circ$` and the second triangle the sum `$\alpha+\beta+\gamma_2=180^\circ.$`
* Therefore `$\alpha+\beta+\gamma_1=180^\circ=\alpha+\beta+\gamma_2,$` or  `$\gamma_1=\gamma_2.$`
