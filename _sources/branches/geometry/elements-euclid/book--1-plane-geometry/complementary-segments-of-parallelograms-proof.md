* For since `$ABCD$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], and `$AC$` its diagonal, triangle `$ABC$` is equal to triangle `$ACD$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* Again, since `$EH$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], and `$AK$` is its diagonal, triangle `$AEK$` is equal to triangle `$AHK$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* So, for the same (reasons), triangle `$KFC$` is also equal to (triangle) `$KGC$`.
* Therefore, since triangle `$AEK$` is equal to triangle `$AHK$`, and `$KFC$` to `$KGC$`, triangle `$AEK$` plus `$KGC$` is equal to triangle `$AHK$` plus `$KFC$`.
* And the whole triangle `$ABC$` is also equal to the whole (triangle) `$ADC$`. 
* Thus, the remaining complement `$BK$` is equal to the remaining complement `$KD$`.
* Thus, for any parallelogrammic figure, the complements of the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] about the diagonal are equal to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
