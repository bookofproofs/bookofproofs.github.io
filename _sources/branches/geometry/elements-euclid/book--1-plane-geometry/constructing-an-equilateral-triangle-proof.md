* Let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$BCD$` with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$A$` and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$` have been drawn [ [Post. 3] ][bookofproofs$694], and again let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ACE$` with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$B$` and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$BA$` have been drawn [ [Post. 3] ][bookofproofs$694].
* And let the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$CA$` and `$CB$` have been joined from the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, where the [circles][bookofproofs$690] cut one another,[^1] to the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively) [ [Post. 1] ][bookofproofs$692].
* And since the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$CDB$`, `$AC$` is equal to `$AB$` [ [Def. 1.15] ][bookofproofs$690].
* Again, since the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$CAE$`, `$BC$` is equal to `$BA$` [ [Def. 1.15] ][bookofproofs$690].
* But `$CA$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$CA$` and `$CB$` are each equal to `$AB$`.
* But things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another [ [C.N. 1] ][bookofproofs$6420].
* Thus, `$CA$` is also equal to `$CB$`.
* Thus, the three ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$CA$`, `$AB$`, and `$BC$` are equal to one another.
* Thus, the [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` is equilateral, and has been constructed on the given finite [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

[^1]: The assumption that the [circles][bookofproofs$690] do indeed cut one another should be counted as an additional postulate. There is also an implicit assumption that two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] cannot share a common segment (translator's note)
