* For let [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` have been taken at random on the other side (to `$C$`) of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, and let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFG$` have been drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$C$` and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$CD$` [ [Post. 3] ][bookofproofs$694], and let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EG$` have been cut in half at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$H$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757], and let the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$CG$`, `$CH$`, and `$CE$` have been joined.
* I say that the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CH$` has been drawn [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the given infinite [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` from the given [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, which is not on ($AB$).
* For since `$GH$` is equal to `$HE$`, and `$HC$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$GH$`, `$HC$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$EH$`, `$HC$`, respectively, and the base `$CG$` is equal to the base `$CE$`.
* Thus, the angle `$CHG$` is equal to the angle `$EHC$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753], and they are adjacent.
* But when a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] stood on a(nother) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] makes the adjacent [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to one another, each of the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], and the former [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is called a [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to that upon which it stands [ [Def. 1.10] ][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CH$` has been drawn [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the given infinite [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` from the given [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, which is not on ($AB$).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
