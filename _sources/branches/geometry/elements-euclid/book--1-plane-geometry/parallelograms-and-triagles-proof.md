* For let `$AC$` have been joined.
* So triangle `$ABC$` is equal to triangle `$EBC$`.
* For it is on the same base, `$BC$`, as ($EBC$), and between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788], `$BC$` and `$AE$` [[Prop. 1.37]][bookofproofs$947].
* But, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` is double (the area) of triangle `$ABC$`.
* For the diagonal `$AC$` cuts the former in half [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* So [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` is also double (the area) of triangle `$EBC$`.
* Thus, if a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] has the same base as a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], and is between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788], then the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] is double (the area) of the triangle.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
