* For let `$AD$` have been produced in both directions to `$G$` and `$H$`, and let the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BG$` have been drawn through `$B$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CA$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and let the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$FH$` have been drawn through `$F$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$DE$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* Thus, `$GBCA$` and `$DEFH$` are each [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909].
* And `$GBCA$` is equal to `$DEFH$`.
* For they are on the equal bases `$BC$` and `$EF$`, and between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788] `$BF$` and `$GH$` [[Prop. 1.36]][bookofproofs$945].
* And triangle `$ABC$` is half of the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$GBCA$`.
* For the diagonal `$AB$` cuts the latter in half [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* And triangle `$FED$` (is) half of [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$DEFH$`.
* For the diagonal `$DF$` cuts the latter in half.
* And the halves of equal things are equal to one another. Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is equal to triangle `$DEF$`.
* Thus, [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] which are on equal bases and between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788] are equal to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
