### (Proposition 47 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In [right-angled triangles][bookofproofs$6431], the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side subtending the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the sides containing the [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Let `$ABC$` be a [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431] having the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` and `$AC$`.

### Modern Formulation

In a right triangle (`\(\triangle{ABC}\)`), the square on the hypotenuse (`\(\overline{BC}\)`) is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides (`\(\overline{AB}\)`, `\(\overline{CA}\)`).

This theorem is also known as the theorem of [Pythagoras][bookofproofs$Pythagoras].
