### (Proposition 46 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To describe a [square][bookofproofs$909] on a given [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* Let `$AB$` be the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* So it is required to describe a [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

Given an arbitrary segment `\(\overline{AB}\)`, it is possible to construct a square on that segment.
