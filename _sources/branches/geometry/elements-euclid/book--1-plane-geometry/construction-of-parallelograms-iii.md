### (Proposition 45 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To construct a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] equal to a given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] in a given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650].
* Let `$ABCD$` be the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687], and `$E$` the given [rectilinear angle][bookofproofs$650].
* So it is required to construct a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] equal to the [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCD$` in the given angle `$E$`.

### Modern Formulation

Given an arbitrary convex [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` and an arbitrary angle (`\(\angle{E}\)`), it is possible to construct a parallelogram `$FKML$` equal in area to the given `\(n\)`-sided figure `$ABCD,$` which contains an angle `$\angle{FKM}$` equal to the given angle `$\angle{E}.$`
