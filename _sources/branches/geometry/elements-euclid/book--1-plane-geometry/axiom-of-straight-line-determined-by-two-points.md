### (Postulate 1 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Let it have been postulated to draw a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] from any [point][bookofproofs$631] to any [point][bookofproofs$631].

### Modern Formulation

Two distinct [points][bookofproofs$631] `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` always completely determine a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `\(a\)`. 

Instead of saying "is determined", we also say that

* `\(a\)` "goes through" `\(A\)` and `\(B\)`,
* `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` "lie" on `\(a\)`.
