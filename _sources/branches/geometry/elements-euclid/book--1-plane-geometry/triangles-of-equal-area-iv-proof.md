* For let `$AD$` have been joined.
* I say that `$AD$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BE$`.
* For if not, let `$AF$` have been drawn through `$A$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BE$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921], and let `$FE$` have been joined.
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is equal to triangle `$FCE$`.
* For they are on equal bases, `$BC$` and `$CE$`, and between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788], `$BE$` and `$AF$` [[Prop. 1.38]][bookofproofs$949].
* But, triangle `$ABC$` is equal to [triangle] `$DCE$`.
* Thus, [triangle] `$DCE$` is also equal to triangle `$FCE$`, the greater to the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$AF$` is not [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BE$`.
* Similarly, we can show that neither (is) any other ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) than `$AD$`.
* Thus, `$AD$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BE$`.
* Thus, equal [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] which are on equal bases, and on the same side, are also between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
