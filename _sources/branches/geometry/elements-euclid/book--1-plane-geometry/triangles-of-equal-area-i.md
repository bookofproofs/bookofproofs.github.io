### (Proposition 37 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> [Triangles][bookofproofs$6432] which are on the same base and between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788] are equal to one another.
* Let `$ABC$` and `$DBC$` be [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] on the same base `$BC$`, and between the same parallels `$AD$` and `$BC$`.
* I say that triangle `$ABC$` is equal to triangle `$DBC$`.

### Modern Formulation

Triangles (`\(\triangle{ABC}\)`, `\(\triangle{DBC}\)`) on the same base (`\(\overline{BC}\)`) and standing between the same parallels (`\(\overline{AD}\)`, `\(\overline{BC}\)`) are equal in area.
