* For, if possible, let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$`, `$CB$`, equal to two other [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AD$`, `$DB$`, respectively, have been constructed on the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, meeting at different [points][bookofproofs$631], `$C$` and `$D$`, on the same side (of `$AB$`), and having the same ends (on `$AB$`).
* So `$CA$` is equal to `$DA$`, having the same end `$A$` as it, and `$CB$` is equal to `$DB$`, having the same end `$B$` as it.
* And let `$CD$` have been joined [ [Post. 1] ][bookofproofs$692].
* Therefore, since `$AC$` is equal to `$AD$`, the angle `$ACD$` is also equal to angle `$ADC$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* Thus, `$ADC$` (is) greater than `$DCB$` [ [C.N. 5] ][bookofproofs$6423].
* Thus, `$CDB$` is much greater than `$DCB$` [ [C.N. 5] ][bookofproofs$6423].
* Again, since `$CB$` is equal to `$DB$`, the angle `$CDB$` is also equal to angle `$DCB$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* But it was shown that the former (angle) is also much greater (than the latter).
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, on the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645], two other [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] equal, respectively, to two (given) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (which meet) cannot be constructed (meeting) at a different [point][bookofproofs$631] on the same side (of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), but having the same ends as the given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
