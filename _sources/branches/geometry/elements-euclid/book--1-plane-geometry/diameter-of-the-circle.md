> And a **diameter** of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] is any [straight line][bookofproofs$645], being drawn through the [center][bookofproofs$690], and terminated in each direction by the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the circle. (And) any such ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) also cuts the circle in half.


### Modern Definition

A **diameter** of a  [circle][bookofproofs$690] is any [segment][bookofproofs$645] `\(\overline{AB}\)` drawn in its interior, connecting two points of its [circumference][bookofproofs$690] and containing its [center][bookofproofs$6428].
### Notes

* Euclid does not differentiate between straight lines and segments.
* Moreover, Euclid's definition uses "cutting the circle in half" as a defining property of a diameter, but it should really be counted as a postulate, rather than as part of a definition. Since it is not necessary to define a diameter

### Example

A circle with the diameter `\(\overline{AB}\)`.
