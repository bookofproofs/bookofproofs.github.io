### (Postulate 3 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> And to draw a [circle][bookofproofs$690] with any [center][bookofproofs$690]":[bookofproofs$690] and "radius":[bookofproofs$690].

### Modern Formulation

A [point][bookofproofs$631] `\(A\)` and a given segment `\(\overline{AB}\)` always completely determine a [circle][bookofproofs$690] `\(c\)`. Instead of saying "determine", we also say that `\(c\)` "is the circle with the center" `\(A\)` "of the radius" `\(\overline{AB}\)`.
