### (Proposition 19 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements” - this a the conversion to the [proposition 1.18][bookofproofs$791])

> In any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], the greater angle is subtended by the greater side.

* Let `$ABC$` be a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] having the angle `$ABC$` greater than `$BCA$`.
* I say that side `$AC$` is also greater than side `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

In a given triangle `\(\triangle{ABC}\)` with the angle `\(\angle{ABC}\)` greater than the angle `\(\angle{BCA}\)`, the side `\(\overline{AC}\)` opposite to the greater angle is longer than `\(\overline{AB}\)`, opposite to the smaller angle.
