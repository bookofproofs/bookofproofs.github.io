> **Parallel lines** are [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which, being in the same [plane][bookofproofs$647], and being produced to infinity in each direction, meet with one another in neither (of these directions).

### Modern Definition

According to [Corollary to Proposition 1.16][bookofproofs$786], there exist straight lines in the [plane][bookofproofs$647], which do not have any point in common. According to the [Post. 1][bookofproofs$692], they are also unique. Since they exist and are unique, we can use those facts to define the concept of parallel straight lines:

Two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] in a plane are called **parallel**, if and only if they do not have any point in common. Any [ray][bookofproofs$645], or [segments][bookofproofs$645] contained in parallel straight lines are also said to be **parallel**.
