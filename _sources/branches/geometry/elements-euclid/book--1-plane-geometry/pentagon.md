A **pentagon** is a [convex][bookofproofs$6287] [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] with 5 sides and 5 vertices.

A pentagon is called 

* **equilateral**, if all of its sides are [congruent][bookofproofs$2781],
* **equiangular**, if all of its angles are congruent,
* **regular**, if it is equilateral or equiangular. 


### Example

The following figure shows an equilateral and equiangular pentagon (above) as well as a general pentagon (below).
