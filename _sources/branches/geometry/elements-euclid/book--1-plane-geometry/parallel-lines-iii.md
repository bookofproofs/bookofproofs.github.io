### (Proposition 29 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A [straight line][bookofproofs$645] falling across [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] makes the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to one another, the external (angle) equal to the internal and opposite (angle), and the (sum of the) internal ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) on the same side equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$` fall across the [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* I say that it makes the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650], `$AGH$` and `$GHD$`, equal, the external angle `$EGB$` equal to the internal and opposite (angle) `$GHD$`, and the (sum of the) internal ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) on the same side, `$BGH$` and `$GHD$`, equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].

### Modern Formulation

If a straight line `\(EF\)` intersects two [parallel][bookofproofs$788] straight lines `\((AB\parallel CD)\)` at one and only one point each then: 

* alternate angles `\(\angle{AGH}, \angle{DHG}\)` are equal[^1]; 
* the exterior angle `\(\angle{BGE}\)` equals its corresponding interior angle `\(\angle{DHG}\)`[^2]; 
* the sum of the two interior angles `\(\angle{DHG} + \angle{HGB}\)` equals two right angles[^3].
