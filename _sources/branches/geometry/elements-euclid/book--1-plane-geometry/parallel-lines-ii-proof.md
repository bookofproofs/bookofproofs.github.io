* For since (in the first case) `$EGB$` is equal to `$GHD$`, but `$EGB$` is equal to `$AGH$` [[Prop. 1.15]][bookofproofs$782], `$AGH$` is thus also equal to `$GHD$`.
* And they are alternate ([angles][bookofproofs$650]).
* Thus, `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$` [[Prop. 1.27]][bookofproofs$911].
* Again, since (in the second case, the sum of) `$BGH$` and `$GHD$` is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653], and (the sum of) `$AGH$` and `$BGH$` is also equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.13]][bookofproofs$763], (the sum of) `$AGH$` and `$BGH$` is thus equal to (the sum of) `$BGH$` and `$GHD$`.
* Let `$BGH$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remainder `$AGH$` is equal to the remainder `$GHD$`.
* And they are alternate ([angles][bookofproofs$650]).
* Thus, `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$` [[Prop. 1.27]][bookofproofs$911].
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] falling across two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] makes the external angle equal to the internal and opposite angle on the same side, or (makes) the (sum of the) internal ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) on the same side equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653], then the (two) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] will be [parallel][bookofproofs$788] (to one another).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
