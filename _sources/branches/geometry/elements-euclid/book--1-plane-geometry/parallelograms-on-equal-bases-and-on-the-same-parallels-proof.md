* For since `$ABCD$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], `$AD$` is equal to `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$EF$` is also equal to `$BC$`.
* So `$AD$` is also equal to `$EF$`.
* And `$DE$` is common.
* Thus, the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AE$` is equal to the whole ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DF$`.
* And `$AB$` is also equal to `$DC$`.
* So the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$EA$`, `$AB$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FD$`, `$DC$`, respectively.
* And angle `$FDC$` is equal to angle `$EAB$`, the external to the internal [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* Thus, the base `$EB$` is equal to the base `$FC$`, and triangle `$EAB$` will be equal to triangle `$DFC$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Let `$DGE$` have been taken away from both.
* Thus, the remaining trapezium `$ABGD$` is equal to the remaining trapezium `$EGCF$`.
* Let triangle `$GBC$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the whole [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` is equal to the whole [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EBCF$`.
* Thus, [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] which are on the same base and between the same parallels are equal to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
