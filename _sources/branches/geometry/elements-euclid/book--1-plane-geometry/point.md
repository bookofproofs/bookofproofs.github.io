> A **point** is that of which there is no part.

### Modern Definition

A **point** (denoted by a capital letter, e.g. `\(A\)`), is an [element][bookofproofs$550] of a [Euclidean metric space][bookofproofs$1206] `\(A\in\mathbb R^n\)`. It has a position but no dimensions, i.e. 

`\[A\in \mathbb R^n,\quad A\cap\mathbb R^n=\mathbb R^0.\]`

The **Cartesian coordinates** of the point are `\[A=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n),\]`

where `\(x_i\in\mathbb R\)` for `\(i=1,2\ldots,n\)`.

### Example

In the plane (which is the two-dimensional Euclidean vector space), the position of every point can be described by two coordinates: `\(A=(x_1,x_2)=(x,y)\)`. In the following figure, you can see the coordinates of the point, if you move your mouse over the point or drag the point around. By conventions, the first coordinate `\(x=x_1\)` corresponds to the horizontal axis, the second `\(y=x_2\)` to the vertical:

<div>
	<div id="boxE16479" class="jxgbox centered" style="max-width:100%; width:500px; height:500px;"></div>
</div>
