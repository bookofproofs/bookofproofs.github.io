* In fact, if `$CBA$` is equal to `$ABD$` then they are two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [ [Def. 1.10] ][bookofproofs$653].
* But, if not, let `$BE$` have been drawn from the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to [the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$CD$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759].
* Thus, `$CBE$` and `$EBD$` are two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And since `$CBE$` is equal to the two ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$CBA$` and `$ABE$`, let `$EBD$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the (sum of the [angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$CBE$` and `$EBD$` is equal to the (sum of the) three ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$CBA$`, `$ABE$`, and `$EBD$` [ [C.N. 2] ][bookofproofs$6421].
* Again, since `$DBA$` is equal to the two ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$DBE$` and `$EBA$`, let `$ABC$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the (sum of the [angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$DBA$` and `$ABC$` is equal to the (sum of the) three ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$DBE$`, `$EBA$`, and `$ABC$` [ [C.N. 2] ][bookofproofs$6421].
* But (the sum of) `$CBE$` and `$EBD$` was also shown (to be) equal to the (sum of the) same three ([angles][bookofproofs$650]).
* And things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another [ [C.N. 1] ][bookofproofs$6420].
* Therefore, (the sum of) `$CBE$` and `$EBD$` is also equal to (the sum of) `$DBA$` and `$ABC$`.
* But, (the sum of) `$CBE$` and `$EBD$` is two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, (the sum of) `$ABD$` and `$ABC$` is also equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] stood on a(nother) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] makes [angles][bookofproofs$650], it will certainly either make two [right angles][bookofproofs$653], or ([angles][bookofproofs$650] whose sum is) equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
