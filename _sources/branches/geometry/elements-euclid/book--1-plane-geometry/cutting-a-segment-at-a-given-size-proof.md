* Let the line `$AD$`, equal to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$C$`, have been placed at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` [[Prop. 1.2]][bookofproofs$732].
* And let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$DEF$` have been drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$A$` and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$AD$` [ [Post. 3] ][bookofproofs$694].
* And since [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$DEF$`, `$AE$` is equal to `$AD$` [ [Def. 1.15] ][bookofproofs$690].
* But, `$C$` is also equal to `$AD$`.
* Thus, `$AE$` and `$C$` are each equal to `$AD$`.
* So `$AE$` is also equal to `$C$` [ [C.N. 1] ][bookofproofs$6420].
* Thus, for two given unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$` and `$C$`, the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AE$`, equal to the lesser `$C$`, has been cut off from the greater `$AB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
