### (Proposition 3 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> For two given unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], to cut off from the greater a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] equal to the lesser.

* Let `$AB$` and `$C$` be the two given unequal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], of which let the greater be `$AB$`.
* So it is required to cut off a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] equal to the lesser `$C$` from the greater `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

Given two arbitrary [segments][bookofproofs$645] in the [plane][bookofproofs$647], which are not [congruent][bookofproofs$2781], it is possible to cut the segment with bigger [length][bookofproofs$645] such that one of its two subsegments is [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] to the smaller segment.
