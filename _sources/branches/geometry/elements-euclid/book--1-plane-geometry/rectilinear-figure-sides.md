> **Rectilinear figures** are those ([figures][bookofproofs$6427]) contained by [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]: **trilateral figures** being those contained by three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645],  **quadrilateral** by four, and **multilateral** by more than four.

### Modern Definition 

A *n-sided figure* (or a **rectilinear figure**) is a figure given by a [finite][bookofproofs$985] number `\(n\ge 3\)` of [segments][bookofproofs$645] `\(\overline{A_1B_1},\overline{A_2B_2},\ldots,\overline{A_nB_n}\)`, also called its **sides**, in such a way that 

1. `\(A_1=B_2, A_2=B_3, \ldots, A_{n-1}=B_n,A_{n}=B_1\)`, and that 
1. all sides do not have any other [points][bookofproofs$631] in common except their endpoints,  and 
1. each endpoint is the endpoint of exactly two sides.

We denote n-sided figures beginning with an arbitrary point and listing all points counter-clockwise. 

### Example 

An 11-sided figure `\( B A K J I H G F E D C \)`:
