The **altitude** of a [triangle][bookofproofs$688] is the [perpendicular segment][bookofproofs$653] from the triangle's base to the base's opposing vertex.


### Examples

In the following two triangles, the segment `\(\overline{AD}\)` is perpendicular to the line `\(\overline{BC}\)` and denotes the altitude.
