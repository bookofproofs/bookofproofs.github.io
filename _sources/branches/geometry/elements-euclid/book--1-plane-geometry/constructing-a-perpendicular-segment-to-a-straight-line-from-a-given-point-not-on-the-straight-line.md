### Euclid's Formulation

> To draw a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] perpendicular to a given infinite [straight line][bookofproofs$645] from a given [point][bookofproofs$631] which is not on it.

* Let `$AB$` be the given infinite [straight line][bookofproofs$645] and `$C$` the given [point][bookofproofs$631], which is not on ($AB$).
* So it is required to draw a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the given infinite [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` from the given [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, which is not on ($AB$).

### Modern Formulation 

Given an arbitrary straight line `$AB$` and an arbitrary point `$C$` not on the line, we may construct a perpendicular segment `$\overline{CH}$` from the point to the line.
