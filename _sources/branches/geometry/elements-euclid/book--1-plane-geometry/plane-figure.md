> A **plane figure** is that which is contained by some [boundary][bookofproofs$907] or [boundaries][bookofproofs$907].

### Modern Definition

A **plane figure** or just **figure** is a part of a [plane][bookofproofs$647] enclosed by [simple closed curve][bookofproofs$1211]. The curve divides the plane into two parts, called the **interior** and the **exterior** of the figure. 

### Example

A figure with its interior and exterior:
