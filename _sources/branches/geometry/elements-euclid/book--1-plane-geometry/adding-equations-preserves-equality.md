### (Common Notion 2 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> __And if equal things are added to equal things then the wholes are equal.__

### Modern Formulation

see[^1] [addition of real numbers is cancellative][bookofproofs$1574].
[^1]: In modern mathematics, the Euclidean space `\(\mathbb R^n\)` [constitutes a normed vector space][bookofproofs$1206]. In Euclid's "Elements", the set of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] is represented by the measures of geometrical objects like the lengths of segments, the magnitudes of angles, the areas of plane figures, the volumes of solids, etc.
