### (Proposition 33 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> [Straight-lines][bookofproofs$645] joining equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) on the same sides are themselves also equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788].

* Let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]), and let the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` and `$BD$` join them on the same sides.
* I say that `$AC$` and `$BD$` are also equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788].

### Modern Formulation

Let `\(\overline{AB}\)`, `\(\overline{CD}\)` be two equal parallel segments. Then the segments joining their adjacent endpoints, (`\(\overline{AC}, \overline{BD}\)`) are themselves parallel and equal in length: `\(\overline{AC}=\overline{BD}\)` and `\(\overline{AC}\parallel\overline{BD}\)`. In other words, the quadrilateral `\({ABCD}\)` forms a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$907].
