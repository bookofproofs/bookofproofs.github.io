> And a **semicircle** is the [plane figure][bookofproofs$6427] contained by the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] and the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] cut off by it. And the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the semicircle is the same ([point][bookofproofs$631]) as (the center of) the [circle][bookofproofs$690].


### Modern Definition

Euclid's definition corresponds to today's formulation. 

### Example

A semicircle is the colored plane figure enclosed by the diameter `\(\overline{CB}\)` with the center at the point `\(A\)`.
