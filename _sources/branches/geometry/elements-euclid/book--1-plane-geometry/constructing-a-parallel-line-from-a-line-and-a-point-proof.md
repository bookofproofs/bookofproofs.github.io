* Let the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` have been taken a random on `$BC$`, and let `$AD$` have been joined.
* And let (angle) `$DAE$`, equal to angle `$ADC$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$DA$` at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` on it [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* And let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AF$` have been produced in a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] with `$EA$`.
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AD$`, (in) falling across the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$` and `$EF$`, has made the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$EAD$` and `$ADC$` equal to one another, `$EAF$` is thus [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.27]][bookofproofs$911].
* Thus, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EAF$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`, through the given [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
