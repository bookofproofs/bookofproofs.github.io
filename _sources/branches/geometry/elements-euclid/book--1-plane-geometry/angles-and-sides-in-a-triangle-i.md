### (Proposition 18 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], the greater side subtends the greater angle.
* For let `$ABC$` be a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] having side `$AC$` greater than `$AB$`.
* I say that angle `$ABC$` is also greater than `$BCA$`.

### Modern Formulation

In a given triangle `\(\triangle{ABC}\)` with the side `\(\overline{AC}\)` longer than `\(\overline{AB}\)`, the angle `\(\angle{ABC}\)` opposite to the longer side is greater than the angle `\(\angle{BCA}\)` opposite to the shorter side.
