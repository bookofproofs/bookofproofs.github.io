### (Proposition 28 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] falling across two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] makes the external angle equal to the internal and opposite angle on the same side, or (makes) the (sum of the) internal ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) on the same side equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653], then the (two) [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] will be [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one another.

* For let `$EF$`, falling across the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$CD$`, make the external angle `$EGB$` equal to the internal and opposite angle `$GHD$`, or the (sum of the) internal ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) on the same side, `$BGH$` and `$GHD$`, equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* I say that `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$`.

### Modern Formulation

If a straight line `\(EF\)` intersects two straight lines `\(AB\)`, `\(CD\)` at one and only point point each such that the [exterior angle][bookofproofs$910] `\(\angle{BGE}\)` equals its corresponding interior angle `\(\angle{DHG}\)` or if it makes two interior angles on the same side `\(\angle{HGB}, \angle{DHG}\)` equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653], then the two lines are [parallel][bookofproofs$788] `\((AB\parallel CD)\)`.

Tha angles `\(\angle{BGE}\)` and `\(\angle{DHG}\)`  are called **corresponding angles**.
