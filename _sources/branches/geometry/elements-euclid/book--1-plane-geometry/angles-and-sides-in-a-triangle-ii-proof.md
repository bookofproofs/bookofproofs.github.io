* For if not, `$AC$` is certainly either equal to, or less than, `$AB$`.
* In fact, `$AC$` is not equal to `$AB$`.
* For then angle `$ABC$` would also have been equal to `$ACB$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* But it is not.
* Thus, `$AC$` is not equal to `$AB$`.
* Neither, indeed, is `$AC$` less than `$AB$`.
* For then angle `$ABC$` would also have been less than `$ACB$` [[Prop. 1.18]][bookofproofs$791].
* But it is not.
* Thus, `$AC$` is not less than `$AB$`.
* But it was shown that ($AC$) is not equal (to `$AB$`) either.
* Thus, `$AC$` is greater than `$AB$`.
* Thus, in any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], the greater angle is subtended by the greater side.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
