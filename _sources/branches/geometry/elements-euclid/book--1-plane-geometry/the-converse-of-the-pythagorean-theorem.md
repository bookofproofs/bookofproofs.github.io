### (Proposition 48 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If the [square][bookofproofs$909] on one of the sides of a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] is equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the two remaining sides of the triangle then the [angle][bookofproofs$650] contained by the two remaining sides of the triangle is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* For let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on one of the sides, `$BC$`, of triangle `$ABC$` be equal to the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the sides `$BA$` and `$AC$`.
* I say that angle `$BAC$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].

### Modern Formulation

If the square on one side (`\(\overline{BC}\)`) of a triangle (`\(\triangle{ABC}\)`) equals the sum of the squares on the remaining sides (`\(\overline{BA}\)`, `\(\overline{AC}\)`), then the angle (`\(\angle{CAB}\)`) opposite to that side is a right angle.
