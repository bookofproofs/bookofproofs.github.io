### (Proposition 21 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two internal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are constructed on one of the sides of a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], from its ends, the constructed ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) will be less than the two remaining sides of the triangle, but will encompass a greater [angle][bookofproofs$650].

* For let the two internal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$` and `$DC$` have been constructed on one of the sides `$BC$` of the triangle `$ABC$`, from its ends `$B$` and `$C$` (respectively).
* I say that `$BD$` and `$DC$` are less than the (sum of the) two remaining sides of the triangle `$BA$` and `$AC$`, but encompass an [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BDC$` greater than `$BAC$`.

### Modern Formulation

In an arbitrary triangle `\(\triangle{ABC}\)`, if two segments are constructed from the vertexes of its base to a point within the triangle, then:

* The sum of these inner sides will be less than the sum of the outer sides excluding the base: `$\overline{AB}+\overline{AC} > \overline{DB}+\overline{DC}.$`
* These inner sides will contain a greater angle than the corresponding sides of the outer triangle: `$\angle{BDC} > \angle{BAC}.$`
