### Euclid's Formulation

> In any [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], (if) one of the sides (is) produced (then) the external angle is equal to the (sum of the) two internal and opposite ([angles][bookofproofs$650]), and the (sum of the) three internal [angles][bookofproofs$650] of the triangle is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Let `$ABC$` be a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], and let one of its sides `$BC$` have been produced to `$D$`.
* I say that the external angle `$ACD$` is equal to the (sum of the) two internal and opposite [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$CAB$` and `$ABC$`, and the (sum of the) three internal [angles][bookofproofs$650] of the triangle - `$ABC$`, `$BCA$`, and `$CAB$` - is equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].

### Modern Formulation

In any triangle `\(\triangle{ABC}\)` in a plane, the sum of its angles equals `$\angle{ACB}+\angle{BAC}+\angle{CBA}=180^\circ.$` Moreover, if one of the sides is extended (without loss of generality extend segment `\(BC\)` to segment `\(BD\)`), then the exterior angle equals the sum of the its interior and opposite angles: `$\angle{DCA}=\angle{BAC}+\angle{CBA}.$`
