### (Proposition 40 from Book 1 of Euclid's “Elements”)[^1]

> Equal [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] which are on equal bases, and on the same side, are also between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788].
* Let `$ABC$` and `$CDE$` be equal [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] on the equal bases `$BC$` and `$CE$` (respectively), and on the same side (of `$BE$`).
* I say that they are also between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788].

### Modern Formulation

Triangles which are equal in area (`\(\triangle{ABC}=\triangle{DCE}\)`) as well as stand on equal bases (`\(\overline{BC}\)`, `\(\overline{CE}\)`) and on the same side of their bases stand on the same parallels (`\(\overline{AD}\parallel\overline{BE}\)`).

[^1]: This whole proposition is regarded by Heiberg as a relatively early interpolation to the original text (translator's note).
