### (Proposition 20 from Book 9 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> The (set of all) [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704] is more numerous than any assigned multitude of [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704].
* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` be the assigned [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704].
* I say that the (set of all) [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704] is more numerous than `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
