* For let `$A$` be the least number measured by the [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704] `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`.
* I say that `$A$` will not be measured by any other [prime number][bookofproofs$704] except (one of) `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`.

* For, if possible, let it be measured by the [prime (number) ][bookofproofs$704] `$E$`.
* And let `$E$` not be the same as one of `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`.
* And since `$E$` measures `$A$`, let it measure it according to `$F$`.
* Thus, `$E$` has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`.
* And `$A$` is measured by the [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704] `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`.
* And if two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] make some (number by) [multiplying one another][bookofproofs$6437], and some [prime number][bookofproofs$704] measures the number created from them, then (the [prime number][bookofproofs$704]) will also measure one of the original ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) [[Prop. 7.30]][bookofproofs$805].
* Thus, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` will measure one of `$E$`, `$F$`.
* In fact, they do not measure `$E$`.
* For `$E$` is prime, and not the same as one of `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`.
* Thus, they (all) measure `$F$`, which is less than `$A$`.
* The very thing (is) [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* For `$A$` was assumed (to be) the least (number) measured by `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`.
* Thus, no [prime number][bookofproofs$704] can measure `$A$` except (one of) `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
