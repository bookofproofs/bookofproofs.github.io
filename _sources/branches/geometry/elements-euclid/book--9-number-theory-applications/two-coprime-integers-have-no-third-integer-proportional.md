### (Proposition 16 from Book 9 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] then as the first is to the second, so the second (will) not (be) to some other (number).
* For let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$` and `$B$` be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* I say that as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$B$` is not to some other (number).
