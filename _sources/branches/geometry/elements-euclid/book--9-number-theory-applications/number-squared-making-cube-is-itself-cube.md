### Euclid's Formulation

> If a [number][bookofproofs$2315] makes a cube (number by) multiplying itself then it itself will also be [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* For let the number `$A$` make the [cube (number) ][bookofproofs$2327] `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* I say that `$A$` is also [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
