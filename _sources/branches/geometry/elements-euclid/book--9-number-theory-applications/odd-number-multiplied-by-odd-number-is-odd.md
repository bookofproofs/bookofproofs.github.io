### (Proposition 29 from Book 9 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If an [odd number][bookofproofs$2318] makes some (number by) multiplying an [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318] then the created (number) will be odd.
* For let the [odd number][bookofproofs$2318] `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] the [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318] `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` is odd.
