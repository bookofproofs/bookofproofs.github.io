* For let the [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318] `$BC$` have been subtracted from the [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318] `$AB$`.
* I say that the remainder `$CA$` is even.

* For since `$AB$` is odd, let the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$BD$` have been subtracted (from it).
* Thus, the remainder `$AD$` is even [ [Def. 7.7] ][bookofproofs$2318].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$CD$` is also even.
* And hence the remainder `$CA$` is even [[Prop. 9.24]][bookofproofs$2069].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
