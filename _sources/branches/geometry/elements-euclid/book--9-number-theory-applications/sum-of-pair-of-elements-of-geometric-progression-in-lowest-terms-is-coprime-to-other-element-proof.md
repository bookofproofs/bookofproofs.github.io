* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` be three [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] (which are) the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.
* I say that two of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` added together in any way are [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the remaining (one), (that is) `$A$` and `$B$` (prime) to `$C$`, `$B$` and `$C$` to `$A$`, and, further, `$A$` and `$C$` to `$B$`.

* Let the two least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$DE$` and `$EF$`, having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, have been taken [[Prop. 8.2]][bookofproofs$2021].
* So it is clear that `$DE$` has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$EF$`, and, further, `$EF$` has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself [[Prop. 8.2]][bookofproofs$2021].
* And since `$DE$`, `$EF$` are the least (of those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them), they are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 7.22]][bookofproofs$2352].
* And if two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] then the sum (of them) is also [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] each [[Prop. 7.28]][bookofproofs$2358].
* Thus, `$DF$` is also [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] each of `$DE$`, `$EF$`.
* But, in fact, `$DE$` is also [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$EF$`.
* Thus, `$DF$`, `$DE$` are (both) [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$EF$`.
* And if two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are (both) [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] some number then the (number) created from (multiplying) them is also [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the remaining (number) [[Prop. 7.24]][bookofproofs$2354].
* Hence, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$FD$`, `$DE$` is [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$EF$`.
* Hence, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$FD$`, `$DE$` is also [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` [[Prop. 7.25]][bookofproofs$2355].
* For if two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] then the (number) created from (squaring) one of them is [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the remaining (number).] But the (number created) from (multiplying) `$FD$`, `$DE$` is the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DE$` plus the (number created) from (multiplying) `$DE$`, `$EF$` [[Prop. 2.3]][bookofproofs$2060].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DE$` plus the (number created) from (multiplying) `$DE$`, `$EF$` is [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DE$` is `$A$`, and the (number created) from (multiplying) `$DE$`, `$EF$` (is) `$B$`, and the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) `$C$`.
* Thus, `$A$`, `$B$` summed is [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$C$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that `$B$`, `$C$` (summed) is also [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$A$`.
* So I say that `$A$`, `$C$` (summed) is also [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$B$`.
* For since `$DF$` is [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] each of `$DE$`, `$EF$` then the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DF$` is also [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the (number created) from (multiplying) `$DE$`, `$EF$` [[Prop. 7.25]][bookofproofs$2355].
* But, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$DE$`, `$EF$` plus twice the (number created) from (multiplying) `$DE$`, `$EF$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DF$` [[Prop. 2.4]][bookofproofs$1017].
* And thus the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$DE$`, `$EF$` plus twice the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DE$`, `$EF$` [is] [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DE$`, `$EF$`.
* By [separation][bookofproofs$1954], the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$DE$`, `$EF$` plus once the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DE$`, `$EF$` is [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DE$`, `$EF$`.[^1] 
* Again, by [separation][bookofproofs$1954], the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$DE$`, `$EF$` is [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DE$`, `$EF$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DE$` is `$A$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DE$`, `$EF$` (is) `$B$`, and the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` (is) `$C$`.
* Thus, `$A$`, `$C$` summed is [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$B$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: Since if `$ab$` measures `$a^2+b^2+2\,a\,b$` then it also measures `$a^2+b^2+a\,b$`, and vice versa (translator's note).
