### Euclid's Formulation

> If an [even (number) ][bookofproofs$2317] is subtracted from an [odd number][bookofproofs$2318] then the remainder will be odd.

* For let the [even (number) ][bookofproofs$2317] `$BC$` have been subtracted from the [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318] `$AB$`.
* I say that the remainder `$CA$` is odd.
