* For let the [even (number) ][bookofproofs$2317] `$BC$` have been subtracted from the [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318] `$AB$`.
* I say that the remainder `$CA$` is odd.

* For let the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$AD$` have been subtracted (from `$AB$`).
* `$DB$` is thus even [ [Def. 7.7] ][bookofproofs$2318].
* And `$BC$` is also even.
* Thus, the remainder `$CD$` is also even [[Prop. 9.24]][bookofproofs$2069].
* `$CA$` (is) thus odd [ [Def. 7.7] ][bookofproofs$2318].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
