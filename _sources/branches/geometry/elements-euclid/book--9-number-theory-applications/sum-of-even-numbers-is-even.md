### (Proposition 21 from Book 9 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If any multitude whatsoever of even [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] is added together then the whole is even.
* For let any multitude whatsoever of even [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, `$DE$`, lie together.
* I say that the whole, `$AE$`, is even.
