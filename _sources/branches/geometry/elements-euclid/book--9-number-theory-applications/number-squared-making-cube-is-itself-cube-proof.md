* For let the number `$A$` make the [cube (number) ][bookofproofs$2327] `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* I say that `$A$` is also [cube][bookofproofs$2327].

* For let `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* Therefore, since `$A$` has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`, `$C$` is thus cube.
* And since `$A$` has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, `$A$` thus measures `$B$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in ($A$).
* And a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] also measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it.
* Thus, as a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] is to `$A$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$`.
* And since `$A$` has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`, `$B$` thus measures `$C$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$A$`.
* And a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] also measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it.
* Thus, as a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] is to `$A$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$C$`.
* But, as a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] (is) to `$A$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$`.
* And thus as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, (so) `$B$` (is) to `$C$`.
* And since `$B$` and `$C$` are cube, they are [similar solid (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329].
* Thus, there exist two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] (between) `$B$` and `$C$` [[Prop. 8.19]][bookofproofs$2038].
* And as `$B$` is to `$C$`, (so) `$A$` (is) to `$B$`.
* Thus, there also exist two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] (between) `$A$` and `$B$` [[Prop. 8.8]][bookofproofs$2027].
* And `$B$` is [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* Thus, `$A$` is also [cube][bookofproofs$2327] [[Prop. 8.23]][bookofproofs$2042].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
