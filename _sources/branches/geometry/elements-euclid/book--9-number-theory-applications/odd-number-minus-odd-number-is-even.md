### Euclid's Formulation

> If an [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318] is subtracted from an [odd number][bookofproofs$2318] then the remainder will be even.
* For let the [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318] `$BC$` have been subtracted from the [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318] `$AB$`.
* I say that the remainder `$CA$` is even.
