* For let the [odd number][bookofproofs$2318] `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] the [even (number) ][bookofproofs$2317] `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` is even.

* For since `$A$` has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`, `$C$` is thus composed out of so many (magnitudes) equal to `$B$`, as many as (there) are [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$A$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* And `$B$` is even.
* Thus, `$C$` is composed out of even ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]).
* And if any multitude whatsoever of even [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] is added together then the whole is even [[Prop. 9.21]][bookofproofs$2066].
* Thus, `$C$` is even.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
