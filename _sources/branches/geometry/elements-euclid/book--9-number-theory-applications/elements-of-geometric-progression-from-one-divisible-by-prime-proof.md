* Let any multitude whatsoever of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, be in [ (continued) proportion][bookofproofs$6552], (starting) from a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* I say that however many [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704] `$D$` is measured by, `$A$` will also be measured by the same ([prime numbers][bookofproofs$704]).

* For let `$D$` be measured by some [prime number][bookofproofs$704] `$E$`.
* I say that `$E$` measures `$A$`.
* For (suppose it does) not.
* `$E$` is prime, and every [prime number][bookofproofs$704] is [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] every number which it does not measure [[Prop. 7.29]][bookofproofs$2359].
* Thus, `$E$` and `$A$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* And since `$E$` measures `$D$`, let it measure it according to `$F$`.
* Thus, `$E$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`.
* Again, since `$A$` measures `$D$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$C$` [ [Prop. 9.11 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6457], `$A$` has thus made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`.
* But, in fact, `$E$` has also made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$`, `$C$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$E$`, `$F$`.
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$E$`, (so) `$F$` (is) to `$C$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And `$A$` and `$E$` (are) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]), and ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288] are) also the least (of those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them) [[Prop. 7.21]][bookofproofs$2351], and the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them an equal number of times, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$C$`.
* Let it measure it according to `$G$`.
* Thus, `$E$` has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$G$`.
* But, in fact, via the (proposition) before this, `$A$` has also made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$` [ [Prop. 9.11 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6457].
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$`, `$B$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$E$`, `$G$`.
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$E$`, (so) `$G$` (is) to `$B$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And `$A$` and `$E$` (are) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]), and ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288] are) also the least (of those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them) [[Prop. 7.21]][bookofproofs$2351], and the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them an equal number of times, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$B$`.
* Let it measure it according to `$H$`.
* Thus, `$E$` has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$H$`.
* But, in fact, `$A$` has also made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself [[Prop. 9.8]][bookofproofs$2054].
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$E$`, `$H$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`.
* Thus, as `$E$` is to `$A$`, (so) `$A$` (is) to `$H$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And `$A$` and `$E$` are [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]), and ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288] are) also the least (of those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them) [[Prop. 7.21]][bookofproofs$2351], and the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them an equal number of times, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$A$`, as the leading (measuring the) leading.
* But, in fact, ($E$) also does not measure ($A$).
* The very thing (is) [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$E$` and `$A$` are not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* Thus, (they are) composite (to one another).
* And ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) composite (to one another) are (both) measured by some [prime] number [ [Def. 7.14] ][bookofproofs$2322].
* And since `$E$` is assumed (to be) prime, and a [prime (number) ][bookofproofs$704] is not measured by another [number][bookofproofs$2315] (other) than itself [ [Def. 7.11] ][bookofproofs$704], `$E$` thus measures (both) `$A$` and `$E$`.
* Hence, `$E$` measures `$A$`.
* And it also measures `$D$`.
* Thus, `$E$` measures (both) `$A$` and `$D$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that however many [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704] `$D$` is measured by, `$A$` will also be measured by the same ([prime numbers][bookofproofs$704]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
