* For let the [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] `$A$` make the [cube (number) ][bookofproofs$2327] `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] some number `$B$`.
* I say that `$B$` is [cube][bookofproofs$2327].

* For let `$A$` make `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* `$D$` is thus cube [[Prop. 9.3]][bookofproofs$2049].
* And since `$A$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`, thus as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$C$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And since `$D$` and `$C$` are (both) cube, they are [similar solid (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329].
* Thus, two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] fall (between) `$D$` and `$C$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] [[Prop. 8.19]][bookofproofs$2038].
* And as `$D$` is to `$C$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$`.
* Thus, two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] also fall (between) `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] [[Prop. 8.8]][bookofproofs$2027].
* And `$A$` is [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* Thus, `$B$` is also [cube][bookofproofs$2327] [[Prop. 8.23]][bookofproofs$2042].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
