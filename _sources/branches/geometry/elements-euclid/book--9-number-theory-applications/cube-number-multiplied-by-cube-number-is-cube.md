### Euclid's Formulation

> If a [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] makes some (number by) multiplying a(nother) [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] then the created (number) will be [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* For let the [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] the [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` is [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
