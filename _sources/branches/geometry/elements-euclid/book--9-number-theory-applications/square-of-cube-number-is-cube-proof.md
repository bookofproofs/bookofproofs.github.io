* For let the [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] `$A$` make `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* I say that `$B$` is [cube][bookofproofs$2327].

* For let the side `$C$` of `$A$` have been taken.
* And let `$C$` make `$D$` [by multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* So it is clear that `$C$` has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`.
* And since `$C$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, `$C$` thus measures `$D$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* But, in fact, a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] also measures `$C$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, as a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] is to `$C$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* Again, since `$C$` has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`, `$D$` thus measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$C$`.
* And a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] also measures `$C$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it.
* Thus, as a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] is to `$C$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$A$`.
* But, as a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] (is) to `$C$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* And thus as a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] (is) to `$C$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, and `$D$` to `$A$`.
* Thus, two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$C$` and `$D$`, have fallen (between) a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] and the number `$A$` in continued [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453].
* Again, since `$A$` has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, `$A$` thus measures `$B$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it.
* And a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] also measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it.
* Thus, as a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] is to `$A$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$`.
* And two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] have fallen (between) a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] and `$A$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453].
* Thus two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] will also fall (between) `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] [[Prop. 8.8]][bookofproofs$2027].
* And if two ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) fall (between) two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453], and the first (number) is [cube][bookofproofs$2327], then the second will also be [cube][bookofproofs$2327] [[Prop. 8.23]][bookofproofs$2042].
* And `$A$` is [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* Thus, `$B$` is also [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
