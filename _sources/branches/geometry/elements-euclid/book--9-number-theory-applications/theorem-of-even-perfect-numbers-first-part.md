### (Proposition 36 from Book 9 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If any multitude whatsoever of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] is set out continuously in a double proportion, (starting) from a [unit][bookofproofs$2314], until the whole sum added together becomes prime, and the sum multiplied into the last (number) makes some (number), then the (number so) created will be [perfect][bookofproofs$2330].
* For let any multitude of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, be set out (continuouly) in a double proportion, until the whole sum added together is made prime.

* And let `$E$` be equal to the sum.
* And let `$E$` make `$FG$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`.
* I say that `$FG$` is a [perfect (number) ][bookofproofs$2330].
### Historical Notes

* The ancient Greeks knew of four [perfect numbers][bookofproofs$2330]: 6, 28, 496, and 8128, which correspond to `$n= 2$`, 3, 5, and 7, respectively.

### Modern Formulation
