### Euclid's Formulation

> If two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] make a [square][bookofproofs$2326] (number by) [multiplying one another][bookofproofs$6437] then they are [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329].

* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], and let `$A$` make the [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* I say that `$A$` and `$B$` are [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329].
