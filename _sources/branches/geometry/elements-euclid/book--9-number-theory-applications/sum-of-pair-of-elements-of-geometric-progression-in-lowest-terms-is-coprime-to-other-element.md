### (Proposition 15 from Book 9 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If three [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them then two (of them) added together in any way are [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the remaining (one).
* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` be three [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] (which are) the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.
* I say that two of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` added together in any way are [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the remaining (one), (that is) `$A$` and `$B$` (prime) to `$C$`, `$B$` and `$C$` to `$A$`, and, further, `$A$` and `$C$` to `$B$`.
