### (Proposition 3 from Book 9 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] makes some (number by) multiplying itself then the created (number) will be [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* For let the [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] `$A$` make `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* I say that `$B$` is [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
