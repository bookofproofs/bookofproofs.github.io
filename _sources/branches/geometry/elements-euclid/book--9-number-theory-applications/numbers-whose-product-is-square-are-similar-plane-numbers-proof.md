* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], and let `$A$` make the [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* I say that `$A$` and `$B$` are [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329].

* For let `$A$` make `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* Thus, `$D$` is [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* And since `$A$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`, thus as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$C$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And since `$D$` is [square][bookofproofs$2326], and `$C$` (is) also, `$D$` and `$C$` are thus [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329].
* Thus, one (number) falls (between) `$D$` and `$C$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] [[Prop. 8.18]][bookofproofs$2037].
* And as `$D$` is to `$C$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$`.
* Thus, one (number) also falls (between) `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] [[Prop. 8.8]][bookofproofs$2027].
* And if one (number) falls (between) two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] then [the] [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are [similar plane (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329] [[Prop. 8.20]][bookofproofs$2039].
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` are [similar plane (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
