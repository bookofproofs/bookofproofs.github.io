### (Proposition 23 from Book 9 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If any multitude whatsoever of odd [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] is added together, and the multitude of them is odd, then the whole will also be odd.
* For let any multitude whatsoever of odd [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, lie together, and let the multitude of them be odd.
* I say that the whole, `$AD$`, is also odd.
