* For let the [odd number][bookofproofs$2318] `$A$` measure the [even (number) ][bookofproofs$2317] `$B$`.
* I say that ($A$) will also measure (one) half of ($B$).

* For since `$A$` measures `$B$`, let it measure it according to `$C$`.
* I say that `$C$` is not odd.
* For, if possible, let it be (odd).
* And since `$A$` measures `$B$` according to `$C$`, `$A$` has thus made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`.
* Thus, `$B$` is composed out of odd [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], (and) the multitude of them is odd.
* `$B$` is thus odd [[Prop. 9.23]][bookofproofs$2068].
* The very thing (is) [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* For ($B$) was assumed (to be) even.
* Thus, `$C$` is not odd.
* Thus, `$C$` is even.
* Hence, `$A$` measures `$B$` an [even number][bookofproofs$2317] of times.
* So, on account of this, ($A$) will also measure (one) half of ($B$).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
