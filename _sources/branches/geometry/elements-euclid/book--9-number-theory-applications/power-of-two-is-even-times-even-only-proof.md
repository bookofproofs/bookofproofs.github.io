* For let any multitude of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] whatsoever, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, have been (continually) doubled, (starting) from the dyad `$A$`.
* I say that `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` are [even-times-even][bookofproofs$2319] ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) only.

* In fact, (it is) clear that each [of `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`] is an [even-times-even][bookofproofs$2319] (number).
* For it is doubled from a dyad [ [Def. 7.8] ][bookofproofs$2319].
* I also say that (they are [even-times-even][bookofproofs$2319] [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) only.
* For let a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] be laid down.
* Therefore, since any multitude of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] whatsoever are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], starting from a [unit][bookofproofs$2314], and the (number) `$A$` after the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] is prime, the greatest of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, (namely) `$D$`, will not be measured by any other ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) except `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` [[Prop. 9.13]][bookofproofs$2059].
* And each of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` is even.
* Thus, `$D$` is an [even-times-even (number) ][bookofproofs$2319] only [ [Def. 7.8] ][bookofproofs$2319].
* So, similarly, we can show that each of `$B$`, `$C$` is [also] an [even-times-even (number) ][bookofproofs$2319] only.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
