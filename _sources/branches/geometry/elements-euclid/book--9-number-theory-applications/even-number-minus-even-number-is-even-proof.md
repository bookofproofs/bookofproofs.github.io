* For let the [even (number) ][bookofproofs$2317] `$BC$` have been subtracted from the [even number][bookofproofs$2317] `$AB$`.
* I say that the remainder `$CA$` is even.

* For since `$AB$` is even, it has a half [part][bookofproofs$703] [ [Def. 7.6] ][bookofproofs$2317].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$BC$` also has a half [part][bookofproofs$703].
* And hence the remainder [$CA$ has a half [part][bookofproofs$703]].
* Thus, `$AC$` is even.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
