* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` be the three given [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
* And let it be required to investigate when it is possible to find a fourth (number) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to them.

* In fact, ($A$, `$B$`, `$C$`) are either not in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] and the outermost of them are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], or are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] and the outermost of them are not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], or are neither in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] nor are the outermost of them [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], or are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] and the outermost of them are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* In fact, if `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and the outermost of them, `$A$` and `$C$`, are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], (then) it has (already) been shown that it is impossible to find a fourth number [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to them [[Prop. 9.17]][bookofproofs$2063].
* So let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` not be in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], (with) the outermost of them again being [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* I say that, in this case, it is also impossible to find a fourth (number) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to them.
* For, if possible, let it have been found, (and let it be) `$D$`.
* Hence, it will be that as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, (so) `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* And let it be contrived that as `$B$` (is) to `$C$`, (so) `$D$` (is) to `$E$`.
* And since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, (so) `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, and as `$B$` (is) to `$C$`, (so) `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$A$` (is) to `$C$`, (so) `$C$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 7.14]][bookofproofs$2344].
* And `$A$` and `$C$` (are) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]).
* And ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288] are) also the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them) [[Prop. 7.21]][bookofproofs$2351].
* And the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) measure those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them (the same number of times), the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$A$` measures `$C$`, (as) the leading (measuring) the leading.
* And it also measures itself.
* Thus, `$A$` measures `$A$` and `$C$`, which are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, it is not possible to find a fourth (number) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* And so let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` again be in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and let `$A$` and `$C$` not be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* I say that it is possible to find a fourth (number) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to them.
* For let `$B$` make `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`.
* Thus, `$A$` either measures or does not measure `$D$`.
* Let it, first of all, measure ($D$) according to `$E$`.
* Thus, `$A$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`.
* But, in fact, `$B$` has also made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$`, `$E$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$B$`, `$C$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as `$A$` [is] to `$B$`, (so) `$C$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* Thus, a fourth (number) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` has been found, (namely) `$E$`.
* And so let `$A$` not measure `$D$`.
* I say that it is impossible to find a fourth number [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* For, if possible, let it have been found, (and let it be) `$E$`.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$`, `$E$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$B$`, `$C$`.
* But, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$B$`, `$C$` is `$D$`.
* And thus the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$`, `$E$` is equal to `$D$`.
* Thus, `$A$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`.
* Thus, `$A$` measures `$D$` according to `$E$`.
* Hence, `$A$` measures `$D$`.
* But, it also does not measure ($D$).
* The very thing (is) [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, it is not possible to find a fourth number [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` when `$A$` does not measure `$D$`.
* And so (let) `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` (be) neither in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], nor (let) the outermost of them (be) [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* And let `$B$` make `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`.
* So, similarly, it can be show that if `$A$` measures `$D$` then it is possible to find a fourth (number) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to ($A$, `$B$`, `$C$`), and impossible if ($A$) does not measure ($D$).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: The proof of this proposition is incorrect.  There are, in fact, only two cases. Either `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], with `$A$` and `$C$` [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], or not. In the first case, it is impossible to find a fourth [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] number. In the second case, it is possible to find a fourth [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] number provided that `$A$` measures `$B$` times `$C$`. Of the four cases considered by Euclid, the proof given in the second case is incorrect, since it only demonstrates that if `$A/B=C/D$` then a [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$E$` cannot be found such that `$B/C=D/E$`. The proofs given in the other three cases are correct (translator's note).
