### (Proposition 31 from Book 9 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If an [odd number][bookofproofs$2318] is [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] some number then it will also be [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] its double.
* For let the [odd number][bookofproofs$2318] `$A$` be [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] some number `$B$`.
* And let `$C$` be double `$B$`.
* I say that `$A$` is [also] [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$C$`.
