### Euclid's Formulation

> If an [odd number][bookofproofs$2318] makes some (number by) multiplying an [even (number) ][bookofproofs$2317] then the created (number) will be even.
* For let the [odd number][bookofproofs$2318] `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] the [even (number) ][bookofproofs$2317] `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` is even.
