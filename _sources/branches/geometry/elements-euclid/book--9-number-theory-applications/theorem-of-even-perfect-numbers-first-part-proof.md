* For as many as is the multitude of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, let so many ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]), `$E$`, `$HK$`, `$L$`, `$M$`, have been taken in a double proportion, (starting) from `$E$`.
* Thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$A$` is to `$D$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$M$` [[Prop. 7.14]][bookofproofs$2344].
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$E, D$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$`, `$M$`.
* And `$FG$` is the (number created) from (multiplying) `$E$`, `$D$`.
* Thus, `$FG$` is also the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$`, `$M$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* Thus, `$A$` has made `$FG$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$M$`.
* Thus, `$M$` measures `$FG$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$A$`.
* And `$A$` is a dyad.
* Thus, `$FG$` is double `$M$`.
* And `$M$`, `$L$`, `$HK$`, `$E$` are also continuously double one another.
* Thus, `$E$`, `$HK$`, `$L$`, `$M$`, `$FG$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in a double proportion.
* So let `$HN$` and `$FO$`, each equal to the first (number) `$E$`, have been subtracted from the second (number) `$HK$` and the last `$FG$` (respectively).

* Thus, as the excess of the second number is to the first, so the excess of the last (is) to (the sum of) all those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) before it [[Prop. 9.35]][bookofproofs$1123].
* Thus, as `$NK$` is to `$E$`, so `$OG$` (is) to `$M$`, `$L$`, `$KH$`, `$E$`.
* And `$NK$` is equal to `$E$`.
* And thus `$OG$` is equal to `$M$`, `$L$`, `$HK$`, `$E$`.
* And `$FO$` is also equal to `$E$`, and `$E$` to `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, and a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* Thus, the whole of `$FG$` is equal to `$E$`, `$HK$`, `$L$`, `$M$`, and `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, and a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* And it is measured by them.
* I also say that `$FG$` will be measured by no other ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) except `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$`, `$HK$`, `$L$`, `$M$`, and a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* For, if possible, let some (number) `$P$` measure `$FG$`, and let `$P$` not be the same as any of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$`, `$HK$`, `$L$`, `$M$`.
* And as many times as `$P$` measures `$FG$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$Q$`.
* Thus, `$Q$` has made `$FG$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$P$`.
* But, in fact, `$E$` has also made `$FG$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`.
* Thus, as `$E$` is to `$Q$`, so `$P$` (is) to `$D$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And since `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` are continually [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], (starting) from a [unit][bookofproofs$2314], `$D$` will thus not be measured by any other [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] except `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` [[Prop. 9.13]][bookofproofs$2059].
* And `$P$` was assumed not (to be) the same as any of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* Thus, `$P$` does not measure `$D$`.
* But, as `$P$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$Q$`.
* Thus, `$E$` does not measure `$Q$` either [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* And `$E$` is a [prime (number) ][bookofproofs$704].
* And every [prime number][bookofproofs$704] [is] [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] every (number) which it does not measure [[Prop. 7.29]][bookofproofs$2359].
* Thus, `$E$` and `$Q$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* And ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288] are) also the least (of those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them) [[Prop. 7.21]][bookofproofs$2351], and the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them an equal number of times, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* And as `$E$` is to `$Q$`, (so) `$P$` (is) to `$D$`.
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$P$` the same number of times as `$Q$` (measures) `$D$`.
* And `$D$` is not measured by any other ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) except `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* Thus, `$Q$` is the same as one of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* Let it be the same as `$B$`.
* And as many as is the multitude of `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, let so many (of the set out [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) have been taken, (starting) from `$E$`, (namely) `$E$`, `$HK$`, `$L$`.
* And `$E$`, `$HK$`, `$L$` are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`.
* Thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$B$` (is) to `$D$`, (so) `$E$` (is) to `$L$` [[Prop. 7.14]][bookofproofs$2344].
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$B$`, `$L$` is equal to the (number created) from multiplying `$D$`, `$E$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* But, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$D$`, `$E$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$Q$`, `$P$`.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$Q$`, `$P$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$B$`, `$L$`.
* Thus, as `$Q$` is to `$B$`, (so) `$L$` (is) to `$P$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And `$Q$` is the same as `$B$`.
* Thus, `$L$` is also the same as `$P$`.
* The very thing (is) [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* For `$P$` was assumed not (to be) the same as any of the ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) set out.
* Thus, `$FG$` cannot be measured by any number except `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$`, `$HK$`, `$L$`, `$M$`, and a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* And `$FG$` was shown (to be) equal to (the sum of) `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$`, `$HK$`, `$L$`, `$M$`, and a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* And a [perfect number][bookofproofs$2330] is one which is equal to (the sum of) its own parts [ [Def. 7.22] ][bookofproofs$2330].
* Thus, `$FG$` is a [perfect (number) ][bookofproofs$2330].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
