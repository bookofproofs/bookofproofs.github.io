* For let the number `$A$` neither be (one) of the ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) doubled from a dyad, nor let it have an [odd][bookofproofs$2318] half.
* I say that `$A$` is (both) an [even-times-even][bookofproofs$2319] and an [even-times-odd][bookofproofs$2320] (number).

* In fact, (it is) clear that `$A$` is an [even-times-even][bookofproofs$2319] (number) [ [Def. 7.8] ][bookofproofs$2319].
* For it does not have an [odd][bookofproofs$2318] half.
* So I say that it is also an [even-times-odd][bookofproofs$2320] (number).
* For if we cut `$A$` in half, and (then cut) its half in half, and we do this continually, then we will arrive at some [odd number][bookofproofs$2318] which will measure `$A$` according to an [even number][bookofproofs$2317].
* For if not, we will arrive at a dyad, and `$A$` will be (one) of the ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) doubled from a dyad.
* The very opposite thing (was) assumed.
* Hence, `$A$` is an [even-times-odd][bookofproofs$2320] (number) [ [Def. 7.9] ][bookofproofs$2320].
* And it was also shown (to be) an [even-times-even][bookofproofs$2319] (number).
* Thus, `$A$` is (both) an [even-times-even][bookofproofs$2319] and an [even-times-odd][bookofproofs$2320] (number).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
