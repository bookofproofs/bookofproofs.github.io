* For let `$FK$` be made equal to `$BC$`, and `$FL$` to `$D$`.
* And since `$FK$` is equal to `$BC$`, of which `$FH$` is equal to `$BG$`, the remainder `$HK$` is thus equal to the remainder `$GC$`.
* And since as `$EF$` is to `$D$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$BC$`, and `$BC$` to `$A$` [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343], and `$D$` (is) equal to `$FL$`, and `$BC$` to `$FK$`, and `$A$` to `$FH$`, thus as `$EF$` is to `$FL$`, so `$LF$` (is) to `$FK$`, and `$FK$` to `$FH$`.
* By [separation][bookofproofs$1954], as `$EL$` (is) to `$LF$`, so `$LK$` (is) to `$FK$`, and `$KH$` to `$FH$` [[Prop. 7.11]][bookofproofs$2341], [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343].
* And thus as one of the leading ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) is to one of the following, so (the sum of) all of the leading ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] is) to (the sum of) all of the following [[Prop. 7.12]][bookofproofs$2342].
* Thus, as `$KH$` is to `$FH$`, so `$EL$`, `$LK$`, `$KH$` (are) to `$LF$`, `$FK$`, `$HF$`.
* And `$KH$` (is) equal to `$CG$`, and `$FH$` to `$A$`, and `$LF$`, `$FK$`, `$HF$` to `$D$`, `$BC$`, `$A$`.
* Thus, as `$CG$` is to `$A$`, so `$EH$` (is) to `$D$`, `$BC$`, `$A$`.
* Thus, as the excess of the second (number) is to the first, so the excess of the last (is) to (the sum of) all those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) before it.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
