### (Proposition 25 from Book 9 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If an [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318] is subtracted from an [even number][bookofproofs$2317] then the remainder will be odd.

* For let the [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318] `$BC$` have been subtracted from the [even number][bookofproofs$2317] `$AB$`.
* I say that the remainder `$CA$` is odd.
