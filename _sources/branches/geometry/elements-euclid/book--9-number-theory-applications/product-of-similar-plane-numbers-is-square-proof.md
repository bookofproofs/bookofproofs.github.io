* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329], and let `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` is [square][bookofproofs$2326].

* For let `$A$` make `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* `$D$` is thus square.
* Therefore, since `$A$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`, thus as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$C$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And since `$A$` and `$B$` are [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329], one [number][bookofproofs$2315] thus falls (between) `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] [[Prop. 8.18]][bookofproofs$2037].
* And if (some) [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] fall between two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] then, as many ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) as fall in (between) them (in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552]), so many also (fall) in (between [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] (as them in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552]) [[Prop. 8.8]][bookofproofs$2027].
* And hence one [number][bookofproofs$2315] falls (between) `$D$` and `$C$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453].
* And `$D$` is [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, `$C$` (is) also square [[Prop. 8.22]][bookofproofs$2041].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
