* Let any multitude whatsoever of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$`, `$F$`, be in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], (starting) from a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* And let the (number) after the [unit][bookofproofs$2314], `$A$`, be [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* I say that all the remaining ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) will also be [square][bookofproofs$2326].

* In fact, it has (already) been shown that the third (number) from the [unit][bookofproofs$2314], `$B$`, is [square][bookofproofs$2326], and all those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] after that) which leave an interval of one (number) [[Prop. 9.8]][bookofproofs$2054].
* So I say that all the remaining ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) are also [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* For since `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and `$A$` (is) [square][bookofproofs$2326], `$C$` is [thus] also [square][bookofproofs$2326] [[Prop. 8.22]][bookofproofs$2041].
* Again, since `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` are [also] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and `$B$` is [square][bookofproofs$2326], `$D$` is [thus] also [square][bookofproofs$2326] [[Prop. 8.22]][bookofproofs$2041].
* So, similarly, we can show that all the remaining ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) are also [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* And so let `$A$` be [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* I say that all the remaining ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) are also [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* In fact, it has (already) been shown that the fourth (number) from the [unit][bookofproofs$2314], `$C$`, is [cube][bookofproofs$2327], and all those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] after that) which leave an interval of two ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) [[Prop. 9.8]][bookofproofs$2054].
* So I say that all the remaining ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) are also [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* For since as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] is to `$A$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] thus measures `$A$` the same number of times as `$A$` (measures) `$B$`.
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it.
* Thus, `$A$` also measures `$B$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in ($A$).
* `$A$` has thus made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* And `$A$` is [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* And if a [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] makes some (number by) multiplying itself then the created (number) is [cube][bookofproofs$2327] [[Prop. 9.3]][bookofproofs$2049].
* Thus, `$B$` is also [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* And since the four [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and `$A$` is [cube][bookofproofs$2327], `$D$` is thus also [cube][bookofproofs$2327] [[Prop. 8.23]][bookofproofs$2042].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$E$` is also [cube][bookofproofs$2327], and, similarly, all the remaining ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) are [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
