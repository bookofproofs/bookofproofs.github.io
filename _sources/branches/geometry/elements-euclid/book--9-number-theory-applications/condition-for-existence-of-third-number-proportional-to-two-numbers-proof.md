* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be the two given [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
* And let it be required to investigate whether it is possible to find a third (number) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to them.

* So `$A$` and `$B$` are either [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], or not.
* And if they are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] then it has (already) been show that it is impossible to find a third (number) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to them [[Prop. 9.16]][bookofproofs$2062].
* And so let `$A$` and `$B$` not be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* And let `$B$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* So `$A$` either measures, or does not measure, `$C$`.
* Let it first of all measure ($C$) according to `$D$`.
* Thus, `$A$` has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`.
* But, in fact, `$B$` has also made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$`, `$D$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`.
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$B$`, (so) `$B$` (is) to `$D$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* Thus, a third number has been found [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to `$A$`, `$B$`, (namely) `$D$`.
* And so let `$A$` not measure `$C$`.
* I say that it is impossible to find a third number [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to `$A$`, `$B$`.
* For, if possible, let it have been found, (and let it be) `$D$`.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$`, `$D$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` is `$C$`.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$`, `$D$` is equal to `$C$`.
* Hence, `$A$` has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`.
* Thus, `$A$` measures `$C$` according to `$D$`.
* But ($A$) was, in fact, also assumed (to be) not measuring ($C$).
* The very thing (is) [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, it is not possible to find a third number [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to `$A$`, `$B$` when `$A$` does not measure `$C$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
