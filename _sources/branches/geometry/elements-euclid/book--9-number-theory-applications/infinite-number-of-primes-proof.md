* For let the least number measured by `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` have been taken, and let it be `$DE$` [[Prop. 7.36]][bookofproofs$2366].
* And let the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$DF$` have been added to `$DE$`.
* So `$EF$` is either prime, or not.
* Let it, first of all, be prime.
* Thus, the (set of) [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704] `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$EF$`, (which is) more numerous than `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, has been found.
* And so let `$EF$` not be prime.
* Thus, it is measured by some [prime number][bookofproofs$704] [[Prop. 7.31]][bookofproofs$798].
* Let it be measured by the [prime (number) ][bookofproofs$704] `$G$`.
* I say that `$G$` is not the same as any of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* For, if possible, let it be (the same).
* And `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` (all) measure `$DE$`.
* Thus, `$G$` will also measure `$DE$`.
* And it also measures `$EF$`.
* (So) `$G$` will also measure the remainder, [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$DF$`, (despite) being a [number][bookofproofs$2315] [[Prop. 7.28]][bookofproofs$2358].
* The very thing (is) [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$G$` is not the same as one of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* And it was assumed (to be) prime.
* Thus, the (set of) [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704] `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$G$`, (which is) more numerous than the assigned multitude (of [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704]), `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, has been found.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
