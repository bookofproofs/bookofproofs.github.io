### (Proposition 1 from Book 9 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329] make some (number by) [multiplying one another][bookofproofs$6437] then the created (number) will be [square][bookofproofs$2326].

* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329], and let `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` is [square][bookofproofs$2326].
