* For let any multitude whatsoever of odd [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, lie together, and let the multitude of them be odd.
* I say that the whole, `$AD$`, is also odd.

* For let the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$DE$` have been subtracted from `$CD$`.
* The remainder `$CE$` is thus even [ [Def. 7.7] ][bookofproofs$2318].
* And `$CA$` is also even [[Prop. 9.22]][bookofproofs$2067].
* Thus, the whole `$AE$` is also even [[Prop. 9.21]][bookofproofs$2066].
* And `$DE$` is a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* Thus, `$AD$` is odd [ [Def. 7.7] ][bookofproofs$2318].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
