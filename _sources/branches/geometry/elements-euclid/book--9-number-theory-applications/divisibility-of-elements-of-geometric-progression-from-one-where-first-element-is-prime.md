### Euclid's Formulation

> If any multitude whatsoever of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] is in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], (starting) from a [unit][bookofproofs$2314], and the (number) after the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] is prime, then the greatest (number) will be measured by no [other] ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) except ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) existing among the [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
* Let any multitude whatsoever of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, be in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], (starting) from a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* And let the (number) after the [unit][bookofproofs$2314], `$A$`, be prime.
* I say that the greatest of them, `$D$`, will be measured by no other ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) except `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
