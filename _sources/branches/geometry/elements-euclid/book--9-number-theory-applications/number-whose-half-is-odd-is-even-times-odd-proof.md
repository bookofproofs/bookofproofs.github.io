* For let the number `$A$` have an [odd][bookofproofs$2318] half.
* I say that `$A$` is an [even-times-odd][bookofproofs$2320] (number) only.

* In fact, (it is) clear that ($A$) is an [even-times-odd][bookofproofs$2320] (number).
* For its half, being odd, measures it an [even number][bookofproofs$2317] of times [ [Def. 7.9] ][bookofproofs$2320].
* So I also say that (it is an [even-times-odd number][bookofproofs$2320]) only.
* For if `$A$` is also an [even-times-even][bookofproofs$2319] (number) then it will be measured by an [even (number) ][bookofproofs$2317] according to an [even number][bookofproofs$2317] [ [Def. 7.8] ][bookofproofs$2319].
* Hence, its half will also be measured by an [even number][bookofproofs$2317], (despite) being odd.
* The very thing is [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$A$` is an [even-times-odd][bookofproofs$2320] (number) only.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
