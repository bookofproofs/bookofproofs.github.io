* For let the [odd number][bookofproofs$2318] `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] the [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318] `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` is odd.

* For since `$A$` has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`, `$C$` is thus composed out of so many (magnitudes) equal to `$B$`, as many as (there) are [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$A$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* And each of `$A$`, `$B$` is odd.
* Thus, `$C$` is composed out of odd ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]), (and) the multitude of them is odd.
* Hence `$C$` is odd [[Prop. 9.23]][bookofproofs$2068].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
