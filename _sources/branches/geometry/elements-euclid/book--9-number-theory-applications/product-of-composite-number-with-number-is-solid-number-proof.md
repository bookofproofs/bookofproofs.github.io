* For let the [composite number][bookofproofs$6436] `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] some number `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` is [solid][bookofproofs$2210].

* For since `$A$` is a composite (number), it will be measured by some number.
* Let it be measured by `$D$`.
* And, as many times as `$D$` measures `$A$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$E$`.
* Therefore, since `$D$` measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$E$`, `$E$` has thus made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* And since `$A$` has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`, and `$A$` is the (number created) from (multiplying) `$D$`, `$E$`, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$D$`, `$E$` has thus made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* Thus, `$C$` is [solid][bookofproofs$2210], and its sides are `$D$`, `$E$`, `$B$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
