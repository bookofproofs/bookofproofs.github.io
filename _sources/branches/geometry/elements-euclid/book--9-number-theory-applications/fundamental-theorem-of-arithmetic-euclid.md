### (Proposition 14 from Book 9 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a least number is measured by (some) [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704] then it will not be measured by any other [prime number][bookofproofs$704] except (one of) the original measuring ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]).
* For let `$A$` be the least number measured by the [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704] `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`.
* I say that `$A$` will not be measured by any other [prime number][bookofproofs$704] except (one of) `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`.
