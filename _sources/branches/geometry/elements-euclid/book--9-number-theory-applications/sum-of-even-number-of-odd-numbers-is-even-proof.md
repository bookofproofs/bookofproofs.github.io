* For let any even multitude whatsoever of odd [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, `$DE$`, lie together.
* I say that the whole, `$AE$`, is even.

* For since everyone of `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, `$DE$` is odd then, a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] being subtracted from each, everyone of the remainders will be (made) even [ [Def. 7.7] ][bookofproofs$2318].
* And hence the sum of them will be even [[Prop. 9.21]][bookofproofs$2066].
* And the multitude of the [units][bookofproofs$2314] is even.
* Thus, the whole `$AE$` is also even [[Prop. 9.21]][bookofproofs$2066].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
