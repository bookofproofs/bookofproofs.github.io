### Euclid's Formulation

> If a [number][bookofproofs$2315] is neither (one) of the ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) doubled from a dyad, nor has an [odd][bookofproofs$2318] half, then it is (both) an [even-times-even][bookofproofs$2319] and an [even-times-odd][bookofproofs$2320] (number).

* For let the number `$A$` neither be (one) of the ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) doubled from a dyad, nor let it have an [odd][bookofproofs$2318] half.
* I say that `$A$` is (both) an [even-times-even][bookofproofs$2319] and an [even-times-odd][bookofproofs$2320] (number).
