### Euclid's Formulation

> For three given [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], to investigate when it is possible to find a fourth (number) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to them.

* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` be the three given [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
* And let it be required to investigate when it is possible to find a fourth (number) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to them.
