* For let the [odd number][bookofproofs$2318] `$A$` be [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] some number `$B$`.
* And let `$C$` be double `$B$`.
* I say that `$A$` is [also] [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$C$`.

* For if [$A$ and `$C$`] are not [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]) then some number will measure them.
* Let it measure (them), and let it be `$D$`.
* And `$A$` is odd.
* Thus, `$D$` (is) also odd.
* And since `$D$`, which is odd, measures `$C$`, and `$C$` is even, [$D$] will thus also measure half of `$C$` [[Prop. 9.30]][bookofproofs$2075].
* And `$B$` is half of `$C$`.
* Thus, `$D$` measures `$B$`.
* And it also measures `$A$`.
* Thus, `$D$` measures (both) `$A$` and `$B$`, (despite) them being [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$A$` is not unprime to `$C$`.
* Thus, `$A$` and `$C$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
