* For let the [odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2318] `$BC$` have been subtracted from the [even number][bookofproofs$2317] `$AB$`.
* I say that the remainder `$CA$` is odd.

* For let the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$CD$` have been subtracted from `$BC$`.
* `$DB$` is thus even [ [Def. 7.7] ][bookofproofs$2318].
* And `$AB$` is also even.
* And thus the remainder `$AD$` is even [[Prop. 9.24]][bookofproofs$2069].
* And `$CD$` is a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* Thus, `$CA$` is odd [ [Def. 7.7] ][bookofproofs$2318].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
