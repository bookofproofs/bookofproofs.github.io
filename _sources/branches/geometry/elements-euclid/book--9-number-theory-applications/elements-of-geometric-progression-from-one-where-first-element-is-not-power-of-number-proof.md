* Let any multitude whatsoever of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$`, `$F$`, be in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], (starting) from a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* And let the (number) after the [unit][bookofproofs$2314], `$A$`, not be [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* I say that no other (number) will be [square][bookofproofs$2326] either, apart from the third from the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] [and (all) those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] after that) which leave an interval of one (number)].

* For, if possible, let `$C$` be [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* And `$B$` is also [square][bookofproofs$2326] [[Prop. 9.8]][bookofproofs$2054].
* Thus, `$B$` and `$C$` have to one another (the) ratio which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to (some other) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* And as `$B$` is to `$C$`, (so) `$A$` (is) to `$B$`.
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` have to one another (the) ratio which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] has to (some other) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Hence, `$A$` and `$B$` are [similar plane (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329] [[Prop. 8.26]][bookofproofs$2045].
* And `$B$` is [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, `$A$` is also [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* The very opposite thing was assumed.
* `$C$` is thus not [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* So, similarly, we can show that no other (number is) [square][bookofproofs$2326] either, apart from the third from the [unit][bookofproofs$2314], and (all) those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] after that) which leave an interval of one (number).
* And so let `$A$` not be [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* I say that no other (number) will be [cube][bookofproofs$2327] either, apart from the fourth from the [unit][bookofproofs$2314], and (all) those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] after that) which leave an interval of two ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]).
* For, if possible, let `$D$` be [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* And `$C$` is also [cube][bookofproofs$2327] [[Prop. 9.8]][bookofproofs$2054].
* For it is the fourth (number) from the [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* And as `$C$` is to `$D$`, (so) `$B$` (is) to `$C$`.
* And `$B$` thus has to `$C$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [cube][bookofproofs$2327] (number has) to (some other) [cube (number) ][bookofproofs$2327].
* And `$C$` is [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* Thus, `$B$` is also [cube][bookofproofs$2327] [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343], [[Prop. 8.25]][bookofproofs$2044].
* And since as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] is to `$A$`, (so) `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, and the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it, `$A$` thus also measures `$B$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in ($A$).
* Thus, `$A$` has made the [cube (number) ][bookofproofs$2327] `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* And if a [number][bookofproofs$2315] makes a [cube][bookofproofs$2327] (number by) multiplying itself then it itself will be [cube][bookofproofs$2327] [[Prop. 9.6]][bookofproofs$2052].
* Thus, `$A$` (is) also [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* The very opposite thing was assumed.
* Thus, `$D$` is not [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* So, similarly, we can show that no other (number) is [cube][bookofproofs$2327] either, apart from the fourth from the [unit][bookofproofs$2314], and (all) those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] after that) which leave an interval of two ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
