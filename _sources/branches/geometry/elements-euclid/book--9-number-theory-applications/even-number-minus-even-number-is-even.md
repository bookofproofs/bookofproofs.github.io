> If an [even (number) ][bookofproofs$2317] is subtracted from an(other) [even number][bookofproofs$2317] then the remainder will be even.
* For let the [even (number) ][bookofproofs$2317] `$BC$` have been subtracted from the [even number][bookofproofs$2317] `$AB$`.
* I say that the remainder `$CA$` is even.
