* For let any multitude whatsoever of even [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, `$DE$`, lie together.
* I say that the whole, `$AE$`, is even.

* For since everyone of `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, `$DE$` is even, it has a half [part][bookofproofs$703] [ [Def. 7.6] ][bookofproofs$2317].
* And hence the whole `$AE$` has a half [part][bookofproofs$703].
* And an [even number][bookofproofs$2317] is one (which can be) divided in half [ [Def. 7.6] ][bookofproofs$2317].
* Thus, `$AE$` is even.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
