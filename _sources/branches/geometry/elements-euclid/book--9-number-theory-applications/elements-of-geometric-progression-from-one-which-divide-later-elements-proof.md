* Let any multitude whatsoever of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$`, be in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], (starting) from the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$A$`.
* I say that, for `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$`, the least (number), `$B$`, measures `$E$` according to some (one) of `$C$`, `$D$`.

* For since as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$A$` thus measures the number `$B$` the same number of times as `$D$` (measures) `$E$`.
* Thus, alternately, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$A$` measures `$D$` the same number of times as `$B$` (measures) `$E$` [[Prop. 7.15]][bookofproofs$2345].
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$A$` measures `$D$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it.
* Thus, `$B$` also measures `$E$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$D$`.
* Hence, the lesser (number) `$B$` measures the greater `$E$` according to some existing number among the [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] (namely, `$D$`).
