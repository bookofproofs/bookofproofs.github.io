* Let any multitude whatsoever of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$`, `$F$`, be in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], (starting) from a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* I say that the third from the [unit][bookofproofs$2314], `$B$`, is [square][bookofproofs$2326], and all those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] after that) which leave an interval of one (number).

* And the fourth (from the [unit][bookofproofs$2314]), `$C$`, (is) [cube][bookofproofs$2327], and all those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] after that) which leave an interval of two ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]).
* And the seventh (from the [unit][bookofproofs$2314]), `$F$`, (is) both [cube][bookofproofs$2327] and [square][bookofproofs$2326], and all those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] after that) which leave an interval of five ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]).
* For since as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] is to `$A$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] thus measures the number `$A$` the same number of times as `$A$` (measures) `$B$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] measures the number `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it.
* Thus, `$A$` also measures `$B$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$A$`.
* `$A$` has thus made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* Thus, `$B$` is [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* And since `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and `$B$` is [square][bookofproofs$2326], `$D$` is thus also [square][bookofproofs$2326] [[Prop. 8.22]][bookofproofs$2041].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$F$` is also [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* So, similarly, we can also show that all those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] after that) which leave an interval of one (number) are [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* So I also say that the fourth (number) from the [unit][bookofproofs$2314], `$C$`, is [cube][bookofproofs$2327], and all those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] after that) which leave an interval of two ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]).
* For since as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] is to `$A$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$C$`, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] thus measures the number `$A$` the same number of times that `$B$` (measures) `$C$`.
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] measures the number `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$A$`.
* And thus `$B$` measures `$C$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$A$`.
* `$A$` has thus made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* Therefore, since `$A$` has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`, `$C$` is thus [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* And since `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$`, `$F$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and `$C$` is [cube][bookofproofs$2327], `$F$` is thus also [cube][bookofproofs$2327] [[Prop. 8.23]][bookofproofs$2042].
* And it was also shown (to be) [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, the seventh (number) from the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] is (both) [cube][bookofproofs$2327] and [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* So, similarly, we can show that all those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] after that) which leave an interval of five ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) are (both) [cube][bookofproofs$2327] and [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
