### Euclid's Formulation

> For two given [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], to investigate whether it is possible to find a third (number) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to them.
* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be the two given [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
* And let it be required to investigate whether it is possible to find a third (number) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to them.
