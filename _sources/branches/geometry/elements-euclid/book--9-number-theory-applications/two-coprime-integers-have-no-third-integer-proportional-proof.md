* For let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$` and `$B$` be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* I say that as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$B$` is not to some other (number).

* For, if possible, let it be that as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, (so) `$B$` (is) to `$C$`.
* And `$A$` and `$B$` (are) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]).
* And ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288] are) also the least (of those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them) [[Prop. 7.21]][bookofproofs$2351].
* And the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] (as them) an equal number of times, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$A$` measures `$B$`, as the leading (measuring) the leading.
* And ($A$) also measures itself.
* Thus, `$A$` measures `$A$` and `$B$`, which are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* The very thing (is) [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$B$` cannot be to `$C$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
