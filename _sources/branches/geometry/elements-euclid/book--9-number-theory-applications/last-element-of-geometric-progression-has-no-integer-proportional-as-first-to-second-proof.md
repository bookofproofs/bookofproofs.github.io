* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` be any multitude whatsoever of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* And let the outermost of them, `$A$` and `$D$`, be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* I say that as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) not to some other (number).

* For, if possible, let it be that as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$`.
* Thus, alternately, as `$A$` is to `$D$`, (so) `$B$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343].
* And `$A$` and `$D$` are [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]).
* And ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288] are) also the least (of those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them) [[Prop. 7.21]][bookofproofs$2351].
* And the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] (as them) an equal number of times, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$A$` measures `$B$`.
* And as `$A$` is to `$B$`, (so) `$B$` (is) to `$C$`.
* Thus, `$B$` also measures `$C$`.
* And hence `$A$` measures `$C$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* And since as `$B$` is to `$C$`, (so) `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, and `$B$` measures `$C$`, `$C$` thus also measures `$D$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* But, `$A$` was (found to be) measuring `$C$`.
* And hence `$A$` also measures `$D$`.
* And ($A$) also measures itself.
* Thus, `$A$` measures `$A$` and `$D$`, which are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$D$` cannot be to some other (number).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
