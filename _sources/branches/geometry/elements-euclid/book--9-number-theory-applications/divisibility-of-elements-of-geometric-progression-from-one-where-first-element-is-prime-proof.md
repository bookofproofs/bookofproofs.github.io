* Let any multitude whatsoever of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, be in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], (starting) from a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* And let the (number) after the [unit][bookofproofs$2314], `$A$`, be prime.
* I say that the greatest of them, `$D$`, will be measured by no other ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) except `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.

* For, if possible, let it be measured by `$E$`, and let `$E$` not be the same as one of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* So it is clear that `$E$` is not prime.
* For if `$E$` is prime, and measures `$D$`, then it will also measure `$A$`, (despite `$A$`) being prime (and) not being the same as it [[Prop. 9.12]][bookofproofs$2058].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$E$` is not prime.
* Thus, (it is) composite.
* And every [composite number][bookofproofs$6436] is measured by some [prime number][bookofproofs$704] [[Prop. 7.31]][bookofproofs$798].
* Thus, `$E$` is measured by some [prime number][bookofproofs$704].
* So I say that it will be measured by no other [prime number][bookofproofs$704] than `$A$`.
* For if `$E$` is measured by another ([prime number][bookofproofs$704]), and `$E$` measures `$D$`, then this ([prime number][bookofproofs$704]) will thus also measure `$D$`.
* Hence, it will also measure `$A$`, (despite `$A$`) being prime (and) not being the same as it [[Prop. 9.12]][bookofproofs$2058].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$A$` measures `$E$`.
* And since `$E$` measures `$D$`, let it measure it according to `$F$`.
* I say that `$F$` is not the same as one of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* For if `$F$` is the same as one of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, and measures `$D$` according to `$E$`, then one of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` thus also measures `$D$` according to `$E$`.
* But one of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` (only) measures `$D$` according to some (one) of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` [[Prop. 9.11]][bookofproofs$2057].
* And thus `$E$` is the same as one of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* The very opposite thing was assumed.
* Thus, `$F$` is not the same as one of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* Similarly, we can show that `$F$` is measured by `$A$`, (by) again showing that `$F$` is not prime.
* For if ($F$ is prime), and measures `$D$`, then it will also measure `$A$`, (despite `$A$`) being prime (and) not being the same as it [[Prop. 9.12]][bookofproofs$2058].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$F$` is not prime.
* Thus, (it is) composite.
* And every [composite number][bookofproofs$6436] is measured by some [prime number][bookofproofs$704] [[Prop. 7.31]][bookofproofs$798].
* Thus, `$F$` is measured by some [prime number][bookofproofs$704].
* So I say that it will be measured by no other [prime number][bookofproofs$704] than `$A$`.
* For if some other [prime (number) ][bookofproofs$704] measures `$F$`, and `$F$` measures `$D$`, then this ([prime number][bookofproofs$704]) will thus also measure `$D$`.
* Hence, it will also measure `$A$`, (despite `$A$`) being prime (and) not being the same as it [[Prop. 9.12]][bookofproofs$2058].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$A$` measures `$F$`.
* And since `$E$` measures `$D$` according to `$F$`, `$E$` has thus made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`.
* But, in fact, `$A$` has also made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$` [ [Prop. 9.11 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6457].
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$`, `$C$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$E$`, `$F$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as `$A$` is to `$E$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$C$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And `$A$` measures `$E$`.
* Thus, `$F$` also measures `$C$`.
* Let it measure it according to `$G$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that `$G$` is not the same as one of `$A$`, `$B$`, and that it is measured by `$A$`.
* And since `$F$` measures `$C$` according to `$G$`, `$F$` has thus made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$G$`.
* But, in fact, `$A$` has also made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$` [ [Prop. 9.11 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6457].
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$`, `$B$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$F$`, `$G$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as `$A$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$B$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And `$A$` measures `$F$`.
* Thus, `$G$` also measures `$B$`.
* Let it measure it according to `$H$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that `$H$` is not the same as `$A$`.
* And since `$G$` measures `$B$` according to `$H$`, `$G$` has thus made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$H$`.
* But, in fact, `$A$` has also made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself [[Prop. 9.8]][bookofproofs$2054].
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$H$`, `$G$` is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$A$`.
* Thus, as `$H$` is to `$A$`, (so) `$A$` (is) to `$G$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And `$A$` measures `$G$`.
* Thus, `$H$` also measures `$A$`, (despite `$A$`) being prime (and) not being the same as it.
* The very thing (is) [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, the greatest (number) `$D$` cannot be measured by another (number) except (one of) `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
