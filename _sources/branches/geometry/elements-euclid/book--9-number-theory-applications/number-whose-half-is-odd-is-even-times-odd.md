### Euclid's Formulation

> If a [number][bookofproofs$2315] has an [odd][bookofproofs$2318] half then it is an [even-times-odd (number) ][bookofproofs$2320] only.

* For let the number `$A$` have an [odd][bookofproofs$2318] half.
* I say that `$A$` is an [even-times-odd][bookofproofs$2320] (number) only.
