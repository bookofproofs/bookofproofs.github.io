### (Proposition 12 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If any multitude whatsoever of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] then as one of the leading ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] is) to one of the following so (the sum of) all of the leading ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) will be to (the sum of) all of the following.
* Let any multitude whatsoever of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, be [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], (such that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* I say that as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$A$`, `$C$` (is) to `$B$`, `$D$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition states that if `\[\frac AB=\frac CD,\]` then `\[\frac AB=\frac{A+C}{B+D}.\]`
