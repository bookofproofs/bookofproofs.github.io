* For since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, thus which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], `$A$` is of `$B$`, `$C$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of `$D$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, the sum `$A$`, `$C$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of the sum `$B$`, `$D$` that `$A$` (is) of `$B$` [[Prop. 7.5]][bookofproofs$2335], [[Prop. 7.6]][bookofproofs$2336].
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$A$`, `$C$` (is) to `$B$`, `$D$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
