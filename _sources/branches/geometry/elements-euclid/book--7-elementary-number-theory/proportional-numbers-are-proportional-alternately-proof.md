* For since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, thus which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], `$A$` is of `$B$`, `$C$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of `$D$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, alterately, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], `$A$` is of `$C$`, `$B$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of `$D$` [[Prop. 7.9]][bookofproofs$2339], [[Prop. 7.10]][bookofproofs$2340].
* Thus, `$A,C,B,D$` are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], i.e. as `$A$` is to `$C$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$D$` [[Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
