### (Proposition 38 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a number has any [part][bookofproofs$703] whatever then it will be measured by a number called the same as the [part][bookofproofs$703].
* For let the number `$A$` have any [part][bookofproofs$703] whatever, `$B$`.
* And let the [number] `$C$` be called the same as the [part][bookofproofs$703] `$B$` (i.e., `$B$` is the `$C$`th [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$A$`).
* I say that `$C$` measures `$A$`.

### Modern Formulation

If `$\frac AC=B$` for some [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `$B,$` then `$A$` is a [multiple][bookofproofs$700] of `$C.$`
