> And a **number** (is) a multitude composed of [units][bookofproofs$2314].
### Modern Definition

For modern definitions of numbers see [number systems][bookofproofs$195] and onwards.

The above means the result of the [addition][bookofproofs$890] `$n$` times, `$n > 1$` the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] to itself:

`\[n=\underbrace{1+\ldots+1}_{n\text{ times}}.\]`

### Notes

* Euclid uses in his [Elements" also another notion of a number - a "magnitude][bookofproofs$2316], which means a positive real number.
* Neither negative numbers nor the number `\(0\)` are defined in Euclid's “Elements”.
