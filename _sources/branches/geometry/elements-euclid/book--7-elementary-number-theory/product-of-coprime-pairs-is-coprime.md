### (Proposition 26 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are both [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] each of two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] then the ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) created from (multiplying) them will also be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* For let two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$` and `$B$`, both be [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] each of two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$C$` and `$D$`.
* And let `$A$` make `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`, and let `$C$` make `$F$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`.
* I say that `$E$` and `$F$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].

### Modern Formulation

Let `$A$` and `$C,$` `$B$` and `$C,$` `$A$` and `$D,$` `$B$` and `$D$` be co-prime. Then `$AB$` is co-prime to `$CD.$`
