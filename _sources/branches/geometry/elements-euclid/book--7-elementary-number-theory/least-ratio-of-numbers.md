### (Proposition 33 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as any given multitude of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` be any given multitude of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
* So it is required to find the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.

### Modern Formulation

To find the reduced ratios of `$\frac AB$` and `$\frac BC,$` i.e. such that `$A,$` `$B$` and `$C$` are mutually [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093].
