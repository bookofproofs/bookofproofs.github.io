### (Proposition 23 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] then a number measuring one of them will be [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the remaining (one).
* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] (which are) [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], and let some number `$C$` measure `$A$`.
* I say that `$C$` and `$B$` are also [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].

### Modern Formulation

If `$A$` and `$B$` are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093] and `$C$` is a [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of `$A$`, then `$C$` and `$B$` are also co-prime.
