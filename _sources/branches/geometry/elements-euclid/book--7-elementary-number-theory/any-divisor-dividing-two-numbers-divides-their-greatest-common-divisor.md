### (Corollary to Proposition 2 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So it is manifest, from this, that if a number measures two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] then it will also measure their greatest common measure. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

### Modern Formulation

See [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280], formally

`\[ d|a\wedge d|b\Longrightarrow d\mid\gcd(a,b).\]`
