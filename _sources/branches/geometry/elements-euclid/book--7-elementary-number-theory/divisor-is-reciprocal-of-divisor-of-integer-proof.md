* For since `$B$` is a [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$A$` called the same as `$C$`, and the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$D$` is also a [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$C$` called the same as it (i.e., `$D$` is the `$C$`th [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$C$`), thus which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$D$` is of the number `$C$`, `$B$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$A$`.
* Thus, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$D$` measures the number `$C$` as many times as `$B$` (measures) `$A$`.
* Thus, alternately, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$D$` measures the number `$B$` as many times as `$C$` (measures) `$A$` [[Prop. 7.15]][bookofproofs$2345].
* Thus, `$C$` measures `$A$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
