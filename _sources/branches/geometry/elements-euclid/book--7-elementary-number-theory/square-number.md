> A **square number** is an equal times an equal, or (a [plane number][bookofproofs$2324]) contained by two equal [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
### Modern Formulation

A **square number** (or a **square**) `\(s\)` is the [product][bookofproofs$891] of some [integer][bookofproofs$844] `\(a\)` with itself, formally

`\[s=a\cdot a=a^2.\]`

### Notes

* A geometrical definition of a square was given in [Def. 1.22][bookofproofs$909].
* The following figure shows a geometrical interpretation of a square number
