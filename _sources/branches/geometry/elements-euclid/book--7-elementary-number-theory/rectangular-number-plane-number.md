> And when two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] [multiplying one another][bookofproofs$6437] make some (other number) then the (number so) created is called **plane**, and its sides (are) the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] which multiply one another.


### Modern Formulation

A **rectangular number** `\(h\)` is the [product][bookofproofs$891] of two [positive integers][bookofproofs$1075] `\(a\)` and `\(b\)`:

`\[h=a\cdot b.\]`

### Notes

* Instead of Euclid's term "plane number", the term "rectangular number" is used more often.
* The rectangular number can be interpreted as the [area of a rectangle][bookofproofs$1014] with the sides of integer lengths `\(a\)` and `\(b\)`, e.g. in the following figure, `\(a=2\)`, `\(b=4\)` and `\(h=8\)`.

* This formula, of course, holds not only for rectangles, whose sides have integer lengths but also for sides with lengths represented by [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107]. However, in the 7th Book of "The Elements", Euclid deals with positive integers only.
