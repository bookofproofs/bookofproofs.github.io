* For since which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$A$` is of `$BC$`, `$D$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$EF$`, thus as many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] as are in `$BC$` equal to `$A$`, so many are also in `$EF$` equal to `$D$`.
* Let `$BC$` have been divided into `$BG$` and `$GC$`, equal to `$A$`, and `$EF$` into `$EH$` and `$HF$`, equal to `$D$`.
* So the multitude of (divisions) `$BG$`, `$GC$` will be equal to the multitude of (divisions) `$EH$`, `$HF$`.
* And since the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$BG$` and `$GC$` are equal to one another, and the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$EH$` and `$HF$` are also equal to one another, and the multitude of (divisions) `$BG$`, `$GC$` is equal to the multitude of (divisions) `$EH$`, `$HC$`, thus which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], `$BG$` is of `$EH$`, `$GC$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of `$HF$`.
* And hence, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], `$BG$` is of `$EH$`, the sum `$BC$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of the sum `$EF$` [[Prop. 7.5]][bookofproofs$2335], [[Prop. 7.6]][bookofproofs$2336].
* And `$BG$` (is) equal to `$A$`, and `$EH$` to `$D$`.
* Thus, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], `$A$` is of `$D$`, `$BC$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of `$EF$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
