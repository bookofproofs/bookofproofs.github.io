* For let it not measure `$A$`.
* And since `$D$` is prime, `$A$` and `$D$` are thus [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 7.29]][bookofproofs$2359].
* And as many times as `$D$` measures `$C$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$E$`.
* Therefore, since `$D$` measures `$C$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$`, `$D$` has thus made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* But, in fact, `$A$` has also made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$D$` and `$E$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, as `$D$` is to `$A$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And `$D$` and `$A$` (are) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]), and ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288] are) also the least (of those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945]) [[Prop. 7.21]][bookofproofs$2351], and the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] (as them) an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser - that is to say, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$D$` measures `$B$`.
* So, similarly, we can also show that if ($D$) does not measure `$B$` then it will measure `$A$`.
* Thus, `$D$` measures one of `$A$` and `$B$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
