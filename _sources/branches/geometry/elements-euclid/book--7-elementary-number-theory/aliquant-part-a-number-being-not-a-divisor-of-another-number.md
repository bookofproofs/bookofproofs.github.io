### Modern Definition

This is any [integer][bookofproofs$844] `\(d\neq 0,~|d| < |n|\)`, which is not a [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of `\(n\)`. For such integers we write `\(d\not\mid n\)`. These are exactly those integers `$d$` which leave a remainder `$r$` with `$0 < r < |d|$` in the [division with quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$818] `$$n=dq+r,\quad 0 < r < |d|.$$`
