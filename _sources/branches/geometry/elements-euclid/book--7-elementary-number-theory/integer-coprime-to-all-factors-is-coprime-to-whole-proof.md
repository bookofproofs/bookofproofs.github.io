* For if `$C$` and `$D$` are not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] then [some] number will measure `$C$` and `$D$`.
* Let it (so) measure them, and let it be `$E$`.
* And since `$C$` and `$A$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], and some number `$E$` measures `$C$`, `$A$` and `$E$` are thus [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 7.23]][bookofproofs$2353].
* So as many times as `$E$` measures `$D$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$F$`.
* Thus, `$F$` also measures `$D$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$E$` [[Prop. 7.16]][bookofproofs$2346].
* Thus, `$E$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* But, in fact, `$A$` has also made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$E$` and `$F$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$` and `$B$`.
* And if the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by the (two) outermost is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by the middle (two) then the four [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [[Prop. 6.15]][bookofproofs$2001].
* Thus, as `$E$` is to `$A$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$F$`.
* And `$A$` and `$E$` (are) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]).
* And ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]) are also the least (of those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945]) [[Prop. 7.21]][bookofproofs$2351].
* And the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser - that is to say, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$B$`.
* And it also measures `$C$`.
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$B$` and `$C$`, which are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, some number cannot measure the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$` and `$D$`.
* Thus, `$C$` and `$D$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
