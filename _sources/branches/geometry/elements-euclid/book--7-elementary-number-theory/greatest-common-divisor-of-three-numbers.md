### (Proposition 3 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find the greatest common measure of three given [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] (which are) not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].

* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` be the three given [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] (which are) not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* So it is required to find the greatest common measure of `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.

### Modern Formulation

See the [greatest common divisor of more than two numbers][bookofproofs$8122].
### Notes

* Nowadays, it is not necessary to require that the numbers are not prime to one another to be able to find their greatest common divisor. 
* Euclid does not provide a [definition of the greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280], he only provides a method to calculate it.
* The modern definition is a generalization of the [greatest common divisor of two numbers][bookofproofs$1280] for any finite number of integers, not only of three integers.
