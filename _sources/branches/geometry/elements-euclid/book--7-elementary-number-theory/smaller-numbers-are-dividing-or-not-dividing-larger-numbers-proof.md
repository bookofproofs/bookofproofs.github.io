* For `$A$` and `$BC$` are either [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], or not.
* Let `$A$` and `$BC$`, first of all, be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* So separating `$BC$` into its constituent [units][bookofproofs$2314], each of the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$BC$` will be some [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$A$`.
* Hence, `$BC$` is [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$A$`.
* So let `$A$` and `$BC$` be not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* So `$BC$` either measures, or does not measure, `$A$`.
* Therefore, if `$BC$` measures `$A$` then `$BC$` is [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$A$`.
* And if not, let the greatest common measure, `$D$`, of `$A$` and `$BC$` have been taken [[Prop. 7.2]][bookofproofs$2370], and let `$BC$` have been divided into `$BE$`, `$EF$`, and `$FC$`, equal to `$D$`.
* And since `$D$` measures `$A$`, `$D$` is a [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$A$`.
* And `$D$` is equal to each of `$BE$`, `$EF$`, and `$FC$`.
* Thus, `$BE$`, `$EF$`, and `$FC$` are also each [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$A$`.
* Hence, `$BC$` is [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$A$`.
* Thus, any number is either [part][bookofproofs$703] or [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of any (other) number, the lesser of the greater.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
