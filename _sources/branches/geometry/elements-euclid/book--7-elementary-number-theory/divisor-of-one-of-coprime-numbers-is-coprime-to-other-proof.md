* For if `$C$` and `$B$` are not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] then [some] number will measure `$C$` and `$B$`.
* Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be `$D$`.
* Since `$D$` measures `$C$`, and `$C$` measures `$A$`, `$D$` thus also measures `$A$`.
* And ($D$) also measures `$B$`.
* Thus, `$D$` measures `$A$` and `$B$`, which are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, some number does not measure the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, `$C$` and `$B$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
