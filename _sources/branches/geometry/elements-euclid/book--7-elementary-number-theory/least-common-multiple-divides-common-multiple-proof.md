* For if `$E$` does not measure `$CD$` then let `$E$` leave `$CF$` less than itself (in) measuring `$DF$`.
* And since `$A$` and `$B$` (both) measure `$E$`, and `$E$` measures `$DF$`, `$A$` and `$B$` will thus also measure `$DF$`.
* And ($A$ and `$B$`) also measure the whole of `$CD$`.
* Thus, they will also measure the remainder `$CF$`, which is less than `$E$`.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$E$` cannot not measure `$CD$`.
* Thus, ($E$) measures ($CD$).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
