* For let `$GH$` be laid down equal to `$AB$`.
* Thus, which(ever) [parts][bookofproofs$2323] `$GH$` is of `$CD$`, `$AE$` is also the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$CF$`.
* Let `$GH$` have been divided into the [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$CD$`, `$GK$` and `$KH$`, and `$AE$` into the [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$CF$`, `$AL$` and `$LE$`.
* So the multitude of (divisions) `$GK$`, `$KH$` will be equal to the multitude of (divisions) `$AL$`, `$LE$`.
* And since which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$GK$` is of `$CD$`, `$AL$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$CF$`, and `$CD$` (is) greater than `$CF$`, `$GK$` (is) thus also greater than `$AL$`.
* Let `$GM$` be made equal to `$AL$`.
* Thus, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$GK$` is of `$CD$`, `$GM$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$CF$`.
* Thus, the remainder `$MK$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of the remainder `$FD$` that the whole `$GK$` (is) of the whole `$CD$` [[Prop. 7.5]][bookofproofs$2335].
* Again, since which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$KH$` is of `$CD$`, `$EL$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$CF$`, and `$CD$` (is) greater than `$CF$`, `$HK$` (is) thus also greater than `$EL$`.
* Let `$KN$` be made equal to `$EL$`.
* Thus, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$KH$` (is) of `$CD$`, `$KN$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$CF$`.
* Thus, the remainder `$NH$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of the remainder `$FD$` that the whole `$KH$` (is) of the whole `$CD$` [[Prop. 7.5]][bookofproofs$2335].
* And the remainder `$MK$` was also shown to be the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of the remainder `$FD$` that the whole `$GK$` (is) of the whole `$CD$`.
* Thus, the sum `$MK$`, `$NH$` is the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$DF$` that the whole `$HG$` (is) of the whole `$CD$`.
* And the sum `$MK$`, `$NH$` (is) equal to `$EB$`, and `$HG$` to `$BA$`.
* Thus, the remainder `$EB$` is also the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of the remainder `$FD$` that the whole `$AB$` (is) of the whole `$CD$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
