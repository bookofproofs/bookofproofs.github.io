> A [number][bookofproofs$2315] is **part** of a(nother) number, the lesser of the greater, when it measures the greater.

### Modern Formulation

See [proper divisor][bookofproofs$700].
### Notes

* Euclid requires a "part" to be a number strictly lesser then the number `\( n > 1\)` it measures. 
* Albeit some commentaries to Euclid's “Elements” state that the modern term of the "part" is the "divisor",  this is not  a correct interpretation, because Euclid never uses the term "part" for the trivial divisors `\(\pm 1\)` and `\(\pm n\)`. Instead, in these cases he uses the notions "is measured by a unit" for `\(1\mid n\)` or "is equal to" for `\(n\mid n\)`.
* Therefore, the modern term most close to the meaning of a "part" is "proper divisor".
* Please note that there is no definition in Euclid's “Elements” corresponding to the modern definition of a [divisor][bookofproofs$700].
