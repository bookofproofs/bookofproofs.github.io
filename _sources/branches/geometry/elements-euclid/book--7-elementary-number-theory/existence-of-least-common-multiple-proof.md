* For `$A$` and `$B$` are either [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], or not.
* Let them, first of all, be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* And let `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* Thus, `$B$` has also made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$A$` [[Prop. 7.16]][bookofproofs$2346].
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` (both) measure `$C$`.
* So I say that ($C$) is also the least (number which they both measure).
* For if not, `$A$` and `$B$` will (both) measure some (other) number which is less than `$C$`.
* Let them (both) measure `$D$` (which is less than `$C$`).
* And as many times as `$A$` measures `$D$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$E$`.
* And as many times as `$B$` measures `$D$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$F$`.
* Thus, `$A$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`, and `$B$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$` and `$E$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$B$` and `$F$`.
* Thus, as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And `$A$` and `$B$` are [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]), and prime ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) are the least (of those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945]) [[Prop. 7.21]][bookofproofs$2351], and the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] (as them) an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$B$` measures `$E$`, as the following (number measuring) the following.
* And since `$A$` has made `$C$` and `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$` and `$E$` (respectively), thus as `$B$` is to `$E$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And `$B$` measures `$E$`.
* Thus, `$C$` also measures `$D$`, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` do not (both) measure some number which is less than `$C$`.
* Thus, `$C$` is the least (number) which is measured by (both) `$A$` and `$B$`.

* So let `$A$` and `$B$` be not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* And let the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$F$` and `$E$`, have been taken having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively) [[Prop. 7.33]][bookofproofs$2363].
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$` and `$E$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$B$` and `$F$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And let `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`.
* Thus, `$B$` has also made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`.
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` (both) measure `$C$`.
* So I say that ($C$) is also the least (number which they both measure).
* For if not, `$A$` and `$B$` will (both) measure some number which is less than `$C$`.
* Let them (both) measure `$D$` (which is less than `$C$`).
* And as many times as `$A$` measures `$D$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$G$`.
* And as many times as `$B$` measures `$D$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$H$`.
* Thus, `$A$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$G$`, and `$B$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$H$`.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$` and `$G$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$B$` and `$H$`.
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$G$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$E$`.
* Thus, also, as `$F$` (is) to `$E$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$G$`.
* And `$F$` and `$E$` are the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$` and `$B$`), and the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$G$`.
* And since `$A$` has made `$C$` and `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$` and `$G$` (respectively), thus as `$E$` is to `$G$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And `$E$` measures `$G$`.
* Thus, `$C$` also measures `$D$`, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` do not (both) measure some (number) which is less than `$C$`.
* Thus, `$C$` (is) the least (number) which is measured by (both) `$A$` and `$B$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
