### (Proposition 22 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> The least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as they are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.
* I say that `$A$` and `$B$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].

### Modern Formulation

This is the converse of [Prop 7.21][bookofproofs$2351]. If two [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] form a fraction `$\frac AB$` and they are the smallest numbers forming this fraction, then they are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093].
