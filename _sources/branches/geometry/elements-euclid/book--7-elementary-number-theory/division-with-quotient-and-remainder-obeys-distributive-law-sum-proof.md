* For since which(ever) [parts][bookofproofs$2323] `$AB$` is of `$C$`, `$DE$` (is) also the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$F$`, thus as many [parts][bookofproofs$703] of `$C$` as are in `$AB$`, so many [parts][bookofproofs$703] of `$F$` are also in `$DE$`.
* Let `$AB$` have been divided into the [parts][bookofproofs$703] of `$C$`, `$AG$` and `$GB$`, and `$DE$` into the [parts][bookofproofs$703] of `$F$`, `$DH$` and `$HE$`.
* So the multitude of (divisions) `$AG$`, `$GB$` will be equal to the multitude of (divisions) `$DH$`, `$HE$`.
* And since which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$AG$` is of `$C$`, `$DH$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$F$`, thus which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$AG$` is of `$C$`, the sum `$AG$`, `$DH$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of the sum `$C$`, `$F$` [[Prop. 7.5]][bookofproofs$2335].
* And so, for the same (reasons), which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$GB$` is of `$C$`, the sum `$GB$`, `$HE$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of the sum `$C$`, `$F$`.
* Thus, which(ever) [parts][bookofproofs$2323] `$AB$` is of `$C$`, the sum `$AB$`, `$DE$` is also the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of the sum `$C$`, `$F$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
