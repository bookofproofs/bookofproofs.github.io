* By hypothesis, any multitude of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] whatsoever, `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, and (some) other ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]), `$D$`, `$E$`, `$F$`, of equal multitude to them, (which are) in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] taken two by two, (such that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, and as `$B$` (is) to `$C$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F.$`
* For since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, thus, alternately, as `$A$` is to `$D$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343].
* Again, since as `$B$` is to `$C$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`, thus, alternately, as `$B$` is to `$E$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$F$` [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343].
* And as `$B$` (is) to `$E$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$D$`.
* Thus, also, as `$A$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$F$`.
* Thus, alternately, as `$A$` is to `$C$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$F$` [[Prop. 7.13] ][bookofproofs$2343], [via equality][bookofproofs$1956].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
