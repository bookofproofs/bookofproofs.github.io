### (Definition 15 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A [number][bookofproofs$2315] is said to **multiply a(nother) number** when the (number being) multiplied is added (to itself) as many times as there are [units][bookofproofs$2314] in the former (number), and (thereby) some (other number) is produced.

### Modern Formulation

See [integer multiplication][bookofproofs$891] of two [positive integers][bookofproofs$1075].
### Notes

* Euclid deals in Book 7 with positive integers only.
