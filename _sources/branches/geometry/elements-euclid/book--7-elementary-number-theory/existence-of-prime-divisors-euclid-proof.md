* For since `$A$` is composite, some number will measure it.
* Let it (so) measure ($A$), and let it be `$B$`.
* And if `$B$` is prime then that which was prescribed has happened.
* And if ($B$ is) composite then some number will measure it.
* Let it (so) measure ($B$), and let it be `$C$`.
* And since `$C$` measures `$B$`, and `$B$` measures `$A$`, `$C$` thus also measures `$A$`.
* And if `$C$` is prime then that which was prescribed has happened.
* And if ($C$ is) composite then some number will measure it.
* So, in this manner of continued investigation, some [prime number][bookofproofs$704] will be found which will measure (the number preceding it, which will also measure `$A$`).
* And if (such a [number][bookofproofs$2315]) cannot be found then an infinite (series of) [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], each of which is less than the preceding, will measure the number `$A$`.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744] for [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
* Thus, some [prime number][bookofproofs$704] will (eventually) be found which will measure the (number) preceding it, which will also measure `$A$`.
* Thus, every [composite number][bookofproofs$6436] is measured by some [prime number][bookofproofs$704].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
