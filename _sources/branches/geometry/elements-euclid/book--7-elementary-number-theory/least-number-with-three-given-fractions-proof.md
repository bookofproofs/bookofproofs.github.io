* For let `$D$`, `$E$`, and `$F$` be [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the same names as the parts `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` (respectively).
* And let the least number, `$G$`, measured by `$D$`, `$E$`, and `$F$`, have been taken [[Prop. 7.36]][bookofproofs$2366].
* Thus, `$G$` has parts called the same as `$D$`, `$E$`, and `$F$` [[Prop. 7.37]][bookofproofs$2367].
* And `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` are parts called the same as `$D$`, `$E$`, and `$F$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$G$` has the parts `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* So I say that ($G$) is also the least (number having the parts `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`).
* For if not, there will be some number less than `$G$` which will have the parts `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* Let it be `$H$`.
* Since `$H$` has the parts `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`, `$H$` will thus be measured by [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] called the same as the parts `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` [[Prop. 7.38]][bookofproofs$2368].
* And `$D$`, `$E$`, and `$F$` are [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] called the same as the parts `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$H$` is measured by `$D$`, `$E$`, and `$F$`.
* And ($H$) is less than `$G$`.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, there cannot be some number less than `$G$` which will have the parts `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
