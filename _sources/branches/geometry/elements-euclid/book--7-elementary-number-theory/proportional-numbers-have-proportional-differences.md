### (Proposition 11 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If as the whole (of a number) is to the whole (of another), so a ([part][bookofproofs$703]) taken away (is) to a ([part][bookofproofs$703]) taken away, then the remainder will also be to the remainder as the whole (is) to the whole.
* Let the whole `$AB$` be to the whole `$CD$` as the ([part][bookofproofs$703]) taken away `$AE$` (is) to the ([part][bookofproofs$703]) taken away `$CF$`.
* I say that the remainder `$EB$` is to the remainder `$FD$` as the whole `$AB$` (is) to the whole `$CD$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition states that if `\[\frac{AB}{CD}=\frac{AE+EB}{CF+FD}=\frac{AE}{CF},\]` then `\[\frac{EB}{FD}=\frac{AB}{CD}.\]`
