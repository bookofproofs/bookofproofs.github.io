* For since which(ever) [parts][bookofproofs$2323] `$AB$` is of `$C$`, `$DE$` is also the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$F$`, thus as many [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$C$` as are in `$AB$`, so many [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$F$` (are) also in `$DE$`.
* Let `$AB$` have been divided into the [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$C$`, `$AG$` and `$GB$`, and `$DE$` into the [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$F$`, `$DH$` and `$HE$`.
* So the multitude of (divisions) `$AG$`, `$GB$` will be equal to the multitude of (divisions) `$DH$`, `$HE$`.
* And since which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$AG$` is of `$C$`, `$DH$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$F$`, also, alternately, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], `$AG$` is of `$DH$`, `$C$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of `$F$` [[Prop. 7.9]][bookofproofs$2339].
* And so, for the same (reasons), which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], `$GB$` is of `$HE$`, `$C$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of `$F$` [[Prop. 7.9]][bookofproofs$2339].
* And so [which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], `$AG$` is of `$DH$`, `$GB$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of `$HE$`.
* And thus, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], `$AG$` is of `$DH$`, `$AB$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of `$DE$` [[Prop. 7.5]][bookofproofs$2335], [[Prop. 7.6]][bookofproofs$2336].
* But, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], `$AG$` is of `$DH$`, `$C$` was also shown (to be) the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of `$F$`.
* And, thus] which(ever) [parts][bookofproofs$2323], or [part][bookofproofs$703], `$AB$` is of `$DE$`, `$C$` is also the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], or the same [part][bookofproofs$703], of `$F$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
