> And when three [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] [multiplying one another][bookofproofs$6437] make some (other number) then the (number so) created is (called) **solid**, and its sides (are) the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] which multiply one another.

### Modern Formulation

A **cuboidal number** `\(h\)` is the [product][bookofproofs$891] of three [positive integers][bookofproofs$1075] `\(a,b\)` and `\(c\)`:

`\[h=a\cdot b\cdot c.\]`

### Notes

* Instead of Euclid's term  **solid number**", the term **cuboidal** is used more often.
* From a geometrical point of view, a cuboidal number can be interpreted as the **volume of a solid rectangular cuboid**, i.e. a solid figure with rectangular faces.

* This formula, of course, holds not only for integer lengths but also for figures with side lengths represented by general real numbers. However, in the 7th Book of "The Elements", Euclid deals with positive integers only.
