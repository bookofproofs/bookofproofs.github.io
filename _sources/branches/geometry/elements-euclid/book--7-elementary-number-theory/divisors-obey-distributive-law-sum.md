### (Proposition 5 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a number is [part][bookofproofs$703] of a number, and another (number) is the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of another, then the sum (of the leading [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) will also be the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of the sum (of the following [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) that one (number) is of another.
* For let a number `$A$` be [part][bookofproofs$703] of a [number] `$BC$`, and another (number) `$D$` (be) the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of another (number) `$EF$` that `$A$` (is) of `$BC$`.
* I say that the sum `$A$`, `$D$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of the sum `$BC$`, `$EF$` that `$A$` (is) of `$BC$`.

### Modern Formulation

See [divisibility law no. 9][bookofproofs$508].
### Notes

This proposition states 
`$$\begin{array}{rclc}BC&=&n\cdot A&\wedge\\
EF&=&n\cdot D\\
&\Downarrow&\\
BC+EF&=&n(A+D).
\end{array}$$`
In particular, 
`$$n\mid BC\wedge n\mid EF\Rightarrow n\mid (BC+EF).$$`
