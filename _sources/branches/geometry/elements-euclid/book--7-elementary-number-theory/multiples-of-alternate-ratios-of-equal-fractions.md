### (Proposition 10 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a number is [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of a number, and another (number) is the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of another, also, alternately, which(ever) [parts][bookofproofs$2323], or [part][bookofproofs$703], the first (number) is of the third, the second will also be the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], or the same [part][bookofproofs$703], of the fourth.
* For let a number `$AB$` be [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of a number `$C$`, and another (number) `$DE$` (be) the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of another `$F$`.
* I say that, also, alternately, which(ever) [parts][bookofproofs$2323], or [part][bookofproofs$703], `$AB$` is of `$DE$`, `$C$` is also the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], or the same [part][bookofproofs$703], of `$F$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition states that if `$C=AB\cdot n+r_0$` with `$0 < r_0 < AB$` and `$F=DE\cdot n+r_1$` with `$0 < r_1 < DE,$` then, using the [division with quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$818], 
`$$\begin{array}{rclccl}
D&=&AB\cdot m&+&r&0\le r < AB\\
&\Updownarrow&\\
F&=&C\cdot m&+&s&0\le s < C,
\end{array}$$`
for some integers `$m,s,r.$`
