* For let `$D$` be made equal to `$A$`.
* Since `$A$` and `$B$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], and `$A$` (is) equal to `$D$`, `$D$` and `$B$` are thus also [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* Thus, `$D$` and `$A$` are each [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$B$`.
* Thus, the (number) created from (multilying) `$D$` and `$A$` will also be [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$B$` [[Prop. 7.24]][bookofproofs$2354].
* And `$C$` is the number created from (multiplying) `$D$` and `$A$`.
* Thus, `$C$` and `$B$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
