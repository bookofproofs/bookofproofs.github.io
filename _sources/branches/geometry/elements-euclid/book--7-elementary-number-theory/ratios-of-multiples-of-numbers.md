### (Proposition 18 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] multiplying some number make some (other [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) then the ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) generated from them will have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as the multiplying ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]).
* For let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$` and `$B$` make (the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) `$D$` and `$E$` (respectively, by) multiplying some number `$C$`.
* I say that as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this propositions states that if `\[a\,c = d\quad\text{ and }\quad b\,c=e,\]` then `\[\frac ab=\frac de,\]` where all symbols denote [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
