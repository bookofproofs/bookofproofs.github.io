### (Proposition 39 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find the least number that will have given [parts][bookofproofs$2323].
* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` be the given [parts][bookofproofs$2323].
* So it is required to find the least number which will have the parts `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` (i.e., an `$A$`th [part][bookofproofs$703], a `$B$`th [part][bookofproofs$703], and a `$C$`th [part][bookofproofs$703]).

### Modern Formulation

If `$A=\frac 1D,$` `$B=\frac 1E,$` `$C=\frac 1F,$` and `$G=\operatorname{lcm}(D,E,F)$` is the [least common multiple][bookofproofs$1276] of these numbers with `$D=\frac G{d},$` `$E=\frac G{e},$` `$F=\frac G{f},$` then `$A=d/G,$` `$B=e/G,$` and `$C=f/G.$`
