* (For) since as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$AE$` (is) to `$CF$`, thus which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], `$AB$` is of `$CD$`, `$AE$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of `$CF$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, the remainder `$EB$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of the remainder `$FD$` that `$AB$` (is) of `$CD$` [[Prop. 7.7]][bookofproofs$2337], [[Prop. 7.8]][bookofproofs$2338].
* Thus, as `$EB$` is to `$FD$`, so `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
