* For since the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$A$` measures the number `$BC$` as many times as `$D$` (measures) `$EF$`, thus as many [units][bookofproofs$2314] as are in `$BC$`, so many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are also in `$EF$` equal to `$D$`.
* Let `$BC$` have been divided into its constituent [units][bookofproofs$2314], `$BG$`, `$GH$`, and `$HC$`, and `$EF$` into the (divisions) `$EK$`, `$KL$`, and `$LF$`, equal to `$D$`.
* So the multitude of ([units][bookofproofs$2314]) `$BG$`, `$GH$`, `$HC$` will be equal to the multitude of (divisions) `$EK$`, `$KL$`, `$LF$`.
* And since the [units][bookofproofs$2314] `$BG$`, `$GH$`, and `$HC$` are equal to one another, and the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$EK$`, `$KL$`, and `$LF$` are also equal to one another, and the multitude of the ([units][bookofproofs$2314]) `$BG$`, `$GH$`, `$HC$` is equal to the multitude of the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$EK$`, `$KL$`, `$LF$`, thus as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$BG$` (is) to the number `$EK$`, so the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$GH$` will be to the number `$KL$`, and the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$HC$` to the number `$LF$`.
* And thus, as one of the leading ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] is) to one of the following, so (the sum of) all of the leading will be to (the sum of) all of the following [[Prop. 7.12]][bookofproofs$2342].
* Thus, as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$BG$` (is) to the number `$EK$`, so `$BC$` (is) to `$EF$`.
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$BG$` (is) equal to the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$A$`, and the number `$EK$` to the number `$D$`.
* Thus, as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$A$` is to the number `$D$`, so `$BC$` (is) to `$EF$`.
* Thus, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$A$` measures the number `$D$` as many times as `$BC$` (measures) `$EF$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
