* For let `$A$` make `$G$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`.
* Therefore, since `$A$` has made `$G$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`, and has made `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`, the number `$A$` has made `$G$` and `$E$` [by multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$` and `$D$` (respectively).
* Thus, as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* But, as `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$`.
* Thus, also, as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$E$`.
* Again, since `$A$` has made `$G$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`, but, in fact, `$B$` has also made `$F$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`, the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$` and `$B$` have made `$G$` and `$F$` (respectively, by) multiplying some number `$C$`.
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$F$` [[Prop. 7.18]][bookofproofs$2348].
* But, also, as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$E$`.
* And thus, as `$G$` (is) to `$E$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$F$`.
* Thus, `$G$` has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to each of `$E$` and `$F$`.
* Thus, `$E$` is equal to `$F$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
* So, again, let `$E$` be equal to `$F$`.
* I say that as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* For, with the same construction, since `$E$` is equal to `$F$`, thus as `$G$` is to `$E$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$F$` [[Prop. 5.7]][bookofproofs$1964].
* But, as `$G$` (is) to `$E$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And as `$G$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$` [[Prop. 7.18]][bookofproofs$2348].
* And, thus, as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
