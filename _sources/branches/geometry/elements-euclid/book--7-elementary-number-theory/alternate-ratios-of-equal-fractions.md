### (Proposition 9 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a number is [part][bookofproofs$703] of a number, and another (number) is the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of another, also, alternately, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], the first (number) is of the third, the second (number) will also be the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of the fourth.
* For let a number `$A$` be [part][bookofproofs$703] of a number `$BC$`, and another (number) `$D$` (be) the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of another `$EF$` that `$A$` (is) of `$BC$`.
* I say that, also, alternately, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], `$A$` is of `$D$`, `$BC$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of `$EF$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition states that if `$A=\frac{BC}{n}$` and `$D=\frac{EF}{n}$` for some integers `$n \ge 1$` and `$0 <  BC < EF,$` then, using the [division with quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$818], 
`$$\begin{array}{rclccl}
D&=&m\cdot A&+&r&0\le r < A\\
&\Updownarrow&\\
EF&=&m\cdot BC&+&nr&0\le nr < BC.
\end{array}$$`
