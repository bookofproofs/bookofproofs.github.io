### (Proposition 37 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a number is measured by some number then the (number) measured will have a [part][bookofproofs$703] called the same as the measuring (number).
* For let the number `$A$` be measured by some number `$B$`.
* I say that `$A$` has a [part][bookofproofs$703] called the same as `$B$`.

### Modern Formulation

If `$A=BC$` and `$A,B,C$` are [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718], then `$B$` is a [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of `$A.$`
