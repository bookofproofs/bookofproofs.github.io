* For if not then there will be some [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] less than `$A$` and `$B$` which are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Let them be `$C$` and `$D$`.
* Therefore, since the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] (as them) an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser - that is to say, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following - `$C$` thus measures `$A$` the same number of times that `$D$` (measures) `$B$` [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* So as many times as `$C$` measures `$A$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$E$`.
* Thus, `$D$` also measures `$B$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$E$`.
* And since `$C$` measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$E$`, `$E$` thus also measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$C$` [[Prop. 7.16]][bookofproofs$2346].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$E$` also measures `$B$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$D$` [[Prop. 7.16]][bookofproofs$2346].
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$A$` and `$B$`, which are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, there cannot be any [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] less than `$A$` and `$B$` which are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
