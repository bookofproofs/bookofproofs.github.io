* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` be any given multitude of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
* So it is required to find the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.

* For `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` are either [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], or not.
* In fact, if `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] then they are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them [[Prop. 7.22]][bookofproofs$2352].
* And if not, let the greatest common measure, `$D$`, of `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` have be taken [[Prop. 7.3]][bookofproofs$2333].
* And as many times as `$D$` measures `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$`, respectively.
* And thus `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$` measure `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, respectively, according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$D$` [[Prop. 7.15]][bookofproofs$2345].
* Thus, `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$` measure `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` (respectively) an equal number of times.
* Thus, `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$` are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` (respectively) [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* So I say that (they are) also the least (of those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`).
* For if `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$` are not the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` (respectively), then there will be [some] [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] less than `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$` which are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` (respectively).
* Let them be `$H$`, `$K$`, `$L$`.
* Thus, `$H$` measures `$A$` the same number of times that `$K$`, `$L$` also measure `$B$`, `$C$`, respectively.
* And as many times as `$H$` measures `$A$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$M$`.
* Thus, `$K$`, `$L$` measure `$B$`, `$C$`, respectively, according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$M$`.
* And since `$H$` measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$M$`, `$M$` thus also measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$H$` [[Prop. 7.15]][bookofproofs$2345].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$M$` also measures `$B$`, `$C$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$K$`, `$L$`, respectively.
* Thus, `$M$` measures `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* And since `$H$` measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$M$`, `$H$` has thus made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$M$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$E$` has also made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`.
* Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) `$E$` and `$D$` is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) `$H$` and `$M$`.
* Thus, as `$E$` (is) to `$H$`, so `$M$` (is) to `$D$` [[Prop. 7.19]][bookofproofs$2349].
* And `$E$` (is) greater than `$H$`.
* Thus, `$M$` (is) also greater than `$D$` [[Prop. 5.13]][bookofproofs$1970].
* And ($M$) measures `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* For `$D$` was assumed (to be) the greatest common measure of `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* Thus, there cannot be any [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] less than `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$` which are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$` are the least of (those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` (respectively).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
