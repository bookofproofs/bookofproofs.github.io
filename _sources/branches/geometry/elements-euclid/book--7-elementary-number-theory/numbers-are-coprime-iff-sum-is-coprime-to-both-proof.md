* "`$\Rightarrow$`"
* Let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$AB$` and `$BC$`, (which are) [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], be laid out.
   * Assume, `$CA$` and `$AB$` are not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288]. 
   * Then some number will measure `$CA$` and `$AB$`.
   * Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be `$D$`.
   * Therefore, since `$D$` measures `$CA$` and `$AB$`, it will thus also measure the remainder `$BC$`.
   * And it also measures `$BA$`.
   * Thus, `$D$` measures `$AB$` and `$BC$`, which are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
   * The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
   * Thus, some number cannot measure (both) the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$CA$` and `$AB$`.
   * Thus, `$CA$` and `$AB$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
   * So, for the same (reasons), `$AC$` and `$CB$` are also [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
   * Thus, `$CA$` is [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] each of `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* "`$\Leftarrow$`"
* So, again, let `$CA$` and `$AB$` be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
   * For if `$AB$` and `$BC$` are not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] then some number will measure `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
   * Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be `$D$`.
   * And since `$D$` measures each of `$AB$` and `$BC$`, it will thus also measure the whole of `$CA$`.
   * And it also measures `$AB$`.
   * Thus, `$D$` measures `$CA$` and `$AB$`, which are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
   * The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
   * Thus, some number cannot measure (both) the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
   * Thus, `$AB$` and `$BC$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
