### Euclid's Formulation

> The least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser.
* For let `$CD$` and `$EF$` be the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively).
* I say that `$CD$` measures `$A$` the same number of times as `$EF$` (measures) `$B$`.

### Modern Formulation 

If `$\frac{\overline{CD}}{\overline{EF}}=\frac{A}{B}$` (all lengths being natural numbers) and `$\frac{\overline{CD}}{\overline{EF}}$` is a reduced fraction, i.e. `$\overline{CD}$` and `$\overline{EF}$` are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093], then there exists a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `$n$` such that `$A=n\cdot \overline{CD}$` and `$B=n\cdot \overline{EF}.$` In other words, the ratio `$\frac AB$` can be reduced by the number `$n.$`
