### Euclid's Formulation

> If two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] then the number created from (squaring) one of them will be [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the remaining (number).
* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] (which are) [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* And let `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* I say that `$B$` and `$C$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].

### Modern Formulation

If `$A$` and `$B$` are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093], then `$A^2$` and `$B$` are co-prime.
