* For since `$A$` has made `$C$` (by) multiplying `$B$`, `$B$` thus measures `$C$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$A$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` also measures the number `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it.
* Thus, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` measures the number `$A$` as many times as `$B$` (measures) `$C$`.
* Thus, alternately, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` measures the number `$B$` as many times as `$A$` (measures) `$C$` [[Prop. 7.15]][bookofproofs$2345].
* Again, since `$B$` has made `$D$` (by) multiplying `$A$`, `$A$` thus measures `$D$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$B$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` also measures `$B$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it.
* Thus, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` measures the number `$B$` as many times as `$A$` (measures) `$D$`.
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` was measuring the number `$B$` as many times as `$A$` (measures) `$C$`.
* Thus, `$A$` measures each of `$C$` and `$D$` an equal number of times.
* Thus, `$C$` is equal to `$D$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
