* For as many times as `$B$` measures `$A$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$C$`.
* Since `$B$` measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$C$`, and the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$D$` also measures `$C$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$D$` thus measures the number `$C$` as many times as `$B$` (measures) `$A$`.
* Thus, alternately, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$D$` measures the number `$B$` as many times as `$C$` (measures) `$A$` [[Prop. 7.15]][bookofproofs$2345].
* Thus, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$D$` is of the number `$B$`, `$C$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$A$`.
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$D$` is a [part][bookofproofs$703] of the number `$B$` called the same as it (i.e., a `$B$`th [part][bookofproofs$703]).
* Thus, `$C$` is also a [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$A$` called the same as `$B$` (i.e., `$C$` is the `$B$`th [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$A$`).
* Hence, `$A$` has a [part][bookofproofs$703] `$C$` which is called the same as `$B$` (i.e., `$A$` has a `$B$`th [part][bookofproofs$703]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
