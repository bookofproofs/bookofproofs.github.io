### (Proposition 15 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] measures some number, and another number measures some other number as many times, then, also, alternately, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] will measure the third number as many times as the second (number measures) the fourth.
* For let a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$A$` measure some number `$BC$`, and let another number `$D$` measure some other number `$EF$` as many times.
* I say that, also, alternately, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$A$` also measures the number `$D$` as many times as `$BC$` (measures) `$EF$`.

### Modern Formulation

This proposition is a special case of [[Prop. 7.9]][bookofproofs$2339]: if `\[1=\frac bn\quad\text{ and }\quad c=\frac dn,\]` then if `\[1=\frac cl,\]` then `\[b = \frac dl,\]` where all symbols denote [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
