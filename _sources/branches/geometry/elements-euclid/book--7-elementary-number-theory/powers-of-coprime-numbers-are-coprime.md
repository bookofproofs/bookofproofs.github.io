### (Proposition 27 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] and each makes some (number by) multiplying itself then the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] created from them will be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], and if the original ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) make some (more [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] by) multiplying the created ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) then these will also be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [and this always happens with the extremes].

* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], and let `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and let it make `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`.
* And let `$B$` make `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and let it make `$F$` [by multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`.
* I say that `$C$` and `$E$`, and `$D$` and `$F$`, are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].

### Modern Formulation

If `$a$` is [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$b$`, then `$a^2$` is also [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$b^2$`, as well as `$a^3$` to `$b^3$`,  etc., where all symbols denote [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
