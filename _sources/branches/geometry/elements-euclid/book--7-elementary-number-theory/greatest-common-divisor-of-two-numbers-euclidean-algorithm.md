### (Proposition 2 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find the greatest common measure of two given [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] (which are) not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* Let `$AB$` and `$CD$` be the two given [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] (which are) not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* So it is required to find the greatest common measure of `$AB$` and `$CD$`.

### Modern Formulation

See [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280].
### Notes

* Euclid does not provide a [definition of the greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280], he only provides a method to calculate it.
* Nowadays, it is not necessary to require that the numbers are not prime to one another to be able to find their greatest common divisor. There exists also a correct and efficient algorithm for finding the `\(\gcd\)` of any two integers, at least one of which does not equal `\(0\)`.
* The contemporary [definition of the greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] not given in Euclid's Elements has the advantage that `\(gcd(0,0)\)` is well-defined: `\(0\)` is the only integer, which is divisible by all other integers. Therefore, `\(\gcd(0,0)=0\)`.
