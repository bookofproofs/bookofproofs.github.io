> [Numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are **proportional** when the first is the same [multiple][bookofproofs$1275], or the same [part][bookofproofs$703], or the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323], of the second that the third (is) of the fourth.

### Modern Definition

See [rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033].
### Notes

* Euclid introduced [proportionality][bookofproofs$6442] for [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] already in Book 5 ([Def. 5.06][bookofproofs$6442]).
* However, now he restricts this definition to [positive integers][bookofproofs$1075]: Euclid calls the positive integers `$a,b,c$` and `$d$` "proportional" if the [rectangular numbers][bookofproofs$2324] `\(a\cdot d\)` and `\(b\cdot c\)` are equal, formally

`\[a\cdot d = b\cdot c.\]`

* Please note that this is exactly the case if they represent the same rational numbers. 
* In fact, being proportional in the sense of the above definition is an equivalence relation which can be used to define [rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033]: Two rational numbers `\(a/b\)` and `\(c/d\)` are equivalent, if and only if  `$ad=bc.$`

`\[\frac ab\sim\frac cd\Longleftrightarrow a\cdot d = b\cdot c.\]`
