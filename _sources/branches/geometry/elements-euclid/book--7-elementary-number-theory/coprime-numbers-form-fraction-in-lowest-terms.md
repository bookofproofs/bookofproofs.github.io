### Euclid's Formulation

> [Numbers][bookofproofs$2315] [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.

* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* I say that `$A$` and `$B$` are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.

### Modern Formulation

If `$\frac{A}{B}$` is a reduced fraction, i.e. `$A$` and `$B$` are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093], then from all pairs of numbers having the same ration, `$A$` and `$B$` are the smallest.
