### (Definition 5 and 15 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> And the greater ([number][bookofproofs$2315] is) a **multiple** of the lesser (number) when it is measured by the lesser.

### Modern Definition

See [multiple][bookofproofs$700].
### Notes

* Euclid requires a multiple to be strictly greater than any of its divisors. 
* Note that the modern definition of the multiple does not make this restriction.
