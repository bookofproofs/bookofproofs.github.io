* For since `$A$` and `$B$` are each [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$C$`, the (number) created from ([multiplying][bookofproofs$6437]) `$A$` and `$B$` will thus also be [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$C$` [[Prop. 7.24]][bookofproofs$2354].
* And `$E$` is the (number) created from (multiplying) `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, `$E$` and `$C$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$E$` and `$D$` are also [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* Thus, `$C$` and `$D$` are each [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$E$`.
* Thus, the (number) created from (multiplying) `$C$` and `$D$` will also be [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] `$E$` [[Prop. 7.24]][bookofproofs$2354].
* And `$F$` is the (number) created from (multiplying) `$C$` and `$D$`.
* Thus, `$E$` and `$F$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
