> A **prime** [number][bookofproofs$2315] is one (which is) measured by a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] alone.

### Modern Formulation

see [prime numbers][bookofproofs$473].
### Notes

* Euclid defined the concept of a [proper divisor][bookofproofs$700] (see part in [Def 7.03][bookofproofs$703]), i.e. the divisors `\(d\mid n\)` with `$d\neq n.$` 
* With this respect, his definition of prime numbers means literally: "A prime number is one which is measured by a unit as the only part."
