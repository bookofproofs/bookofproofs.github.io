> An **even** [number][bookofproofs$2315] is one (which can be) divided in half.

### Notes

* Euclid's definition of even numbers is not exact since it allows e.g. incommensurable numbers being divided into halves to be even numbers, which is obviously not correct. 

### Modern Formulation

see [even number][bookofproofs$8130].
