* For if they are not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] then some number will measure them.
* Let it (so measure them), and let it be `$C$`.
* And as many times as `$C$` measures `$A$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$D$`.
* And as many times as `$C$` measures `$B$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$E$`.
* Since `$C$` measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$D$`, `$C$` has thus made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$C$` has also made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`.
* So the number `$C$` has made `$A$` and `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$` and `$E$` (respectively).
* Thus, as `$D$` is to `$E$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* Thus, `$D$` and `$E$` are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$` and `$B$`, being less than them.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, some number does not measure the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
