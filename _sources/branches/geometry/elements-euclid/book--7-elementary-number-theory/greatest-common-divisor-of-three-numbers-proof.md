* For let the greatest common measure, `$D$`, of the two ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) `$A$` and `$B$` have been taken [[Prop. 7.2]][bookofproofs$2370].
* So `$D$` either measures, or does not measure, `$C$`.
* First of all, let it measure ($C$).
* And it also measures `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, `$D$` measures `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* Thus, `$D$` is a common measure of `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* So I say that (it is) also the greatest (common measure).
* For if `$D$` is not the greatest common measure of `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` then some number greater than `$D$` will measure the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* Let it (so) measure ($A$, `$B$`, and `$C$`), and let it be `$E$`.
* Therefore, since `$E$` measures `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`, it will thus also measure `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, it will also measure the greatest common measure of `$A$` and `$B$` [ [Prop. 7.2 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6414].
* And `$D$` is the greatest common measure of `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$D$`, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, some number which is greater than `$D$` cannot measure the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* Thus, `$D$` is the greatest common measure of `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* So let `$D$` not measure `$C$`.
* I say, first of all, that `$C$` and `$D$` are not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* For since `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` are not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], some number will measure them.
* So the (number) measuring `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` will also measure `$A$` and `$B$`, and it will also measure the greatest common measure, `$D$`, of `$A$` and `$B$` [ [Prop. 7.2 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6414].
* And it also measures `$C$`.
* Thus, some number will measure the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$` and `$C$`.
* Thus, `$D$` and `$C$` are not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* Therefore, let their greatest common measure, `$E$`, have been taken [[Prop. 7.2]][bookofproofs$2370].
* And since `$E$` measures `$D$`, and `$D$` measures `$A$` and `$B$`, `$E$` thus also measures `$A$` and `$B$`.
* And it also measures `$C$`.
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* Thus, `$E$` is a common measure of `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* So I say that (it is) also the greatest (common measure).
* For if `$E$` is not the greatest common measure of `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` then some number greater than `$E$` will measure the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* Let it (so) measure ($A$, `$B$`, and `$C$`), and let it be `$F$`.
* And since `$F$` measures `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`, it also measures `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, it will also measure the greatest common measure of `$A$` and `$B$` [ [Prop. 7.2 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6414].
* And `$D$` is the greatest common measure of `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, `$F$` measures `$D$`.
* And it also measures `$C$`.
* Thus, `$F$` measures `$D$` and `$C$`.
* Thus, it will also measure the greatest common measure of `$D$` and `$C$` [ [Prop. 7.2 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6414].
* And `$E$` is the greatest common measure of `$D$` and `$C$`.
* Thus, `$F$` measures `$E$`, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, some number which is greater than `$E$` does not measure the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* Thus, `$E$` is the greatest common measure of `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
