* For if `$B$` and `$A$` are not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] then some number will measure them.
* Let `$C$` measure (them).
* Since `$C$` measures `$B$`, and `$A$` does not measure `$B$`, `$C$` is thus not the same as `$A$`.
* And since `$C$` measures `$B$` and `$A$`, it thus also measures `$A$`, which is prime, (despite) not being the same as it.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, some number cannot measure (both) `$B$` and `$A$`.
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
