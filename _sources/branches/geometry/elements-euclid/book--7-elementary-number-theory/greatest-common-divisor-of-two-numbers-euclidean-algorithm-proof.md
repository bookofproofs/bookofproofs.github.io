* In fact, if `$CD$` measures `$AB$`, `$CD$` is thus a common measure of `$CD$` and `$AB$`, (since `$CD$`) also measures itself.
* And (it is) manifest that (it is) also the greatest (common measure).
* For nothing greater than `$CD$` can measure `$CD$`.
* But if `$CD$` does not measure `$AB$` then some number will remain from `$AB$` and `$CD$`, the lesser being continually subtracted, in turn, from the greater, which will measure the (number) preceding it.
* For a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] will not be left.
* But if not, `$AB$` and `$CD$` will be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 7.1]][bookofproofs$2331].
* The very opposite thing was assumed.
* Thus, some number will remain which will measure the (number) preceding it.
* And let `$CD$` measuring `$BE$` leave `$EA$` less than itself, and let `$EA$` measuring `$DF$` leave `$FC$` less than itself, and let `$CF$` measure `$AE$`.
* Therefore, since `$CF$` measures `$AE$`, and `$AE$` measures `$DF$`, `$CF$` will thus also measure `$DF$`.
* And it also measures itself.
* Thus, it will also measure the whole of `$CD$`.
* And `$CD$` measures `$BE$`.
* Thus, `$CF$` also measures `$BE$`.
* And it also measures `$EA$`.
* Thus, it will also measure the whole of `$BA$`.
* And it also measures `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$CF$` measures (both) `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$CF$` is a common measure of `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* So I say that (it is) also the greatest (common measure).
   * For if `$CF$` is not the greatest common measure of `$AB$` and `$CD$` then some number which is greater than `$CF$` will measure the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
   * Let it (so) measure ($AB$ and `$CD$`), and let it be `$G$`.
   * And since `$G$` measures `$CD$`, and `$CD$` measures `$BE$`, `$G$` thus also measures `$BE$`.
   * And it also measures the whole of `$BA$`.
   * Thus, it will also measure the remainder `$AE$`.
   * And `$AE$` measures `$DF$`.
   * Thus, `$G$` will also measure `$DF$`.
   * And it also measures the whole of `$DC$`.
   * Thus, it will also measure the remainder `$CF$`, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
   * The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
   * Thus, some number which is greater than `$CF$` cannot measure the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
   * Thus, `$CF$` is the greatest common measure of `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
