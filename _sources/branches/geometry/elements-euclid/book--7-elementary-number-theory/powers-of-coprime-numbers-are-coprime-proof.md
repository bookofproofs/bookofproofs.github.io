### Euclid's' Proof 

* For since `$A$` and `$B$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], and `$A$` has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, `$C$` and `$B$` are thus [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 7.25]][bookofproofs$2355].
* Therefore, since `$C$` and `$B$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], and `$B$` has made `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, `$C$` and `$E$` are thus [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 7.25]][bookofproofs$2355].
* Again, since `$A$` and `$B$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], and `$B$` has made `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, `$A$` and `$E$` are thus [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 7.25]][bookofproofs$2355].
* Therefore, since the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$` and `$C$` are both [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] each of the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$B$` and `$E$`, the (number) created from (multiplying) `$A$` and `$C$` is thus [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the (number created) from (multiplying) `$B$` and `$E$` [[Prop. 7.26]][bookofproofs$2356].
* And `$D$` is the (number created) from (multiplying) `$A$` and `$C$`, and `$F$` the (number created) from (multiplying) `$B$` and `$E$`.
* Thus, `$D$` and `$F$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
