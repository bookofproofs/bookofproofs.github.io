### (Proposition 4 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Any number is either [part][bookofproofs$703] or [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of any (other) number, the lesser of the greater.
* Let `$A$` and `$BC$` be two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], and let `$BC$` be the lesser.
* I say that `$BC$` is either [part][bookofproofs$703] or [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$A$`.

### Modern Formulation

For two [positive integers][bookofproofs$1075] `$0 < a < b$` we have either `$a\mid b\wedge a\neq b$` or `$a\not\mid d.$`

### Notes

* In the modern formulation, this is part of the [definition of divisors][bookofproofs$700] and not a separate theorem.
