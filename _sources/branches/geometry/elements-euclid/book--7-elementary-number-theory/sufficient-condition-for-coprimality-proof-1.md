* For if `$AB$` and `$CD$` are not [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] then some number will measure them.
* Let (some number) measure them, and let it be `$E$`.
* And let `$CD$` measuring `$BF$` leave `$FA$` less than itself, and let `$AF$` measuring `$DG$` leave `$GC$` less than itself, and let `$GC$` measuring `$FH$` leave a [unit][bookofproofs$2314], `$HA$`.
* In fact, since `$E$` measures `$CD$`, and `$CD$` measures `$BF$`, `$E$` thus also measures `$BF$`.[^1] And ($E$) also measures the whole of `$BA$`.
* Thus, ($E$) will also measure the remainder `$AF$`.[^2] And `$AF$` measures `$DG$`.
* Thus, `$E$` also measures `$DG$`.
* And ($E$) also measures the whole of `$DC$`.
* Thus, ($E$) will also measure the remainder `$CG$`.
* And `$CG$` measures `$FH$`.
* Thus, `$E$` also measures `$FH$`.
* And ($E$) also measures the whole of `$FA$`.
* Thus, ($E$) will also measure the remaining [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$AH$`, (despite) being a number.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, some number does not measure (both) the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` and `$CD$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: Here, use is made of the unstated common notion that if `$a$` measures `$b$`, and `$b$` measures `$c$`, then `$a$` also measures `$c$`, where all symbols denote [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] (translator's note).

[^2]: Here, use is made of the unstated common notion that if `$a$` measures `$b$`, and `$a$` measures [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$b$`, then `$a$` also measures the remainder of `$b$`, where all symbols denote [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] (translator's note).
