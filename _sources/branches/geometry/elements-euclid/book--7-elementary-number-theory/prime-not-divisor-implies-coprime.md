### (Proposition 29 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Every [prime number][bookofproofs$704] is [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] every number which it does not measure.
* Let `$A$` be a [prime number][bookofproofs$704], and let it not measure `$B$`.
* I say that `$B$` and `$A$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
