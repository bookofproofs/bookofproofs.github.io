### (Proposition 24 from Book 7 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] some number then the number created from (multiplying) the former (two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) will also be [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] the latter (number).
* For let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] (which are both) [prime to][bookofproofs$1288] some number `$C$`.
* And let `$A$` make `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` and `$D$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].

### Modern Formulation

If `$A$` and `$B$` are both [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093] to `$C,$` then also the product `$AB$` is co-prime to `$C.$`
