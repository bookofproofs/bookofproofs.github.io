* For `$CD$` is not [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$A$`.
* For, if possible, let it be ([parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$A$`).
* Thus, `$EF$` is also the same [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$B$` that `$CD$` (is) of `$A$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328], [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343].
* Thus, as many [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$A$` as are in `$CD$`, so many [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$B$` are also in `$EF$`.
* Let `$CD$` have been divided into the [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$A$`, `$CG$` and `$GD$`, and `$EF$` into the [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$B$`, `$EH$` and `$HF$`.
* So the multitude of (divisions) `$CG$`, `$GD$` will be equal to the multitude of (divisions) `$EH$`, `$HF$`.
* And since the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$CG$` and `$GD$` are equal to one another, and the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$EH$` and `$HF$` are also equal to one another, and the multitude of (divisions) `$CG$`, `$GD$` is equal to the multitude of (divisions) `$EH$`, `$HF$`, thus as `$CG$` is to `$EH$`, so `$GD$` (is) to `$HF$`.
* Thus, as one of the leading ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] is) to one of the following, so will (the sum of) all of the leading ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) be to (the sum of) all of the following [[Prop. 7.12]][bookofproofs$2342].
* Thus, as `$CG$` is to `$EH$`, so `$CD$` (is) to `$EF$`.
* Thus, `$CG$` and `$EH$` are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$CD$` and `$EF$`, being less than them.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* For `$CD$` and `$EF$` were assumed (to be) the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.
* Thus, `$CD$` is not [parts][bookofproofs$2323] of `$A$`.
* Thus, (it is) a [part][bookofproofs$703] (of `$A$`) [[Prop. 7.4]][bookofproofs$2334].
* And `$EF$` is the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$B$` that `$CD$` (is) of `$A$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328], [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343].
* Thus, `$CD$` measures `$A$` the same number of times that `$EF$` (measures) `$B$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
