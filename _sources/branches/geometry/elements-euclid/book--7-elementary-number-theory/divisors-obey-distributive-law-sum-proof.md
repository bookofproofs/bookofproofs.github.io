* For since which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$A$` is of `$BC$`, `$D$` is the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$EF$`, thus as many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] as are in `$BC$` equal to `$A$`, so many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are also in `$EF$` equal to `$D$`.
* Let `$BC$` have been divided into `$BG$` and `$GC$`, equal to `$A$`, and `$EF$` into `$EH$` and `$HF$`, equal to `$D$`.
* So the multitude of (divisions) `$BG$`, `$GC$` will be equal to the multitude of (divisions) `$EH$`, `$HF$`.
* And since `$BG$` is equal to `$A$`, and `$EH$` to `$D$`, thus `$BG$`, `$EH$` (is) also equal to `$A$`, `$D$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$GC$`, `$HF$` (is) also (equal) to `$A$`, `$D$`.
* Thus, as many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] as [are] in `$BC$` equal to `$A$`, so many are also in `$BC$`, `$EF$` equal to `$A$`, `$D$`.
* Thus, as many times as `$BC$` is (divisible) by `$A$`, so many times is the sum `$BC$`, `$EF$` also (divisible) by the sum `$A$`, `$D$`.
* Thus, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$A$` is of `$BC$`, the sum `$A$`, `$D$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of the sum `$BC$`, `$EF$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
