* For since `$A$` has made `$D$` (by) multiplying `$C$`, `$C$` has thus also made `$D$` (by) multiplying `$A$` [[Prop. 7.16]][bookofproofs$2346].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$C$` has also made `$E$` (by) multiplying `$B$`.
* So the number `$C$` has made `$D$` and `$E$` (by) multiplying the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively).
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
