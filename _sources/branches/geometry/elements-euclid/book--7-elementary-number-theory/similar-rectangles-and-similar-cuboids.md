> **Similar** [plane][bookofproofs$2324] and [solid numbers][bookofproofs$2325] are those having [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] sides.


### Modern Definitions 

Two [rectangles][bookofproofs$909] with the integer side lengths `\(a,b\)` and `\(c,d\)` are called **similar**, if the [ratios][bookofproofs$1033] of their sides are [proportional numbers][bookofproofs$2328], i.e. 

`\[\frac ab\sim \frac cd\Longleftrightarrow ad=cb.\]`

Two **cuboids** with integer side lengths `\(a,b,c\)` and `\(d,e,f\)` are called **similar**, if the [ratios][bookofproofs$1033] of their respective sides are [proportional numbers][bookofproofs$2328], i.e. 

`\[\frac ab\sim \frac de\Longleftrightarrow ae=db,
\frac ac\sim \frac df\Longleftrightarrow af=dc.\]`

### Notes

* Nowadays, the term [similarity][bookofproofs$2782] is related to geometrical figures rather than numbers. 
* However, the numerical proportions of the sides of rectilinear figures are indeed a defining property of similar rectilinear figures, as it was already demonstrated by Euclid in the previous Book 6 for triangles ([Prop 6.04][bookofproofs$1990] and [Prop 6.05][bookofproofs$1991]).
