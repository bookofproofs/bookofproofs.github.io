* For which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$AE$` is of `$CF$`, let `$EB$` also be the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$CG$`.
* And since which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$AE$` is of `$CF$`, `$EB$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$CG$`, thus which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$AE$` is of `$CF$`, `$AB$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$GF$` [[Prop. 7.5]][bookofproofs$2335].
* And which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$AE$` is of `$CF$`, `$AB$` is also assumed (to be) the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$CD$`.
* Thus, also, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$AB$` is of `$GF$`, ($AB$) is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$GF$` is equal to `$CD$`.
* Let `$CF$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remainder `$GC$` is equal to the remainder `$FD$`.
* And since which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$AE$` is of `$CF$`, `$EB$` [is] also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$GC$`, and `$GC$` (is) equal to `$FD$`, thus which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$AE$` is of `$CF$`, `$EB$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$FD$`.
* But, which(ever) [part][bookofproofs$703] `$AE$` is of `$CF$`, `$AB$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of `$CD$`.
* Thus, the remainder `$EB$` is also the same [part][bookofproofs$703] of the remainder `$FD$` that the whole `$AB$` (is) of the whole `$CD$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
