* For since `$A$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`, `$B$` thus measures `$D$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$A$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$F$` also measures the number `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it.
* Thus, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$F$` measures the number `$A$` as many times as `$B$` (measures) `$D$`.
* Thus, as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$F$` is to the number `$A$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$D$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* And so, for the same (reasons), as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$F$` (is) to the number `$A$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$E$`.
* And thus, as `$B$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$E$`.
* Thus, alternately, as `$B$` is to `$C$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
