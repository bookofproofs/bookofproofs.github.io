* For let the least (number), `$D$`, measured by the two ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) `$A$` and `$B$` have been taken [[Prop. 7.34]][bookofproofs$2364].
* So `$C$` either measures, or does not measure, `$D$`.
* Let it, first of all, measure ($D$).
* And `$A$` and `$B$` also measure `$D$`.
* Thus, `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` (all) measure `$D$`.
* So I say that ($D$ is) also the least (number measured by `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`).
* For if not, `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` will (all) measure [some] number which is less than `$D$`.
* Let them measure `$E$` (which is less than `$D$`).
* Since `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` (all) measure `$E$` then `$A$` and `$B$` thus also measure `$E$`.
* Thus, the least (number) measured by `$A$` and `$B$` will also measure [$E$] [[Prop. 7.35]][bookofproofs$2365].
* And `$D$` is the least (number) measured by `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, `$D$` will measure `$E$`, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` cannot (all) measure some number which is less than `$D$`.
* Thus, `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` (all) measure the least (number) `$D$`.
* So, again, let `$C$` not measure `$D$`.
* And let the least number, `$E$`, measured by `$C$` and `$D$` have been taken [[Prop. 7.34]][bookofproofs$2364].
* Since `$A$` and `$B$` measure `$D$`, and `$D$` measures `$E$`, `$A$` and `$B$` thus also measure `$E$`.
* And `$C$` also measures [$E$].
* Thus, `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` [also] measure `$E$`.
* So I say that ($E$ is) also the least (number measured by `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`).
* For if not, `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` will (all) measure some (number) which is less than `$E$`.
* Let them measure `$F$` (which is less than `$E$`).
* Since `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` (all) measure `$F$`, `$A$` and `$B$` thus also measure `$F$`.
* Thus, the least (number) measured by `$A$` and `$B$` will also measure `$F$` [[Prop. 7.35]][bookofproofs$2365].
* And `$D$` is the least (number) measured by `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, `$D$` measures `$F$`.
* And `$C$` also measures `$F$`.
* Thus, `$D$` and `$C$` (both) measure `$F$`.
* Hence, the least (number) measured by `$D$` and `$C$` will also measure `$F$` [[Prop. 7.35]][bookofproofs$2365].
* And `$E$` is the least (number) measured by `$C$` and `$D$`.
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$F$`, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` cannot measure some number which is less than `$E$`.
* Thus, `$E$` (is) the least (number) which is measured by `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
