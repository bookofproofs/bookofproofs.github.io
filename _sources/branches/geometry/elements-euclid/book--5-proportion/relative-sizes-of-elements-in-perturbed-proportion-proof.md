* And if ($A$ is) equal (to `$C$` then `$D$` will also be) equal (to `$F$`).
* And if ($A$ is) less (than `$C$` then `$D$` will also be) less (than `$F$`).
* For since `$A$` is greater than `$C$`, and `$B$` some other (magnitude), `$A$` thus has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to `$B$` than `$C$` (has) to `$B$` [[Prop. 5.8]][bookofproofs$1965].
* But as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
* And, inversely, as `$C$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$D$` [ [Prop. 5.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6451].
* Thus, `$E$` also has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to `$F$` than `$E$` (has) to `$D$` [[Prop. 5.13]][bookofproofs$1970].
* And that (magnitude) to which the same (magnitude) has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] is (the) lesser (magnitude) [[Prop. 5.10]][bookofproofs$1967].
* Thus, `$F$` is less than `$D$`.
* Thus, `$D$` is greater than `$F$`.
* Similarly, we can show that even if `$A$` is equal to `$C$` then `$D$` will also be equal to `$F$`, and even if ($A$ is) less (than `$C$` then `$D$` will also be) less (than `$F$`).
* Thus, if there are three magnitudes, and others of equal number to them, (being) also in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] taken two by two, and (if) their proportion (is) [perturbed][bookofproofs$1957], and (if), [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], the first is greater than the third then the fourth will also be greater than the sixth.
* And if (the first is) equal (to the third then the fourth will also be) equal (to the sixth).
* And if (the first is) less (than the third then the fourth will also be) less (than the sixth).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
