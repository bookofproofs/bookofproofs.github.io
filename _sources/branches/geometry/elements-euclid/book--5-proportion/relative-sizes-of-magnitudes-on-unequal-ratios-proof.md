* For if not, `$A$` is surely either equal to or less than `$B$`.
* In fact, `$A$` is not equal to `$B$`.
* For (then) `$A$` and `$B$` would each have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to `$C$` [[Prop. 5.7]][bookofproofs$1964].
* But they do not.
* Thus, `$A$` is not equal to `$B$`.
* Neither, indeed, is `$A$` less than `$B$`.
* For (then) `$A$` would have a lesser ratio to `$C$` than `$B$` (has) to `$C$` [[Prop. 5.8]][bookofproofs$1965].
* But it does not.
* Thus, `$A$` is not less than `$B$`.
* And it was shown not (to be) equal either.
* Thus, `$A$` is greater than `$B$`.
* So, again, let `$C$` have a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to `$B$` than `$C$` (has) to `$A$`.
* I say that `$B$` is less than `$A$`.
* For if not, (it is) surely either equal or greater.
* In fact, `$B$` is not equal to `$A$`.
* For (then) `$C$` would have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to each of `$A$` and `$B$` [[Prop. 5.7]][bookofproofs$1964].
* But it does not.
* Thus, `$A$` is not equal to `$B$`.
* Neither, indeed, is `$B$` greater than `$A$`.
* For (then) `$C$` would have a lesser ratio to `$B$` than (it has) to `$A$` [[Prop. 5.8]][bookofproofs$1965].
* But it does not.
* Thus, `$B$` is not greater than `$A$`.
* And it was shown that (it is) not equal (to `$A$`) either.
* Thus, `$B$` is less than `$A$`.
* Thus, for (magnitudes) [having a ratio][bookofproofs$6441] to the same (magnitude), that (magnitude which) has the [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] is (the) greater.
* And that (magnitude) to which the latter (magnitude) has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] is (the) lesser.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
