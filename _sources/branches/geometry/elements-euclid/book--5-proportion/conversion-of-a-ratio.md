> A **conversion of a ratio** is a taking of the (ratio of the) leading (magnitude) to the excess by which the leading (magnitude) exceeds the following.

### Modern Formulation

In other words, given a [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta\)` with `\(\alpha > \beta\)`,

`\[\frac\alpha\beta,\]` 

the **conversion of the ratio** is given by

`\[\frac\alpha{\alpha-\beta}.\]`
