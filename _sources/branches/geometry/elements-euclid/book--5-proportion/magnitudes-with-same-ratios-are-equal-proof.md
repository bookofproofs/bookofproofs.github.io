* For if not, `$A$` and `$B$` would not each have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to `$C$` [[Prop. 5.8]][bookofproofs$1965].
* But they do.
* Thus, `$A$` is equal to `$B$`.
* So, again, let `$C$` have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to each of `$A$` and `$B$`.
* I say that `$A$` is equal to `$B$`.
* For if not, `$C$` would not have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to each of `$A$` and `$B$` [[Prop. 5.8]][bookofproofs$1965].
* But it does.
* Thus, `$A$` is equal to `$B$`.
* Thus, (magnitudes) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to the same (magnitude) are equal to one another.
* And those (magnitudes) to which the same (magnitude) has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] are equal.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
