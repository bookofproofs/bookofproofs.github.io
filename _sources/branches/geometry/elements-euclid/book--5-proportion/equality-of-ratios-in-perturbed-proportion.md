### (Proposition 23 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If there are three magnitudes, and others of equal number to them, (being) in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] taken two by two, and (if) their proportion is [perturbed][bookofproofs$1957], then they will also be in the same [ratio via equality][bookofproofs$1956].
* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` be three magnitudes, and `$D$`, `$E$` and `$F$` other (magnitudes) of equal number to them, (being) in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] taken two by two.
* And let their proportion be [perturbed][bookofproofs$1957], (so that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`, and as `$B$` (is) to `$C$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$`.
* I say that as `$A$` is to `$C$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$F$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\epsilon\zeta\text{ and }\frac\beta\gamma=\frac\delta\epsilon,\]` then `\[\frac\alpha\gamma=\frac\delta\zeta,\]`

for all [positive real  numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\epsilon,\zeta\)`.
