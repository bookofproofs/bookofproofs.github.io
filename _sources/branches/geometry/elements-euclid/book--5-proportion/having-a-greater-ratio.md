### (Definition 7 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> And when for equal [multiples][bookofproofs$1275] (as in [Def. 5)][bookofproofs$1945], the [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of the first (magnitude) exceeds the [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of the second, and the [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of the third (magnitude) does not exceed the [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of the fourth, then the first (magnitude) is said to **have a greater ratio** to the second than the third (magnitude has) to the fourth.

### Modern Formulation

For all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)`, if there is [natural number][bookofproofs$718]  `$n>0$` such that `$n\alpha > \beta$` and `$n\gamma\le \delta$` then
`\[\frac\alpha\beta > \frac\gamma\delta.\]`
