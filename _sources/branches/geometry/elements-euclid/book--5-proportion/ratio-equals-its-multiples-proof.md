* For since `$AB$` and `$DE$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$C$` and `$F$` (respectively), thus as many magnitudes as there are in `$AB$` equal to `$C$`, so many (are there) also in `$DE$` equal to `$F$`.
* Let `$AB$` have been divided into (magnitudes) `$AG$`, `$GH$`, `$HB$`, equal to `$C$`, and `$DE$` into (magnitudes) `$DK$`, `$KL$`, `$LE$`, equal to `$F$`.
* So, the number of (magnitudes) `$AG$`, `$GH$`, `$HB$` will equal the number of (magnitudes) `$DK$`, `$KL$`, `$LE$`.
* And since `$AG$`, `$GH$`, `$HB$` are equal to one another, and `$DK$`, `$KL$`, `$LE$` are also equal to one another, thus as `$AG$` is to `$DK$`, so `$GH$` (is) to `$KL$`, and `$HB$` to `$LE$` [[Prop. 5.7]][bookofproofs$1964].
* And, thus (for [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] magnitudes), as one of the leading (magnitudes) will be to one of the following, so all of the leading (magnitudes will be) to all of the following [[Prop. 5.12]][bookofproofs$1969].
* Thus, as `$AG$` is to `$DK$`, so `$AB$` (is) to `$DE$`.
* And `$AG$` is equal to `$C$`, and `$DK$` to `$F$`.
* Thus, as `$C$` is to `$F$`, so `$AB$` (is) to `$DE$`.
* Thus, [parts][bookofproofs$2316] have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as similar [multiples][bookofproofs$6440], taken in [corresponding][bookofproofs$1950] order.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
