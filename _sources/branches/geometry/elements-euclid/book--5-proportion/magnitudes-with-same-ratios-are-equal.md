### (Proposition 9 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> (Magnitudes) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to the same (magnitude) are equal to one another. And those (magnitudes) to which the same (magnitude) has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] are equal.

* For let `$A$` and `$B$` each have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to `$C$`.
* I say that `$A$` is equal to `$B$`.
* So, again, let `$C$` have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to each of `$A$` and `$B$`.
* I say that `$A$` is equal to `$B$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `\(\alpha =\beta\)` then `\[\frac\alpha\gamma = \frac\beta\gamma\]` 
and if 
`\[\frac\gamma\alpha = \frac\gamma\beta\]` then `\(\alpha =\beta\)` for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\)`.

### Generalized Formulation

The above proposition is true for all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] with `\(\alpha\neq 0, \beta\neq 0, \gamma\neq 0\)`, since it follows from the [existence][bookofproofs$42] and [uniqueness][bookofproofs$51] of inverse real numbers with respect to multiplication.
