### (Proposition 15 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> [Parts][bookofproofs$2316] have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as similar [multiples][bookofproofs$6440], taken in [corresponding][bookofproofs$1950] order.
* For let `$AB$` and `$DE$` be equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$C$` and `$F$` (respectively).
* I say that as `$C$` is to `$F$`, so `$AB$` (is) to `$DE$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac{m\,\alpha}{m\,\beta},\]`

for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha\)`, `\(\beta\)`, and all [multiples of aliquot parts][bookofproofs$2316] `\(m > 1\)`.

### Generalized Modern Formulation

since `$\frac mm=1$`, this follows immediately from the [existence][bookofproofs$40] and [uniqueness of real 1][bookofproofs$48].
