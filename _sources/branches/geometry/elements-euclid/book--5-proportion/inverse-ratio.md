> An **inverse ratio** is a taking of the ([ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of the) following (magnitude) as the leading and the leading (magnitude) as the following.

### Modern Formulation

In other words, given a [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta\)`:

`\[\frac\alpha\beta,\]` 

the **inverse ratio** (or **reciprocal ratio**) is given by

`\[\frac\beta\alpha.\]`
