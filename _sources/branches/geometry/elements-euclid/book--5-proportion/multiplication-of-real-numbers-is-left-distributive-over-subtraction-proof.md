* For as many times as `$AE$` is (divisible) by `$CF$`, so many times let `$EB$` also have been made (divisible) by `$CG$`.
* And since `$AE$` and `$EB$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$CF$` and `$GC$` (respectively), `$AE$` and `$AB$` are thus equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$CF$` and `$GF$` (respectively) [[Prop. 5.1]][bookofproofs$1958].
* And `$AE$` and `$AB$` are assumed (to be) equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$CF$` and `$CD$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$AB$` is an equal [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of each of `$GF$` and `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$GF$` (is) equal to `$CD$`.
* Let `$CF$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remainder `$GC$` is equal to the remainder `$FD$`.
* And since `$AE$` and `$EB$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$CF$` and `$GC$` (respectively), and `$GC$` (is) equal to `$DF$`, `$AE$` and `$EB$` are thus equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$CF$` and `$FD$` (respectively).
* And `$AE$` and `$AB$` are assumed (to be) equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$CF$` and `$CD$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$EB$` and `$AB$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$FD$` and `$CD$` (respectively).
* Thus, the remainder `$EB$` will also be the same [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of the remainder `$FD$` as that which the whole `$AB$` (is) of the whole `$CD$` (respectively).
* Thus, if a magnitude is the same [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of a magnitude that a ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away (is) of a ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away (respectively) then the remainder will also be the same [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of the remainder as that which the whole (is) of the whole (respectively).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
