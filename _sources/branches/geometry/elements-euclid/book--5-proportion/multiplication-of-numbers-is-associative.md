### (Proposition 3 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a first (magnitude) and a third are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of a second and a fourth (respectively), and equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] are taken of the first and the third, then, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], the (magnitudes) taken will also be equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second (magnitude) and the fourth, respectively.
* For let a first (magnitude) `$A$` and a third `$C$` be equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of a second `$B$` and a fourth `$D$` (respectively), and let the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$EF$` and `$GH$` have been taken of `$A$` and `$C$` (respectively).
* I say that `$EF$` and `$GH$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$B$` and `$D$` (respectively).

### Modern Formulation

If we are given two[^1] [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha\)`, `\(\beta\)`, and the following [multiples of aliquot parts][bookofproofs$2316] `\(m\ge 1\)`, `\(n\ge 1\)`:
`\[m\alpha=m\beta,\quad n(m\alpha)=n(m\beta)\quad\quad( * )\]`
then it follows 
`\[(nm)\alpha=(nm)\beta.\]`

### General Modern Formulation

See [multiplication of real numbers is associative][bookofproofs$37].
[^1]: From a geometrical point of view, `\(\alpha,\beta\)` could e.g. mean the lengths of some segments, the areas of some plane figures or the volumes of some solids.
