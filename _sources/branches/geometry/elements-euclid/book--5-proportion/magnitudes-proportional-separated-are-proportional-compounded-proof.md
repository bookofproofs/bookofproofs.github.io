* For if (it is) not (the case that) as `$AB$` is to `$BE$`, so `$CD$` (is) to `$FD$`, then it will surely be (the case that) as `$AB$` (is) to `$BE$`, so `$CD$` is either to some (magnitude) less than `$DF$`, or (some magnitude) greater (than `$DF$`).[^1]
* Let it, first of all, be to (some magnitude) less (than `$DF$`), (namely) `$DG$`.
* And since [composed][bookofproofs$1953] magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442], (so that) as `$AB$` is to `$BE$`, so `$CD$` (is) to `$DG$`, they will thus also be [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] (when) [separated][bookofproofs$1954] [[Prop. 5.17]][bookofproofs$1974].
* Thus, as `$AE$` is to `$EB$`, so `$CG$` (is) to `$GD$`.
* But it was also assumed that as `$AE$` (is) to `$EB$`, so `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$`.
* Thus, (it is) also (the case that) as `$CG$` (is) to `$GD$`, so `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* And the first (magnitude) `$CG$` (is) greater than the third `$CF$`.
* Thus, the second (magnitude) `$GD$` (is) also greater than the fourth `$FD$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* But (it is) also less.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, (it is) not (the case that) as `$AB$` is to `$BE$`, so `$CD$` (is) to less than `$FD$`.
* Similarly, we can show that neither (is it the case) to greater (than `$FD$`).
* Thus, (it is the case) to the same (as `$FD$`).
* Thus, if [separated][bookofproofs$1954] magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] then they will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] (when) [composed][bookofproofs$1953].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: Here, Euclid assumes, without proof, that a fourth magnitude [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] to three given magnitudes can always be found (translator's note)
