> (Those) magnitudes are said to **have a ratio** with respect to one another which, being multiplied, are capable of exceeding one another.

### Modern Formulation

Two [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta\)` **have a ratio** if there is a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `$n$` such that `$n  \alpha > \beta$`.
