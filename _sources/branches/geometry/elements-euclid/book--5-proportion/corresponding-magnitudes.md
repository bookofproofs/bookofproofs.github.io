> These magnitudes are said to be *corresponding[^1] (magnitudes)*: the leading to the leading (of two ratios), and the following to the following.

### Modern Formulation

Given two [ratios][bookofproofs$1943] of [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107].
`\[\frac\alpha\beta,\quad\frac\gamma\delta,\]` 

pairs of numbers `\((\alpha, \gamma)\)` and `\((\beta,\delta)\)` are called **corresponding magnitudes**.

[^1]: Literally, "double".
