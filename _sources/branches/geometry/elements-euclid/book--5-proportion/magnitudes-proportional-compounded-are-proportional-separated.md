### (Proposition 17 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If [composed][bookofproofs$1953] magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] then they will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] (when) [separated][bookofproofs$1954].

* Let `$AB$`, `$BE$`, `$CD$`, and `$DF$` be [composed][bookofproofs$1953] magnitudes (which are) [proportional][bookofproofs$6442], (so that) as `$AB$` (is) to `$BE$`, so `$CD$` (is) to `$DF$`.
* I say that they will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] (when) [separated][bookofproofs$1954], (so that) as `$AE$` (is) to `$EB$`, so `$CF$` (is) to `$DF$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `\[\frac{\alpha+\beta}\beta=\frac{\gamma+\delta}\delta,\]` then `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta,\]`

for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)`.
