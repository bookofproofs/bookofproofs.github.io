> And when four magnitudes are in [ (continued) proportion][bookofproofs$6552], the first is said to have to the fourth the *cubed[^1] ratio* of that (it has) to the second. And so on, similarly, in successive order, whatever the [ (continued) proportion][bookofproofs$6552] might be.

### Modern Formulation

The [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\delta\)` are said to be in **cubed ratio**, if there exist positive real numbers `$\beta,\gamma$` such that (\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\) are in a [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
`\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\beta\gamma=\frac\gamma\delta.\]`

Please note that in this case 

`\[\frac\alpha\delta=\frac{\alpha^3}{\beta^3},\]` which explains the name "cubed ratio".

In general, if a [proportion in `\(n\)` terms][bookofproofs$6442] holds  for some [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha_0,\ldots,\alpha_n\)`

`\[\frac{\alpha_0}{\alpha_1}=\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_2}=\ldots=\frac{\alpha_{n-1}}{\alpha_{n}},\quad\quad ( * )\]` 

then the ratio `\[\frac{\alpha_0}{\alpha_{n}}=\left(\frac{\alpha_0}{\alpha_1}\right)^n,\quad\quad ( * * )\]` is said to be in *`\(n\)`-th continued ratio*.

Note that the formula in `\( ( * ) \)` is a special case of the [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], as we can write for `\( ( * * ) \)` the equivalent formula

`\[\alpha_{n}=\alpha_0\left(\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_0}\right)^n.\]`
