* For since `$A$` is greater than `$C$`, and `$B$` (is) another random [magnitude], `$A$` thus has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to `$B$` than `$C$` (has) to `$B$` [[Prop. 5.8]][bookofproofs$1965].
* And as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* Thus, `$C$` also has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to `$D$` than `$C$` (has) to `$B$`.
* And that (magnitude) to which the same (magnitude) has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] is the lesser [[Prop. 5.10]][bookofproofs$1967].
* Thus, `$D$` (is) less than `$B$`.
* Hence, `$B$` is greater than `$D$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that even if `$A$` is equal to `$C$` then `$B$` will also be equal to `$D$`, and even if `$A$` is less than `$C$` then `$B$` will also be less than `$D$`.
* Thus, if a first (magnitude) has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to a second that a third (has) to a fourth, and the first (magnitude) is greater than the third, then the second will also be greater than the fourth.
* And if (the first magnitude is) equal (to the third then the second will also be) equal (to the fourth).
* And if (the first magnitude is) less (than the third then the second will also be) less (than the fourth).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
