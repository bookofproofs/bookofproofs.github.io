* For since `$AB$` is greater than `$C$`, let `$BE$` be made equal to `$C$`.
* So, the lesser of `$AE$` and `$EB$`, being multiplied, will sometimes be greater than `$D$` [ [Def. 5.4] ][bookofproofs$6441].
* First of all, let `$AE$` be less than `$EB$`, and let `$AE$` have been multiplied, and let `$FG$` be a [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of it which (is) greater than `$D$`.
* And as many times as `$FG$` is (divisible) by `$AE$`, so many times let `$GH$` also have become (divisible) by `$EB$`, and `$K$` by `$C$`.
* And let the double [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] `$L$` of `$D$` have been taken, and the triple [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] `$M$`, and several more, (each increasing) in order by one, until the ([multiple][bookofproofs$1275]) taken becomes the first [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of `$D$` (which is) greater than `$K$`.
* Let it have been taken, and let it also be the quadruple [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] `$N$` of `$D$` - the first ([multiple][bookofproofs$1275]) greater than `$K$`.
* Therefore, since `$K$` is less than `$N$` first, `$K$` is thus not less than `$M$`.
* And since `$FG$` and `$GH$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AE$` and `$EB$` (respectively), `$FG$` and `$FH$` are thus equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AE$` and `$AB$` (respectively) [[Prop. 5.1]][bookofproofs$1958].
* And `$FG$` and `$K$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AE$` and `$C$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$FH$` and `$K$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AB$` and `$C$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$FH$`, `$K$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AB$`, `$C$`.
* Again, since `$GH$` and `$K$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$EB$` and `$C$`, and `$EB$` (is) equal to `$C$`, `$GH$` (is) thus also equal to `$K$`.
* And `$K$` is not less than `$M$`.
* Thus, `$GH$` not less than `$M$` either.
* And `$FG$` (is) greater than `$D$`.
* Thus, the whole of `$FH$` is greater than `$D$` and `$M$` (added) together.
* But, `$D$` and `$M$` (added) together is equal to `$N$`, inasmuch as `$M$` is three times `$D$`, and `$M$` and `$D$` (added) together is four times `$D$`, and `$N$` is also four times `$D$`.
* Thus, `$M$` and `$D$` (added) together is equal to `$N$`.
* But, `$FH$` is greater than `$M$` and `$D$`.
* Thus, `$FH$` exceeds `$N$`.
* And `$K$` does not exceed `$N$`.
* And `$FH$`, `$K$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AB$`, `$C$`, and `$N$` another random [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of `$D$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to `$D$` than `$C$` (has) to `$D$` [ [Def. 5.7] ][bookofproofs$1946].
* So, I say that `$D$` also has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to `$C$` than `$D$` (has) to `$AB$`.
* For, similarly, by the same construction, we can show that `$N$` exceeds `$K$`, and `$N$` does not exceed `$FH$`.
* And `$N$` is a [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of `$D$`, and `$FH$`, `$K$` other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AB$`, `$C$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$D$` has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to `$C$` than `$D$` (has) to `$AB$` [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* And so let `$AE$` be greater than `$EB$`.
* So, the lesser, `$EB$`, being multiplied, will sometimes be greater than `$D$`.
* Let it have been multiplied, and let `$GH$` be a [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of `$EB$` (which is) greater than `$D$`.
* And as many times as `$GH$` is (divisible) by `$EB$`, so many times let `$FG$` also have become (divisible) by `$AE$`, and `$K$` by `$C$`.
* So, similarly (to the above), we can show that `$FH$` and `$K$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AB$` and `$C$` (respectively).
* And, similarly (to the above), let the [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] `$N$` of `$D$`, (which is) the first ([multiple][bookofproofs$1275]) greater than `$FG$`, have been taken.
* So, `$FG$` is again not less than `$M$`.
* And `$GH$` (is) greater than `$D$`.
* Thus, the whole of `$FH$` exceeds `$D$` and `$M$`, that is to say `$N$`.
* And `$K$` does not exceed `$N$`, inasmuch as `$FG$`, which (is) greater than `$GH$` - that is to say, `$K$` - also does not exceed `$N$`.
* And, following the above (arguments), we (can) complete the proof in the same manner.
* Thus, for unequal magnitudes, the greater (magnitude) has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] than the lesser to the same (magnitude).
* And the latter (magnitude) has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to the lesser (magnitude) than to the greater.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
