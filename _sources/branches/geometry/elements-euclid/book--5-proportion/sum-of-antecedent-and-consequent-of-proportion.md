### (Proposition 25 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If four magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] then the (sum of the) largest and the smallest [of them] is greater than the (sum of the) remaining two (magnitudes).
* Let `$AB$`, `$CD$`, `$E$`, and `$F$` be four [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] magnitudes, (such that) as `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
* And let `$AB$` be the greatest of them, and `$F$` the least.
* I say that `$AB$` and `$F$` is greater than `$CD$` and `$E$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `$\alpha > \beta,\gamma >\delta > 0$` and if `\[\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=\frac{\gamma}{\delta},\]` then `\[\alpha+\delta > \beta+\gamma.\]`
