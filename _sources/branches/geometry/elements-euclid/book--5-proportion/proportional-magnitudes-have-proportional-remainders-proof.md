* For since as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$AE$` (is) to `$CF$`, (it is) also (the case), alternately, (that) as `$BA$` (is) to `$AE$`, so `$DC$` (is) to `$CF$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And since [composed][bookofproofs$1953] magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] then they will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] (when) [separated][bookofproofs$1954], (so that) as `$BE$` (is) to `$EA$`, so `$DF$` (is) to `$CF$` [[Prop. 5.17]][bookofproofs$1974].
* Also, alternately, as `$BE$` (is) to `$DF$`, so `$EA$` (is) to `$FC$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And it was assumed that as `$AE$` (is) to `$CF$`, so the whole `$AB$` (is) to the whole `$CD$`.
* And, thus, as the remainder `$EB$` (is) to the remainder `$FD$`, so the whole `$AB$` will be to the whole `$CD$`.
* Thus, if as the whole is to the whole so the ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away is to the ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away then the remainder to the remainder will also be as the whole (is) to the whole.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
