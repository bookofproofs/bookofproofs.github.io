### (Corollary to Proposition 7 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So (it is) clear, from this, that if some magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] then they will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] inversely. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this corollary reads that if `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta\]` then `\[\frac\beta\alpha=\frac\delta\gamma\]`

for all [positive rational number][bookofproofs$1076]  `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)`.

### Generalized Formulation

The above corollary even for all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] with `\(\alpha\neq0, \beta\neq 0, \gamma\neq 0,\delta\neq 0\)`. Algebraically, it follows from the [existence][bookofproofs$42] and [uniqueness][bookofproofs$51] of inverse real numbers with respect to multiplication.
