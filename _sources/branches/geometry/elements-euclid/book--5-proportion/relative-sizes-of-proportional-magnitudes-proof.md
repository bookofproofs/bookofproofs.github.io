* For since there are some equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$C$` and `$E$`, and other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$D$` and `$F$`, (for which) the [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of `$C$` exceeds the ([multiple][bookofproofs$1275]) of `$D$`, and the [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of `$E$` does not exceed the [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of `$F$` [ [Def. 5.7] ][bookofproofs$1946], let them have been taken.
* And let `$G$` and `$H$` be equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$C$` and `$E$` (respectively), and `$K$` and `$L$` other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$D$` and `$F$` (respectively), such that `$G$` exceeds `$K$`, but `$H$` does not exceed `$L$`.
* And as many times as `$G$` is (divisible) by `$C$`, so many times let `$M$` be (divisible) by `$A$`.
* And as many times as `$K$` (is divisible) by `$D$`, so many times let `$N$` be (divisible) by `$B$`.
* And since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, and the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$M$` and `$G$` have been taken of `$A$` and `$C$` (respectively), and the other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$N$` and `$K$` of `$B$` and `$D$` (respectively), thus if `$M$` exceeds `$N$` then `$G$` exceeds `$K$`, and if ($M$ is) equal (to `$N$` then `$G$` is also) equal (to `$K$`), and if ($M$ is) less (than `$N$` then `$G$` is also) less (than `$K$`) [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* And `$G$` exceeds `$K$`.
* Thus, `$M$` also exceeds `$N$`.
* And `$H$` does not exceeds `$L$`.
* And `$M$` and `$H$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$A$` and `$E$` (respectively), and `$N$` and `$L$` other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$B$` and `$F$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$A$` has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to `$B$` than `$E$` (has) to `$F$` [ [Def. 5.7] ][bookofproofs$1946].
* Thus, if a first (magnitude) has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to a second that a third (has) to a fourth, and a third (magnitude) has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to a fourth than a fifth (has) to a sixth, then the first (magnitude) will also have a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to the second than the fifth (has) to the sixth.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
