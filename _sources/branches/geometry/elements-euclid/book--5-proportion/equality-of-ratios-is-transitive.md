### (Proposition 11 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> ([Ratios][bookofproofs$1943] which are) the same with the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] are also the same with one another.

* For let it be that as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, and as `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
* I say that as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta\text{ and }\frac\gamma\delta=\frac\epsilon\zeta\]` then `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\epsilon\zeta\]`

for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\epsilon,\zeta\)`.

### Generalized Formulation

see [any equality is an equivalence relation][bookofproofs$1539] (and in particular transitive)

see also [common notion 1.1][bookofproofs$6420].
The above proposition is true for all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] with `\(\beta\neq 0, \delta\neq 0, \zeta\neq 0\)`.
