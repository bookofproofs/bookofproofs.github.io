### (Proposition 5 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a magnitude is the same [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of a magnitude that a ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away (is) of a ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away (respectively) then the remainder will also be the same [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of the remainder as that which the whole (is) of the whole (respectively).
* For let the magnitude `$AB$` be the same [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of the magnitude `$CD$` that the ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away `$AE$` (is) of the ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away `$CF$` (respectively).
* I say that the remainder `$EB$` will also be the same [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of the remainder `$FD$` as that which the whole `$AB$` (is) of the whole `$CD$` (respectively).

### Modern Formulation

If we are given two [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha\)`, `\(\beta\)`,[^1] and the following [multiples of aliquot parts][bookofproofs$2316] `\(m\ge 1\)`, `\(n\ge 1\)`:
`\[\alpha m=\beta m,\quad \alpha n=\beta n\quad\quad( * )\]`
then adding both equations gives us 
`\[\alpha(m-n)=\beta m-\beta n.\]`

### General Modern Formulation

See [distributivity law for real numbers][bookofproofs$520].
[^1]: From a geometrical point of view, `\(\alpha,\beta\)` could e.g. mean the lengths of some segments, the areas of some plane figures or the volumes of some solids.
