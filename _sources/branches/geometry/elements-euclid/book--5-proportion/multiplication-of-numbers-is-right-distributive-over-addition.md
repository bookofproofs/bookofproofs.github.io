### (Proposition 2 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a first (magnitude) and a third are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of a second and a fourth (respectively), and a fifth (magnitude) and a sixth (are) also equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second and fourth (respectively), then the first (magnitude) and the fifth, being added together, and the third and the sixth, (being added together), will also be equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second (magnitude) and the fourth (respectively).
* For let a first (magnitude) `$AB$` and a third `$DE$` be equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of a second `$C$` and a fourth `$F$` (respectively).
* And let a fifth (magnitude) `$BG$` and a sixth `$EH$` also be (other) equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second `$C$` and the fourth `$F$` (respectively).
* I say that the first (magnitude) and the fifth, being added together, (to give) `$AG$`, and the third (magnitude) and the sixth, (being added together, to give) `$DH$`, will also be equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second (magnitude) `$C$` and the fourth `$F$` (respectively).

### Modern Formulation

If we are given two [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha\)`, `\(\beta\)`,[^1] and the following [multiples of aliquot parts][bookofproofs$2316] `\(m > 1\)`, `\(n > 1\)`:
`\[m\alpha=m\beta,\quad n\alpha=n\beta\quad\quad( * )\]`
then adding both equations gives us 
`\[(m+n)\alpha=m\beta+n\beta.\]`

### General Modern Formulation

See [distributivity law for real numbers][bookofproofs$520].
[^1]: From a geometrical point of view, `\(\alpha,\beta\)` could e.g. mean the lengths of some segments, the areas of some plane figures or the volumes of some solids.
