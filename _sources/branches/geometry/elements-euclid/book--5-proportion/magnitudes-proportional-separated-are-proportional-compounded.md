### (Proposition 18 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If [separated][bookofproofs$1954] magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] then they will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] (when) [composed][bookofproofs$1953].
* Let `$AE$`, `$EB$`, `$CF$`, and `$FD$` be [separated][bookofproofs$1954] magnitudes (which are) [proportional][bookofproofs$6442], (so that) as `$AE$` (is) to `$EB$`, so `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$`.
* I say that they will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] (when) [composed][bookofproofs$1953], (so that) as `$AB$` (is) to `$BE$`, so `$CD$` (is) to `$FD$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta,\]` then `\[\frac{\alpha+\beta}\beta=\frac{\gamma+\delta}\delta,\]`

for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)`.
