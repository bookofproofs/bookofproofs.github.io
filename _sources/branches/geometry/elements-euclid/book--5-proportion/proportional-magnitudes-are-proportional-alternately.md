### (Proposition 16 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If four magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] then they will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] alternately.
* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` and `$D$` be four [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] magnitudes, (such that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* I say that they will also be [[proportional][bookofproofs$6442]] alternately, (so that) as `$A$` (is) to `$C$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$D$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta,\]` then `\[\frac\alpha\gamma=\frac\beta\delta,\]`

for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)`.

### Generalized Modern Formulation

This is a special case of the fact that the [multiplication of real numbers is cancellative][bookofproofs$1575]. Since for `$\frac\beta\gamma\neq 0$`:

`$$\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta\Leftrightarrow \frac \beta\gamma \frac\alpha\beta=\frac \beta\gamma \frac\gamma\delta.$$`
