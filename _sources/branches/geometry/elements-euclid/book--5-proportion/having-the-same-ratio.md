> Magnitudes are said to be **in the same ratio**, the first to the second, and the third to the fourth, when equal [multiples][bookofproofs$1275] of the first and the third either both exceed, are both equal to, or are both less than, equal [multiples][bookofproofs$1275] of the second and the fourth, respectively, being taken in corresponding order, according to any kind of multiplication whatever.

### Modern Formulation

If for [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `$\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta$` and for any [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `$n,m,k$` we have

`$$\begin{array}{rcll}
n\alpha > \beta&\Rightarrow&n\gamma > \delta&\wedge\\
m\alpha = \beta&\Rightarrow&m\gamma =\delta&\wedge\\
k\alpha < \beta&\Rightarrow&k\gamma < \delta&\wedge\\
\end{array}$$`

then `$$\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta.$$`

This definition is the kernel of [Eudoxus](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Eudoxus/)'s theory of proportion, and is valid even if `$\alpha$`, `$\beta$`, etc., are [irrational][bookofproofs$6663].
