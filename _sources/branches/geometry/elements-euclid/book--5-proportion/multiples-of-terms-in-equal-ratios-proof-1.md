* For let equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$K$` and `$L$` have been taken of `$E$` and `$F$` (respectively), and other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$M$` and `$N$` of `$G$` and `$H$` (respectively).
* And since `$E$` and `$F$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$A$` and `$C$` (respectively), and the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$K$` and `$L$` have been taken of `$E$` and `$F$` (respectively), `$K$` and `$L$` are thus equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$A$` and `$C$` (respectively) [[Prop. 5.3]][bookofproofs$1960].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$M$` and `$N$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$B$` and `$D$` (respectively).
* And since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, and the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$K$` and `$L$` have been taken of `$A$` and `$C$` (respectively), and the other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$M$` and `$N$` of `$B$` and `$D$` (respectively), then if `$K$` exceeds `$M$` then `$L$` also exceeds `$N$`, and if ($K$ is) equal (to `$M$` then `$L$` is also) equal (to `$N$`), and if ($K$ is) less (than `$M$` then `$L$` is also) less (than `$N$`) [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* And `$K$` and `$L$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$E$` and `$F$` (respectively), and `$M$` and `$N$` other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$G$` and `$H$` (respectively).
* Thus, as `$E$` (is) to `$G$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$H$` [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* Thus, if a first (magnitude) has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to a second that a third (has) to a fourth then equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the first (magnitude) and the third will also have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second and the fourth, being taken in [corresponding][bookofproofs$1950] order, according to any kind of multiplication whatsoever.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
