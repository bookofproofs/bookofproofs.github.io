* For since `$AB$` and `$DE$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$C$` and `$F$` (respectively), thus as many (magnitudes) as (there) are in `$AB$` equal to `$C$`, so many (are there) also in `$DE$` equal to `$F$`.
* And so, for the same (reasons), as many (magnitudes) as (there) are in `$BG$` equal to `$C$`, so many (are there) also in `$EH$` equal to `$F$`.
* Thus, as many (magnitudes) as (there) are in the whole of `$AG$` equal to `$C$`, so many (are there) also in the whole of `$DH$` equal to `$F$`.
* Thus, as many times as `$AG$` is (divisible) by `$C$`, so many times will `$DH$` also be divisible by `$F$`.
* Thus, the first (magnitude) and the fifth, being added together, (to give) `$AG$`, and the third (magnitude) and the sixth, (being added together, to give) `$DH$`, will also be equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second (magnitude) `$C$` and the fourth `$F$` (respectively).
* Thus, if a first (magnitude) and a third are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of a second and a fourth (respectively), and a fifth (magnitude) and a sixth (are) also equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second and fourth (respectively), then the first (magnitude) and the fifth, being added together, and the third and sixth, (being added together), will also be equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second (magnitude) and the fourth (respectively).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
