* For let `$AG$` be made equal to `$E$`, and `$CH$` equal to `$F$`.
* In fact, since as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`, and `$E$` (is) equal to `$AG$`, and `$F$` to `$CH$`, thus as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$AG$` (is) to `$CH$`.
* And since the whole `$AB$` is to the whole `$CD$` as the ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away `$AG$` (is) to the ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away `$CH$`, thus the remainder `$GB$` will also be to the remainder `$HD$` as the whole `$AB$` (is) to the whole `$CD$` [[Prop. 5.19]][bookofproofs$1976].
* And `$AB$` (is) greater than `$CD$`.
* Thus, `$GB$` (is) also greater than `$HD$`.
* And since `$AG$` is equal to `$E$`, and `$CH$` to `$F$`, thus `$AG$` and `$F$` is equal to `$CH$` and `$E$`.
* And [since] if [equal (magnitudes) are added to unequal (magnitudes) then the wholes are unequal, thus if] `$AG$` and `$F$` are added to `$GB$`, and `$CH$` and `$E$` to `$HD$` - `$GB$` and `$HD$` being unequal, and `$GB$` greater - it is inferred that `$AB$` and `$F$` (is) greater than `$CD$` and `$E$`.
* Thus, if four magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] then the (sum of the) largest and the smallest of them is greater than the (sum of the) remaining two (magnitudes).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
