### (Corollary to Proposition 19 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

>  And since it was shown (that) as `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$`, so `$EB$` (is) to `$FD$`, (it is) also (the case), alternately, (that) as `$AB$` (is) to `$BE$`, so `$CD$` (is) to `$FD$`.
* Thus, [composed][bookofproofs$1953] magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442].
* And it was shown (that) as `$BA$` (is) to `$AE$`, so `$DC$` (is) to `$CF$`.
* And (the latter) is [converted][bookofproofs$1955] (from the former).

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this corollary reads that if `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta,\]` then `\[\frac\alpha{\alpha-\beta}=\frac\gamma{\gamma-\delta,}\]`
for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)` with `\(\alpha > \beta\)` and `\(\gamma > \delta\)`.
