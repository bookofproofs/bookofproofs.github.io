### (Proposition 22 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If there are any number of magnitudes whatsoever, and (some) other (magnitudes) of equal number to them, (which are) also in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] taken two by two, then they will also be in the same [ratio via equality][bookofproofs$1956].
* Let there be any number of magnitudes whatsoever, `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, and (some) other (magnitudes), `$D$`, `$E$`, `$F$`, of equal number to them, (which are) in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] taken two by two, (so that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, and as `$B$` (is) to `$C$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
* I say that they will also be in the same [ratio via equality][bookofproofs$1956].
* (That is, as `$A$` is to `$C$`, so `$D$` is to `$F$`.)

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\epsilon\zeta\text{ and }\frac\beta\gamma=\frac\zeta\eta\text{ and }\frac\gamma\delta=\frac\eta\theta,\]` then `\[\frac\alpha\delta=\frac\epsilon\theta,\]`

for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107]  `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\epsilon,\zeta,\eta,\theta\)`.
