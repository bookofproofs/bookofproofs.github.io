### Euclid's Formulation

> For (magnitudes) [having a ratio][bookofproofs$6441] to the same (magnitude), that > For (magnitudes) [having a ratio][bookofproofs$6441] to the same (magnitude), that (magnitude which) has the [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] is (the) greater. And that (magnitude) to which the latter (magnitude) has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] is (the) lesser.
* For let `$A$` have a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to `$C$` than `$B$` (has) to `$C$`.
* I say that `$A$` is greater than `$B$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `\[\frac\alpha\gamma > \frac\beta\gamma,\]` then 
`\[\alpha > \beta,\]` 

for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\)`.

### Generalized Modern Formulation
