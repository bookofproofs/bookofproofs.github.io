### (Proposition 6 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two magnitudes are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of two (other) magnitudes, and some ([parts][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away (from the former magnitudes) are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the latter (magnitudes, respectively), then the remainders are also either equal to the latter (magnitudes), or (are) equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of them (respectively).
* For let two magnitudes `$AB$` and `$CD$` be equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of two magnitudes `$E$` and `$F$` (respectively).
* And let the ([parts][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away (from the former) `$AG$` and `$CH$` be equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$E$` and `$F$` (respectively).
* I say that the remainders `$GB$` and `$HD$` are also either equal to `$E$` and `$F$` (respectively), or (are) equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of them.

### Modern Formulation


If we are given two [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha\)`, `\(\beta\)`,[^1] and the following [multiples of aliquot parts][bookofproofs$2316] `\(m\ge 1\)`, `\(n\ge 1\)`:
`\[m\alpha=m\beta,\quad n\alpha=n\beta\quad\quad( * )\]`
then adding both equations gives us 
`\[(m-n)\alpha=m\beta-n\beta.\]`

### General Modern Formulation

See [distributivity law for real numbers][bookofproofs$520].
[^1]: From a geometrical point of view, `\(\alpha,\beta\)` could e.g. mean the lengths of some segments, the areas of some plane figures or the volumes of some solids.
