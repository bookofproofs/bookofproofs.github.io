### (Proposition 4 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a first (magnitude) has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to a second that a third (has) to a fourth then equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the first (magnitude) and the third will also have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second and the fourth, being taken in [corresponding][bookofproofs$1950] order, according to any kind of multiplication whatsoever.
* For let a first (magnitude) `$A$` have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to a second `$B$` that a third `$C$` (has) to a fourth `$D$`.
* And let equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$E$` and `$F$` have been taken of `$A$` and `$C$` (respectively), and other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$G$` and `$H$` of `$B$` and `$D$` (respectively).
* I say that as `$E$` (is) to `$G$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$H$`.

### Modern Formulation

Given four [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)` with the equation of [ratios][bookofproofs$1943].
`\[\frac \alpha\beta=\frac \gamma\delta,\quad\quad( * )\]` 

the ratios of the corresponding [multiples of aliquot parts][bookofproofs$2316] `\(m\ge 1\)`, `\(n\ge 1\)` will also be equal:
`\[\frac{m\alpha}{n\beta}=\frac{m\gamma}{n\delta}.\]`

In other words, the equation `\((*)\)` remains valid if we multiply it by any [positive rational number][bookofproofs$1076] `\(\frac mn\)`.

### General Modern Formulation
