* For let the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$D$` and `$E$` have been taken of `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively), and the other random [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] `$F$` of `$C$`.
* Therefore, since `$D$` and `$E$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively), and `$A$` (is) equal to `$B$`, `$D$` (is) thus also equal to `$E$`.
* And `$F$` (is) different, at random.
* Thus, if `$D$` exceeds `$F$` then `$E$` also exceeds `$F$`, and if ($D$ is) equal (to `$F$` then `$E$` is also) equal (to `$F$`), and if ($D$ is) less (than `$F$` then `$E$` is also) less (than `$F$`).
* And `$D$` and `$E$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively), and `$F$` another random [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of `$C$`.
* Thus, as `$A$` (is) to `$C$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$C$` [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* So I say that `$C$`[^1] also has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to each of `$A$` and `$B$`.
* For, similarly, we can show, by the same construction, that `$D$` is equal to `$E$`.
* And `$F$` (has) some other (value).
* Thus, if `$F$` exceeds `$D$` then it also exceeds `$E$`, and if ($F$ is) equal (to `$D$` then it is also) equal (to `$E$`), and if ($F$ is) less (than `$D$` then it is also) less (than `$E$`).
* And `$F$` is a [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of `$C$`, and `$D$` and `$E$` other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, as `$C$` (is) to `$A$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$B$` [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* Thus, equal (magnitudes) have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to the same (magnitude), and the latter (magnitude has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945]) to the equal (magnitudes).
