> And a **proportion in three terms** is the smallest (possible).

### Modern Formulation

We say, the [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\)` are in a **proportion in three terms**, if they fulfil the [proportion][bookofproofs$6442].
`\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\beta\gamma.\]`
