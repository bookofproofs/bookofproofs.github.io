### (Proposition 8 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> For unequal magnitudes, the greater (magnitude) has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] than the lesser to the same (magnitude). And the latter (magnitude) has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to the lesser (magnitude) than to the greater.

* Let `$AB$` and `$C$` be unequal magnitudes, and let `$AB$` be the greater (of the two), and `$D$` another random magnitude.
* I say that `$AB$` has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to `$D$` than `$C$` (has) to `$D$`, and (that) `$D$` has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to `$C$` than (it has) to `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `\(\alpha > \beta\)` then `\[\frac\alpha\gamma > \frac\beta\gamma\]` and
`\[\frac\gamma\beta > \frac\gamma\alpha\]` 

for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\)`.

### Generalized Modern Formulation
