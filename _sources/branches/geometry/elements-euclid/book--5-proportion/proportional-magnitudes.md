> And let magnitudes having [the same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] be called **proportional**.

### Modern Formulation

Iif the [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `$\alpha$` and `$\beta$` have [the same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$\gamma$` and `$\delta$` then they are **proportional**, formally

`\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta.\]`
