A [sequence of real numbers][bookofproofs$875]  `\((\alpha_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is called a **geometric progression** (or a **continued proportion**), if its sequence members can be built recursively by `\[\begin{array}{rcl}\alpha_0&:=&\alpha\\\alpha_n&:=&\alpha\beta^n\end{array}\]`
for some fixed [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `\(\alpha,\beta\)` with `\(\beta\neq 0\)`. Thus the sequence is given by `\(\alpha,\alpha\beta,\alpha\beta^2,\alpha\beta^3\ldots\)`.

The number `\(\beta\)` is called the **common ratio** or **scale factor**.
