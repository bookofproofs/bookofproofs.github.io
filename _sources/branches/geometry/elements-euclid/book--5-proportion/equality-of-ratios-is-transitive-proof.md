* For let the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$` have been taken of `$A$`, `$C$`, `$E$` (respectively), and the other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$L$`, `$M$`, `$N$` of `$B$`, `$D$`, `$F$` (respectively).
* And since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, and the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$G$` and `$H$` have been taken of `$A$` and `$C$` (respectively), and the other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$L$` and `$M$` of `$B$` and `$D$` (respectively), thus if `$G$` exceeds `$L$` then `$H$` also exceeds `$M$`, and if ($G$ is) equal (to `$L$` then `$H$` is also) equal (to `$M$`), and if ($G$ is) less (than `$L$` then `$H$` is also) less (than `$M$`) [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* Again, since as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`, and the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$H$` and `$K$` have been taken of `$C$` and `$E$` (respectively), and the other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$M$` and `$N$` of `$D$` and `$F$` (respectively), thus if `$H$` exceeds `$M$` then `$K$` also exceeds `$N$`, and if ($H$ is) equal (to `$M$` then `$K$` is also) equal (to `$N$`), and if ($H$ is) less (than `$M$` then `$K$` is also) less (than `$N$`) [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* But (we saw that) if `$H$` was exceeding `$M$` then `$G$` was also exceeding `$L$`, and if ($H$ was) equal (to `$M$` then `$G$` was also) equal (to `$L$`), and if ($H$ was) less (than `$M$` then `$G$` was also) less (than `$L$`).
* And, hence, if `$G$` exceeds `$L$` then `$K$` also exceeds `$N$`, and if ($G$ is) equal (to `$L$` then `$K$` is also) equal (to `$N$`), and if ($G$ is) less (than `$L$` then `$K$` is also) less (than `$N$`).
* And `$G$` and `$K$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$A$` and `$E$` (respectively), and `$L$` and `$N$` other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$B$` and `$F$` (respectively).
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$` [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* Thus, (ratios which are) the same with the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] are also the same with one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
