### (Proposition 24 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a first (magnitude) has to a second the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] that third (has) to a fourth, and a fifth (magnitude) also has to the second the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] that a sixth (has) to the fourth, then the first (magnitude) and the fifth, added together, will also have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to the second that the third (magnitude) and sixth (added together, have) to the fourth.
* For let a first (magnitude) `$AB$` have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to a second `$C$` that a third `$DE$` (has) to a fourth `$F$`.
* And let a fifth (magnitude) `$BG$` also have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to the second `$C$` that a sixth `$EH$` (has) to the fourth `$F$`.
* I say that the first (magnitude) and the fifth, added together, `$AG$`, will also have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to the second `$C$` that the third (magnitude) and the sixth, (added together), `$DH$`, (has) to the fourth `$F$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if for [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)` `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta\text{ and }\frac\epsilon\beta=\frac\zeta\delta,\]` then `\[\alpha+\frac\epsilon\beta=\gamma+\frac\zeta\delta.\]`
