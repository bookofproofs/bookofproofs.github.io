### (Definition 12 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> An **alternate ratio** is a taking of the (ratio of the) leading (magnitude) to the leading (of two [equal ratios][bookofproofs$1945]), and (setting it equal to) the (ratio of the) following (magnitude) to the following.

### Modern Formulation

Given two equal [ratios][bookofproofs$1945] of [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107]:

`\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta,\]` 

the **alternate ratio** is given by

`\[\frac\alpha\gamma=\frac\beta\delta.\]`
