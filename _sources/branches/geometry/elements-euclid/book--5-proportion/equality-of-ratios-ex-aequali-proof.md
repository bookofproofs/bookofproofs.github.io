* For let the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$G$` and `$H$` have been taken of `$A$` and `$D$` (respectively), and the other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$K$` and `$L$` of `$B$` and `$E$` (respectively), and the yet other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$M$` and `$N$` of `$C$` and `$F$` (respectively).
* And since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, and the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$G$` and `$H$` have been taken of `$A$` and `$D$` (respectively), and the other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$K$` and `$L$` of `$B$` and `$E$` (respectively), thus as `$G$` is to `$K$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$L$` [[Prop. 5.4]][bookofproofs$1961].
* And, so, for the same (reasons), as `$K$` (is) to `$M$`, so `$L$` (is) to `$N$`.
* Therefore, since `$G$`, `$K$`, and `$M$` are three magnitudes, and `$H$`, `$L$`, and `$N$` other (magnitudes) of equal number to them, (which are) also in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] taken two by two, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], if `$G$` exceeds `$M$` then `$H$` also exceeds `$N$`, and if ($G$ is) equal (to `$M$` then `$H$` is also) equal (to `$N$`), and if ($G$ is) less (than `$M$` then `$H$` is also) less (than `$N$`) [[Prop. 5.20]][bookofproofs$1977].
* And `$G$` and `$H$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$A$` and `$D$` (respectively), and `$M$` and `$N$` other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$C$` and `$F$` (respectively).
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$C$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$F$` [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* Thus, if there are any number of magnitudes whatsoever, and (some) other (magnitudes) of equal number to them, (which are) also in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] taken two by two, then they will also be in the same [ratio via equality][bookofproofs$1956].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
