> And the greater (magnitude is) a [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of the lesser when it is measured by the lesser.

### Modern Formulation

A [positive real number][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\beta > 0\)` is called a **multiple** of another positive real number[^1]  `\(\alpha\)`, if there exists a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `\(k > 1\)` such that[^2] 
`\[\beta=k\cdot \alpha.\]`

[^1]: i.e. `$\beta$` is multiple of `$\alpha$` if and only if `$\alpha$` is [aliquot part][bookofproofs$2316] of `$\beta.$`
