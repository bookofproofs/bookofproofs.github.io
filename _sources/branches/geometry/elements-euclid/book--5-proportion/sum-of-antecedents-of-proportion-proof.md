* For since as `$BG$` is to `$C$`, so `$EH$` (is) to `$F$`, thus, inversely, as `$C$` (is) to `$BG$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$EH$` [ [Prop. 5.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6451].
* Therefore, since as `$AB$` is to `$C$`, so `$DE$` (is) to `$F$`, and as `$C$` (is) to `$BG$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$EH$`, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$AB$` is to `$BG$`, so `$DE$` (is) to `$EH$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* And since [separated][bookofproofs$1954] magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] then they will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] (when) [composed][bookofproofs$1953] [[Prop. 5.18]][bookofproofs$1975].
* Thus, as `$AG$` is to `$GB$`, so `$DH$` (is) to `$HE$`.
* And, also, as `$BG$` is to `$C$`, so `$EH$` (is) to `$F$`.
* Thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$AG$` is to `$C$`, so `$DH$` (is) to `$F$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* Thus, if a first (magnitude) has to a second the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] that a third (has) to a fourth, and a fifth (magnitude) also has to the second the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] that a sixth (has) to the fourth, then the first (magnitude) and the fifth, added together, will also have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to the second that the third (magnitude) and the sixth (added together, have) to the fourth.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
