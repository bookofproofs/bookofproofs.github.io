### (Definition 1 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> A **magnitude** is a **part** of a(nother) magnitude, the lesser of the greater, when it measures the greater.

### Modern Formulation

A [positive real number][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha > 0\)` is called an **aliquot part** of another positive real number[^1]  `\(\beta\)`, if there exists a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `\(k > 1\)` such that[^2] 
`\[\beta=k\cdot \alpha.\]`

 
[^1]: From a geometrical point of view, `\(\alpha\)` and `\(\beta\)` could measure the lengths of some segments, the areas of some plane figures or the volumes of some solids.

[^2]: Please note that we always have the relation `\(0 < \alpha < \beta\)`, because we require `\(k\ge 2\)`.
