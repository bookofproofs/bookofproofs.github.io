* For let the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$GH$`, `$HK$`, `$LM$`, and `$MN$` have been taken of `$AE$`, `$EB$`, `$CF$`, and `$FD$` (respectively), and the other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$KO$` and `$NP$` of `$EB$` and `$FD$` (respectively).
* And since `$GH$` and `$HK$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AE$` and `$EB$` (respectively), `$GH$` and `$GK$` are thus equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AE$` and `$AB$` (respectively) [[Prop. 5.1]][bookofproofs$1958].
* But `$GH$` and `$LM$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AE$` and `$CF$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$GK$` and `$LM$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AB$` and `$CF$` (respectively).
* Again, since `$LM$` and `$MN$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$CF$` and `$FD$` (respectively), `$LM$` and `$LN$` are thus equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$CF$` and `$CD$` (respectively) [[Prop. 5.1]][bookofproofs$1958].
* And `$LM$` and `$GK$` were equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$CF$` and `$AB$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$GK$` and `$LN$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AB$` and `$CD$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$GK$`, `$LN$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AB$`, `$CD$`.
* Again, since `$HK$` and `$MN$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$EB$` and `$FD$` (respectively), and `$KO$` and `$NP$` are also equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$EB$` and `$FD$` (respectively), then, added together, `$HO$` and `$MP$` are also equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$EB$` and `$FD$` (respectively) [[Prop. 5.2]][bookofproofs$1959].
* And since as `$AB$` (is) to `$BE$`, so `$CD$` (is) to `$DF$`, and the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$GK$`, `$LN$` have been taken of `$AB$`, `$CD$`, and the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$HO$`, `$MP$` of `$EB$`, `$FD$`, thus if `$GK$` exceeds `$HO$` then `$LN$` also exceeds `$MP$`, and if ($GK$ is) equal (to `$HO$` then `$LN$` is also) equal (to `$MP$`), and if ($GK$ is) less (than `$HO$` then `$LN$` is also) less (than `$MP$`) [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* So let `$GK$` exceed `$HO$`, and thus, `$HK$` being taken away from both, `$GH$` exceeds `$KO$`.
* But (we saw that) if `$GK$` was exceeding `$HO$` then `$LN$` was also exceeding `$MP$`.
* Thus, `$LN$` also exceeds `$MP$`, and, `$MN$` being taken away from both, `$LM$` also exceeds `$NP$`.
* Hence, if `$GH$` exceeds `$KO$` then `$LM$` also exceeds `$NP$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that even if `$GH$` is equal to `$KO$` then `$LM$` will also be equal to `$NP$`, and even if ($GH$ is) less (than `$KO$` then `$LM$` will also be) less (than `$NP$`).
* And `$GH$`, `$LM$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$AE$`, `$CF$`, and `$KO$`, `$NP$` other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$EB$`, `$FD$`.
* Thus, as `$AE$` is to `$EB$`, so `$CF$` (is) to `$FD$` [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* Thus, if [composed][bookofproofs$1953] magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] then they will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] (when) [separated][bookofproofs$1954].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
