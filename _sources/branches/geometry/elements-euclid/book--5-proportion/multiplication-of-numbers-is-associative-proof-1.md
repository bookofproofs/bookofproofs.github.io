* For since `$EF$` and `$GH$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$A$` and `$C$` (respectively), thus as many (magnitudes) as (there) are in `$EF$` equal to `$A$`, so many (are there) also in `$GH$` equal to `$C$`.
* Let `$EF$` have been divided into magnitudes `$EK$`, `$KF$` equal to `$A$`, and `$GH$` into (magnitudes) `$GL$`, `$LH$` equal to `$C$`.
* So, the number of (magnitudes) `$EK$`, `$KF$` will be equal to the number of (magnitudes) `$GL$`, `$LH$`.
* And since `$A$` and `$C$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$B$` and `$D$` (respectively), and `$EK$` (is) equal to `$A$`, and `$GL$` to `$C$`, `$EK$` and `$GL$` are thus equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$B$` and `$D$` (respectively).
* So, for the same (reasons), `$KF$` and `$LH$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$B$` and `$D$` (respectively).
* Therefore, since the first (magnitude) `$EK$` and the third `$GL$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second `$B$` and the fourth `$D$` (respectively), and the fifth (magnitude) `$KF$` and the sixth `$LH$` are also equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second `$B$` and the fourth `$D$` (respectively), then the first (magnitude) and fifth, being added together, (to give) `$EF$`, and the third (magnitude) and sixth, (being added together, to give) `$GH$`, are thus also equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second (magnitude) `$B$` and the fourth `$D$` (respectively) [[Prop. 5.2]][bookofproofs$1959].
* Thus, if a first (magnitude) and a third are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of a second and a fourth (respectively), and equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] are taken of the first and the third, then, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], the (magnitudes) taken will also be equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the second (magnitude) and the fourth, respectively.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
