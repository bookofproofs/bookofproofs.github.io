### (Proposition 7 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Equal (magnitudes) have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to the same (magnitude), and the latter (magnitude has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945]) to the equal (magnitudes).
* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be equal magnitudes, and `$C$` some other random magnitude.
* I say that `$A$` and `$B$` each have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to `$C$`, and (that) `$C$` (has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945]) to each of `$A$` and `$B$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `\(\alpha=\beta\)` and `\[\frac\alpha\gamma=\frac\beta\gamma\]` then `\[\frac\gamma\alpha=\frac\gamma\beta\]`

for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\)`.

### Generalized Formulation

The above proposition is even true for all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] with `\(\alpha\neq 0, \beta\neq 0, \gamma\neq 0\)`. Algebraically, it follows from the [existence][bookofproofs$42] and [uniqueness][bookofproofs$51] of inverse real numbers with respect to multiplication.
