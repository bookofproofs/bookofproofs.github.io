### (Proposition 13 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a first (magnitude) has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to a second that a third (has) to a fourth, and the third (magnitude) has a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to the fourth than a fifth (has) to a sixth, then the first (magnitude) will also have a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to the second than the fifth (has) to the sixth.
* For let a first (magnitude) `$A$` have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to a second `$B$` that a third `$C$` (has) to a fourth `$D$`, and let the third (magnitude) `$C$` have a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to the fourth `$D$` than a fifth `$E$` (has) to a sixth `$F$`.
* I say that the first (magnitude) `$A$` will also have a [greater ratio][bookofproofs$1946] to the second `$B$` than the fifth `$E$` (has) to the sixth `$F$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta\text{ and }\frac\gamma\delta > \frac\epsilon\zeta\]` then `\[\frac\alpha\beta > \frac\epsilon\zeta\]`

for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\epsilon,\zeta\)`.

### Generalized Modern Formulation
