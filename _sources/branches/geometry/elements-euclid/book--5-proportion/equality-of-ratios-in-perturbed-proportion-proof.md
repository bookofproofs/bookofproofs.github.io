* Let the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$G$`, `$H$`, and `$K$` have been taken of `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$D$` (respectively), and the other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$L$`, `$M$`, and `$N$` of `$C$`, `$E$`, and `$F$` (respectively).
* And since `$G$` and `$H$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively), and [parts][bookofproofs$2316] have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as similar [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] [[Prop. 5.15]][bookofproofs$1972], thus as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$H$`.
* And, so, for the same (reasons), as `$E$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$M$` (is) to `$N$`.
* And as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
* And, thus, as `$G$` (is) to `$H$`, so `$M$` (is) to `$N$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* And since as `$B$` is to `$C$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, also, alternately, as `$B$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And since `$H$` and `$K$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$B$` and `$D$` (respectively), and [parts][bookofproofs$2316] have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as similar [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] [[Prop. 5.15]][bookofproofs$1972], thus as `$B$` is to `$D$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$K$`.
* But, as `$B$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$E$`.
* And, thus, as `$H$` (is) to `$K$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Again, since `$L$` and `$M$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$C$` and `$E$` (respectively), thus as `$C$` is to `$E$`, so `$L$` (is) to `$M$` [[Prop. 5.15]][bookofproofs$1972].
* But, as `$C$` (is) to `$E$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$K$`.
* And, thus, as `$H$` (is) to `$K$`, so `$L$` (is) to `$M$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Also, alternately, as `$H$` (is) to `$L$`, so `$K$` (is) to `$M$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And it was also shown (that) as `$G$` (is) to `$H$`, so `$M$` (is) to `$N$`.
* Therefore, since `$G$`, `$H$`, and `$L$` are three magnitudes, and `$K$`, `$M$`, and `$N$` other (magnitudes) of equal number to them, (being) in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] taken two by two, and their proportion is [perturbed][bookofproofs$1957], thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], if `$G$` exceeds `$L$` then `$K$` also exceeds `$N$`, and if ($G$ is) equal (to `$L$` then `$K$` is also) equal (to `$N$`), and if ($G$ is) less (than `$L$` then `$K$` is also) less (than `$N$`) [[Prop. 5.21]][bookofproofs$1978].
* And `$G$` and `$K$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$A$` and `$D$` (respectively), and `$L$` and `$N$` of `$C$` and `$F$` (respectively).
* Thus, as `$A$` (is) to `$C$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$F$` [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* Thus, if there are three magnitudes, and others of equal number to them, (being) in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] taken two by two, and (if) their proportion is [perturbed][bookofproofs$1957], then they will also be in the same [ratio via equality][bookofproofs$1956].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
