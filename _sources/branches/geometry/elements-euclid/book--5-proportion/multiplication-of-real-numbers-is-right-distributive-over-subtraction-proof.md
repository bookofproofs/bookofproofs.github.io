* For let `$GB$` be, first of all, equal to `$E$`.
* I say that `$HD$` is also equal to `$F$`.
* For let `$CK$` be made equal to `$F$`.
* Since `$AG$` and `$CH$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$E$` and `$F$` (respectively), and `$GB$` (is) equal to `$E$`, and `$KC$` to `$F$`, `$AB$` and `$KH$` are thus equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$E$` and `$F$` (respectively) [[Prop. 5.2]][bookofproofs$1959].
* And `$AB$` and `$CD$` are assumed (to be) equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$E$` and `$F$` (respectively).
* Thus, `$KH$` and `$CD$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$F$` and `$F$` (respectively).
* Therefore, `$KH$` and `$CD$` are each equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$F$`.
* Thus, `$KH$` is equal to `$CD$`.
* Let `$CH$` have be taken away from both.
* Thus, the remainder `$KC$` is equal to the remainder `$HD$`.
* But, `$F$` is equal to `$KC$`.
* Thus, `$HD$` is also equal to `$F$`.
* Hence, if `$GB$` is equal to `$E$` then `$HD$` will also be equal to `$F$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that even if `$GB$` is a [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of `$E$` then `$HD$` will also be the same [multiple][bookofproofs$1275] of `$F$`.
* Thus, if two magnitudes are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of two (other) magnitudes, and some ([parts][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away (from the former magnitudes) are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of the latter (magnitudes, respectively), then the remainders are also either equal to the latter (magnitudes), or (are) equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of them (respectively).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
