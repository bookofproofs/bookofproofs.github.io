* For let the equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$E$` and `$F$` have been taken of `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively), and the other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] `$G$` and `$H$` of `$C$` and `$D$` (respectively).
* And since `$E$` and `$F$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively), and [parts][bookofproofs$2316] have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as similar [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] [[Prop. 5.15]][bookofproofs$1972], thus as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
* But as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* And, thus, as `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Again, since `$G$` and `$H$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$C$` and `$D$` (respectively), thus as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$H$` [[Prop. 5.15]][bookofproofs$1972].
* But as `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, [so] `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
* And, thus, as `$E$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$H$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* And if four magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442], and the first is greater than the third then the second will also be greater than the fourth, and if (the first is) equal (to the third then the second will also be) equal (to the fourth), and if (the first is) less (than the third then the second will also be) less (than the fourth) [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Thus, if `$E$` exceeds `$G$` then `$F$` also exceeds `$H$`, and if ($E$ is) equal (to `$G$` then `$F$` is also) equal (to `$H$`), and if ($E$ is) less (than `$G$` then `$F$` is also) less (than `$H$`).
* And `$E$` and `$F$` are equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively), and `$G$` and `$H$` other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of `$C$` and `$D$` (respectively).
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$C$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$D$` [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* Thus, if four magnitudes are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] then they will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] alternately.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
