> And when [three magnitudes are proportional][bookofproofs$1947], the first is said to have to the third the *squared[^1] ratio* of that (it has) to the second.

### Modern Formulation

The [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] `$\frac \alpha\gamma$` of [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `$\alpha,\gamma$` is called a **squared ratio** if there is a positive real number `$\beta$` sucht that `$\alpha,\beta,\gamma$` are in a [proportion in three terms][bookofproofs$6442].
`\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\beta\gamma.\]` 

Note: Note that in this case we have 

`\[\frac\alpha\gamma=\frac{\alpha^2}{\beta^2},\]` 

explaining the name "squared ratio".

[^1]: Literally, "double" (translator's note)
