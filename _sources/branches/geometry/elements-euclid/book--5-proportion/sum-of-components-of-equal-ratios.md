### (Proposition 12 from Book 5 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If there are any number of magnitudes whatsoever (which are) [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] then as one of the leading (magnitudes is) to one of the following, so will all of the leading (magnitudes) be to all of the following.
* Let there be any number of magnitudes whatsoever, `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$`, `$F$`, (which are) [proportional][bookofproofs$6442], (so that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, and `$E$` to `$F$`.
* I say that as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$A$`, `$C$`, `$E$` (are) to `$B$`, `$D$`, `$F$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `\[\frac\alpha{\alpha'}=\frac\beta{\beta'}=\frac\gamma{\gamma'}=\ldots.\]` 
then 
`\[\frac\alpha{\alpha'}=\frac{\alpha+\beta+\gamma+\cdots}{\alpha'+\beta'+\gamma'+\cdots},\]`

for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107].
