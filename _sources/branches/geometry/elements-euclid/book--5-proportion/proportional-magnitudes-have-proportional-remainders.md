### Euclid's Formulation

> If as the whole is to the whole so the ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away is to the ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away then the remainder to the remainder will also be as the whole (is) to the whole.

* For let the whole `$AB$` be to the whole `$CD$` as the ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away `$AE$` (is) to the ([part][bookofproofs$2316]) taken away `$CF$`.
* I say that the remainder `$EB$` to the remainder `$FD$` will also be as the whole `$AB$` (is) to the whole `$CD$`.

### Modern Formulation

In modern notation, this proposition reads that if `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac\gamma\delta,\]` then `\[\frac\alpha\beta=\frac{\alpha-\gamma}{\beta-\delta},\]`
for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\)` with `\(\alpha > \gamma\)` and `\(\beta > \delta\)`.
