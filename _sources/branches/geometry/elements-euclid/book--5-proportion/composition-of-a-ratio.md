> A **composition of a ratio** is a taking of the (ratio of the) leading plus the following (magnitudes), as one, to the following (magnitude) by itself.

### Modern Formulation

In other words, given a [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(\alpha,\beta\)`:

`\[\frac\alpha\beta,\]` 

the **composition of the ratio** is given by

`\[\frac{\alpha+\beta}\beta.\]`
