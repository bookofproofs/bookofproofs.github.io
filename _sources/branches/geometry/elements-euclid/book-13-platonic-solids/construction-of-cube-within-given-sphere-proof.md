* Let the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$AB$` of the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] be laid out, and let it have been cut at `$C$` such that `$AC$` is double `$CB$`.
* And let the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$ADB$` have been drawn on `$AB$`.
* And let `$CD$` have been drawn from `$C$` at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$`.
* And let `$DB$` have been joined.
* And let the square `$EFGH$`, having (its) side equal to `$DB$`, be laid out.
* And let `$EK$`, `$FL$`, `$GM$`, and `$HN$` have been drawn from ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$`, and `$H$`, (respectively), at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of square `$EFGH$`.
* And let `$EK$`, `$FL$`, `$GM$`, and `$HN$`, equal to one of `$EF$`, `$FG$`, `$GH$`, and `$HE$`, have been cut off from `$EK$`, `$FL$`, `$GM$`, and `$HN$`, respectively.
* And let `$KL$`, `$LM$`, `$MN$`, and `$NK$` have been joined.
* Thus, a [cube][bookofproofs$2234] contained by six equal squares has been constructed.
* So, it is also necessary to enclose it by the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223], and to show that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].

* For let `$KG$` and `$EG$` have been joined.
* And since angle `$KEG$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] - on account of `$KE$` also being at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] `$EG$`, and manifestly also to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EG$` [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212] - the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] drawn on `$KG$` will thus also pass through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`.
* Again, since `$GF$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to each of `$FL$` and `$FE$`, `$GF$` is thus also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] `$FK$` [[Prop. 11.4]][bookofproofs$2241].
* Hence, if we also join `$FK$` then `$GF$` will also be at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$FK$`.
* And, again, on account of this, the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] drawn on `$GK$` will also pass through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`.
* Similarly, it will also pass through the remaining (angular) [points][bookofproofs$631] of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* So, if `$KG$` remains (fixed), and the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] is carried around, and again established at the same (position) from which it began to be moved, then the [cube][bookofproofs$2234] will have been enclosed by a [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* So, I say that (it is) also (enclosed) by the given ([sphere][bookofproofs$2223]).
* For since `$GF$` is equal to `$FE$`, and the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$F$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` is thus double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EF$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And `$EF$` (is) equal to `$EK$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$` is double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EK$`.
* Hence, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$GE$` and `$EK$` - that is to say, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GK$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968] - is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EK$`.
* And since `$AB$` is three times `$BC$`, and as `$AB$` (is) to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994], [ [Def. 5.9] ][bookofproofs$1948], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) thus three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$GK$` was also shown (to be) three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KE$`.
* And `$KE$` was made equal to `$DB$`.
* Thus, `$KG$` (is) also equal to `$AB$`.
* And `$AB$` is the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* Thus, `$KG$` is also equal to the [diameter of the given sphere][bookofproofs$2226].
* Thus, the [cube][bookofproofs$2234] has been enclosed by the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* And it has simultaneously been shown that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
