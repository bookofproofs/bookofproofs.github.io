* Let the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429], `$AB$`, of the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] be laid out.
* And let it have been cut at `$C$`, such that `$AC$` is equal to `$CB$`, and at `$D$`, such that `$AD$` is double `$DB$`.
* And let the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$AEB$` have been drawn on `$AB$`.
* And let `$CE$` and `$DF$` have been drawn from `$C$` and `$D$` (respectively), at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$`.
* And let `$AF$`, `$FB$`, and `$EB$` have been joined.
* And since `$AD$` is double `$DB$`, `$AB$` is thus triple `$BD$`.
* Thus, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], `$BA$` is one and a half times `$AD$`.
* And as `$BA$` (is) to `$AD$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$` [ [Def. 5.9] ][bookofproofs$1948].
* For [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$AFB$` is equiangular to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$AFD$` [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` is one and a half times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AF$`.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is also one and a half times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] [[Prop. 13.13]][bookofproofs$2307].
* And `$AB$` is the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226].
* Thus, `$AF$` is equal to the side of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221].
* Again, since `$AD$` is double `$DB$`, `$AB$` is thus triple `$BD$`.
* And as `$AB$` (is) to `$BD$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$` [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994], [ [Def. 5.9] ][bookofproofs$1948].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$`.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is also three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234] [[Prop. 13.15]][bookofproofs$2309].
* And `$AB$` is the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226].
* Thus, `$BF$` is the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* And since `$AC$` is equal to `$CB$`, `$AB$` is thus double `$BC$`.
* And as `$AB$` (is) to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$` [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994], [ [Def. 5.9] ][bookofproofs$1948].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$`.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is also double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the octagon [[Prop. 13.14]][bookofproofs$2308].
* And `$AB$` is the [diameter of the given sphere][bookofproofs$2226].
* Thus, `$BE$` is the side of the octagon.
* So let `$AG$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.
* And let `$AG$` be made equal to `$AB$`.
* And let `$GC$` have been joined.
* And let `$HK$` have been drawn from `$H$`, [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$`.
* And since `$GA$` is double `$AC$`.
* For `$GA$` (is) equal to `$AB$`.
* And as `$GA$` (is) to `$AC$`, so `$HK$` (is) to `$KC$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* `$HK$` (is) thus also double `$KC$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HK$` is four times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KC$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$HK$` and `$KC$`, which is the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HC$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968], is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KC$`.
* And `$HC$` (is) equal to `$CB$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` (is) five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CK$`.
* And since `$AB$` is double `$CB$`, of which `$AD$` is double `$DB$`, the remainder `$BD$` is thus double the remainder `$DC$`.
* `$BC$` (is) thus triple `$CD$`.
* The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` (is) thus nine times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` (is) five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CK$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CK$` (is) greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$`.
* `$CK$` is thus greater than `$CD$`.
* Let `$CL$` be made equal to `$CK$`.
* And let `$LM$` have been drawn from `$L$` at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$`.
* And let `$MB$` have been joined.
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CK$`, and `$AB$` is double `$BC$`, and `$KL$` double `$CK$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is thus five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KL$`.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is also five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] from which the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] has been described [ [Prop. 13.16 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6470].
* And `$AB$` is the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226].
* Thus, `$KL$` is the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] from which the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] has been described.
* Thus, `$KL$` is (the side) of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] (inscribed) in the aforementioned [circle][bookofproofs$690] [ [Prop. 4.15 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]0.
* And since the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is composed of (the side) of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448], and two of (the sides) of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571], inscribed in the aforementioned [circle][bookofproofs$690], and `$AB$` is the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226], and `$KL$` the side of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448], and `$AK$` (is) equal to `$LB$`, thus `$AK$` and `$LB$` are each sides of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571] [inscribed in the circle][bookofproofs$1920] from which the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] has been described.
* And since `$LB$` is (the side) of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571].
* And `$ML$` (is the side) of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] - for (it is) equal to `$KL$`, since (it is) also (equal) to `$HK$`, for they are [equally far from the center][bookofproofs$1854].
* And `$HK$` and `$KL$` are each double `$KC$`.
* `$MB$` is thus (the side) of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] ([inscribed in the circle][bookofproofs$1920]) [[Prop. 13.10]][bookofproofs$2304], [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And (the side) of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is (the side) of the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] [[Prop. 13.16]][bookofproofs$2310].
* Thus, `$MB$` is (the side) of the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236].
* And since `$FB$` is the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234], let it have been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$N$`, and let `$NB$` be the greater piece.
* Thus, `$NB$` is the side of the [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237] [ [Prop. 13.17 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6471].
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] was shown (to be) one and a half times the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side, `$AF$`, of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221], and twice the [square][bookofproofs$909] on (the side), `$BE$`, of the octagon, and three times the [square][bookofproofs$909] on (the side), `$FB$`, of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234], thus, of whatever (parts) the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] (makes) six, of such (parts) the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (the side) of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] (makes) four, and (the square) on (the side) of the octagon three, and (the square) on (the side) of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234] two.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] is one and a third times the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the octagon, and double the [square][bookofproofs$909] on (the side) of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (the side) of the [octahedron][bookofproofs$2235] is one and a half times the [square][bookofproofs$909] on (the side) of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* Therefore, the aforementioned sides of the three figures - I mean, of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221], and of the [octahedron][bookofproofs$2235], and of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234] - are in [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ratios to one another.
* And (the sides of) the remaining two (figures) - I mean, of the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236], and of the [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237] - are neither in [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ratios to one another, nor to the (sides) of the aforementioned (three figures).
* For they are [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]): (namely), a [minor][bookofproofs$2170] [[Prop. 13.16]][bookofproofs$2310], and an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 13.17]][bookofproofs$2311].
* (And), we can show that the side, `$MB$`, of the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] is greater that the (side), `$NB$`, or the [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237], as follows.
* For, since [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$FDB$` is equiangular to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$FAB$` [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994], proportionally, as `$DB$` is to `$BF$`, so `$BF$` (is) to `$BA$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* And since three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are (continually) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], as the first (is) to the third, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the first (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the second [ [Def. 5.9] ][bookofproofs$1948], [ [Prop. 6.20 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]5.
* Thus, as `$DB$` is to `$BA$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DB$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$`.
* Thus, inversely, as `$AB$` (is) to `$BD$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FB$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`.
* And `$AB$` (is) triple `$BD$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FB$` (is) three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` is also four times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DB$`.
* For `$AD$` (is) double `$DB$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` (is) greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FB$`.
* Thus, `$AD$` (is) greater than `$FB$`.
* Thus, `$AL$` is much greater than `$FB$`.
* And `$KL$` is the greater piece of `$AL$`, which is cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] - inasmuch as `$LK$` is (the side) of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448], and `$KA$` (the side) of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571] [[Prop. 13.9]][bookofproofs$2303].
* And `$NB$` is the greater piece of `$FB$`, which is cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985].
* Thus, `$KL$` (is) greater than `$NB$`.
* And `$KL$` (is) equal to `$LM$`.
* Thus, `$LM$` (is) greater than `$NB$` [and `$MB$` is greater than `$LM$`].
* Thus, `$MB$`, which is (the side) of the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236], is much greater than `$NB$`, which is (the side) of the [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
* So, I say that, beside the five aforementioned figures, no other ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]) figure can be constructed (which is) contained by equilateral and equiangular ([planes][bookofproofs$647]), equal to one another.
   * For a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] cannot be constructed from two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], or indeed (two) [planes][bookofproofs$647] (of any sort) [ [Def. 11.11] ][bookofproofs$2220].
   * And (the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220]) of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] (is constructed) from three (equiangular) [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], and (that) of the [octahedron][bookofproofs$2235] from four ([triangles][bookofproofs$6432]), and (that) of the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] from (five) [triangles][bookofproofs$6432].
   * And a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] cannot be (made) from six equilateral and equiangular [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] set up together at one [point][bookofproofs$631].
   * For, since the [angles][bookofproofs$650] of a [equilateral triangle][bookofproofs$688] are (each) two-thirds of a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], the (sum of the) six (plane) [angles][bookofproofs$650] (containing the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220]) will be four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
   * The very thing (is) [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
   * For every [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] is contained by ([rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] whose sum is) less than four [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 11.21]][bookofproofs$2258].
   * So, for the same (reasons), a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] cannot be constructed from more than six [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] (equal to two-thirds of a [right angle][bookofproofs$653]) either.
   * And the ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]) angle of a [cube][bookofproofs$2234] is contained by three squares.
   * And (a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] contained) by four (squares is) impossible.
   * For, again, the (sum of the [rectilinear angles][bookofproofs$650] containing the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220]) will be four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
   * And (the [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220]) of a [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237] (is contained) by three [equilateral and equiangular pentagon][bookofproofs$6447]s.
   * And (a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] contained) by four (equiangular [pentagons][bookofproofs$6447] is) impossible.
   * For, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] of an equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] being one and one-fifth of [right angle][bookofproofs$653], four (such) [angles][bookofproofs$650] will be greater (in sum) than four [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
   * The very thing (is) [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
   * And, on account of the same absurdity, a [solid angle][bookofproofs$2220] cannot be constructed from any other (equiangular) polygonal figures either.
   * Thus, beside the five aforementioned figures, no other [solid figure][bookofproofs$2210] can be constructed (which is) contained by equilateral and equiangular ([planes][bookofproofs$647]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
