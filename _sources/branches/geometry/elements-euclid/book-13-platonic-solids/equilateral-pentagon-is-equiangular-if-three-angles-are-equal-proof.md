* For let three [angles][bookofproofs$650] of the equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$` - first of all, the consecutive ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) at `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` - -be equal to one another.
* I say that [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$` is equiangular.

* For let `$AC$`, `$BE$`, and `$FD$` have been joined.
* And since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$CB$` and `$BA$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BA$` and `$AE$`, respectively, and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$CBA$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAE$`, base `$AC$` is thus equal to base `$BE$`, and [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` equal to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABE$`, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] will be equal to the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] which the equal sides subtend [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738], (that is), `$BCA$` (equal) to `$BEA$`, and `$ABE$` to `$CAB$`.
* And hence side `$AF$` is also equal to side `$BF$` [[Prop. 1.6]][bookofproofs$743].
* And the whole of `$AC$` was also shown (to be) equal to the whole of `$BE$`.
* Thus, the remainder `$FC$` is also equal to the remainder `$FE$`.
* And `$CD$` is also equal to `$DE$`.
* So, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FC$` and `$CD$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FE$` and `$ED$` (respectively).
* And `$FD$` is their common base.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FCD$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FED$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* And `$BCA$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$AEB$`.
* And thus the whole of `$BCD$` (is) equal to the whole of `$AED$`.
* But, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BCD$` was assumed (to be) equal to the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$A$` and `$B$`.
* Thus, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$AED$` is also equal to the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$A$` and `$B$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$CDE$` is also equal to the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`.
* Thus, [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$` is equiangular.
* And so let consecutive [angles][bookofproofs$650] not be equal, but let the ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, `$C$`, and `$D$` be equal.
* I say that [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$` is also equiangular in this case.
* For let `$BD$` have been joined.
* And since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BA$` and `$AE$` are equal to the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BC$` and `$CD$`, and they contain equal [angles][bookofproofs$650], base `$BE$` is thus equal to base `$BD$`, and [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABE$` is equal to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$BCD$`, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] will be equal to the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] which the equal sides subtend [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$AEB$` is equal to (angle) `$CDB$`.
* And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BED$` is also equal to (angle) `$BDE$`, since side `$BE$` is also equal to side `$BD$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* Thus, the whole [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$AED$` is also equal to the whole [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$CDE$`.
* But, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$CDE$` was assumed (to be) equal to the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$A$` and `$C$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$AED$` is also equal to the ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) at `$A$` and `$C$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), (angle) `$ABC$` is also equal to the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$A$`, `$C$`, and `$D$`.
* Thus, [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$` is equiangular.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
