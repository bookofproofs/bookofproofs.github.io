* For let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` have been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`.
* And let `$AC$` be the greater piece.
* And let `$AC$` have been cut in half at `$D$`.
* I say that the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$`.

* For let the square `$AE$` have been described on `$AB$`.
* And let the figure have been drawn double.
* Since `$AC$` is double `$DC$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` (is) thus four times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$` - that is to say, `$RS$` (is four times) `$FG$`.
* And since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ABC$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [ [Def. 6.3] ][bookofproofs$1986], [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003], and `$CE$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ABC$`, `$CE$` is thus equal to `$RS$`.
* And `$RS$` (is) four times `$FG$`.
* Thus, `$CE$` (is) also four times `$FG$`.
* Again, since `$AD$` is equal to `$DC$`, `$HK$` is also equal to `$KF$`.
* Hence, square `$GF$` is also equal to square `$HL$`.
* Thus, `$GK$` (is) equal to `$KL$` - that is to say, `$MN$` to `$NE$`.
* Hence, `$MF$` is also equal to `$FE$`.
* But, `$MF$` is equal to `$CG$`.
* Thus, `$CG$` is also equal to `$FE$`.
* Let `$CN$` have been added to both.
* Thus, [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$OPQ$` is equal to `$CE$`.
* But, `$CE$` was shown (to be) equal to four times `$GF$`.
* Thus, [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$OPQ$` is also four times square `$FG$`.
* Thus, [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$OPQ$` plus square `$FG$` is five times `$FG$`.
* But, [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$OPQ$` plus square `$FG$` is (square) `$DN$`.
* And `$DN$` is the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DB$`, and `$GF$` the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DB$` is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
