* Let `$AB$` be a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$C$`, and let `$AC$` be the greater piece.
* I say that `$AC$` and `$CB$` is each that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].

* For let `$BA$` have been produced, and let `$AD$` be made (equal) to half of `$BA$`.
* Therefore, since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$C$`, and `$AD$`, which is half of `$AB$`, has been added to the greater piece `$AC$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` is thus five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DA$` [[Prop. 13.1]][bookofproofs$2295].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` has to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DA$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which a [number][bookofproofs$2315] (has) to a [number][bookofproofs$2315].
* The [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` (is) thus [commensurable with the (square) ][bookofproofs$2082] on on `$DA$` [[Prop. 10.6]][bookofproofs$2100].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DA$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* For `$DA$` [is] [rational][bookofproofs$2083], being half of `$AB$`, which is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` (is) also rational [ [Def. 10.4] ][bookofproofs$2084].
* Thus, `$CD$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DA$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which a [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to a [square number][bookofproofs$2326], `$CD$` (is) thus [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$DA$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Thus, `$CD$` and `$DA$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* Thus, `$AC$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* Again, since `$AB$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985], and `$AC$` is the greater piece, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is thus equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [ [Def. 6.3] ][bookofproofs$1986], [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] `$AC$`, applied to the [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$`, makes `$BC$` as width.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], applied to a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), makes a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091] as width [[Prop. 10.97]][bookofproofs$2191].
* Thus, `$CB$` is a [first apotome][bookofproofs$2091].
* And `$CA$` was also shown (to be) an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* Thus, if a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] then each of the pieces is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
