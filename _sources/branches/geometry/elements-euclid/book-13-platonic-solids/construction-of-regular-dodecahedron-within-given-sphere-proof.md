* Let two [planes][bookofproofs$647] of the aforementioned [cube][bookofproofs$2234] [[Prop. 13.15]][bookofproofs$2309], `$ABCD$` and `$CBEF$`, (which are) at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to one another, be laid out.
* And let the sides `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, `$DA$`, `$EF$`, `$EB$`, and `$FC$` have each been cut in half at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$L$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, and `$O$` (respectively).
* And let `$GK$`, `$HL$`, `$MH$`, and `$NO$` have been joined.
* And let `$NP$`, `$PO$`, and `$HQ$` have each been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$R$`, `$S$`, and `$T$` (respectively).
* And let their greater pieces be `$RP$`, `$PS$`, and `$TQ$` (respectively).
* And let `$RU$`, `$SV$`, and `$TW$` have been set up on the exterior side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234], at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$R$`, `$S$`, and `$T$` (respectively), at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [planes][bookofproofs$647] of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* And let them be made equal to `$RP$`, `$PS$`, and `$TQ$`.
* And let `$UB$`, `$BW$`, `$WC$`, `$CV$`, and `$VU$` have been joined.
* I say that the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$UBWCV$` is equilateral, and in one [plane][bookofproofs$657], and, further, equiangular.

* For let `$RB$`, `$SB$`, and `$VB$` have been joined.
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$NP$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$R$`, and `$RP$` is the greater piece, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$PN$` and `$NR$` is thus three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$RP$` [[Prop. 13.4]][bookofproofs$2298].
* And `$PN$` (is) equal to `$NB$`, and `$PR$` to `$RU$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$BN$` and `$NR$` is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$RU$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BR$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$BN$` and `$NR$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BR$` is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$RU$`.
* Hence, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$BR$` and `$RU$` is four times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$RU$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BU$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$BR$` and `$RU$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BU$` is four times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$UR$`.
* Thus, `$BU$` is double `$RU$`.
* And `$VU$` is also double `$UR$`, inasmuch as `$SR$` is also double `$PR$` - that is to say, `$RU$`.
* Thus, `$BU$` (is) equal to `$UV$`.
* So, similarly, it can be shown that each of `$BW$`, `$WC$`, `$CV$` is equal to each of `$BU$` and `$UV$`.
* Thus, [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$BUVCW$` is equilateral.
* So, I say that it is also in one [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* For let `$PX$` have been drawn from `$P$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to each of `$RU$` and `$SV$`, on the exterior side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* And let `$XH$` and `$HW$` have been joined.
* I say that `$XHW$` is a [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* For since `$HQ$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$T$`, and `$QT$` is its greater piece, thus as `$HQ$` is to `$QT$`, so `$QT$` (is) to `$TH$`.
* And `$HQ$` (is) equal to `$HP$`, and `$QT$` to each of `$TW$` and `$PX$`.
* Thus, as `$HP$` is to `$PX$`, so `$WT$` (is) to `$TH$`.
* And `$HP$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$TW$`.
* For of each of them is at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] `$BD$` [[Prop. 11.6]][bookofproofs$2243].
* And `$TH$` (is [parallel][bookofproofs$788]) to `$PX$`.
* For each of them is at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] `$BF$` [[Prop. 11.6]][bookofproofs$2243].
* And if two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], like `$XPH$` and `$HTW$`, having two sides [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to two sides, are placed together at a single angle such that their corresponding sides are also [parallel][bookofproofs$788] then the remaining sides will be [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] (to one another) [[Prop. 6.32]][bookofproofs$2018].
* Thus, `$XH$` is [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$HW$`.
* And every [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is in one [plane][bookofproofs$657] [[Prop. 11.1]][bookofproofs$2238].
* Thus, [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$UBWCV$` is in one [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* So, I say that it is also equiangular.
* For since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$NP$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$R$`, and `$PR$` is the greater piece [thus as the sum of `$NP$` and `$PR$` is to `$PN$`, so `$NP$` (is) to `$PR$`], and `$PR$` (is) equal to `$PS$` [thus as `$SN$` is to `$NP$`, so `$NP$` (is) to `$PS$`], `$NS$` has thus also been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$P$`, and `$NP$` is the greater piece [[Prop. 13.5]][bookofproofs$2299].
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$NS$` and `$SP$` is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$NP$` [[Prop. 13.4]][bookofproofs$2298].
* And `$NP$` (is) equal to `$NB$`, and `$PS$` to `$SV$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$NS$` and `$SV$` is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$NB$`.
* Hence, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$VS$`, `$SN$`, and `$NB$` is four times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$NB$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$SB$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$SN$` and `$NB$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$BS$` and `$SV$` - that is to say, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BV$` [for angle `$VSB$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653]] - is four times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$NB$` [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212], [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, `$VB$` is double `$BN$`.
* And `$BC$` (is) also double `$BN$`.
* Thus, `$BV$` is equal to `$BC$`.
* And since the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BU$` and `$UV$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BW$` and `$WC$` (respectively), and the base `$BV$` (is) equal to the base `$BC$`, angle `$BUV$` is thus equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BWC$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* So, similarly, we can show that [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$UVC$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BWC$`.
* Thus, the three [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BWC$`, `$BUV$`, and `$UVC$` are equal to one another.
* And if three [angles][bookofproofs$650] of an equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] are equal to one another then the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is equiangular [[Prop. 13.7]][bookofproofs$2301].
* Thus, [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$BUVCW$` is equiangular.
* And it was also shown (to be) equilateral.
* Thus, [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$BUVCW$` is equilateral and equiangular, and it is on one of the sides, `$BC$`, of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* Thus, if we make the same construction on each of the twelve sides of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234] then some [solid figure][bookofproofs$2210] contained by twelve [equilateral and equiangular pentagon][bookofproofs$6447]s will have been constructed, which is called a [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237].
* So, it is necessary to enclose it in the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223], and to show that the side of the [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237] is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* For let `$XP$` have been produced, and let (the produced [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) be `$XZ$`.
* Thus, `$PZ$` meets the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234], and they cut one another in half.
* For, this has been proved in the penultimate theorem of the eleventh book [[Prop. 11.38]][bookofproofs$2275].
* Let them cut (one another) at `$Z$`.
* Thus, `$Z$` is the [center of the sphere][bookofproofs$2225] enclosing the [cube][bookofproofs$2234], and `$ZP$` (is) half the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* So, let `$UZ$` have been joined.
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$NS$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$P$`, and its greater piece is `$NP$`, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$NS$` and `$SP$` is thus three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$NP$` [[Prop. 13.4]][bookofproofs$2298].
* And `$NS$` (is) equal to `$XZ$`, inasmuch as `$NP$` is also equal to `$PZ$`, and `$XP$` to `$PS$`.
* But, indeed, `$PS$` (is) also (equal) to `$XU$`, since (it is) also (equal) to `$RP$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$ZX$` and `$XU$` is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$NP$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$UZ$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$ZX$` and `$XU$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$UZ$` is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$NP$`.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] enclosing the [cube][bookofproofs$2234] is also three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on half the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* For it has previously been demonstrated (how to) construct the [cube][bookofproofs$2234], and to enclose (it) in a [sphere][bookofproofs$2223], and to show that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234] [[Prop. 13.15]][bookofproofs$2309].
* And if the ([square][bookofproofs$909] on the) whole (is three times) the ([square][bookofproofs$909] on the) whole, then the ([square][bookofproofs$909] on the) half (is) also (three times) the ([square][bookofproofs$909] on the) half.
* And `$NP$` is half of the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* Thus, `$UZ$` is equal to the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] enclosing the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* And `$Z$` is the [center of the sphere][bookofproofs$2225] enclosing the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* Thus, [point][bookofproofs$631] `$U$` is on the surface of the [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* So, similarly, we can show that each of the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] of the [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237] is also on the surface of the [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* Thus, the [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237] has been enclosed by the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* So, I say that the side of the [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237] is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] called an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* For since `$RP$` is the greater piece of `$NP$`, which has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985], and `$PS$` is the greater piece of `$PO$`, which has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985], `$RS$` is thus the greater piece of the whole of `$NO$`, which has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985].
* Thus, since as `$NP$` is to `$PR$`, (so) `$PR$` (is) to `$RN$`, and (the same is also true) of the doubles.
* For parts have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as similar [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] (taken in corresponding order) [[Prop. 5.15]][bookofproofs$1972].
* Thus, as `$NO$` (is) to `$RS$`, so `$RS$` (is) to the sum of `$NR$` and `$SO$`.
* And `$NO$` (is) greater than `$RS$`.
* Thus, `$RS$` (is) also greater than the sum of `$NR$` and `$SO$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Thus, `$NO$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985], and `$RS$` is its greater piece.] And `$RS$` (is) equal to `$UV$`.
* Thus, `$UV$` is the greater piece of `$NO$`, which has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985].
* And since the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on it is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234], `$NO$`, which is the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234], is thus [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And if a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] (straight)-line is cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] then each of the pieces is the [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] called) an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
* Thus, `$UV$`, which is the side of the [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237], is the [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] called) an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 13.6]][bookofproofs$2300].
