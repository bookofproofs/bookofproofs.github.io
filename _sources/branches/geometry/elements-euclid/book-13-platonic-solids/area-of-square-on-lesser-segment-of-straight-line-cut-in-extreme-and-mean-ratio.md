### (Proposition 3 from Book 13 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the lesser piece added to half of the greater piece is five times the [square][bookofproofs$909] on half of the greater piece.
* For let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` have been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`.
* And let `$AC$` be the greater piece.
* And let `$AC$` have been cut in half at `$D$`.
* I say that the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$`.
