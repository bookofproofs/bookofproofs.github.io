### (Corollary to Proposition 17 from Book 13 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So, (it is) clear, from this, that the side of the [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237] is the greater piece of the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234], when it is cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

### Modern Formulation

### Notes

If the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the circumscribed [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] is unity then the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234] is `$\sqrt{4/3}$`, and the side of the [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237] is `\[\frac{\sqrt{15}-\sqrt{3}}{3}.\]`
