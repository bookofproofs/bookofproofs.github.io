* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` have been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, and let `$AC$` be the greater piece.
* And let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AD$` have been produced in a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] with `$CA$`.
* And let `$AD$` be made (equal to) half of `$AB$`.
* I say that the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DA$`.

* For let the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$AE$` and `$DF$` have been described on `$AB$` and `$DC$` (respectively).
* And let the figure in `$DF$` have been drawn.
* And let `$FC$` have been drawn across to `$G$`.
* And since `$AB$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$C$`, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ABC$` is thus equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [ [Def. 6.3] ][bookofproofs$1986], [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* And `$CE$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ABC$`, and `$FH$` the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`.
* Thus, `$CE$` (is) equal to `$FH$`.
* And since `$BA$` is double `$AD$`, and `$BA$` (is) equal to `$KA$`, and `$AD$` to `$AH$`, `$KA$` (is) thus also double `$AH$`.
* And as `$KA$` (is) to `$AH$`, so `$CK$` (is) to `$CH$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$CK$` (is) double `$CH$`.
* And `$LH$` plus `$HC$` is also double `$CH$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959].
* Thus, `$KC$` (is) equal to `$LH$` plus `$HC$`.
* And `$CE$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$HF$`.
* Thus, the whole square `$AE$` is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$MNO$`.
* And since `$BA$` is double `$AD$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` is four times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` - that is to say, `$AE$` (is four times) `$DH$`.
* And `$AE$` (is) equal to [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$MNO$`.
* And, thus, [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$MNO$` is also four times `$AP$`.
* Thus, the whole of `$DF$` is five times `$AP$`.
* And `$DF$` is the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$`, and `$AP$` the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DA$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DA$`.
* Thus, if a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater piece, added to half of the whole, is five times the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the half.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
