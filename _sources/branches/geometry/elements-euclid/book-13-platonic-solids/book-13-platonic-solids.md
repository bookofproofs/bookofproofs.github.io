The five regular solids - the [cube][bookofproofs$2234], tetrahedron (i.e., [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221]), [octahedron][bookofproofs$2235], [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236], and [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237] - were probably discovered by the school of [Pythagoras][bookofproofs$Pythagoras].
They are generally termed "Platonic" solids because they feature prominently in [Plato][bookofproofs$Plato]'s famous dialogue with Timaeus. Many of the theorems contained in this book - particularly those which pertain to the last two solids - 
are ascribed to [Theaetetus of Athens](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Theaetetus/) (ca. 417 BC - 369 BC).
