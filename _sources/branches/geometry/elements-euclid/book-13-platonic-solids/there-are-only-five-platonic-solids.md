### (Proposition 18 from Book 13 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To set out the sides of the five (aforementioned) figures, and to compare (them) with one another.

* `$AB$` is the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226].
* `$AF$` is equal to the side of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221].
* `$BF$` is the side of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* `$MB$` is thus (the side) of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] ([inscribed in the circle][bookofproofs$1920]) [[Prop. 13.10]][bookofproofs$2304], [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968] ... And (the side) of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is (the side) of the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] [[Prop. 13.16]][bookofproofs$2310].
* `$NB$` is the side of the [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237] [ [Prop. 13.17 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6471].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (the side) of the [octahedron][bookofproofs$2235] is one and a half times the [square][bookofproofs$909] on (the side) of the [cube][bookofproofs$2234].
* So, I say that, beside the five aforementioned figures, no other ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]) figure can be constructed (which is) contained by equilateral and equiangular ([planes][bookofproofs$647]), equal to one another.

### Modern Formulation

If the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] is unity then the sides of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] (i.e., tetrahedron), [octahedron][bookofproofs$2235], [cube][bookofproofs$2234], [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236], and [dodecahedron][bookofproofs$2237], respectively, satisfy the following inequality: `\[\sqrt{\frac 83} > \sqrt{2} > \sqrt{\frac 43} > \frac{\sqrt{10 -2\,\sqrt{5}}}{\sqrt{5}}  > \frac{\sqrt{15}-\sqrt{3}}3.\]`

Moreover, these five **Platonic solids** (i.e. solids contained by equilateral and equiangular [rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687]) are the only existing ones.
