* For let the equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$` have been [inscribed in the circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCDE$` which has a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [diameter][bookofproofs$6429].
* I say that the side of [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] [$ABCDE$] is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called [minor][bookofproofs$2170].

* For let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`, have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058].
* And let `$AF$` and `$FB$` have been joined.
* And let them have been drawn across to [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$H$` (respectively).
* And let `$AC$` have been joined.
* And let `$FK$` made (equal) to the fourth part of `$AF$`.
* And `$AF$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* `$FK$` (is) thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And `$BF$` is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the whole of `$BK$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And since [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ACG$` is equal to [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ADG$`, of which `$ABC$` is equal to `$AED$`, the remainder `$CG$` is thus equal to the remainder `$GD$`.
* And if we join `$AD$` then the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$L$` are inferred (to be) [right angles][bookofproofs$653], and `$CD$` (is inferred to be) double `$CL$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* So, for the same (reasons), the ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) at `$M$` are also [right angles][bookofproofs$653], and `$AC$` (is) double `$CM$`.
* Therefore, since angle `$ALC$` (is) equal to `$AMF$`, and (angle) `$LAC$` (is) common to the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ACL$` and `$AMF$`, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$ACL$` is thus equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$MFA$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ACL$` is equiangular to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$AMF$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as `$LC$` (is) to `$CA$`, so `$MF$` (is) to `$FA$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* And (we can take) the doubles of the leading (magnitudes).
* Thus, as double `$LC$` (is) to `$CA$`, so double `$MF$` (is) to `$FA$`.
* And as double `$MF$` (is) to `$FA$`, so `$MF$` (is) to half of `$FA$`.
* And, thus, as double `$LC$` (is) to `$CA$`, so `$MF$` (is) to half of `$FA$`.
* And (we can take) the halves of the following (magnitudes).
* Thus, as double `$LC$` (is) to half of `$CA$`, so `$MF$` (is) to the fourth of `$FA$`.
* And `$DC$` is double `$LC$`, and `$CM$` half of `$CA$`, and `$FK$` the fourth part of `$FA$`.
* Thus, as `$DC$` is to `$CM$`, so `$MF$` (is) to `$FK$`.
* Via [composition][bookofproofs$1953], as the sum of `$DCM$` (i.e., `$DC$` and `$CM$`) (is) to `$CM$`, so `$MK$` (is) to `$KF$` [[Prop. 5.18]][bookofproofs$1975].
* And, thus, as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the sum of `$DCM$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CM$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MK$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KF$`.
* And since the greater piece of a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) subtending two sides of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447], such as `$AC$`, (which is) cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] is equal to the side of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] [[Prop. 13.8]][bookofproofs$2302] - that is to say, to `$DC$` - -and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater piece added to half of the whole is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on half of the whole [[Prop. 13.1]][bookofproofs$2295], and `$CM$` (is) half of the whole, `$AC$`, thus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DCM$`, (taken) as one, is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CM$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DCM$`, (taken) as one, (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CM$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MK$` was shown (to be) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KF$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MK$` (is) five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KF$`.
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$KF$` (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* For the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] (is) [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MK$` (is) also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Thus, `$MK$` is [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [in square only].
* And since `$BF$` is four times `$FK$`, `$BK$` is thus five times `$KF$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BK$` (is) twenty-five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KF$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$MK$` (is) five times the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$KF$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BK$` (is) five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KM$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BK$` does not have to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KM$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which a [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to a [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, `$BK$` is [incommensurable in length][bookofproofs$1095] with `$KM$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* And each of them is a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* Thus, `$BK$` and `$KM$` are [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645] which are) [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only.
* And if from a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is subtracted, which is [commensurable in square][bookofproofs$2082] only with the whole, then the remainder is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] called) an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167] [[Prop. 10.73]][bookofproofs$2167].
* Thus, `$MB$` is an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167], and `$MK$` its attachment.
* So, I say that (it is) also a [fourth (apotome) ][bookofproofs$2094].
* So, let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$N$` be (made) equal to that (magnitude) by which the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BK$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KM$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BK$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KM$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$N$`.
* And since `$KF$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FB$` then, via [composition][bookofproofs$1953], `$KB$` is also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$FB$` [[Prop. 10.15]][bookofproofs$2109].
* But, `$BF$` is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BH$`.
* Thus, `$BK$` is also [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$BH$` [[Prop. 10.12]][bookofproofs$2106].
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BK$` is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KM$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BK$` thus has to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KM$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which 5 (has) to one.
* Thus, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BK$` has to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$N$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which 5 (has) to 4 [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2, which is not (that) of a [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] to a [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326].
* `$BK$` is thus [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with `$N$` [[Prop. 10.9]][bookofproofs$2103].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BK$` is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KM$` by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BK$).
* Therefore, since the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the whole, `$BK$`, is greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the attachment, `$KM$`, by the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on (some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] which is) [incommensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with ($BK$), and the whole, `$BK$`, is [commensurable (in length) ][bookofproofs$1095] with the (previously) laid down [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BH$`, `$MB$` is thus a [fourth apotome][bookofproofs$2094] [ [Def. 10.14] ][bookofproofs$2094].
* And the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and a [fourth apotome][bookofproofs$2094] is [irrational][bookofproofs$2083], and its [square root][bookofproofs$46] is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called [minor][bookofproofs$2170] [[Prop. 10.94]][bookofproofs$2188].
* And the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$HBM$`, on account of joining `$AH$`, (so that) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABH$` becomes equiangular with [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABM$` [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994], and (proportionally) as `$HB$` is to `$BA$`, so `$AB$` (is) to `$BM$`.
* Thus, the side `$AB$` of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called [minor][bookofproofs$2170].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
