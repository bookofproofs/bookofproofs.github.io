* Let `$ABCDE$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* And let the equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$` have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCDE$`.
* I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side of [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$` is the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on the sides of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] and of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571] [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCDE$`.

* For let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`, have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058].
* And, `$AF$` being joined, let it have been drawn across to [point][bookofproofs$631] `$G$`.
* And let `$FB$` have been joined.
* And let `$FH$` have been drawn from `$F$` [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$`.
* And let it have been drawn across to `$K$`.
* And let `$AK$` and `$KB$` have been joined.
* And, again, let `$FL$` have been drawn from `$F$` [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$AK$`.
* And let it have been drawn across to `$M$`.
* And let `$KN$` have been joined.
* Since [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCG$` is equal to [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$AEDG$`, of which `$ABC$` is equal to `$AED$`, the remaining [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CG$` is thus equal to the remaining ([circumference][bookofproofs$690]) `$GD$`.
* And `$CD$` (is the side) of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447].
* `$CG$` (is) thus (the side) of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571].
* And since `$FA$` is equal to `$FB$`, and `$FH$` is [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] (to `$AB$`), angle `$AFK$` (is) thus also equal to `$KFB$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740], [[Prop. 1.26]][bookofproofs$905].
* Hence, [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$AK$` is also equal to `$KB$` [[Prop. 3.26]][bookofproofs$1906].
* Thus, [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$` (is) double [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BK$`.
* Thus, [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AK$` is the side of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571].
* So, for the same (reasons, [circumference][bookofproofs$690]) `$AK$` is also double `$KM$`.
* And since [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$` is double [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BK$`, and [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CD$` (is) equal to [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$`, [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CD$` (is) thus also double [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BK$`.
* And [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CD$` is also double `$CG$`.
* Thus, [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CG$` (is) equal to [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BK$`.
* But, `$BK$` is double `$KM$`, since `$KA$` (is) also (double `$KM$`).
* Thus, ([circumference][bookofproofs$690]) `$CG$` is also double `$KM$`.
* But, indeed, [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CB$` is also double [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BK$`.
* For [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CB$` (is) equal to `$BA$`.
* Thus, the whole [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$GB$` is also double `$BM$`.
* Hence, angle `$GFB$` [is] also double angle `$BFM$` [[Prop. 6.33]][bookofproofs$2019].
* And `$GFB$` (is) also double `$FAB$`.
* For `$FAB$` (is) equal to `$ABF$`.
* Thus, `$BFN$` is also equal to `$FAB$`.
* And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABF$` (is) common to the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABF$` and `$BFN$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$AFB$` is equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BNF$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABF$` is equiangular to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$BFN$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` (is) to `$BF$`, so `$FB$` (is) to `$BN$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ABN$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* Again, since `$AL$` is equal to `$LK$`, and `$LN$` is common and at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] (to `$KA$`), base `$KN$` is thus equal to base `$AN$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And, Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$LKN$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$LAN$`.
* But, `$LAN$` is equal to `$KBN$` [[Prop. 3.29]][bookofproofs$1909], [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* Thus, `$LKN$` is also equal to `$KBN$`.
* And the (angle) at `$A$` (is) common to the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$AKB$` and `$AKN$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$AKB$` is equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$KNA$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$KBA$` is equiangular to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$KNA$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BA$` is to `$AK$`, so `$KA$` (is) to `$AN$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BAN$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AK$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ABN$` was also shown (to be) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ABN$` plus the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BAN$`, which is the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` [[Prop. 2.2]][bookofproofs$2361], is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BF$` plus the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AK$`.
* And `$BA$` is the side of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447], and `$BF$` (the side) of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] [ [Prop. 4.15 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]0, and `$AK$` (the side) of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] ([inscribed in a circle][bookofproofs$1920]) is (equal to) the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on the (sides) of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] and of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571] inscribed in the same [circle][bookofproofs$690].
