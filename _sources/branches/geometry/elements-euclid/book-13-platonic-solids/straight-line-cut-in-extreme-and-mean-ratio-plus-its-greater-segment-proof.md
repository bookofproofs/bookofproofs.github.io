* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` have been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`.
* And let `$AC$` be the greater piece.
* And let `$AD$` be [made] equal to `$AC$`.
* I say that the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$DB$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$A$`, and that the original [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` is the greater piece.

* For let the square `$AE$` have been described on `$AB$`, and let the (remainder of the) figure have been drawn.
* And since `$AB$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$C$`, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ABC$` is thus equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [ [Def. 6.3] ][bookofproofs$1986], [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* And `$CE$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ABC$`, and `$CH$` the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`.
* But, `$HE$` is equal to `$CE$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959], and `$DH$` equal to `$HC$`.
* Thus, `$DH$` is also equal to `$HE$`.
* Let `$HB$` have been added to both. Thus, the whole of `$DK$` is equal to the whole of `$AE$`.
* And `$DK$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BD$` and `$DA$`.
* For `$AD$` (is) equal to `$DL$`.
* And `$AE$` (is) the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BDA$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`.
* Thus, as `$DB$` (is) to `$BA$`, so `$BA$` (is) to `$AD$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* And `$DB$` (is) greater than `$BA$`.
* Thus, `$BA$` (is) also greater than `$AD$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Thus, `$DB$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$A$`, and the greater piece is `$AB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
