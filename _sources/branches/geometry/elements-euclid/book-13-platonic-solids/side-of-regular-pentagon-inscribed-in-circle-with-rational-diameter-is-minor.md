### (Proposition 11 from Book 13 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If an equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is [inscribed in a circle][bookofproofs$1920] which has a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] then the side of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called [minor][bookofproofs$2170].
* For let the equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$` have been [inscribed in the circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCDE$` which has a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [diameter][bookofproofs$6429].
* I say that the side of [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] [$ABCDE$] is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called [minor][bookofproofs$2170].

### Modern Formulation

If the [circle][bookofproofs$690] has [unit][bookofproofs$2314] [radius][bookofproofs$690] then the side of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is  `\[\frac{\sqrt{10-2\,\sqrt{5}}}2.\]`

However, this length can be written in the [minor][bookofproofs$2170].
`\[\sqrt{5}\sqrt{\left(1+\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}}\right)\frac 12} - \sqrt{\left(1-\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{1+\rho^2}}\right)\frac 12}, \]`

with `$\rho=2$`.
