* Let `$AB$` be a [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and let it have been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$C$`, and let `$AC$` be the greater piece.
* I say that the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CA$`.

* For let the square `$ADEB$` have been described on `$AB$`, and let the (remainder of the) figure have been drawn.
* Therefore, since `$AB$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$C$`, and `$AC$` is the greater piece, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ABC$` is thus equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` [ [Def. 6.3] ][bookofproofs$1986], [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* And `$AK$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ABC$`, and `$HG$` the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`.
* Thus, `$AK$` is equal to `$HG$`.
* And since `$AF$` is equal to `$FE$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959], let `$CK$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the whole of `$AK$` is equal to the whole of `$CE$`.
* Thus, `$AK$` plus `$CE$` is double `$AK$`.
* But, `$AK$` plus `$CE$` is the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$LMN$` plus the square `$CK$`.
* Thus, [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$LMN$` plus square `$CK$` is double `$AK$`.
* But, indeed, `$AK$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$HG$`.
* Thus, [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$LMN$` plus [square `$CK$` is double `$HG$`.
* Hence, [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$LMN$` plus] the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$CK$` and `$HG$` is three times the square `$HG$`.
* And [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$LMN$` plus the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$CK$` and `$HG$` is the whole of `$AE$` plus `$CK$` - which are the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$` (respectively) - and `$GH$` (is) the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the) [squares][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` and `$BC$` is three times the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
