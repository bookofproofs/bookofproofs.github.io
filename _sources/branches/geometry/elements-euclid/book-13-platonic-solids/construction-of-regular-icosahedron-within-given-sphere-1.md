### (Corollary to Proposition 16 from Book 13 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So, (it is) clear, from this, that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is five times the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] from which the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] has been described, and that the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is the sum of (the side) of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448], and two of (the sides) of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571], inscribed in the same [circle][bookofproofs$690].

### Notes

If the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] is unity then the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] is `\[\frac 2{\sqrt{5}},\]` and the sides of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448], [decagon][bookofproofs$6571], and [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] / [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] are `\[\frac 2{\sqrt{5}},\quad 1-\frac 1{\sqrt{5}},\quad\text{ and }\quad \frac {\sqrt{10-2\,\sqrt{5}}}{\sqrt{5}},\]` 
respectively.
