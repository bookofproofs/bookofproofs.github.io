### (Proposition 9 from Book 13 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If the side of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] and of a [decagon][bookofproofs$6571] inscribed in the same [circle][bookofproofs$690] are added together then the whole [straight line][bookofproofs$645] has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] (at the junction [point][bookofproofs$631]), and its greater piece is the side of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448].
* Let `$ABC$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* And of the figures [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABC$`, let `$BC$` be the side of a [decagon][bookofproofs$6571], and `$CD$` (the side) of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448].
* And let them be (laid down) [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] (to one another).
* I say that the whole [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] (at `$C$`), and that `$CD$` is its greater piece.

### Modern Formulation

If the [circle][bookofproofs$690] is of [unit][bookofproofs$2314] [radius][bookofproofs$690] then the side of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] is 1, whereas the side of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571] is `\[\frac {\sqrt{5}-1}2.\]`
