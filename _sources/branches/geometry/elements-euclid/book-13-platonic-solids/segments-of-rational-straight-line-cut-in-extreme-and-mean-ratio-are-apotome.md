### (Proposition 6 from Book 13 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] then each of the pieces is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].

* Let `$AB$` be a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [straight line][bookofproofs$645] cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$C$`, and let `$AC$` be the greater piece.
* I say that `$AC$` and `$CB$` is each that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called an [apotome][bookofproofs$2167].
