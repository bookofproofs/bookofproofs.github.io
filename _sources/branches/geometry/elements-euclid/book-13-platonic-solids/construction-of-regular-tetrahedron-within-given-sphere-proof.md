* Let the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$AB$` of the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] be laid out, and let it have been cut at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` such that `$AC$` is double `$CB$` [[Prop. 6.10]][bookofproofs$1996].
* And let the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$ADB$` have been drawn on `$AB$`.
* And let `$CD$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$`.
* And let `$DA$` have been joined.
* And let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFG$` be laid down having a [radius][bookofproofs$690] equal to `$DC$`, and let the [equilateral triangle][bookofproofs$688] `$EFG$` have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$EFG$` [[Prop. 4.2]][bookofproofs$1926].
* And let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$`, have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058].
* And let `$EH$`, `$HF$`, and `$HG$` have been joined.
* And let `$HK$` have been set up, at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$`, at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFG$` [[Prop. 11.12]][bookofproofs$2249].
* And let `$HK$`, equal to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$`, have been cut off from `$HK$`.
* And let `$KE$`, `$KF$`, and `$KG$` have been joined.
* And since `$KH$` is at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFG$`, it will thus also make [right angles][bookofproofs$653] with all of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joining it (which are) also in the plane of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFG$` [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212].
* And `$HE$`, `$HF$`, and `$HG$` each join it.
* Thus, `$HK$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to each of `$HE$`, `$HF$`, and `$HG$`.
* And since `$AC$` is equal to `$HK$`, and `$CD$` to `$HE$`, and they contain [right angles][bookofproofs$653], the base `$DA$` is thus equal to the base `$KE$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$KF$` and `$KG$` is each equal to `$DA$`.
* Thus, the three ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$KE$`, `$KF$`, and `$KG$` are equal to one another.
* And since `$AC$` is double `$CB$`, `$AB$` (is) thus triple `$BC$`.
* And as `$AB$` (is) to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$`, as will be shown later [see lemma].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` (is) three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FE$` is also three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EH$` [[Prop. 13.12]][bookofproofs$2306], and `$DC$` is equal to `$EH$`.
* Thus, `$DA$` (is) also equal to `$EF$`.
* But, `$DA$` was shown (to be) equal to each of `$KE$`, `$KF$`, and `$KG$`.
* Thus, `$EF$`, `$FG$`, and `$GE$` are equal to `$KE$`, `$KF$`, and `$KG$`, respectively.
* Thus, the four [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$EFG$`, `$KEF$`, `$KFG$`, and `$KEG$` are equilateral.
* Thus, a [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221], whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$EFG$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$K$`, has been constructed from four [equilateral triangles][bookofproofs$688].
* So, it is also necessary to enclose it in the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223], and to show that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is one and a half times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221].
* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$HL$` have been produced in a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] with `$KH$`, and let `$HL$` be made equal to `$CB$`.
* And since as `$AC$` (is) to `$CD$`, so `$CD$` (is) to `$CB$` [ [Prop. 6.8 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]3, and `$AC$` (is) equal to `$KH$`, and `$CD$` to `$HE$`, and `$CB$` to `$HL$`, thus as `$KH$` is to `$HE$`, so `$EH$` (is) to `$HL$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$KH$` and `$HL$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EH$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* And each of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$KHE$` and `$EHL$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] drawn on `$KL$` will also pass through `$E$` [inasmuch as if we join `$EL$` then the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$LEK$` becomes a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], on account of [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ELK$` becoming equiangular to each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ELH$` and `$EHK$` [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994], [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911] ].
* So, if `$KL$` remains (fixed), and the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] is carried around, and again established at the same (position) from which it began to be moved, it will also pass through [points][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` and `$G$`, (because) if `$FL$` and `$LG$` are joined, the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$F$` and `$G$` will similarly become [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] will have been enclosed by the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* For the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429], `$KL$`, of the [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] is equal to the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429], `$AB$`, of the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] - inasmuch as `$KH$` was made equal to `$AC$`, and `$HL$` to `$CB$`.
* So, I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is one and a half times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221].
* For since `$AC$` is double `$CB$`, `$AB$` is thus triple `$BC$`.
* Thus, via [convertion][bookofproofs$1955], `$BA$` is one and a half times `$AC$`.
* And as `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` [inasmuch as if `$DB$` is joined then as `$BA$` is to `$AD$`, so `$DA$` (is) to `$AC$`, on account of the similarity of [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$DAB$` and `$DAC$`.
* And as the first is to the third (of four [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] magnitudes), so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the first (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the second.] Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` (is) also one and a half times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$`.
* And `$BA$` is the [diameter of the given sphere][bookofproofs$2226], and `$AD$` (is) equal to the side of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is one and a half times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
