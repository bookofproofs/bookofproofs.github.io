* Let the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$AB$` of the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] be laid out, and let it have been cut at `$C$` such that `$AC$` is four times `$CB$` [[Prop. 6.10]][bookofproofs$1996].
* And let the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$ADB$` have been drawn on `$AB$`.
* And let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$CD$` have been drawn from `$C$` at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$`.
* And let `$DB$` have been joined.

* And let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGHK$` be set down, and let its [radius][bookofproofs$690] be equal to `$DB$`.
* And let the [equilateral and equiangular pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$EFGHK$` have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$EFGHK$` [[Prop. 4.11]][bookofproofs$1935].
* And let the [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$EF$`, `$FG$`, `$GH$`, `$HK$`, and `$KE$` have been cut in half at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, `$O$`, and `$P$` (respectively).
* And let `$LM$`, `$MN$`, `$NO$`, `$OP$`, `$PL$`, and `$EP$` have been joined.
* Thus, [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$LMNOP$` is also equilateral, and `$EP$` (is) the side of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571] ([inscribed in the circle][bookofproofs$1920]).
* And let the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$EQ$`, `$FR$`, `$GS$`, `$HT$`, and `$KU$`, which are equal to the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGHK$`, have been set up at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$`, and `$K$` (respectively).
* And let `$QR$`, `$RS$`, `$ST$`, `$TU$`, `$UQ$`, `$QL$`, `$LR$`, `$RM$`, `$MS$`, `$SN$`, `$NT$`, `$TO$`, `$OU$`, `$UP$`, and `$PQ$` have been joined.
* And since `$EQ$` and `$KU$` are each at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the same [plane][bookofproofs$657], `$EQ$` is thus [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$KU$` [[Prop. 11.6]][bookofproofs$2243].
* And it is also equal to it.
* And [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joining equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) on the same side are (themselves) equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [[Prop. 1.33]][bookofproofs$931].
* Thus, `$QU$` is equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$EK$`.
* And `$EK$` (is the side) of an equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] ([inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$EFGHK$`).
* Thus, `$QU$` (is) also the side of an equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$EFGHK$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$QR$`, `$RS$`, `$ST$`, and `$TU$` are also the sides of an equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$EFGHK$`.
* [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$QRSTU$` (is) thus equilateral.
* And side `$QE$` is (the side) of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] ([inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$EFGHK$`), and `$EP$` (the side) of a [decagon][bookofproofs$6571], and (angle) `$QEP$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], thus `$QP$` is (the side) of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] (inscribed in the same [circle][bookofproofs$690]).
* For the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is (equal to the sum of) the (squares) on (the sides of) a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] and a [decagon][bookofproofs$6571] inscribed in the same [circle][bookofproofs$690] [[Prop. 13.10]][bookofproofs$2304].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$PU$` is also the side of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447].
* And `$QU$` is also (the side) of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447].
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$QPU$` is equilateral.
* So, for the same (reasons), ([triangles][bookofproofs$6432]) `$QLR$`, `$RMS$`, `$SNT$`, and `$TOU$` are each also equilateral.
* And since `$QL$` and `$QP$` were each shown (to be the sides) of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447], and `$LP$` is also (the side) of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447], [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$QLP$` is thus equilateral.
* So, for the same (reasons), [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$LRM$`, `$MSN$`, `$NTO$`, and `$OUP$` are each also equilateral.

* Let the [center][bookofproofs$6428], [point][bookofproofs$631] `$V$`, of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGHK$` have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058].
* And let `$VZ$` have been set up, at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$V$`, at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* And let it have been produced on the other side (of the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), like `$VX$`.
* And let `$VW$` have been cut off (from `$XZ$` so as to be equal to the side) of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448], and each of `$VX$` and `$WZ$` (so as to be equal to the side) of a [decagon][bookofproofs$6571].
* And let `$QZ$`, `$QW$`, `$UZ$`, `$EV$`, `$LV$`, `$LX$`, and `$XM$` have been joined.
* And since `$VW$` and `$QE$` are each at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], `$VW$` is thus [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$QE$` [[Prop. 11.6]][bookofproofs$2243].
* And they are also equal.
* `$EV$` and `$QW$` are thus equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] (to one another) [[Prop. 1.33]][bookofproofs$931].
* And `$EV$` (is the side) of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448].
* Thus, `$QW$` (is) also (the side) of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448].
* And since `$QW$` is (the side) of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448], and `$WZ$` (the side) of a [decagon][bookofproofs$6571], and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$QWZ$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212], [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915], `$QZ$` is thus (the side) of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] [[Prop. 13.10]][bookofproofs$2304].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$UZ$` is also (the side) of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] - inasmuch as, if we join `$VK$` and `$WU$` then they will be equal and opposite.
* And `$VK$`, being (equal) to the [radius][bookofproofs$690] (of the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), is (the side) of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] [ [Prop. 4.15 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]0.
* Thus, `$WU$` (is) also the side of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448].
* And `$WZ$` (is the side) of a [decagon][bookofproofs$6571], and (angle) `$UWZ$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$UZ$` (is the side) of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] [[Prop. 13.10]][bookofproofs$2304].
* And `$QU$` is also (the side) of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447].
* [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$QUZ$` is thus equilateral.
* So, for the same (reasons), each of the remaining [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], whose bases are the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$QR$`, `$RS$`, `$ST$`, and `$TU$`, and apexes the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$Z$`, are also equilateral.
* Again, since `$VL$` (is the side) of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448], and `$VX$` (the side) of a [decagon][bookofproofs$6571], and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$LVX$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], `$LX$` is thus (the side) of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] [[Prop. 13.10]][bookofproofs$2304].
* So, for the same (reasons), if we join `$MV$`, which is (the side) of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448], `$MX$` is also inferred (to be the side) of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447].
* And `$LM$` is also (the side) of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447].
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$LMX$` is equilateral.
* So, similarly, it can be shown that each of the remaining [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], whose bases are the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$MN$`, `$NO$`, `$OP$`, and `$PL$`, and apexes the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$X$`, are also equilateral.
* Thus, an [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] contained by twenty [equilateral triangles][bookofproofs$688] has been constructed.
* So, it is also necessary to enclose it in the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223], and to show that the side of the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called [minor][bookofproofs$2170].
* For, since `$VW$` is (the side) of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448], and `$WZ$` (the side) of a [decagon][bookofproofs$6571], `$VZ$` has thus been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$W$`, and `$VW$` is its greater piece [[Prop. 13.9]][bookofproofs$2303].
* Thus, as `$ZV$` is to `$VW$`, so `$VW$` (is) to `$WZ$`.
* And `$VW$` (is) equal to `$VE$`, and `$WZ$` to `$VX$`.
* Thus, as `$ZV$` is to `$VE$`, so `$EV$` (is) to `$VX$`.
* And [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ZVE$` and `$EVX$` are [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, if we join [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EZ$` then angle `$XEZ$` will be a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], on account of the similarity of [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$XEZ$` and `$VEZ$`. [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994].
* So, for the same (reasons), since as `$ZV$` is to `$VW$`, so `$VW$` (is) to `$WZ$`, and `$ZV$` (is) equal to `$XW$`, and `$VW$` to `$WQ$`, thus as `$XW$` is to `$WQ$`, so `$QW$` (is) to `$WZ$`.
* And, again, on account of this, if we join `$QX$` then the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$Q$` will be a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994].
* Thus, the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] drawn on `$XZ$` will also pass through `$Q$` [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911].
* And if `$XZ$` remains fixed, and the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] is carried around, and again established at the same (position) from which it began to be moved, then it will also pass through ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$Q$`, and (through) the remaining (angular) [points][bookofproofs$631] of the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236].
* And the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] will have been enclosed by a [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* So, I say that (it is) also (enclosed) by the given ([sphere][bookofproofs$2223]).
* For let `$VW$` have been cut in half at `$a$`.
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$VZ$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$W$`, and `$ZW$` is its lesser piece, then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$ZW$` added to half of the greater piece, `$Wa$`, is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on half of the greater piece [[Prop. 13.3]][bookofproofs$2297].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$Za$` is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$aW$`.
* And `$ZX$` is double `$Za$`, and `$VW$` double `$aW$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$ZX$` is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$WV$`.
* And since `$AC$` is four times `$CB$`, `$AB$` is thus five times `$BC$`.
* And as `$AB$` (is) to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994], [ [Def. 5.9] ][bookofproofs$1948].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$ZX$` was also shown (to be) five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$VW$`.
* And `$DB$` is equal to `$VW$`.
* For each of them is equal to the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGHK$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` (is) also equal to `$XZ$`.
* And `$AB$` is the [diameter of the given sphere][bookofproofs$2226].
* Thus, `$XZ$` is equal to the [diameter of the given sphere][bookofproofs$2226].
* Thus, the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] has been enclosed by the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* So, I say that the side of the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called [minor][bookofproofs$2170].
* For since the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is [rational][bookofproofs$2083], and the [square][bookofproofs$909] on it is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGHK$`, the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGHK$` is thus also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* Hence, its [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] is also [rational][bookofproofs$2083].
* And if an equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is [inscribed in a circle][bookofproofs$1920] having a [rational][bookofproofs$2083] [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] then the side of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called [minor][bookofproofs$2170] [[Prop. 13.11]][bookofproofs$2305].
* And the side of [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$EFGHK$` is (the side) of the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236].
* Thus, the side of the [icosahedron][bookofproofs$2236] is that [irrational][bookofproofs$2083] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) called [minor][bookofproofs$2170].
