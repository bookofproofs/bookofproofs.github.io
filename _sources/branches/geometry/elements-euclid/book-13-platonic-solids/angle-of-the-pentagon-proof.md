* For let `$ABCDE$` be an [equilateral and equiangular pentagon][bookofproofs$6447], and let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCDE$` have been [circumscribed about][bookofproofs$6438] it [[Prop. 4.14]][bookofproofs$1938].
* And let its [center][bookofproofs$6428], `$F$`, have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058].
* And let `$FA$`, `$FB$`, `$FC$`, `$FD$`, and `$FE$` have been joined.

* Thus, they cut the [angles][bookofproofs$650] of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] in half at ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, and `$E$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And since the five [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$F$` are equal (in sum) to four [right angles][bookofproofs$653], and are also equal (to one another), (any) one of them, like `$AFB$`, is thus one less a fifth of a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the (sum of the) remaining ([angles][bookofproofs$650] in [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABF$`), `$FAB$` and `$ABF$`, is one plus a fifth of a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* And `$FAB$` (is) equal to `$FBC$`.
* Thus, the whole angle, `$ABC$`, of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is also one and one-fifth of a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
