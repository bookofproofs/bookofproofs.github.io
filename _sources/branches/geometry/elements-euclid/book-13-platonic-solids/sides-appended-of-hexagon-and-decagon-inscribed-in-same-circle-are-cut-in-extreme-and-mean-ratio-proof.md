* Let `$ABC$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* And of the figures [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABC$`, let `$BC$` be the side of a [decagon][bookofproofs$6571], and `$CD$` (the side) of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448].
* And let them be (laid down) [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] (to one another).
* I say that the whole [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] (at `$C$`), and that `$CD$` is its greater piece.

* For let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and let `$EB$`, `$EC$`, and `$ED$` have been joined, and let `$BE$` have been drawn across to `$A$`.
* Since `$BC$` is a side on an equilateral [decagon][bookofproofs$6571], [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ACB$` (is) thus five times [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BC$`.
* Thus, [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$AC$` (is) four times `$CB$`.
* And as [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$AC$` (is) to `$CB$`, so angle `$AEC$` (is) to `$CEB$` [[Prop. 6.33]][bookofproofs$2019].
* Thus, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$AEC$` (is) four times `$CEB$`.
* And since angle `$EBC$` (is) equal to `$ECB$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740], angle `$AEC$` is thus double `$ECB$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* And since [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EC$` is equal to `$CD$` - for each of them is equal to the side of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] [inscribed] in [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` [ [Prop. 4.15 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]0 -  angle `$CED$` is also equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$CDE$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ECB$` (is) double `$EDC$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* But, `$AEC$` was shown (to be) double `$ECB$`.
* Thus, `$AEC$` (is) four times `$EDC$`.
* And `$AEC$` was also shown (to be) four times `$BEC$`.
* Thus, `$EDC$` (is) equal to `$BEC$`.
* And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EBD$` (is) common to the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$BEC$` and `$BED$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BED$` is equal to the (remaining angle) `$ECB$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$EBD$` is equiangular to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$EBC$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as `$DB$` is to `$BE$`, so `$EB$` (is) to `$BC$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* And `$EB$` (is) equal to `$CD$`.
* Thus, as `$BD$` is to `$DC$`, so `$DC$` (is) to `$CB$`.
* And `$BD$` (is) greater than `$DC$`.
* Thus, `$DC$` (is) also greater than `$CB$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Thus, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] [at `$C$`], and `$DC$` is its greater piece.
* (Which is), the very thing it was required to show.
