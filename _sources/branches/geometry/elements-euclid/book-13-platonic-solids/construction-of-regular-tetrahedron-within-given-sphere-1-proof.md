* For, let the figure of the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] have been set out, and let `$DB$` have been joined.
* And let the square `$EC$` have been described on `$AC$`.
* And let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FB$` have been completed.
* Therefore, since, on account of [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DAB$` being equiangular to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DAC$` [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994], [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990], (proportionally) as `$BA$` is to `$AD$`, so `$DA$` (is) to `$AC$`, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BA$` and `$AC$` is thus equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* And since as `$AB$` is to `$BC$`, so `$EB$` (is) to `$BF$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* And `$EB$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BA$` and `$AC$` - for `$EA$` (is) equal to `$AC$`.
* And `$BF$` the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* Thus, as `$AB$` (is) to `$BC$`, so the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BA$` and `$AC$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AC$` and `$CB$`.
* And the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$BA$` and `$AC$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$ACB$` (is) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$`.
* For the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] `$DC$` is [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to the pieces of the base, `$AC$` and `$CB$`, on account of `$ADB$` being a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [ [Prop. 6.8 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6453].
* Thus, as `$AB$` (is) to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AD$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
