* Let there be a [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, and let the [equilateral triangle][bookofproofs$688] `$ABC$` have been inscribed in it [[Prop. 4.2]][bookofproofs$1926].
* I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on one side of [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.

* For let the [center][bookofproofs$6428], `$D$`, of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058].
* And `$AD$` (being) joined, let it have been drawn across to `$E$`.
* And let `$BE$` have been joined.
* And since [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` is equilateral, [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BEC$` is thus the third part of the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.
* Thus, [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BE$` is the sixth part of the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* Thus, [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BE$` is (the side) of a [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448].
* Thus, it is equal to the [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$DE$` [ [Prop. 4.15 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]0.
* And since `$AE$` is double `$DE$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` is four times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$ED$` - that is to say, of the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AE$` (is) equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BE$` [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911], [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AB$` and `$BE$` is four times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$`.
* Thus, via [separation][bookofproofs$1954], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BE$`.
* And `$BE$` (is) equal to `$DE$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DE$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] is three times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the [radius][bookofproofs$690] [of the [circle][bookofproofs$690]].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
