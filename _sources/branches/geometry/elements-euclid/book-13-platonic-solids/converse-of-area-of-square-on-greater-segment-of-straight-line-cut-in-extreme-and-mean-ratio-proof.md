* For let the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` be five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the piece of it, `$AC$`.
* And let `$CD$` be double `$AC$`.
* I say that if `$CD$` is cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] then the greater piece is `$CB$`.

* For let the [squares][bookofproofs$909] `$AF$` and `$CG$` have been described on each of `$AB$` and `$CD$` (respectively).
* And let the figure in `$AF$` have been drawn.
* And let `$BE$` have been drawn across.
* And since the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`, `$AF$` is five times `$AH$`.
* Thus, [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$MNO$` (is) four times `$AH$`.
* And since `$DC$` is double `$CA$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DC$` is thus four times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CA$` - that is to say, `$CG$` (is four times) `$AH$`.
* And the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$MNO$` was also shown (to be) four times `$AH$`.
* Thus, [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$MNO$` (is) equal to `$CG$`.
* And since `$DC$` is double `$CA$`, and `$DC$` (is) equal to `$CK$`, and `$AC$` to `$CH$`, [$KC$ (is) thus also double `$CH$`], (and) `$KB$` (is) also double `$BH$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* And `$LH$` plus `$HB$` is also double `$HB$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959].
* Thus, `$KB$` (is) equal to `$LH$` plus `$HB$`.
* And the whole [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$MNO$` was also shown (to be) equal to the whole of `$CG$`.
* Thus, the remainder `$HF$` is also equal to (the remainder) `$BG$`.
* And `$BG$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CDB$`.
* For `$CD$` (is) equal to `$DG$`.
* And `$HF$` (is) the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$`.
* Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CDB$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CB$`.
* Thus, as `$DC$` is to `$CB$`, so `$CB$` (is) to `$BD$` [[Prop. 6.17]][bookofproofs$2003].
* And `$DC$` (is) greater than `$CB$` (see lemma).
* Thus, `$CB$` (is) also greater than `$BD$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Thus, if the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$CD$` is cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] then the greater piece is `$CB$`.
* Thus, if the [square][bookofproofs$909] on a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on a piece of itself, and double the aforementioned piece is cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985], then the greater piece is the remaining part of the original [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
