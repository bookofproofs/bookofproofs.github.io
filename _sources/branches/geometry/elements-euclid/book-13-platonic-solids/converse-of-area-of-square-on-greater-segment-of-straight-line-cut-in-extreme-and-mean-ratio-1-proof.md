* For if (double `$AC$` is) not (greater than `$BC$`), if possible, let `$BC$` be double `$CA$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BC$` (is) four times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CA$`.
* Thus, the (sum of) the (squares) on `$BC$` and `$CA$` (is) five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CA$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` was assumed (to be) five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CA$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` is equal to the (sum of) the (squares) on `$BC$` and `$CA$`.
* The very thing (is) [impossible][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 2.4]][bookofproofs$1017].
* Thus, `$CB$` is not double `$AC$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) less than `$CB$` is not double `$AC$` either.
* For (in this case) the absurdity is much [greater].
* Thus, double `$AC$` is greater than `$CB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
