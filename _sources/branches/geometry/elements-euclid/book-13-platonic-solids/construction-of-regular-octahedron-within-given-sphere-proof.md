* Let the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$AB$` of the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] be laid out, and let it have been cut in half at `$C$`.
* And let the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$ADB$` have been drawn on `$AB$`.
* And let `$CD$` be drawn from `$C$` at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$`.
* And let `$DB$` have been joined.
* And let the square `$EFGH$`, having each of its sides equal to `$DB$`, be laid out.
* And let `$HF$` and `$EG$` have been joined.
* And let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$KL$` have been set up, at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$K$`, at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of square `$EFGH$` [[Prop. 11.12]][bookofproofs$2249].
* And let it have been drawn across on the other side of the plane, like `$KM$`.
* And let `$KL$` and `$KM$`, equal to one of `$EK$`, `$FK$`, `$GK$`, and `$HK$`, have been cut off from `$KL$` and `$KM$`, respectively.
* And let `$LE$`, `$LF$`, `$LG$`, `$LH$`, `$ME$`, `$MF$`, `$MG$`, and `$MH$` have been joined.
* And since `$KE$` is equal to `$KH$`, and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EKH$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the `$HE$` is thus double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EK$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Again, since `$LK$` is equal to `$KE$`, and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$LKE$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EL$` is thus double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EK$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$HE$` was also shown (to be) double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EK$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LE$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EH$`.
* Thus, `$LE$` is equal to `$EH$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$LH$` is also equal to `$HE$`.
* [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$LEH$` is thus equilateral.
* So, similarly, we can show that each of the remaining [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], whose bases are the sides of the square `$EFGH$`, and apexes the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$L$` and `$M$`, are equilateral.
* Thus, an [octahedron][bookofproofs$2235] contained by eight [equilateral triangles][bookofproofs$688] has been constructed.
* So, it is also necessary to enclose it by the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223], and to show that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [octahedron][bookofproofs$2235].
* For since the three ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$LK$`, `$KM$`, and `$KE$` are equal to one another, the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] drawn on `$LM$` will thus also pass through `$E$`.
* And, for the same (reasons), if `$LM$` remains (fixed), and the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] is carried around, and again established at the same (position) from which it began to be moved, then it will also pass through [points][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`, `$G$`, and `$H$`, and the [octahedron][bookofproofs$2235] will have been enclosed by a [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* So, I say that (it is) also (enclosed) by the given ([sphere][bookofproofs$2223]).
* For since `$LK$` is equal to `$KM$`, and `$KE$` (is) common, and they contain [right angles][bookofproofs$653], the base `$LE$` is thus equal to the base `$EM$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And since angle `$LEM$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] - for (it is) in a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911] - the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LM$` is thus double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LE$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Again, since `$AC$` is equal to `$CB$`, `$AB$` is double `$BC$`.
* And as `$AB$` (is) to `$BC$`, so the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994], [ [Def. 5.9] ][bookofproofs$1948].
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LM$` was also shown (to be) double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LE$`.
* And the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DB$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LE$`.
* For `$EH$` was made equal to `$DB$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` (is) also equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$LM$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` (is) equal to `$LM$`.
* And `$AB$` is the [diameter of the given sphere][bookofproofs$2226].
* Thus, `$LM$` is equal to the [diameter of the given sphere][bookofproofs$2226].
* Thus, the [octahedron][bookofproofs$2235] has been enclosed by the given [sphere][bookofproofs$2223], and it has been simultaneously proved that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226] is double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [octahedron][bookofproofs$2235].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
