### (Proposition 10 from Book 13 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If an equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is [inscribed in a circle][bookofproofs$1920] then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is (equal to) the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on the (sides) of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] and of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571] inscribed in the same [circle][bookofproofs$690]$^\dag$
* Let `$ABCDE$` be a [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* And let the equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$` have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCDE$`.
* I say that the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the side of [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$` is the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on the sides of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] and of the [decagon][bookofproofs$6571] [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCDE$`.

### Modern Formulation

If the [circle][bookofproofs$690] is of [unit][bookofproofs$2314] [radius][bookofproofs$690] then the side of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] is `\[\frac{\sqrt{10-2\,\sqrt{5}}}2.\]`
