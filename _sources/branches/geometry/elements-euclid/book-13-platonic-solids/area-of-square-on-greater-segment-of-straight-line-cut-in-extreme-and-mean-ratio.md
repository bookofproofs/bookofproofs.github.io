### (Proposition 1 from Book 13 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] then the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the greater piece, added to half of the whole, is five times the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the half.

* For let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` have been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, and let `$AC$` be the greater piece.
* And let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AD$` have been produced in a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] with `$CA$`.
* And let `$AD$` be made (equal to) half of `$AB$`.
* I say that the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CD$` is five times the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DA$`.
