* For let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AC$` and `$BE$`, cutting one another at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$`, have subtended two consecutive [angles][bookofproofs$650], at `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively), of the [equilateral and equiangular pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$`.
* I say that each of them has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$`, and that their greater pieces are equal to the sides of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447].

* For let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCDE$` have been [circumscribed about][bookofproofs$6438] [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$` [[Prop. 4.14]][bookofproofs$1938].
* And since the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$EA$` and `$AB$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` and `$BC$` (respectively), and they contain equal [angles][bookofproofs$650], the base `$BE$` is thus equal to the base `$AC$`, and [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABE$` is equal to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] will be equal to the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650], respectively, which the equal sides subtend [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` is equal to (angle) `$ABE$`.
* Thus, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$AHE$` (is) double (angle) `$BAH$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* And `$EAC$` is also double `$BAC$`, inasmuch as [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$EDC$` is also double [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$CB$` [[Prop. 3.28]][bookofproofs$1908], [[Prop. 6.33]][bookofproofs$2019].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$HAE$` (is) equal to (angle) `$AHE$`.
* Hence, [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$HE$` is also equal to ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$EA$` - that is to say, to ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.6]][bookofproofs$743].
* And since [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BA$` is equal to `$AE$`, angle `$ABE$` is also equal to `$AEB$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* But, `$ABE$` was shown (to be) equal to `$BAH$`.
* Thus, `$BEA$` is also equal to `$BAH$`.
* And (angle) `$ABE$` is common to the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABE$` and `$ABH$`.
* Thus, the remaining [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAE$` is equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$AHB$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABE$` is equiangular to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABH$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as `$EB$` is to `$BA$`, so `$AB$` (is) to `$BH$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* And `$BA$` (is) equal to `$EH$`.
* Thus, as `$BE$` (is) to `$EH$`, so `$EH$` (is) to `$HB$`.
* And `$BE$` (is) greater than `$EH$`.
* `$EH$` (is) thus also greater than `$HB$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Thus, `$BE$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$H$`, and the greater piece `$HE$` is equal to the side of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447].
* So, similarly, we can show that `$AC$` has also been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$H$`, and that its greater piece `$CH$` is equal to the side of the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
