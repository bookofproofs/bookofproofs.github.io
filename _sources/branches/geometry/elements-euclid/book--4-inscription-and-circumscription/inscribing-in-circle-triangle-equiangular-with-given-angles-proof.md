* Let `$GH$` have been drawn [touching][bookofproofs$1853] [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` at `$A$`.[^1] And Let [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$HAC$`, equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DEF$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AH$` at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` on it, and (angle) `$GAB$`, equal to [angle] `$DFE$`, on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AG$` at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` on it [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* And let `$BC$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AH$` [touches][bookofproofs$1853] the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` has been drawn across (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) from the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact `$A$`, (angle) `$HAC$` is thus equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` in the alternate [segment of the circle][bookofproofs$1852] [[Prop. 3.32]][bookofproofs$1912].
* But, `$HAC$` is equal to `$DEF$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` is also equal to `$DEF$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$ACB$` is also equal to `$DFE$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` is equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$EDF$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is equiangular[^2] with triangle `$DEF$`, and has been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABC$`].
* Thus, a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], equiangular with the given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], has been [inscribed in the given circle][bookofproofs$1920].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

[^1]: Presumably, by finding the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of `$ABC$` [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], drawing a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] between the [center][bookofproofs$6428] and [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, and then drawing `$GH$` through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the aforementioned [straight line][bookofproofs$645] [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759] (translator's note).

[^2]: I.e. a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] with given [angles][bookofproofs$650] (editor's note).
