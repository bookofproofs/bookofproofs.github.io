> And a [circle][bookofproofs$690] is said to be **circumscribed about a rectilinear (figure)** when the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] touches each angle of the [ (rectilinear) figure][bookofproofs$687] about which it is circumscribed.

### Modern Formulation

If a [rectilinear figure is inscribed in the circle][bookofproofs$1920], then the circle is said to be **circumscribed** about the figure.

### Example 

The pentagon is inscribed in a circle and the circle is circumscribed about the pentagon:
