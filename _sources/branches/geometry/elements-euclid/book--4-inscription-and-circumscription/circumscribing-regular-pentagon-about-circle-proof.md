* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, and `$E$` have been conceived as the angular [points][bookofproofs$631] of a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] having been [inscribed][bookofproofs$1920] (in [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCDE$`) [[Prop. 3.11]][bookofproofs$1891], such that the [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, `$DE$`, and `$EA$` are equal.
* And let `$GH$`, `$HK$`, `$KL$`, `$LM$`, and `$MG$` have been drawn through ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, and `$E$` (respectively)[^1], [touching the circle][bookofproofs$1853].
* And let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$F$` of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCDE$` have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058].
* And let `$FB$`, `$FK$`, `$FC$`, `$FL$`, and `$FD$` have been joined.
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$KL$` touches ([circle][bookofproofs$690]) `$ABCDE$` at `$C$`, and `$FC$` has been joined from the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$F$` to the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact `$C$`, `$FC$` is thus [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$KL$` [[Prop. 3.18]][bookofproofs$1898].
* Thus, each of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$C$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* So, for the same (reasons), the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$B$` and `$D$` are also [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And since angle `$FCK$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FK$` is thus equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$FC$` and `$CK$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* So, for the same (reasons), the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FK$` is also equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$FB$` and `$BK$`.
* So that the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$FC$` and `$CK$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$FB$` and `$BK$`, of which the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FC$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FB$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$CK$` is equal to the remaining [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BK$`.
* Thus, `$BK$` (is) equal to `$CK$`.
* And since `$FB$` is equal to `$FC$`, and `$FK$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BF$`, `$FK$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$CF$`, `$FK$`.
* And the base `$BK$` [is] equal to the base `$CK$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BFK$` is equal to [angle] `$KFC$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* And `$BKF$` (is equal) to `$FKC$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* Thus, `$BFC$` (is) double `$KFC$`, and `$BKC$` (is double) `$FKC$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$CFD$` is also double `$CFL$`, and `$DLC$` (is also double) `$FLC$`.
* And since [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BC$` is equal to `$CD$`, angle `$BFC$` is also equal to `$CFD$` [[Prop. 3.27]][bookofproofs$1907].
* And `$BFC$` is double `$KFC$`, and `$DFC$` (is double) `$LFC$`.
* Thus, `$KFC$` is also equal to `$LFC$`.
* And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FCK$` is also equal to `$FCL$`.
* So, `$FKC$` and `$FLC$` are two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having two [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to two [angles][bookofproofs$650], and one side equal to one side, (namely) their common (side) `$FC$`.
* Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the (corresponding) remaining sides, and the remaining [angle][bookofproofs$650] to the remaining [angle][bookofproofs$650] [[Prop. 1.26]][bookofproofs$905].
* Thus, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$KC$` (is) equal to `$CL$`, and the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FKC$` to `$FLC$`.
* And since `$KC$` is equal to `$CL$`, `$KL$` (is) thus double `$KC$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), it can be shown that `$HK$` (is) also double `$BK$`.
* And `$BK$` is equal to `$KC$`.
* Thus, `$HK$` is also equal to `$KL$`.
* So, similarly, each of `$HG$`, `$GM$`, and `$ML$` can also be shown (to be) equal to each of `$HK$` and `$KL$`.
* Thus, [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$GHKLM$` is equilateral.
* So I say that (it is) also equiangular.
* For since angle `$FKC$` is equal to `$FLC$`, and `$HKL$` was shown (to be) double `$FKC$`, and `$KLM$` double `$FLC$`, `$HKL$` is thus also equal to `$KLM$`.
* So, similarly, each of `$KHG$`, `$HGM$`, and `$GML$` can also be shown (to be) equal to each of `$HKL$` and `$KLM$`.
* Thus, the five [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$GHK$`, `$HKL$`, `$KLM$`, `$LMG$`, and `$MGH$` are equal to one another.
* Thus, the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$GHKLM$` is equiangular.
* And it was also shown (to be) equilateral, and has been [circumscribed about circle][bookofproofs$1921] `$ABCDE$`.
* Thus, an [equilateral and equiangular pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] has been [circumscribed about the given circle][bookofproofs$1921]].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
