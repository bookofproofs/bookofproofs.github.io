### (Proposition 5 from Book 4 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To [circumscribe a circle][bookofproofs$6438] about a given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432].
* Let `$ABC$` be the given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432].
* So it is required to [circumscribe a circle][bookofproofs$6438] about the given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`.
