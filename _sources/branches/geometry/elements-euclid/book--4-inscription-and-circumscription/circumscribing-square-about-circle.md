### Euclid's Formulation

> To [circumscribe][bookofproofs$1921] a [square][bookofproofs$909] about a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* Let `$ABCD$` be the given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* So it is required to [circumscribe][bookofproofs$1921] a [square][bookofproofs$909] about [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`.
