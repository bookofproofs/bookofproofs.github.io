### (Proposition 14 from Book 4 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To [circumscribe a circle][bookofproofs$6438] about a given [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] which is equilateral and equiangular.
* Let `$ABCDE$` be the given [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] which is equilateral and equiangular.
* So it is required to [circumscribe a circle][bookofproofs$6438] about the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$`.
