### (Proposition 10 from Book 4 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To construct an [isosceles triangle][bookofproofs$688] having each of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at the base double the remaining (angle).

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to construct an [isosceles triangle][bookofproofs$688] having the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at the base twice as big as the remaining angle (i.e. a triangle with the angles `$72^\circ$`, `$72^\circ$` and `$36^\circ$`).
