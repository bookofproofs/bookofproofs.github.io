* Let a [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$BC$` of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` have been drawn.[^1] Therefore, if `$BC$` is equal to `$D$` then that (which) was prescribed has taken place.
* For the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BC$`, equal to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$D$`, has been [inserted into the circle][bookofproofs$1012] `$ABC$`.
* And if `$BC$` is greater than `$D$` then let `$CE$` be made equal to `$D$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736], and let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EAF$` have been drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$C$` and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$CE$`.
* And let `$CA$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EAF$`, `$CA$` is equal to `$CE$`.
* But, `$CE$` is equal to `$D$`.
* Thus, `$D$` is also equal to `$CA$`.
* Thus, `$CA$`, equal to the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$D$`, has been [inserted into the given circle][bookofproofs$1012] `$ABC$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.[^2]

[^1]: Presumably, by finding the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and then drawing a line through it (translator's note).

[^2]: It has been shown that it is possible to construct a [chord][bookofproofs$1012] of a circle with a length less or equal to the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429].
