> A [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is said to be **inserted into a circle** when its extremities are on the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].

### Modern Formulation

A **chord** of a [circle][bookofproofs$690] is a [segment][bookofproofs$645] which intersects two [points][bookofproofs$631] of the circleâ€™s circumference.

If the chord is extended in both directions, then this line is called a **secant**.

Note: A the special case of a chord which goes through the [center of the circle][bookofproofs$6428], is its [diameter][bookofproofs$6429].
