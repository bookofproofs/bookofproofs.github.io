> A [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] is said to be **inscribed in a circle** when each [angle][bookofproofs$650] of the inscribed (figure) touches the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].


### Modern Formulation

A [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] (`\(n\)`-sided figure, `\(n \ge 3\)`) is said to be **inscribed** in a [circle][bookofproofs$690] when each of its vertices is in the circumference of the circle. 

### Example 

The pentagon is inscribed in a circle:
