### (Definitions 4 from Book 4 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> And a [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] is said to be **circumscribed about a circle** when each side of the circumscribed (figure) touches the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].

### Modern Formulation

A [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] (`\(n\)`-sided figure, `\(n \ge 3\)`) is said to be **circumscribed** about a [circle][bookofproofs$690] when each side of the figure is [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] to the circumference of the circle. 

### Example 

The pentagon is circumscribed about a circle:
