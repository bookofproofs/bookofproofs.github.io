### (Proposition 15 from Book 4 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To [inscribe][bookofproofs$1920] an equilateral and equiangular [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] in a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* Let `$ABCDEF$` be the given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* So it is required to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] in [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCDEF$`.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to [inscribe][bookofproofs$1920] a [regular hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] in a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
