* Let two [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, `$AC$` and `$BD$`, have been drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to one another.[^1] And let `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, and `$DA$` have been joined.
* And since `$BE$` is equal to `$ED$`, for `$E$` (is) the [center][bookofproofs$6428] (of the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), and `$EA$` is common and at [right angles][bookofproofs$653], the base `$AB$` is thus equal to the base `$AD$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* So, for the same (reasons), each of `$BC$` and `$CD$` is equal to each of `$AB$` and `$AD$`.
* Thus, the [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCD$` is equilateral.
* So I say that (it is) also right-angled.
* For since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$` is a [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, `$BAD$` is thus a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAD$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911].
* So, for the same (reasons), ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$ABC$`, `$BCD$`, and `$CDA$` are also each [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCD$` is right-angled.
* And it was also shown (to be) equilateral.
* Thus, it is a [square][bookofproofs$909] [ [Def. 1.22] ][bookofproofs$909].
* And it has been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCD$`.
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` has been [inscribed in the given circle][bookofproofs$1920].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

[^1]: Presumably, by finding the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], drawing a line through it, and then drawing a second line through it, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the first [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759] (translator's note).
