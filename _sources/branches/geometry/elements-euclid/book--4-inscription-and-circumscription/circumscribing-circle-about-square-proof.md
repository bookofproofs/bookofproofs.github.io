* `$AC$` and `$BD$` being joined, let them cut one another at `$E$`.
* And since `$DA$` is equal to `$AB$`, and `$AC$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DA$`, `$AC$` are thus equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BA$`, `$AC$`.
* And the base `$DC$` (is) equal to the base `$BC$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DAC$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753].
* Thus, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DAB$` has been cut in half by `$AC$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that `$ABC$`, `$BCD$`, and `$CDA$` have each been cut in half by the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` and `$DB$`.
* And since angle `$DAB$` is equal to `$ABC$`, and `$EAB$` is half of `$DAB$`, and `$EBA$` half of `$ABC$`, `$EAB$` is thus also equal to `$EBA$`.
* So that side `$EA$` is also equal to `$EB$` [[Prop. 1.6]][bookofproofs$743].
* So, similarly, we can show that each of the [[straight lines][bookofproofs$645]] `$EA$` and `$EB$` are also equal to each of `$EC$` and `$ED$`.
* Thus, the four ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$EA$`, `$EB$`, `$EC$`, and `$ED$` are equal to one another.
* Thus, the [circle][bookofproofs$690] drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$E$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] one of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, or `$D$`, will also go through the remaining [points][bookofproofs$631], and will have been [circumscribed about the square][bookofproofs$6438] `$ABCD$`.
* Let it have been (so) circumscribed, like `$ABCD$` (in the figure).
* Thus, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] has been [circumscribed about][bookofproofs$6438] the given [square][bookofproofs$909].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
