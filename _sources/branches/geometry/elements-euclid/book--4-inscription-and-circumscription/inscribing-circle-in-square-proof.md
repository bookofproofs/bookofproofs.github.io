* Let `$AD$` and `$AB$` each have been cut in half at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` and `$F$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757].
* And let `$EH$` have been drawn through `$E$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$AB$` or `$CD$`, and let `$FK$` have been drawn through `$F$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$AD$` or `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* Thus, `$AK$`, `$KB$`, `$AH$`, `$HD$`, `$AG$`, `$GC$`, `$BG$`, and `$GD$` are each [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909], and their opposite sides [are] manifestly equal [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* And since `$AD$` is equal to `$AB$`, and `$AE$` is half of `$AD$`, and `$AF$` half of `$AB$`, `$AE$` (is) thus also equal to `$AF$`.
* So that the opposite (sides are) also (equal).
* Thus, `$FG$` (is) also equal to `$GE$`.
* So, similarly, we can also show that each of `$GH$` and `$GK$` is equal to each of `$FG$` and `$GE$`.
* Thus, the four ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$GE$`, `$GF$`, `$GH$`, and `$GK$` [are] equal to one another.
* Thus, the [circle][bookofproofs$690] drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$G$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] one of `$E$`, `$F$`, `$H$`, or `$K$`, will also go through the remaining [points][bookofproofs$631].
* And it will [touch][bookofproofs$1853] the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, and `$DA$`, on account of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$E$`, `$F$`, `$H$`, and `$K$` being [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* For if the [circle][bookofproofs$690] cuts `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, or `$DA$`, then a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to a [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], from its extremity, will fall inside the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* The very thing was shown (to be) absurd [[Prop. 3.16]][bookofproofs$1896].
* Thus, the [circle][bookofproofs$690] drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$G$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] one of `$E$`, `$F$`, `$H$`, or `$K$`, does not cut the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, or `$DA$`.
* Thus, it will [touch][bookofproofs$1853] them, and will have been [inscribed in the square][bookofproofs$6439] `$ABCD$`.
* Thus, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] has been [inscribed][bookofproofs$6439] in the given [square][bookofproofs$909].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
