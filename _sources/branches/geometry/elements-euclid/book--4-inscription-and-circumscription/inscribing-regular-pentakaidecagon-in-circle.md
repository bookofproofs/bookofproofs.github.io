### Euclid's Formulation

> To [inscribe][bookofproofs$6439] an equilateral and equiangular fifteen-sided figure in a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].

* Let `$ABCD$` be the given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* So it is required to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular [fifteen-sided figure][bookofproofs$687] in [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to [inscribe][bookofproofs$6439] a regular **pentakaidecagon** (regular `$15$`-sided figure) in a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
