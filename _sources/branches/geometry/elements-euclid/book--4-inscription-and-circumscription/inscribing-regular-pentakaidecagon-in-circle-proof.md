* Let the side `$AC$` of an [equilateral triangle][bookofproofs$688] inscribed in (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) [[Prop. 4.2]][bookofproofs$1926], and (the side) `$AB$` of an (inscribed) equilateral [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] [[Prop. 4.11]][bookofproofs$1935], have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCD$`.
* Thus, just as the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` is (made up) of fifteen equal pieces, the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`, being a third of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], will be (made up) of five such (pieces), and the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$`, being a fifth of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], will be (made up) of three.
* Thus, the remainder `$BC$` (will be made up) of two equal (pieces).
* Let ([circumference][bookofproofs$690]) `$BC$` have been cut in half at `$E$` [[Prop. 3.30]][bookofproofs$1910].
* Thus, each of the [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$BE$` and `$EC$` is one fifteenth of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCDE$`.
* Thus, if, joining `$BE$` and `$EC$`, we continuously [insert][bookofproofs$1012] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] equal to them into [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD[E]$` [[Prop. 4.1]][bookofproofs$1925], then an equilateral and equiangular fifteen-sided figure will have been [inserted into (the circle) ][bookofproofs$1012].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
* And similarly to the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447], if we draw [tangents][bookofproofs$1853] to the [circle][bookofproofs$690] through the (fifteenfold) divisions of the ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the) [circle][bookofproofs$690], we can circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular fifteen-sided figure about the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* And, further, through similar proofs to the [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447], we can also [inscribe][bookofproofs$1920] and [circumscribe a circle][bookofproofs$6438] in (and about) a given [fifteen-sided figure][bookofproofs$687].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
