### Euclid's Formulation

> To [insert][bookofproofs$1012] a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] equal to a given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] into a [circle][bookofproofs$690], (the latter [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) not being greater than the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* Let `$ABC$` be the given [circle][bookofproofs$690], and `$D$` the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] (which is) not greater than the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* So it is required to [insert][bookofproofs$1012] a [straight line][bookofproofs$645], equal to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$D$`, into the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to construct a [chord][bookofproofs$1012] of a circle with a length less or equal to the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429].
