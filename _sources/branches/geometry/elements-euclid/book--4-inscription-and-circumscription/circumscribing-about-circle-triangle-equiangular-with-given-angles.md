### (Proposition 3 from Book 4 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To [circumscribe][bookofproofs$1921] a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], equiangular with a given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], about a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* Let `$ABC$` be the given [circle][bookofproofs$690], and `$DEF$` the given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432].
* So it is required to [circumscribe][bookofproofs$1921] a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], equiangular with triangle `$DEF$`, about [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to [circumscribe][bookofproofs$1921] a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] with a given [angles][bookofproofs$650], about a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
