* Let the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` and `$ACB$` have been cut in half by the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$` and `$CD$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.9]][bookofproofs$755], and let them meet one another at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, and let `$DE$`, `$DF$`, and `$DG$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, `$BC$`, and `$CA$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.12]][bookofproofs$760].
* And since angle `$ABD$` is equal to `$CBD$`, and the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] `$BED$` is also equal to the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] `$BFD$`, `$EBD$` and `$FBD$` are thus two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having two [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to two [angles][bookofproofs$650], and one side equal to one side - the (one) subtending one of the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] (which is) common to the ([triangles][bookofproofs$6432]) - (namely), `$BD$`.
* Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the (corresponding) remaining sides [[Prop. 1.26]][bookofproofs$905].
* Thus, `$DE$` (is) equal to `$DF$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$DG$` is also equal to `$DF$`.
* Thus, the three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$DE$`, `$DF$`, and `$DG$` are equal to one another.
* Thus, the [circle][bookofproofs$690] drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$D$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] one of `$E$`, `$F$`, or `$G$`,[^1] will also go through the remaining [points][bookofproofs$631], and will touch the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, `$BC$`, and `$CA$`, on account of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$E$`, `$F$`, and `$G$` being [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* For if it cuts (one of) them then it will be a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to a [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], from its extremity, falling inside the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* The very thing was shown (to be) absurd [[Prop. 3.16]][bookofproofs$1896].
* Thus, the [circle][bookofproofs$690] drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$D$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] one of `$E$`, `$F$`, or `$G$`, does not cut the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, `$BC$`, and `$CA$`.
* Thus, it will touch them and will be the [circle][bookofproofs$690] inscribed in [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`.
* Let it have been (so) inscribed, like `$FGE$` (in the figure).
* Thus, the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFG$` has been [inscribed][bookofproofs$6439] in the given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

[^1]: Here, and in the following propositions, it is understood that the [radius][bookofproofs$690] is actually one of `$DE$`, `$DF$`, or `$DG$` (translator's note).
