### Euclid's Formulation

> To [inscribe][bookofproofs$1920] an [equilateral and equiangular pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] in a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* Let `$ABCDE$` be the given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* So it is required to [inscribe][bookofproofs$1920] an [equilateral and equiangular pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] in [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCDE$`.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to [inscribe][bookofproofs$1920] a [regular pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] in a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
