### Euclid's Formulation

> To [inscribe][bookofproofs$1920] a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], equiangular with a given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], in a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* Let `$ABC$` be the given [circle][bookofproofs$690], and `$DEF$` the given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432].
* So it is required to [inscribe][bookofproofs$1920] a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], equiangular with triangle `$DEF$`, in [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to [inscribe][bookofproofs$1920] a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] with given [angles][bookofproofs$650] into a [circle][bookofproofs$690].
