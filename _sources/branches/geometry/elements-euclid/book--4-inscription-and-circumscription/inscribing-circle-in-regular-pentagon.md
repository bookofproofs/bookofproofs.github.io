### Euclid's Formulation

> To [inscribe a circle][bookofproofs$6439] in a given [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447], which is equilateral and equiangular.
* Let `$ABCDE$` be the given [equilateral and equiangular pentagon][bookofproofs$6447].
* So it is required to [inscribe a circle][bookofproofs$6439] in [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] `$ABCDE$`.
