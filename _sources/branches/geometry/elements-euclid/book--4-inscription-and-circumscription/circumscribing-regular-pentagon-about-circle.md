### Euclid's Formulation

> To [circumscribe][bookofproofs$1921] an [equilateral and equiangular pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] about a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].

* Let `$ABCDE$` be the given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* So it is required to [circumscribe][bookofproofs$1921] an [equilateral and equiangular pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] about [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCDE$`.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to [circumscribe][bookofproofs$1921] a [regular pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] about a given [circle][bookofproofs$690].
