### (Corollary to Proposition 15 from Book 4 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So, from this, (it is) manifest that a side of the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] is equal to the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690]. And similarly to a [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447], if we draw tangents to the [circle][bookofproofs$690] through the (sixfold) divisions of the ([circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the) [circle][bookofproofs$690], an equilateral and equiangular [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] can be [circumscribed about the circle][bookofproofs$1921], analogously to the aforementioned [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447]. And, further, by (means) similar to the aforementioned [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447], we can [inscribe][bookofproofs$6439] and [circumscribe a circle][bookofproofs$6438] in (and about) a given [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448]. (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

### Modern Formulation

The side of a [regular hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] which is [inscribed][bookofproofs$6439] in a [circle][bookofproofs$690] is equal to the radius of that circle. Moreover, by drawing a [tangent][bookofproofs$1853] to the circle through each of the edges of the inscribed regular hexagon, we get another regular hexagon, which is [circumscribed about circle][bookofproofs$6438].
