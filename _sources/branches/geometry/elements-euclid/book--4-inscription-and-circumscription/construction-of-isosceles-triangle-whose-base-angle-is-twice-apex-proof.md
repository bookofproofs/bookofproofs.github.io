* Let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` be taken, and let it have been cut at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` so that the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$CA$` [[Prop. 2.11]][bookofproofs$1025].
* And let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$BDE$` have been drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$A$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$`.
* And let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$`, equal to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$`, being not greater than the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$BDE$`, have been [inserted into circle][bookofproofs$1012] `$BDE$` [[Prop. 4.1]][bookofproofs$1925].
* And let `$AD$` and `$DC$` have been joined.
* And let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ACD$` have been [circumscribed about][bookofproofs$6438] triangle `$ACD$` [[Prop. 4.5]][bookofproofs$1929].

* And since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$`, and `$AC$` (is) equal to `$BD$`, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is thus equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`.
* And since some [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` has been taken outside of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ACD$`, and two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$BA$` and `$BD$` have radiated from `$B$` towards the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ACD$`, and (one) of them cuts (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), and (the other) meets (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]), and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$BC$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`, `$BD$` thus [touches circle][bookofproofs$1853] `$ACD$` [[Prop. 3.37]][bookofproofs$1917].
* Therefore, since `$BD$` [touches (the circle) ][bookofproofs$1853], and `$DC$` has been drawn across (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) from the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact `$D$`, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BDC$` is thus equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DAC$` in the alternate [segment of the circle][bookofproofs$1852] [[Prop. 3.32]][bookofproofs$1912].
* Therefore, since `$BDC$` is equal to `$DAC$`, let `$CDA$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the whole of `$BDA$` is equal to the two ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$CDA$` and `$DAC$`.
* But, the external (angle) `$BCD$` is equal to `$CDA$` and `$DAC$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, `$BDA$` is also equal to `$BCD$`.
* But, `$BDA$` is equal to `$CBD$`, since the side `$AD$` is also equal to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* So that `$DBA$` is also equal to `$BCD$`.
* Thus, the three ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$BDA$`, `$DBA$`, and `$BCD$` are equal to one another.
* And since angle `$DBC$` is equal to `$BCD$`, side `$BD$` is also equal to side `$DC$` [[Prop. 1.6]][bookofproofs$743].
* But, `$BD$` was assumed (to be) equal to `$CA$`.
* Thus, `$CA$` is also equal to `$CD$`.
* So that [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$CDA$` is also equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DAC$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* Thus, `$CDA$` and `$DAC$` is double `$DAC$`.
* But `$BCD$` (is) equal to `$CDA$` and `$DAC$`.
* Thus, `$BCD$` is also double `$CAD$`.
* And `$BCD$` (is) equal to to each of `$BDA$` and `$DBA$`.
* Thus, `$BDA$` and `$DBA$` are each double `$DAB$`.
* Thus, the [isosceles triangle][bookofproofs$688] `$ABD$` has been constructed having each of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at the base `$BD$` double the remaining (angle).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
