> And, similarly, a [ (rectilinear) figure][bookofproofs$687] is said to be **circumscribed about a(nother rectilinear) figure** when the respective sides of the circumscribed (figure) touch the respective [angles][bookofproofs$650] of the (figure) about which it is circumscribed.

### Modern Formulation

A [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `\(A\)` is said to be **circumscribed** about another rectilinear figure `\(B\)`, if and only if all the sides of `\(A\)` pass through the vertices of `\(B\)`. In this case, `\(B\)` is [inscribed][bookofproofs$1918] in `\(A\)`. 

### Example

The `\(4\)`-sided figure `\( A B C D \)` is circumscribed about the `\(4\)`-sided figure `\( E F G H \)`, and the `\(4\)`-sided figure `\(  E F G H \)` is inscribed about the `\(4\)`-sided figure `\( A B C D \)`, :
