* For let [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BCD$` and `$CDE$` have each been cut in half by each of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$CF$` and `$DF$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.9]][bookofproofs$755].
* And from the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`, at which the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$CF$` and `$DF$` meet one another, let the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$FB$`, `$FA$`, and `$FE$` have been joined.
* And since `$BC$` is equal to `$CD$`, and `$CF$` (is) common, the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BC$`, `$CF$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DC$`, `$CF$`.
* And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BCF$` [is] equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DCF$`.
* Thus, the base `$BF$` is equal to the base `$DF$`, and triangle `$BCF$` is equal to triangle `$DCF$`, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] will be equal to the (corresponding) remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] which the equal sides subtend [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$CBF$` (is) equal to `$CDF$`.
* And since `$CDE$` is double `$CDF$`, and `$CDE$` (is) equal to `$ABC$`, and `$CDF$` to `$CBF$`, `$CBA$` is thus also double `$CBF$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABF$` is equal to `$FBC$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` has been cut in half by the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BF$`.
* So, similarly, it can be shown that `$BAE$` and `$AED$` have been cut in half by the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$FA$` and `$FE$`, respectively.
* So let `$FG$`, `$FH$`, `$FK$`, `$FL$`, and `$FM$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`, [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, `$DE$`, and `$EA$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.12]][bookofproofs$760].
* And since angle `$HCF$` is equal to `$KCF$`, and the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] `$FHC$` is also equal to the [[right angle][bookofproofs$653]] `$FKC$`, `$FHC$` and `$FKC$` are two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having two [angles][bookofproofs$650] equal to two [angles][bookofproofs$650], and one side equal to one side, (namely) their common (side) `$FC$`, subtending one of the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650].
* Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the (corresponding) remaining sides [[Prop. 1.26]][bookofproofs$905].
* Thus, the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] `$FH$` (is) equal to the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] `$FK$`.
* So, similarly, it can be shown that `$FL$`, `$FM$`, and `$FG$` are each equal to each of `$FH$` and `$FK$`.
* Thus, the five [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$FG$`, `$FH$`, `$FK$`, `$FL$`, and `$FM$` are equal to one another.
* Thus, the [circle][bookofproofs$690] drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$F$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] one of `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$L$`, or `$M$`, will also go through the remaining [points][bookofproofs$631], and will [touch][bookofproofs$1853] the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, `$DE$`, and `$EA$`, on account of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$L$`, and `$M$` being [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* For if it does not touch them, but cuts them, it follows that a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], from its extremity, falls inside the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* The very thing was shown (to be) absurd [[Prop. 3.16]][bookofproofs$1896].
* Thus, the [circle][bookofproofs$690] drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$F$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] one of `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$L$`, or `$M$`, does not cut the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, `$DE$`, or `$EA$`.
* Thus, it will [touch][bookofproofs$1853] them.
* Let it have been drawn, like `$GHKLM$` (in the figure).
* Thus, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] has been [inscribed][bookofproofs$6439] in the given [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447] which is equilateral and equiangular.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
