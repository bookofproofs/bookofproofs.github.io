* Let `$EF$` have been produced in each direction to [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$H$`.
* And let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$K$` of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058].
* And let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$KB$` have been drawn, at random, across ($ABC$).
* And Let [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BKA$`, equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DEG$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$KB$` at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$K$` on it, and (angle) `$BKC$`, equal to `$DFH$` [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* And let the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$LAM$`, `$MBN$`, and `$NCL$` have been drawn through the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` (respectively), touching the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.[^1]
* And since `$LM$`, `$MN$`, and `$NL$` [touch][bookofproofs$1853] [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$` at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` (respectively), and `$KA$`, `$KB$`, and `$KC$` are joined from the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$K$` to [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` (respectively), the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` are thus [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.18]][bookofproofs$1898].
* And since the (sum of the) four [angles][bookofproofs$650] of [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] `$AMBK$` is equal to four [right angles][bookofproofs$653], inasmuch as `$AMBK$` (can) also (be) divided into two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924], and [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$KAM$` and `$KBM$` are (both) [right angles][bookofproofs$653], the (sum of the) remaining ([angles][bookofproofs$650]), `$AKB$` and `$AMB$`, is thus equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And `$DEG$` and `$DEF$` is also equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.13]][bookofproofs$763].
* Thus, `$AKB$` and `$AMB$` is equal to `$DEG$` and `$DEF$`, of which `$AKB$` is equal to `$DEG$`.
* Thus, the remainder `$AMB$` is equal to the remainder `$DEF$`.
* So, similarly, it can be shown that `$LNB$` is also equal to `$DFE$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$MLN$` is also equal to the [remaining] (angle) `$EDF$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, triangle `$LMN$` is equiangular with triangle `$DEF$`.
* And it has been drawn around [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABC$`.
* Thus, a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], equiangular[^2] with the given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], has been [circumscribed about the given circle][bookofproofs$1921].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.[^2]

[^1]: Presumably, by finding the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of `$ABC$` [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], drawing a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] between the [center][bookofproofs$6428] and [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, respectively, and then drawing `$LAM$`, `$MBN$`, and `$NCL$`  through those [points][bookofproofs$631], at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the aforementioned [straight line][bookofproofs$645] [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759] (translator's note).

[^2]: I.e. a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] with a given [angles][bookofproofs$650] (editor's note).
