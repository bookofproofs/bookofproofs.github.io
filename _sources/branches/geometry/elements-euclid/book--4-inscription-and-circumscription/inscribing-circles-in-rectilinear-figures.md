> And, similarly, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] is said to be **inscribed in a  (rectilinear) figure** when the [circumference][bookofproofs$690] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] touches each side of the ([figure][bookofproofs$687]) in which it is inscribed.

### Modern Formulation

If a [rectilinear figure is circumscribed about a circle][bookofproofs$1921], then the circle is said to be **inscribed** in that figure.

### Example 

The pentagon is circumscribed about a circle and the circle is inscribed in the pentagon:
