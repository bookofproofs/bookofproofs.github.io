* Let the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$AD$` of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCDEF$` have been drawn,[^1] and let the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$G$` of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] have been found [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058].
* And let the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EGCH$` have been drawn, with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$D$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$DG$`.
* And `$EG$` and `$CG$` being joined, let them have been drawn across (the [circle][bookofproofs$690]) to [points][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` and `$F$` (respectively).
* And let `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, `$DE$`, `$EF$`, and `$FA$` have been joined.
* I say that the [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] `$ABCDEF$` is equilateral and equiangular.
* For since [point][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCDEF$`, `$GE$` is equal to `$GD$`.
* Again, since [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$GCH$`, `$DE$` is equal to `$DG$`.
* But, `$GE$` was shown (to be) equal to `$GD$`.
* Thus, `$GE$` is also equal to `$ED$`.
* Thus, triangle `$EGD$` is equilateral.
* Thus, its three [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$EGD$`, `$GDE$`, and `$DEG$` are also equal to one another, inasmuch as the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at the base of [isosceles triangles][bookofproofs$688] are equal to one another [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* And the three [angles][bookofproofs$650] of the triangle are equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EGD$` is one third of two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* So, similarly, `$DGC$` can also be shown (to be) one third of two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$CG$`, standing on `$EB$`, makes adjacent [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$EGC$` and `$CGB$` equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.13]][bookofproofs$763], the remaining [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$CGB$` is thus also one third of two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$EGD$`, `$DGC$`, and `$CGB$` are equal to one another.
* And hence the ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) opposite to them `$BGA$`, `$AGF$`, and `$FGE$` are also equal [to `$EGD$`, `$DGC$`, and `$CGB$` (respectively)] [[Prop. 1.15]][bookofproofs$782].
* Thus, the six [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$EGD$`, `$DGC$`, `$CGB$`, `$BGA$`, `$AGF$`, and `$FGE$` are equal to one another.
* And equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] stand on equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] [[Prop. 3.26]][bookofproofs$1906].
* Thus, the six [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, `$DE$`, `$EF$`, and `$FA$` are equal to one another.
* And equal [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] are subtended by equal [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] [[Prop. 3.29]][bookofproofs$1909].
* Thus, the six [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] ($AB$, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, `$DE$`, `$EF$`, and `$FA$`) are equal to one another.
* Thus, [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] `$ABCDEF$` is equilateral.
* So, I say that (it is) also equiangular.
* For since [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$FA$` is equal to [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ED$`, let [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the whole of `$FABCD$` is equal to the whole of `$EDCBA$`.
* And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FED$` stands on [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$FABCD$`, and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$AFE$` on [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$EDCBA$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$AFE$` is equal to `$DEF$` [[Prop. 3.27]][bookofproofs$1907].
* Similarly, it can also be shown that the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] of [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] `$ABCDEF$` are individually equal to each of the [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$AFE$` and `$FED$`.
* Thus, [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] `$ABCDEF$` is equiangular.
* And it was also shown (to be) equilateral.
* And it has been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCDE$`.
* Thus, an equilateral and equiangular [hexagon][bookofproofs$6448] has been [inscribed in the given circle][bookofproofs$1920].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

[^1]: Presumably, by finding the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] [[Prop. 3.1]][bookofproofs$1058], and drawing a line through it (translator's note).
