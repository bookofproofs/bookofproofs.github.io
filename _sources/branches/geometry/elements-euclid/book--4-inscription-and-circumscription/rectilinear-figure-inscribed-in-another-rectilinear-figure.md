> A [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] is said to be **inscribed in a(nother) rectilinear figure** when the respective [angles][bookofproofs$650] of the inscribed figure touch the respective sides of the (figure) in which it is inscribed.

### Modern Formulation

A [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] (`\(n\)`-sided figure, `\(n \ge 3\)`) is said to be **inscribed** in another when all its vertices are on the sides of the figure in which it is said to be inscribed.

### Example

The `\(4\)`-sided figure `\( E F G H \)` is inscribed in the `\(4\)`-sided figure `\( A B C D \)`:
