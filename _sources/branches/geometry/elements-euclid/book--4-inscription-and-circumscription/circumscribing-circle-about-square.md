### (Proposition 9 from Book 4 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To [circumscribe a circle][bookofproofs$6438] about a given [square][bookofproofs$909].
* Let `$ABCD$` be the given [square][bookofproofs$909].
* So it is required to [circumscribe a circle][bookofproofs$6438] about [square][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$`.
