* Let two [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, `$AC$` and `$BD$`, have been drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to one another.[^1] And let `$FG$`, `$GH$`, `$HK$`, and `$KF$` have been drawn through [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, and `$D$` (respectively), [touching][bookofproofs$1853] [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`.[^2]
* Therefore, since `$FG$` [touches circle][bookofproofs$1853] `$ABCD$`, and `$EA$` has been joined from the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$E$` to the [point][bookofproofs$631] of contact `$A$`, the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$A$` are thus [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.18]][bookofproofs$1898].
* So, for the same (reasons), the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$B$`, `$C$`, and `$D$` are also [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* And since angle `$AEB$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], and `$EBG$` is also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], `$GH$` is thus [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AC$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$AC$` is also [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$FK$`.
* So that `$GH$` is also [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$FK$` [[Prop. 1.30]][bookofproofs$919].
* So, similarly, we can show that `$GF$` and `$HK$` are each [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BED$`.
* Thus, `$GK$`, `$GC$`, `$AK$`, `$FB$`, and `$BK$` are (all) [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909].
* Thus, `$GF$` is equal to `$HK$`, and `$GH$` to `$FK$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* And since `$AC$` is equal to `$BD$`, but `$AC$` (is) also (equal) to each of `$GH$` and `$FK$`, and `$BD$` is equal to each of `$GF$` and `$HK$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933] [and each of `$GH$` and `$FK$` is thus equal to each of `$GF$` and `$HK$`], the [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] `$FGHK$` is thus equilateral.
* So I say that (it is) also right-angled.
* For since `$GBEA$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], and `$AEB$` is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], `$AGB$` is thus also a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* So, similarly, we can show that the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$H$`, `$K$`, and `$F$` are also [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$FGHK$` is right-angled.
* And it was also shown (to be) equilateral.
* Thus, it is a [square][bookofproofs$909] [ [Def. 1.22] ][bookofproofs$909].
* And it has been [circumscribed about circle][bookofproofs$1921] `$ABCD$`.
* Thus, a [square][bookofproofs$909] has been [circumscribed about the given circle][bookofproofs$1921].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
