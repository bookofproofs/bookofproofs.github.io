* Let the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$AC$` have been cut in half at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` and `$E$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757].
* And let `$DF$` and `$EF$` have been drawn from [points][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` and `$E$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$` and `$AC$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759].
* So ($DF$ and `$EF$`) will surely either meet inside triangle `$ABC$`, on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$`, or beyond `$BC$`.
* Let them, first of all, meet inside (triangle `$ABC$`) at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$F$`, and let `$FB$`, `$FC$`, and `$FA$` have been joined.
* And since `$AD$` is equal to `$DB$`, and `$DF$` is common and at [right angles][bookofproofs$653], the base `$AF$` is thus equal to the base `$FB$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* So, similarly, we can show that `$CF$` is also equal to `$AF$`.
* So that `$FB$` is also equal to `$FC$`.
* Thus, the three ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$FA$`, `$FB$`, and `$FC$` are equal to one another.
* Thus, the [circle][bookofproofs$690] drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$F$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] one of `$A$`, `$B$`, or `$C$`, will also go through the remaining [points][bookofproofs$631].
* And the [circle][bookofproofs$690] will have been circumscribed about triangle `$ABC$`.
* Let it have been (so) circumscribed, like `$ABC$` (in the first diagram from the left).
* And so, let `$DF$` and `$EF$` meet on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$` at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$F$`, like in the second diagram (from the left).
* And let `$AF$` have been joined.
* So, similarly, we can show that [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$` is the [center][bookofproofs$6428] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] circumscribed about triangle `$ABC$`.
* And so, let `$DF$` and `$EF$` meet outside triangle `$ABC$`, again at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$F$`, like in the third diagram (from the left).
* And let `$AF$`, `$BF$`, and `$CF$` have been joined.
* And, again, since `$AD$` is equal to `$DB$`, and `$DF$` is common and at [right angles][bookofproofs$653], the base `$AF$` is thus equal to the base `$BF$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* So, similarly, we can show that `$CF$` is also equal to `$AF$`.
* So that `$BF$` is also equal to `$FC$`.
* Thus, [again] the [circle][bookofproofs$690] drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$F$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] one of `$FA$`, `$FB$`, and `$FC$`, will also go through the remaining [points][bookofproofs$631].
* And it will have been circumscribed about triangle `$ABC$`.
* Thus, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] has been [circumscribed][bookofproofs$6438] about the given [triangle][bookofproofs$6432].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
