* So let [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BCD$` and `$CDE$` have been cut in half by the ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$CF$` and `$DF$`, respectively [[Prop. 1.9]][bookofproofs$755].
* And let the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$FB$`, `$FA$`, and `$FE$` have been joined from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$F$`, at which the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] meet, to the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$B$`, `$A$`, and `$E$` (respectively).
* So, similarly, to the (proposition) before this (one), it can be shown that [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$CBA$`, `$BAE$`, and `$AED$` have also been cut in half by the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$FB$`, `$FA$`, and `$FE$`, respectively.
* And since angle `$BCD$` is equal to `$CDE$`, and `$FCD$` is half of `$BCD$`, and `$CDF$` half of `$CDE$`, `$FCD$` is thus also equal to `$FDC$`.
* So that side `$FC$` is also equal to side `$FD$` [[Prop. 1.6]][bookofproofs$743].
* So, similarly, it can be shown that `$FB$`, `$FA$`, and `$FE$` are also each equal to each of `$FC$` and `$FD$`.
* Thus, the five [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$FA$`, `$FB$`, `$FC$`, `$FD$`, and `$FE$` are equal to one another.
* Thus, the [circle][bookofproofs$690] drawn with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$F$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] one of `$FA$`, `$FB$`, `$FC$`, `$FD$`, or `$FE$`, will also go through the remaining [points][bookofproofs$631], and will have been circumscribed.
* Let it have been (so) circumscribed, and let it be `$ABCDE$`.
* Thus, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] has been [circumscribed about][bookofproofs$6438] the given [pentagon][bookofproofs$6447], which is equilateral and equiangular.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
