* Let two [spheres][bookofproofs$2223] have been conceived about the same [center][bookofproofs$6428], `$A$`.
* So, it is necessary to inscribe a polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] in the greater [sphere][bookofproofs$2223], not touching the lesser [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] on its surface.

* Let the [spheres][bookofproofs$2223] have been cut by some [plane][bookofproofs$657] through the [center][bookofproofs$6428].
* So, the sections will be [circles][bookofproofs$690], inasmuch as a [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] is generated by the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] remaining behind, and a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] being carried around [ [Def. 11.14] ][bookofproofs$2223].
* And, hence, whatever position we conceive (of for) the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430], the plane produced through it will make a [circle][bookofproofs$690] on the surface of the [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* And (it is) clear that (it is) also a great ([circle][bookofproofs$690]), inasmuch as the [diameter of the sphere][bookofproofs$2226], which is also manifestly the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] and the [circle][bookofproofs$690], is greater than all of the (other) [[straight lines][bookofproofs$645] drawn across in the [circle][bookofproofs$690] or the [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] [[Prop. 3.15]][bookofproofs$1895].
* Therefore, let `$BCDE$` be the [circle][bookofproofs$690] in the greater [sphere][bookofproofs$2223], and `$FGH$` the [circle][bookofproofs$690] in the lesser [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* And let two [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of them have been drawn at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to one another, (namely), `$BD$` and `$CE$`.
* And there being two [circles][bookofproofs$690] about the same [center][bookofproofs$6428] - (namely), `$BCDE$` and `$FGH$` - let an equilateral and even-sided [polygon][bookofproofs$687] have been inscribed in the greater [circle][bookofproofs$690], `$BCDE$`, not touching the lesser [circle][bookofproofs$690], `$FGH$` [[Prop. 12.16]][bookofproofs$2292], of which let the sides in the quadrant `$BE$` be `$BK$`, `$KL$`, `$LM$`, and `$ME$`.
* And, `$KA$` being joined, let it have been drawn across to `$N$`.
* And let `$AO$` have been set up at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$BCDE$`.
* And let it meet the surface of the (greater) [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] at `$O$`.
* And let [planes][bookofproofs$647] have been produced through `$AO$` and each of `$BD$` and `$KN$`.
* So, according to the aforementioned (discussion), they will make great [circles][bookofproofs$690] on the surface of the (greater) [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* Let them make (great [circles][bookofproofs$690]), of which let `$BOD$` and `$KON$` be [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430]s on the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] `$BD$` and `$KN$` (respectively).
* And since `$OA$` is at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$BCDE$`, all of the [planes][bookofproofs$647] through `$OA$` are thus also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$BCDE$` [[Prop. 11.18]][bookofproofs$2255].
* And, hence, the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430]s `$BOD$` and `$KON$` are also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$BCDE$`.
* And since [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430]s `$BED$`, `$BOD$`, and `$KON$` are equal - for (they are) on the equal [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] `$BD$` and `$KN$` [ [Def. 3.1] ][bookofproofs$1850] - the quadrants `$BE$`, `$BO$`, and `$KO$` are also equal to one another.
* Thus, as many sides of the [polygon][bookofproofs$687] as are in quadrant `$BE$`, so many are also in quadrants `$BO$` and `$KO$` equal to the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$BK$`, `$KL$`, `$LM$`, and `$ME$`.
* Let them have been inscribed, and let them be `$BP$`, `$PQ$`, `$QR$`, `$RO$`, `$KS$`, `$ST$`, `$TU$`, and `$UO$`.
* And let `$SP$`, `$TQ$`, and `$UR$` have been joined.
* And let [perpendiculars][bookofproofs$653] have been drawn from `$P$` and `$S$` to the plane of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$BCDE$` [[Prop. 11.11]][bookofproofs$2248].
* So, they will fall on the common sections of the [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$BD$` and `$KN$` (with `$BCDE$`), inasmuch as the [planes][bookofproofs$647] of `$BOD$` and `$KON$` are also at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$BCDE$` [ [Def. 11.4] ][bookofproofs$2213].
* Let them have fallen, and let them be `$PV$` and `$SW$`.
* And let `$WV$` have been joined.
* And since `$BP$` and `$KS$` are equal ([circumferences][bookofproofs$690]) having been cut off in the equal [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430]s `$BOD$` and `$KON$` [[Prop. 3.28]][bookofproofs$1908], and `$PV$` and `$SW$` are [perpendiculars][bookofproofs$653] having been drawn (from them), `$PV$` is [thus] equal to `$SW$`, and `$BV$` to `$KW$` [[Prop. 3.27]][bookofproofs$1907], [[Prop. 1.26]][bookofproofs$905].
* And the whole of `$BA$` is also equal to the whole of `$KA$`.
* And, thus, as `$BV$` is to `$VA$`, so `$KW$` (is) to `$WA$`.
* `$WV$` is thus [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$KB$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* And since `$PV$` and `$SW$` are each at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$BCDE$`, `$PV$` is thus [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$SW$` [[Prop. 11.6]][bookofproofs$2243].
* And it was also shown (to be) equal to it.
* And, thus, `$WV$` and `$SP$` are equal and [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [[Prop. 1.33]][bookofproofs$931].
* And since `$WV$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$SP$`, but `$WV$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$KB$`, `$SP$` is thus also [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$KB$` [[Prop. 11.1]][bookofproofs$2238].
* And `$BP$` and `$KS$` join them.
* Thus, the [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] `$KBPS$` is in one [plane][bookofproofs$657], inasmuch as if there are two [parallel][bookofproofs$788] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and a random [point][bookofproofs$631] is taken on each of them, then the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining the [points][bookofproofs$631] is in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657] as the [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) [[Prop. 11.7]][bookofproofs$2244].
* So, for the same (reasons), each of the [quadrilaterals][bookofproofs$687] `$SPQT$` and `$TQRU$` is also in one [plane][bookofproofs$657].
* And [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$URO$` is also in one [plane][bookofproofs$657] [[Prop. 11.2]][bookofproofs$2239].
* So, if we conceive [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joining [points][bookofproofs$631] `$P$`, `$S$`, `$Q$`, `$T$`, `$R$`, and `$U$` to `$A$` then some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] polyhedral figure will have been constructed between the [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$BO$` and `$KO$`, being composed of [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] whose bases (are) the [quadrilaterals][bookofproofs$687] `$KBPS$`, `$SPQT$`, `$TQRU$`, and the [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$URO$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`.
* And if we also make the same construction on each of the sides `$KL$`, `$LM$`, and `$ME$`, just as on `$BK$`, and, further, (repeat the construction) in the remaining three quadrants, then some polyhedral figure which has been inscribed in the [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] will have been constructed, being contained by [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] whose bases (are) the aforementioned [quadrilaterals][bookofproofs$687], and [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$URO$`, and the ([quadrilaterals][bookofproofs$687] and [triangles][bookofproofs$6432]) similarly arranged to them, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`.
* So, I say that the aforementioned polyhedron will not touch the lesser [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] on the surface on which the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$FGH$` is (situated).
* Let the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AX$` have been drawn from [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` to the plane `$KBPS$`, and let it meet the [plane][bookofproofs$647] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$X$` [[Prop. 11.11]][bookofproofs$2248].
* And let `$XB$` and `$XK$` have been joined.
* And since `$AX$` is at [right angles to the plane][bookofproofs$2212] of [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] `$KBPS$`, it is thus also at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to all of the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined to it which are also in the plane of the [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] [ [Def. 11.3] ][bookofproofs$2212].
* Thus, `$AX$` is at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to each of `$BX$` and `$XK$`.
* And since `$AB$` is equal to `$AK$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$` is also equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AK$`.
* And the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AX$` and `$XB$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`.
* For the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$X$` (is) a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* And the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AX$` and `$XK$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AK$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AX$` and `$XB$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$AX$` and `$XK$`.
* Let the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AX$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remaining [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BX$` is equal to the remaining [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$XK$`.
* Thus, `$BX$` (is) equal to `$XK$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joined from `$X$` to `$P$` and `$S$` are equal to each of `$BX$` and `$XK$`.
* Thus, a [circle][bookofproofs$690] drawn (in the plane of the [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687]) with [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$X$`, and [radius][bookofproofs$690] one of `$XB$` or `$XK$`, will also pass through `$P$` and `$S$`, and the [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] `$KBPS$` will be inside the [circle][bookofproofs$690].
* And since `$KB$` is greater than `$WV$`, and `$WV$` (is) equal to `$SP$`, `$KB$` (is) thus greater than `$SP$`.
* And `$KB$` (is) equal to each of `$KS$` and `$BP$`.
* Thus, `$KS$` and `$BP$` are each greater than `$SP$`.
* And since [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] `$KBPS$` is in a [circle][bookofproofs$690], and `$KB$`, `$BP$`, and `$KS$` are equal (to one another), and `$PS$` (is) less (than them), and `$BX$` is the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690], the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KB$` is thus greater than double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BX$`.[^1] 
* Let the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] `$KY$` have been drawn from `$K$` to `$BV$`.[^2] 
* And since `$BD$` is less than double `$DY$`, and as `$BD$` is to `$DY$`, so the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DB$` and `$BY$` (is) to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DY$` and `$YB$` - a [square][bookofproofs$909] being described on `$BY$`, and a (rectangular) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] (with short side equal to `$BY$`) completed on `$YD$` - the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DB$` and `$BY$` is thus also less than double the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DY$` and `$YB$`.
* And, `$KD$` being joined, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DB$` and `$BY$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BK$`, and the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$DY$` and `$YB$` equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KY$` [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911], [ [Prop. 6.8 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]3.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KB$` is less than double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KY$`.
* But, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KB$` is greater than double the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BX$`.
* Thus, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KY$` (is) greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BX$`.
* And since `$BA$` is equal to `$KA$`, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AK$`.
* And the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$BX$` and `$XA$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BA$`, and the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$KY$` and `$YA$` (is) equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KA$` [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968].
* Thus, the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$BX$` and `$XA$` is equal to the (sum of the [squares][bookofproofs$909]) on `$KY$` and `$YA$`, of which the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$KY$` (is) greater than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BX$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$YA$` is less than the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$XA$`.
* Thus, `$AX$` (is) greater than `$AY$`.
* Thus, `$AX$` is much greater than `$AG$`.[^3] 
* And `$AX$` is (a [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653]) on one of the bases of the polyhedron, and `$AG$` (is a [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653]) on the surface of the lesser [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* Hence, the polyhedron will not touch the lesser [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] on its surface.
* Thus, there being two [spheres][bookofproofs$2223] about the same [center][bookofproofs$6428], a polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] has been inscribed in the greater [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] which does not touch the lesser [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] on its surface.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

[^1]: Since `$KB$`, `$BP$`, and `$KS$` are greater than the sides of an inscribed square, which are each of length `$\sqrt{2}\,BX$` (translator's note).

[^2]: Note that [points][bookofproofs$631] `$Y$` and `$V$` are actually identical  (translator's note).

[^3]: This conclusion depends on the fact that the chord of the [polygon][bookofproofs$687] in [proposition 12.16][bookofproofs$2292] does not touch the inner [circle][bookofproofs$690] (translator's note).
