* For let it have been contrived that as area `$S$` (is) to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, so [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` (is) to area `$T$`.
* I say that area `$T$` is less than [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`.
* For since as area `$S$` is to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, so [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` (is) to area `$T$`, alternately, as area `$S$` is to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, so [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) to area `$T$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And area `$S$` (is) greater than [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`.
* Thus, [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) also greater than area `$T$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Hence, as area `$S$` is to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, so [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` (is) to some area less than [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
