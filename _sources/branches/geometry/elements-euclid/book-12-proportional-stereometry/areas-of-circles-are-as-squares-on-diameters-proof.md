* Let `$ABCD$` and `$EFGH$` be [circles][bookofproofs$690], and [let] `$BD$` and `$FH$` [be] their [diameters][bookofproofs$6429].
* I say that as [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` is to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, so the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` (is) to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$`.

* For if the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` is not to the ([circle][bookofproofs$690]) `$EFGH$`, as the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$`, then as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$`, so [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` will be to some area either less than, or greater than, [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`.
* Let it, first of all, be (in that ratio) to (some) lesser (area), `$S$`.
* And let the square `$EFGH$` have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$EFGH$` [[Prop. 4.6]][bookofproofs$1930].
* So the inscribed square is greater than half of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, inasmuch as if we draw [tangents][bookofproofs$1853] to the [circle][bookofproofs$690] through the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$`, and `$H$`, then square `$EFGH$` is half of the square [circumscribed about the circle][bookofproofs$1921] [[Prop. 1.47]][bookofproofs$968], and the [circle][bookofproofs$690] is less than the circumscribed square.
* Hence, the inscribed square `$EFGH$` is greater than half of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`.
* Let the [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$EF$`, `$FG$`, `$GH$`, and `$HE$` have been cut in half at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$K$`, `$L$`, `$M$`, and `$N$` (respectively), and let `$EK$`, `$KF$`, `$FL$`, `$LG$`, `$GM$`, `$MH$`, `$HN$`, and `$NE$` have been joined.
* And, thus, each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$EKF$`, `$FLG$`, `$GMH$`, and `$HNE$` is greater than half of the [segment of the circle][bookofproofs$1852] about it, inasmuch as if we draw [tangents][bookofproofs$1853] to the [circle][bookofproofs$690] through [points][bookofproofs$631] `$K$`, `$L$`, `$M$`, and `$N$`, and complete the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] on the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$`, `$FG$`, `$GH$`, and `$HE$`, then each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$EKF$`, `$FLG$`, `$GMH$`, and `$HNE$` will be half of the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] about it, but the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] about it is less than the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909].
* Hence, each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$EKF$`, `$FLG$`, `$GMH$`, and `$HNE$` is greater than half of the [segment of the circle][bookofproofs$1852] about it.
* So, by cutting the [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] remaining behind in half, and joining [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], and doing this continually, we will (eventually) leave behind some [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] whose (sum) will be less than the excess by which [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` exceeds the area `$S$`.
* For we showed in the first theorem of the tenth book that if two unequal magnitudes are laid out, and if (a part) greater than a half is subtracted from the greater, and (if from) the remainder (a part) greater than a half (is subtracted), and this happens continually, then some magnitude will (eventually) be left which will be less than the lesser laid out magnitude [[Prop. 10.1]][bookofproofs$2095].
* Therefore, let the (segments) have been left, and let the (sum of the) [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` on `$EK$`, `$KF$`, `$FL$`, `$LG$`, `$GM$`, `$MH$`, `$HN$`, and `$NE$` be less than the excess by which [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` exceeds area `$S$`.
* Thus, the remaining [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$EKFLGMHN$` is greater than area `$S$`.
* And let the [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$AOBPCQDR$`, [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$EKFLGMHN$`, have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCD$`.
* Thus, as the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` is to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$`, so [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$AOBPCQDR$` (is) to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$EKFLGMHN$` [[Prop. 12.1]][bookofproofs$2277].
* But, also, as the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` (is) to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$`, so [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) to area `$S$`.
* And, thus, as [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) to area `$S$`, so [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$AOBPGQDR$` (is) to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$EKFLGMHN$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, alternately, as [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) to the [polygon][bookofproofs$687] (inscribed) within it, so area `$S$` (is) to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$EKFLGMHN$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) greater than the [polygon][bookofproofs$687] (inscribed) within it.
* Thus, area `$S$` is also greater than [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$EKFLGMHN$`.
* But, (it is) also less.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` is not to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$`, as [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) to some area less than [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$` (is) not to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` as [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` (is) to some area less than [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` either.
* So, I say that neither (is) the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$`, as [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) to some area greater than [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`.
* For, if possible, let it be (in that ratio) to (some) greater (area), `$S$`.
* Thus, inversely, as the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$` [is] to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$DB$`, so area `$S$` (is) to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` [ [Prop. 5.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]1.
* But, as area `$S$` (is) to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, so [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` (is) to some area less than [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (see lemma).
* And, thus, as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$`, so [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` (is) to some area less than [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* The very thing was shown (to be) impossible.
* Thus, as the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$`, so [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) not to some area greater than [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`.
* And it was shown that neither (is it in that ratio) to (some) lesser (area).
* Thus, as the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BD$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$FH$`, so [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`.
* Thus, [circles][bookofproofs$690] are to one another as the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on (their) [diameters][bookofproofs$6429].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
