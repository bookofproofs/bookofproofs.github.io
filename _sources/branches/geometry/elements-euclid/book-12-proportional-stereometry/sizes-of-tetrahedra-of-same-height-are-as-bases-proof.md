* Let there be [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] whose bases (are) the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` and `$DEF$`, and apexes the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$H$` (respectively).
* I say that as base `$ABC$` is to base `$DEF$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`.

* For if base `$ABC$` is not to base `$DEF$`, as [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`, then base `$ABC$` will be to base `$DEF$`, as [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] either less than, or greater than, [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`.
* Let it, first of all, be (in this ratio) to (some) lesser ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]), `$W$`.
* And let [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` have been divided into two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] equal to one another, and [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the whole, and into two equal [prisms][bookofproofs$2222].
* So, the (sum of the) two [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] is greater than half of the whole [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] [[Prop. 12.3]][bookofproofs$2279].
* And, again, let the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] generated by the division have been similarly divided, and let this be done continually until some [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] are left from [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` which (when added together) are less than the excess by which [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` exceeds the [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$W$` [[Prop. 10.1]][bookofproofs$2095].
* Let them have been left, and, for the sake of argument, let them be `$DQRS$` and `$STUH$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the) remaining [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] within [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` is greater than [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$W$`.
* Let [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` also have been divided similarly, and a [similar][bookofproofs$2218] number of times, as [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`.
* Thus, as base `$ABC$` is to base `$DEF$`, so the (sum of the) [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] within [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to the (sum of the) [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] within [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` [[Prop. 12.4]][bookofproofs$2280].
* But, also, as base `$ABC$` (is) to base `$DEF$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$W$`.
* And, thus, as [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$W$`, so the (sum of the) [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] within [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to the (sum of the) [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] within [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, alternately, as [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to the (sum of the) [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] within it, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$W$` (is) to the (sum of the) [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] within [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) greater than the (sum of the) [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] within it.
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$W$` (is) also greater than the (sum of the) [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] within [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* But, (it is) also less.
* This very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, as base `$ABC$` is to base `$DEF$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) not to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] less than [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that base `$DEF$` is not to base `$ABC$`, as [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` (is) to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] less than [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` either.
* So, I say that neither is base `$ABC$` to base `$DEF$`, as [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] greater than [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`.
* For, if possible, let it be (in this ratio) to some greater ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]), `$W$`.
* Thus, inversely, as base `$DEF$` (is) to base `$ABC$`, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$W$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` [ [Prop. 5.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6451].
* And as [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$W$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` (is) to some ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]) less than [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$`, as shown before [ [Prop. 12.2 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6480].
* And, thus, as base `$DEF$` (is) to base `$ABC$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` (is) to some ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]) less than [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* The very thing was shown (to be) absurd.
* Thus, base `$ABC$` is not to base `$DEF$`, as [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] greater than [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`.
* And, it was shown that neither (is it in this ratio) to a lesser ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]).
* Thus, as base `$ABC$` is to base `$DEF$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
