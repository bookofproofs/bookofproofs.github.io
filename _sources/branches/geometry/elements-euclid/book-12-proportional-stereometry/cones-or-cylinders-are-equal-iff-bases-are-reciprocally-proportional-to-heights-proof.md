* Let there be equal [cones][bookofproofs$2227] and [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] whose bases are the [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` and `$EFGH$`, and the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of (the bases) `$AC$` and `$EG$`, and (whose) axes (are) `$KL$` and `$MN$`, which are also the heights of the [cones][bookofproofs$2227] and [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] (respectively).
* And let the [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` and `$EP$` have been completed.
* I say that the bases of [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` and `$EP$` are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights, and (so) as base `$ABCD$` is to base `$EFGH$`, so [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$MN$` (is) to [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$KL$`.

* For [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$LK$` is either equal to [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$MN$`, or not.
* Let it, first of all, be equal.
* And [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` is also equal to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EP$`.
* And [cones][bookofproofs$2227] and [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] having the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] are to one another as their bases [[Prop. 12.11]][bookofproofs$2287].
* Thus, base `$ABCD$` (is) also equal to base `$EFGH$`.
* And, hence, [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952], as base `$ABCD$` (is) to base `$EFGH$`, so [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$MN$` (is) to [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$KL$`.
* And so, let [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$LK$` not be equal to `$MN$`, but let `$MN$` be greater.
* And let `$QN$`, equal to `$KL$`, have been cut off from [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$MN$`.
* And let the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EP$` have been cut, through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$Q$`, by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$TUS$` (which is) [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the [planes][bookofproofs$647] of the [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` and `$RP$`.
* And let [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$ES$` have been conceived, with base the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, and [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$NQ$`.
* And since [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` is equal to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EP$`, thus, as [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` (is) to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$ES$`, so [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EP$` (is) to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$ES$` [[Prop. 5.7]][bookofproofs$1964].
* But, as [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` (is) to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$ES$`, so base `$ABCD$` (is) to base `$EFGH$`.
* For [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` and `$ES$` (have) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] [[Prop. 12.11]][bookofproofs$2287].
* And as [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EP$` (is) to ([cylinder][bookofproofs$2230]) `$ES$`, so [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$MN$` (is) to [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$QN$`.
* For [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EP$` has been cut by a [plane][bookofproofs$647] which is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to its opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] [[Prop. 12.13]][bookofproofs$2289].
* And, thus, as base `$ABCD$` is to base `$EFGH$`, so [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$MN$` (is) to [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$QN$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* And [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$QN$` (is) equal to [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$KL$`.
* Thus, as base `$ABCD$` is to base `$EFGH$`, so [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$MN$` (is) to [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$KL$`.
* Thus, the bases of [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` and `$EP$` are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights.
And, so, let the bases of [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` and `$EP$` be [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights, and (thus) let base `$ABCD$` be to base `$EFGH$`, as [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$MN$` (is) to [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$KL$`.
* I say that [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` is equal to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EP$`.
* For, with the same construction, since as base `$ABCD$` is to base `$EFGH$`, so [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$MN$` (is) to [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$KL$`, and [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$KL$` (is) equal to [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$QN$`, thus, as base `$ABCD$` (is) to base `$EFGH$`, so [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$MN$` will be to [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$QN$`.
* But, as base `$ABCD$` (is) to base `$EFGH$`, so [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` (is) to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$ES$`.
* For they are the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] [[Prop. 12.11]][bookofproofs$2287].
* And as [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$MN$` (is) to [[height][bookofproofs$1986]] `$QN$`, so [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EP$` (is) to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$ES$` [[Prop. 12.13]][bookofproofs$2289].
* Thus, as [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` is to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$ES$`, so [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EP$` (is) to ([cylinder][bookofproofs$2230]) `$ES$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` (is) equal to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EP$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
* In the same manner, (the proposition can) also (be demonstrated) for the [cones][bookofproofs$2227].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
