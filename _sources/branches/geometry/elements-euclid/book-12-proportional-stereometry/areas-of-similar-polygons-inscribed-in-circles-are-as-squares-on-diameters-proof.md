* Let `$ABC$` and `$FGH$` be [circles][bookofproofs$690], and let `$ABCDE$` and `$FGHKL$` be [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [polygons][bookofproofs$687] (inscribed) in them (respectively), and let `$BM$` and `$GN$` be the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of the [circles][bookofproofs$690] (respectively).
* I say that as the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BM$` is to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$GN$`, so [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCDE$` (is) to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$FGHKL$`.

* For let `$BE$`, `$AM$`, `$GL$`, and `$FN$` have been joined.
* And since [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCDE$` (is) [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$FGHKL$`, angle `$BAE$` is also equal to (angle) `$GFL$`, and as `$BA$` is to `$AE$`, so `$GF$` (is) to `$FL$` [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* So, `$BAE$` and `$GFL$` are two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having one angle equal to one angle, (namely), `$BAE$` (equal) to `$GFL$`, and the sides around the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABE$` is thus equiangular with [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$FGL$` [[Prop. 6.6]][bookofproofs$1992].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$AEB$` is equal to (angle) `$FLG$`.
* But, `$AEB$` is equal to `$AMB$`, and `$FLG$` to `$FNG$`, for they stand on the same [circumference][bookofproofs$690] [[Prop. 3.27]][bookofproofs$1907].
* Thus, `$AMB$` is also equal to `$FNG$`.
* And the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] `$BAM$` is also equal to the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] `$GFN$` [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911].
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] is also equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABM$` is equiangular with [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$FGN$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as `$BM$` is to `$GN$`, so `$BA$` (is) to `$GF$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* But, the (ratio) of the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BM$` to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$GN$` is the square of the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$BM$` to `$GN$`, and the (ratio) of [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCDE$` to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$FGHKL$` is the square of the (ratio) of `$BA$` to `$GF$` [[Prop. 6.20]][bookofproofs$2006].
* And, thus, as the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BM$` (is) to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$GN$`, so [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCDE$` (is) to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$FGHKL$`.
* Thus, [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [polygons][bookofproofs$687] (inscribed) in [circles][bookofproofs$690] are to one another as the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] (of the [circles][bookofproofs$690]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
