* For if the solids are divided into similarly numbered, and similarly situated, [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221], then the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] will be [similar][bookofproofs$2218].
* And [similar][bookofproofs$2218] [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] are in the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] of corresponding sides [ [Prop. 12.8 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6468].
* Thus, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [quadrilateral][bookofproofs$687] `$KBPS$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$A$`, will have to the similarly situated [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] in the other [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding side.
* That is to say, that of [radius][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$` of the [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] about [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$A$` to the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the other [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* And, similarly, each [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] in the [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] about [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$A$` will have to each similarly situated [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] in the other [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$AB$` (has) to the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the other [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* And as one of the leading (magnitudes is) to one of the following (in two sets of [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] magnitudes), so (the sum of) all the leading (magnitudes is) to (the sum of) all of the following (magnitudes) [[Prop. 5.12]][bookofproofs$1969].
* Hence, the whole polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] in the [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] about [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$A$` will have to the whole polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] in the other [[sphere][bookofproofs$2223]] the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that ([radius][bookofproofs$690]) `$AB$` (has) to the [radius][bookofproofs$690] of the other [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* That is to say, that [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$BD$` (has) to the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of the other [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
