### Euclid's Formulation

> [Similar][bookofproofs$1983] [polygons][bookofproofs$687] (inscribed) in [circles][bookofproofs$690] are to one another as the [squares][bookofproofs$909] on the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] (of the [circles][bookofproofs$690]).
* Let `$ABC$` and `$FGH$` be [circles][bookofproofs$690], and let `$ABCDE$` and `$FGHKL$` be [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [polygons][bookofproofs$687] (inscribed) in them (respectively), and let `$BM$` and `$GN$` be the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of the [circles][bookofproofs$690] (respectively).
* I say that as the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$BM$` is to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$GN$`, so [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCDE$` (is) to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$FGHKL$`.
