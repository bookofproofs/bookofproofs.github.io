* For, dividing them into the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] (contained) within them which have [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases, with the [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [polygons][bookofproofs$687] of the bases also being divided into [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] (which are) both equal in number, and corresponding, to the wholes [[Prop. 6.20]][bookofproofs$2006].
* As one [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] having a [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] base in the former ([pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] having a polygonal base is) to one [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] having a [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] base in the latter ([pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] having a polygonal base), so (the sum of) all the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases in the former [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] will also be to (the sum of) all the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases in the latter [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] [[Prop. 5.12]][bookofproofs$1969] - that is to say, the (former) [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] itself having a polygonal base to the (latter) [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] having a polygonal base.
* And a [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] having a [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] base is to a ([pyramid][bookofproofs$2221]) having a [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] base in the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] of corresponding sides [[Prop. 12.8]][bookofproofs$2284].
* Thus, a ([pyramid][bookofproofs$2221]) having a polygonal base also has to to a ([pyramid][bookofproofs$2221]) having a [similar][bookofproofs$1983] base the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] of a (corresponding) side to a (corresponding) side.
