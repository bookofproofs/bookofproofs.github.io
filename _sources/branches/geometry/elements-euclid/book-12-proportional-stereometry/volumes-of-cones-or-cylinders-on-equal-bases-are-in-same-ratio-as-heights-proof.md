* For let `$EB$` and `$FD$` be [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] on equal bases, (namely) the [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$` and `$CD$` (respectively).
* I say that as [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EB$` is to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$FD$`, so  `$GH$` (is) to  `$KL$`.

* For let the  `$KL$` have been produced to [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`.
* And let `$LN$` be made equal to  `$GH$`.
* And let the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$CM$` have been conceived about  `$LN$`.
* Therefore, since [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] `$EB$` and `$CM$` have the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] they are to one another as their bases [[Prop. 12.11]][bookofproofs$2287].
* And the bases are equal to one another.
* Thus, [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] `$EB$` and `$CM$` are also equal to one another.
* And since [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$FM$` has been cut by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$CD$`, which is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to its opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647], thus as [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$CM$` is to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$FD$`, so  `$LN$` (is) to  `$KL$` [[Prop. 12.13]][bookofproofs$2289].
* And [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$CM$` is equal to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EB$`, and  `$LN$` to  `$GH$`.
* Thus, as [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EB$` is to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$FD$`, so  `$GH$` (is) to  `$KL$`.
* And as [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EB$` (is) to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$FD$`, so [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$ABG$` (is) to [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$CDK$` [[Prop. 12.10]][bookofproofs$2286].
* Thus, also, as  `$GH$` (is) to  `$KL$`, so [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$ABG$` (is) to [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$CDK$`, and [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$EB$` to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$FD$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
