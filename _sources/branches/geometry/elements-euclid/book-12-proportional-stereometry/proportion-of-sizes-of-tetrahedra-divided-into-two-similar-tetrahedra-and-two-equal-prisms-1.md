### (Lemma to Proposition 4 from Book 12 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> And one may show, as follows, that as [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$LOC$` is to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$RVF$`, so the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$LOC$`, and opposite (plane) `$PMN$`, (is) to the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base (is) [[triangle][bookofproofs$6432]] `$RVF$`, and opposite (plane) `$STU$`.
