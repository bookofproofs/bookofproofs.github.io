* Let there be a [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`, and (whose) apex (is) [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`.
* I say that [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCD$` is divided into two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases (which are) equal to one another, and [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the whole, and into two equal [prisms][bookofproofs$2222].

* And the (sum of the) two [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] is greater than half of the whole [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221].
* For let `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CA$`, `$AD$`, `$DB$`, and `$DC$` have been cut in half at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, and `$L$` (respectively).
* And let `$HE$`, `$EG$`, `$GH$`, `$HK$`, `$KL$`, `$LH$`, `$KF$`, and `$FG$` have been joined.
* Since `$AE$` is equal to `$EB$`, and `$AH$` to `$DH$`, `$EH$` is thus [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$DB$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$HK$` is also [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AB$`.
* Thus, `$HEBK$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909].
* Thus, `$HK$` is equal to `$EB$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* But, `$EB$` is equal to `$EA$`.
* Thus, `$AE$` is also equal to `$HK$`.
* And `$AH$` is also equal to `$HD$`.
* So the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$EA$` and `$AH$` are equal to the two ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$KH$` and `$HD$`, respectively.
* And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EAH$` (is) equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$KHD$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* Thus, base `$EH$` is equal to base `$KD$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEH$` is equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$HKD$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* So, for the same (reasons), [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$AHG$` is also equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$HLD$`.
* And since `$EH$` and `$HG$` are two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joining one another (which are respectively) [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joining one another, `$KD$` and `$DL$`, not being in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657], they will contain equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [[Prop. 11.10]][bookofproofs$2247].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EHG$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$KDL$`.
* And since the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$EH$` and `$HG$` are equal to the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$KD$` and `$DL$`, respectively, and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EHG$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$KDL$`, base `$EG$` [is] thus equal to base `$KL$` [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$EHG$` is equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$KDL$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEG$` is also equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$HKL$`.
* Thus, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEG$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$`, is equal and [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$HKL$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` [ [Def. 11.10] ][bookofproofs$2219].
* And since `$HK$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one of the sides, `$AB$`, of [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ADB$`, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ADB$` is equiangular to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DHK$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915], and they have [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] sides.
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ADB$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DHK$` [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* So, for the same (reasons), [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DBC$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DKL$`, and `$ADC$` to `$DLH$`.
* And since two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joining one another, `$BA$` and `$AC$`, are [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] joining one another, `$KH$` and `$HL$`, not in the same [plane][bookofproofs$657], they will contain equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [[Prop. 11.10]][bookofproofs$2247].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` is equal to (angle) `$KHL$`.
* And as `$BA$` is to `$AC$`, so `$KH$` (is) to `$HL$`.
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$HKL$` [[Prop. 6.6]][bookofproofs$1992].
* And, thus, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, is [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$HKL$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` [ [Def. 11.9] ][bookofproofs$2218].
* But, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base [is] [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$HKL$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, was shown (to be) [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEG$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$`.
* Thus, each of the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] `$AEGH$` and `$HKLD$` is [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the whole [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCD$`.
* And since `$BF$` is equal to `$FC$`, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EBFG$` is double [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$GFC$` [[Prop. 1.41]][bookofproofs$955].
* And since, if two [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] (have) equal heights, and the former has a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] as a base, and the latter a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], and the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] (is) double the [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], then the [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] are equal [[Prop. 11.39]][bookofproofs$2276], the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] contained by the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$BKF$` and `$EHG$`, and the three [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$EBFG$`, `$EBKH$`, and `$HKFG$`, is thus equal to the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] contained by the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$GFC$` and `$HKL$`, and the three [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$KFCL$`, `$LCGH$`, and `$HKFG$`.
* And (it is) clear that each of the [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] whose base (is) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EBFG$`, and opposite (side) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$HK$`, and whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$GFC$`, and opposite (plane) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$HKL$`, is greater than each of the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] whose bases are [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEG$` and `$HKL$`, and apexes the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$H$` and `$D$` (respectively), inasmuch as, if we [also] join the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$` and `$EK$` then the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base (is) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EBFG$`, and opposite (side) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$HK$`, is greater than the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$EBF$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$K$`.
* But the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$EBF$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$K$`, is equal to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEG$`, and apex [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$`.
* For they are contained by equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [planes][bookofproofs$647].
* And, hence, the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base (is) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EBFG$`, and opposite (side) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$HK$`, is greater than the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEG$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$`.
* And the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base is [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EBFG$`, and opposite (side) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$HK$`, (is) equal to the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$GFC$`, and opposite (plane) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$HKL$`.
* And the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEG$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$H$`, is equal to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$HKL$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`.
* Thus, the (sum of the) aforementioned two [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] is greater than the (sum of the) aforementioned two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221], whose bases (are) [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEG$` and `$HKL$`, and apexes the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$H$` and `$D$` (respectively).
* Thus, the whole [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221], whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, has been divided into two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] (which are) equal to one another [and [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the whole], and into two equal [prisms][bookofproofs$2222].
* And the (sum of the) two [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] is greater than half of the whole [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
