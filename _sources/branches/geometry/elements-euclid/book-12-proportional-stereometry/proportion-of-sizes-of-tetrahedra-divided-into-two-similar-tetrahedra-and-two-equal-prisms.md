### Euclid's Formulation

> If there are two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] with the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], having trianglular bases, and each of them is divided into two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] equal to one another, and [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the whole, and into two equal [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] then as the base of one [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] (is) to the base of the other [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221], so (the sum of) all the [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] in one [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] will be to (the sum of all) the equal number of [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] in the other [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221].

* Let there be two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] with the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], having the [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases `$ABC$` and `$DEF$`, (with) apexes the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$H$` (respectively).
* And let each of them have been divided into two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] equal to one another, and [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the whole, and into two equal [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] [[Prop. 12.3]][bookofproofs$2279].
* I say that as base `$ABC$` is to base `$DEF$`, so (the sum of) all the [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] in [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to (the sum of) all the equal number of [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] in [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`.
