* Let there be [cones][bookofproofs$2227] and [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] whose bases [are] the [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` and `$EFGH$`, axes `$KL$` and `$MN$`, and [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of the bases `$AC$` and `$EG$` (respectively).
* I say that as [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` is to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, so [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$` (is) to [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EN$`.

* For if not, then as [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, so [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$` will be to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] either less than, or greater than, [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EN$`.
* Let it, first of all, be (in this ratio) to (some) lesser ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]), `$O$`.
* And let [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$X$` be equal to that (magnitude) by which [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$` is less than [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EN$`.
* Thus, [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EN$` is equal to (the sum of) solids `$O$` and `$X$`.
* Let the square `$EFGH$` have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$EFGH$` [[Prop. 4.6]][bookofproofs$1930].
* Thus, the square is greater than half of the [circle][bookofproofs$690] [[Prop. 12.2]][bookofproofs$2278].
* Let a [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] have been set up on square `$EFGH$`.
* Thus, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] set up is greater than half of the [cone][bookofproofs$2227], inasmuch as, if we circumscribe a [square][bookofproofs$909] about the [circle][bookofproofs$690] [[Prop. 4.7]][bookofproofs$1931], and set up on it a [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227], then the inscribed [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] is half of the circumscribed [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221].
* For they are to one another as their bases [[Prop. 12.6]][bookofproofs$2282].
* And the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] (is) less than the circumscribed [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221].
* Let the [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$EF$`, `$FG$`, `$GH$`, and `$HE$` have been cut in half at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$P$`, `$Q$`, `$R$`, and `$S$`.
* And let `$HP$`, `$PE$`, `$EQ$`, `$QF$`, `$FR$`, `$RG$`, `$GS$`, and `$SH$` have been joined.
* Thus, each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$HPE$`, `$EQF$`, `$FRG$`, and `$GSH$` is greater than half of the [segment of the circle][bookofproofs$1852] about it [[Prop. 12.2]][bookofproofs$2278].
* Let [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] have been set up on each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$HPE$`, `$EQF$`, `$FRG$`, and `$GSH$`.
* And, thus, each of the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] set up is greater than half of the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] of the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] about it [[Prop. 12.10]][bookofproofs$2286].
* So, (if) the remaining [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] are cut in half, and [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are joined, and [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] of equal [height][bookofproofs$1986] to the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] are set up on each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], and this is done continually, then we will (eventually) leave some [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] (the sum of) which is less than [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$X$` [[Prop. 10.1]][bookofproofs$2095].
* Let them have been left, and let them be the (segments) on `$HPE$`, `$EQF$`, `$FRG$`, and `$GSH$`.
* Thus, the remaining [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$HPEQFRGS$`, and [height][bookofproofs$1986] the same as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227], is greater than [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$` [[Prop. 6.18]][bookofproofs$2004].
* And let the [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$DTAUBVCW$`, [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$HPEQFRGS$`, have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCD$`.
* And on it let a [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] as [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$` have been set up.
* Therefore, since as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` is to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$`, so [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$DTAUBVCW$` (is) to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$HPEQFRGS$` [[Prop. 12.1]][bookofproofs$2277], and as the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$AC$` (is) to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$EG$`, so [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` [[Prop. 12.2]][bookofproofs$2278], thus as [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, so [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$DTAUBVCW$` also (is) to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$HPEQFRGS$`.
* And as [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, so [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$`.
* And as [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$DTAUBVCW$` (is) to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$HPEQFRGS$`, so the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$DTAUBVCW$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`, (is) to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$HPEQFRGS$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$` [[Prop. 12.6]][bookofproofs$2282].
* And, thus, as [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$`, so the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is `$DTAUBVCW$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`, (is) to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$HPEQFRGS$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, alternately, as [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$` is to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] within it, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$` (is) to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] within [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EN$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* But, [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$` (is) greater than the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] within it.
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$` (is) also greater than the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] within [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EN$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* But, (it is) also less.
* The very thing (is) [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` is not to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, as [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$` (is) to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] less than [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EN$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that neither is [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, as [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EN$` (is) to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] less than [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$`.
* So, I say that neither is [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, as [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$` (is) to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] greater than [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EN$`.
* For, if possible, let it be (in this ratio) to (some) greater ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]), `$O$`.
* Thus, inversely, as [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` is to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, so [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$` (is) to [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$` [ [Prop. 5.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]1.
* But, as [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$` (is) to [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$`, so [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EN$` (is) to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] less than [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$` [ [Prop. 12.2 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6480].
* And, thus, as [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` (is) to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, so [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EN$` (is) to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] less than [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$`.
* The very thing was shown (to be) impossible.
* Thus, [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` is not to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, as [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$` (is) to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] greater than [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EN$`.
* And, it was shown that neither (is it in this ratio) to (some) lesser ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]).
* Thus, as [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` is to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, so [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$AL$` (is) to [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EN$`.
But, as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] (is) to the [cone][bookofproofs$2227], (so) the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] (is) to the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230].
* For each (is) three times each [[Prop. 12.10]][bookofproofs$2286].
* Thus, [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` (is) also to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, as (the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of the [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230]) on them (having) the same [height][bookofproofs$1986].
* Thus, [cones][bookofproofs$2227] and [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] having the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] are to one another as their bases.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
