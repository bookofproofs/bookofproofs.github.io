### (Lemma to Proposition 2 from Book 12 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So, I say that, area `$S$` being greater than [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, as area `$S$` is to [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, so [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` (is) to some area less than [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`.
