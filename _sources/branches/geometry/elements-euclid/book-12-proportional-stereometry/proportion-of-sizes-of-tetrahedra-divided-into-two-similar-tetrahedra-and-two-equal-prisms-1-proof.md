* For, in the same figure, let [perpendiculars][bookofproofs$653] have been conceived (drawn) from ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$G$` and `$H$` to the [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` (respectively).
* These clearly turn out to be equal, on account of the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] being assumed (to be) of equal [height][bookofproofs$1986].
* And since two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$GC$` and the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] from `$G$`, are cut by the [parallel planes][bookofproofs$2217] `$ABC$` and `$PMN$` they will be cut in the [same ratios][bookofproofs$1945] [[Prop. 11.17]][bookofproofs$2254].
* And `$GC$` was cut in half by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$PMN$` at `$N$`.
* Thus, the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] from `$G$` to the plane `$ABC$` will also be cut in half by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$PMN$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] from `$H$` to the plane `$DEF$` will also be cut in half by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$STU$`.
* And the [perpendiculars][bookofproofs$653] from `$G$` and `$H$` to the [planes][bookofproofs$647] `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` (respectively) are equal.
* Thus, the [perpendiculars][bookofproofs$653] from the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$PMN$` and `$STU$` to `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` (respectively, are) also equal.
* Thus, the [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] whose bases are [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$LOC$` and `$RVF$`, and opposite (sides) `$PMN$` and `$STU$` (respectively), [are] of equal [height][bookofproofs$1986].
* And, hence, the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] described on the aforementioned [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] [are] of equal [height][bookofproofs$1986] and (are) to one another as their bases [[Prop. 11.32]][bookofproofs$2269].
* Likewise, the halves (of the solids) [[Prop. 11.28]][bookofproofs$2265].
* Thus, as base `$LOC$` is to base `$RVF$`, so the aforementioned [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] (are) to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
