### Euclid's Formulation

> There being two [spheres][bookofproofs$2223] about the same [center][bookofproofs$6428], to inscribe a polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] in the greater [sphere][bookofproofs$2223], not touching the lesser [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] on its surface.
* Let two [spheres][bookofproofs$2223] have been conceived about the same [center][bookofproofs$6428], `$A$`.
* So, it is necessary to inscribe a polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] in the greater [sphere][bookofproofs$2223], not touching the lesser [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] on its surface.
