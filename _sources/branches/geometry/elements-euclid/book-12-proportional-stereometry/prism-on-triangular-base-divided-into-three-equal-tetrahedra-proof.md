* Let there be a [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`, and opposite (plane) `$DEF$`.
* I say that [prism][bookofproofs$2222] `$ABCDEF$` is divided into three [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases (which are) equal to one another.

* For let `$BD$`, `$EC$`, and `$CD$` have been joined.
* Since `$ABED$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], and `$BD$` is its diagonal, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABD$` is thus equal to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$EBD$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* And, thus, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABD$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, is equal to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DEB$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` [[Prop. 12.5]][bookofproofs$2281].
* But, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DEB$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, is the same as the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$EBC$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`.
* For they are contained by the same [planes][bookofproofs$647].
* And, thus, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is `$ABD$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, is equal to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is `$EBC$` and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`.
* Again, since `$FCBE$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], and `$CE$` is its diagonal, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$CEF$` is equal to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$CBE$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* And, thus, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$BCE$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, is equal to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ECF$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` [[Prop. 12.5]][bookofproofs$2281].
* And the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$BCE$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, was shown (to be) equal to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABD$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`.
* Thus, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$CEF$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, is also equal to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base [is] [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABD$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`.
* Thus, the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] `$ABCDEF$` has been divided into three [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases (which are) equal to one another.
* And since the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABD$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, is the same as the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$CAB$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`.
* For they are contained by the same [planes][bookofproofs$647].
* And the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABD$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$`, was shown (to be) a third of the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`, and opposite (plane) `$DEF$`, thus the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$`, is also a third of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] having the same base, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`, and opposite (plane) `$DEF$`.
