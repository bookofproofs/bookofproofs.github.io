* Let the [spheres][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` have been conceived, and (let) their [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] (be) `$BC$` and `$EF$` (respectively).
* I say that [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` has to [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BC$` (has) to `$EF$`.

* For if [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` does not have to [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BC$` (has) to `$EF$` then [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` will have to some ([sphere][bookofproofs$2223]) either less than, or greater than, [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BC$` (has) to `$EF$`.
* Let it, first of all, have (such a ratio) to a lesser ([sphere][bookofproofs$2223]), `$GHK$`.
* And let `$DEF$` have been conceived about the same [center][bookofproofs$6428] as `$GHK$`.
* And let a polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] have been inscribed in the greater [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$`, not touching the lesser [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$GHK$` on its surface [[Prop. 12.17]][bookofproofs$2293].
* And let a polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210], [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] in [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$`, have also been inscribed in [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$`.
* Thus, the polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] in [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` has to the polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] in [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BC$` (has) to `$EF$` [ [Prop. 12.17 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6469].
* And [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` also has to [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$GHK$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BC$` (has) to `$EF$`.
* Thus, as [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` is to [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$GHK$`, so the polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] in [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` (is) to the polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] is [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$`.
* Thus, alternately, as [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` (is) to the [polygon][bookofproofs$687] within it, so [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$GHK$` (is) to the polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] within [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` (is) greater than the polyhedron within it.
* Thus, [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$GHK$` (is) also greater than the polyhedron within [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* But, (it is) also less.
* For it is encompassed by it.
* Thus, [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` does not have to (a [sphere][bookofproofs$2223]) less than [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$BC$` (has) to `$EF$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$` does not have to (a [sphere][bookofproofs$2223]) less than [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$EF$` (has) to `$BC$` either.
* So, I say that [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` does not have to some ([sphere][bookofproofs$2223]) greater than [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BC$` (has) to `$EF$` either.
* For, if possible, let it have (the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949]) to a greater ([sphere][bookofproofs$2223]), `$LMN$`.
* Thus, inversely, [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$LMN$` (has) to [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$EF$` (has) to [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] `$BC$` [ [Prop. 5.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6451].
* And as [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$LMN$` (is) to [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$`, so [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$` (is) to some ([sphere][bookofproofs$2223]) less than [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$`, inasmuch as `$LMN$` is greater than `$DEF$`, as was shown before [ [Prop. 12.2 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6480].
* And, thus, [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$` has to some ([sphere][bookofproofs$2223]) less than [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$EF$` (has) to `$BC$`.
* The very thing was shown (to be) impossible.
* Thus, [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` does not have to some ([sphere][bookofproofs$2223]) greater than [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BC$` (has) to `$EF$`.
* And it was shown that neither (does it have such a ratio) to a lesser ([sphere][bookofproofs$2223]).
* Thus, [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$ABC$` has to [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$DEF$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BC$` (has) to `$EF$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
