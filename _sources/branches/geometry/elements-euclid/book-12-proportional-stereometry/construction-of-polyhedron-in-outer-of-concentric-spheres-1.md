### (Corollary to Proposition 17 from Book 12 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> And, also, if a [similar][bookofproofs$2218] polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] to that in [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$BCDE$` is inscribed in another [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] then the polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] in [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$BCDE$` has to the polyhedral [solid][bookofproofs$2210] in the other [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of [sphere][bookofproofs$2223] `$BCDE$` has to the [diameter][bookofproofs$6429] of the other [sphere][bookofproofs$2223].
