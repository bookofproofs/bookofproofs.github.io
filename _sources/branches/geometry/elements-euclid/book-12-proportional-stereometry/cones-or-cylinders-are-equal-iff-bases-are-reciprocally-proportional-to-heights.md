### Euclid's Formulation

> The bases of equal [cones][bookofproofs$2227] and [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights. And, those [cones][bookofproofs$2227] and [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] whose bases (are) [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights are equal.
* Let there be equal [cones][bookofproofs$2227] and [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] whose bases are the [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` and `$EFGH$`, and the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of (the bases) `$AC$` and `$EG$`, and (whose) axes (are) `$KL$` and `$MN$`, which are also the heights of the [cones][bookofproofs$2227] and [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] (respectively).
* And let the [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` and `$EP$` have been completed.
* I say that the bases of [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] `$AO$` and `$EP$` are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights, and (so) as base `$ABCD$` is to base `$EFGH$`, so [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$MN$` (is) to [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$KL$`.
