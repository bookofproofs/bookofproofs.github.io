### Euclid's Formulation

> [Similar cones and cylinders][bookofproofs$2233] are to one another in the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] of the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of their bases.
* Let there be [similar cones and cylinders][bookofproofs$2233] of which the bases (are) the [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` and `$EFGH$`, the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of the bases (are) `$BD$` and `$FH$`, and the axes of the [cones][bookofproofs$2227] and [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] (are) `$KL$` and `$MN$` (respectively).
* I say that the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] whose [base][bookofproofs$2229] [is] [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`, has to the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] whose [base][bookofproofs$2229] [is] [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`, the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BD$` (has) to `$FH$`.
