* For let there be (two) equal [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having the [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases `$ABC$` and `$DEF$`, and apexes the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$H$` (respectively).
* I say that the bases of the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` and `$DEFH$` are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights, and (so) that as base `$ABC$` is to base `$DEF$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$`.

* For let the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$BGML$` and `$EHQP$` have been completed.
* And since [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` is equal to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`, and [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$BGML$` is six times [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (see previous proposition), and [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$EHQP$` (is) six times [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$BGML$` is thus equal to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$EHQP$`.
* And the bases of equal [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights [[Prop. 11.34]][bookofproofs$2271].
* Thus, as base `$BM$` is to base `$EQ$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$EHQP$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$BGML$`.
* But, as base `$BM$` (is) to base `$EQ$`, so [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` (is) to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DEF$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* And, thus, as [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` (is) to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DEF$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$EHQP$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$BGML$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* But, the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$EHQP$` is the same as the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`, and the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$BGML$` is the same as the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$`.
* Thus, as base `$ABC$` is to base `$DEF$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$`.
* Thus, the bases of [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` and `$DEFH$` are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights.
* And so, let the bases of [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` and `$DEFH$` be [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights, and (thus) let base `$ABC$` be to base `$DEF$`, as the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$`.
* I say that [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` is equal to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`.
* For, with the same construction, since as base `$ABC$` is to base `$DEF$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$`, but as base `$ABC$` (is) to base `$DEF$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BM$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EQ$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933], thus as [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BM$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EQ$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` (is) also to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* But, the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` is the same as the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [parallelepiped][bookofproofs$2222] `$EHQP$`, and the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` is the same as the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [parallelepiped][bookofproofs$2222] `$BGML$`.
* Thus, as base `$BM$` is to base `$EQ$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [parallelepiped][bookofproofs$2222] `$EHQP$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [parallelepiped][bookofproofs$2222] `$BGML$`.
* And those [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] whose bases are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights are equal [[Prop. 11.34]][bookofproofs$2271].
* Thus, the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$BGML$` is equal to the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] `$EHQP$`.
* And [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` is a sixth part of `$BGML$`, and [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` a sixth part of [parallelepiped][bookofproofs$2222] `$EHQP$`.
* Thus, [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` is equal to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`.
* Thus, the bases of equal [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] which also have [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights.
* And those [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases whose bases are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights are equal.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
