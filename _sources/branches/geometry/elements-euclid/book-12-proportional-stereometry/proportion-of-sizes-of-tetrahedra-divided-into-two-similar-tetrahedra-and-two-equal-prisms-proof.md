* Let there be two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] with the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], having the [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases `$ABC$` and `$DEF$`, (with) apexes the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$H$` (respectively).
* And let each of them have been divided into two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] equal to one another, and [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the whole, and into two equal [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] [[Prop. 12.3]][bookofproofs$2279].
* I say that as base `$ABC$` is to base `$DEF$`, so (the sum of) all the [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] in [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to (the sum of) all the equal number of [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] in [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`.

* For since `$BO$` is equal to `$OC$`, and `$AL$` to `$LC$`, `$LO$` is thus [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AB$`, and [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$LOC$` [[Prop. 12.3]][bookofproofs$2279].
* So, for the same (reasons), [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DEF$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$RVF$`.
* And since `$BC$` is double `$CO$`, and `$EF$` (double) `$FV$`, thus as `$BC$` (is) to `$CO$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$FV$`.
* And the [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, rectilinear (figures) `$ABC$` and `$LOC$` have been described on `$BC$` and `$CO$` (respectively), and the [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, [rectilinear] (figures) `$DEF$` and `$RVF$` on `$EF$` and `$FV$` (respectively).
* Thus, as [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` is to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$LOC$`, so [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DEF$` (is) to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$RVF$` [[Prop. 6.22]][bookofproofs$2008].
* Thus, alternately, as [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` is to [[triangle][bookofproofs$6432]] `$DEF$`, so [[triangle][bookofproofs$6432]] `$LOC$` (is) to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$RVF$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* But, as [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$LOC$` (is) to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$RVF$`, so the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base [is] [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$LOC$`, and opposite (plane) `$PMN$`, (is) to the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$RVF$`, and opposite (plane) `$STU$` (see lemma).
* And, thus, as [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` (is) to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$DEF$`, so the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$LOC$`, and opposite (plane) `$PMN$`, (is) to the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$RVF$`, and opposite (plane) `$STU$`.
* And as the aforementioned [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] (are) to one another, so the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base (is) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$KBOL$`, and opposite (side) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$PM$`, (is) to the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base (is) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$QEVR$`, and opposite (side) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$ST$` [[Prop. 11.39]][bookofproofs$2276], [[Prop. 12.3]][bookofproofs$2279].
* Thus, also, (is) the (sum of the) two [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] - that whose base (is) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$KBOL$`, and opposite (side) `$PM$`, and that whose base (is) `$LOC$`, and opposite (plane) `$PMN$` - to (the sum of) the (two) [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] - that whose base (is) `$QEVR$`, and opposite (side) [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$ST$`, and that whose base (is) [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$RVF$`, and opposite (plane) `$STU$` [[Prop. 5.12]][bookofproofs$1969].
* And, thus, as base `$ABC$` (is) to base `$DEF$`, so the (sum of the first) aforementioned two [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] (is) to the (sum of the second) aforementioned two [prisms][bookofproofs$2222].
And, similarly, if [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] `$PMNG$` and `$STUH$` are divided into two [prisms][bookofproofs$2222], and two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221], as base `$PMN$` (is) to base `$STU$`, so (the sum of) the two [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] in [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$PMNG$` will be to (the sum of) the two [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] in [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$STUH$`.
* But, as base `$PMN$` (is) to base `$STU$`, so base `$ABC$` (is) to base `$DEF$`.
* For the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$PMN$` and `$STU$` (are) equal to `$LOC$` and `$RVF$`, respectively.
* And, thus, as base `$ABC$` (is) to base `$DEF$`, so (the sum of) the four [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] (is) to (the sum of) the four [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] [[Prop. 5.12]][bookofproofs$1969].
* So, similarly, even if we divide the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] left behind into two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] and into two [prisms][bookofproofs$2222], as base `$ABC$` (is) to base `$DEF$`, so (the sum of) all the [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] in [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` will be to (the sum of) all the equal number of [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] in [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
