* Let there be "Similar cones and cylinders":https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/similar-cones,-similar-cylinders/ of which the bases (are) the [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` and `$EFGH$`, the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of the bases (are) `$BD$` and `$FH$`, and the axes of the [cones][bookofproofs$2227] and [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] (are) `$KL$` and `$MN$` (respectively).
* I say that the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] whose [base][bookofproofs$2229] [is] [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`, has to the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] whose [base][bookofproofs$2229] [is] [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`, the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BD$` (has) to `$FH$`.

![fig12e](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/euclid/Book12/fig12e.png?raw=true)

* For if [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$ABCDL$` does not have to [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EFGHN$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BD$` (has) to `$FH$` then [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$ABCDL$` will have the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] either less than, or greater than, [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EFGHN$`.
* Let it, first of all, have (such a ratio) to (some) lesser ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]), `$O$`.
* And let the square `$EFGH$` have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$EFGH$` [[Prop. 4.6]][bookofproofs$1930].
* Thus, square `$EFGH$` is greater than half of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` [[Prop. 12.2]][bookofproofs$2278].
* And let a [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] having the same apex as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] have been set up on square `$EFGH$`.
* Thus, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] set up is greater than the half part of the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] [[Prop. 12.10]][bookofproofs$2286].
* So, let the [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$EF$`, `$FG$`, `$GH$`, and `$HE$` have been cut in half at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$P$`, `$Q$`, `$R$`, and `$S$` (respectively).
* And let `$EP$`, `$PF$`, `$FQ$`, `$QG$`, `$GR$`, `$RH$`, `$HS$`, and `$SE$` have been joined.
* And, thus, each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$EPF$`, `$FQG$`, `$GRH$`, and `$HSE$` is greater than the half part of the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$` about it [[Prop. 12.2]][bookofproofs$2278].
* And let a [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] having the same apex as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] have been set up on each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$EPF$`, `$FQG$`, `$GRH$`, and `$HSE$`.
* And thus each of the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] set up is greater than the half part of the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] of the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] about it [[Prop. 12.10]][bookofproofs$2286].
* So, (if) the the remaining [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] are cut in half, and [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are joined, and [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having the same apex as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] are set up on each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], and this is done continually, then we will (eventually) leave some [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] whose (sum) is less than the excess by which [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EFGHN$` exceeds [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$` [[Prop. 10.1]][bookofproofs$2095].
* Let them have been left, and let them be the (segments) on `$EP$`, `$PF$`, `$FQ$`, `$QG$`, `$GR$`, `$RH$`, `$HS$`, and `$SE$`.
* Thus, the remaining [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$EPFQGRHS$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`, is greater than [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$`.
* And let the [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ATBUCVDW$`, [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$EPFQGRHS$`, have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCD$` [[Prop. 6.18]][bookofproofs$2004].
* And let a [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] having the same apex as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] have been set up on [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ATBUCVDW$`.
* And let `$LBT$` be one of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] containing the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ATBUCVDW$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`.
* And let `$NFP$` be one of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] containing the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$EPFQGRHS$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`.
* And let `$KT$` and `$MP$` have been joined.
* And since [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$ABCDL$` is [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EFGHN$`, thus as `$BD$` is to `$FH$`, so axis `$KL$` (is) to axis `$MN$` " [Def. 11.24] ":https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/similar-cones,-similar-cylinders/.
* And as `$BD$` (is) to `$FH$`, so `$BK$` (is) to `$FM$`.
* And, thus, as `$BK$` (is) to `$FM$`, so `$KL$` (is) to `$MN$`.
* And, alternately, as `$BK$` (is) to `$KL$`, so `$FM$` (is) to `$MN$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And the sides around the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BKL$` and `$FMN$` are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$BKL$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$FMN$` [[Prop. 6.6]][bookofproofs$1992].
* Again, since as `$BK$` (is) to `$KT$`, so `$FM$` (is) to `$MP$`, and (they are) about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BKT$` and `$FMP$`, inasmuch as whatever part angle `$BKT$` is of the four [right angles][bookofproofs$653] at the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$K$`, angle `$FMP$` is also the same part of the four [right angles][bookofproofs$653] at the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$M$`.
* Therefore, since the sides about equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$BKT$` is thus [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to traingle `$FMP$` [[Prop. 6.6]][bookofproofs$1992].
* Again, since it was shown that as `$BK$` (is) to `$KL$`, so `$FM$` (is) to `$MN$`, and `$BK$` (is) equal to `$KT$`, and `$FM$` to `$PM$`, thus as `$TK$` (is) to `$KL$`, so `$PM$` (is) to `$MN$`.
* And the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$TKL$` and `$PMN$` - for (they are both) [right angles][bookofproofs$653] - are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$LKT$` (is) [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$NMP$` [[Prop. 6.6]][bookofproofs$1992].
* And since, on account of the similarity of [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$LKB$` and `$NMF$`, as `$LB$` (is) to `$BK$`, so `$NF$` (is) to `$FM$`, and, on account of the similarity of [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$BKT$` and `$FMP$`, as `$KB$` (is) to `$BT$`, so `$MF$` (is) to `$FP$` [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983], thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$LB$` (is) to `$BT$`, so `$NF$` (is) to `$FP$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* Again, since, on account of the similarity of [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$LTK$` and `$NPM$`, as `$LT$` (is) to `$TK$`, so `$NP$` (is) to `$PM$`, and, on account of the similarity of [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$TKB$` and `$PMF$`, as `$KT$` (is) to `$TB$`, so `$MP$` (is) to `$PF$`, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$LT$` (is) to `$TB$`, so `$NP$` (is) to `$PF$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* And it was shown that as `$TB$` (is) to `$BL$`, so `$PF$` (is) to `$FN$`.
* Thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$TL$` (is) to `$LB$`, so `$PN$` (is) to `$NF$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* Thus, the sides of [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$LTB$` and `$NPF$` are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$LTB$` and `$NPF$` are equiangular [[Prop. 6.5]][bookofproofs$1991].
* And, hence, (they are) [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* And, thus, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$BKT$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`, is [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$FMP$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`.
* For they are contained by equal [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] of [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [planes][bookofproofs$647] [ [Def. 11.9] ][bookofproofs$2218].
* And [similar][bookofproofs$2218] [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] which also have [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases are in the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] of corresponding sides [[Prop. 12.8]][bookofproofs$2284].
* Thus, [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$BKTL$` has to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$FMPN$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BK$` (has) to `$FM$`.
* So, similarly, joining [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] from ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$A$`, `$W$`, `$D$`, `$V$`, `$C$`, and `$U$` to ([center][bookofproofs$6428]) `$K$`, and from ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$E$`, `$S$`, `$H$`, `$R$`, `$G$`, and `$Q$` to ([center][bookofproofs$6428]) `$M$`, and setting up [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having the same apexes as the [cones][bookofproofs$2227] on each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] (so formed), we can also show that each of the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] (on base `$ABCD$` taken) in order will have to each of the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] (on base `$EFGH$` taken) in order the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that the corresponding side `$BK$` (has) to the corresponding side `$FM$` - that is to say, that `$BD$` (has) to `$FH$`.
* And (for two sets of [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] magnitudes) as one of the leading (magnitudes is) to one of the following, so (the sum of) all of the leading (magnitudes is) to (the sum of) all of the following (magnitudes) [[Prop. 5.12]][bookofproofs$1969].
* And, thus, as [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$BKTL$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$FMPN$`, so the whole [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ATBUCVDW$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`, (is) to the whole [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$EPFQGRHS$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`.
* And, hence, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ATBUCVDW$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`, has to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$EPFQGRHS$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`, the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BD$` (has) to `$FH$`.
* And it was also assumed that the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] whose [base][bookofproofs$2229] is [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`, has to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BD$` (has) to `$FH$`.
* Thus, as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] whose [base][bookofproofs$2229] is [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`, is to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$`, so the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base (is) [[polygon][bookofproofs$687]] `$ATBUCVDW$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`, (is) to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$EPFQGRHS$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`.
* Thus, alternately, as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] whose [base][bookofproofs$2229] (is) [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`, (is) to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] within it whose base (is) the [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ATBUCVDW$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$L$`, so the [[solid][bookofproofs$2210]] `$O$` (is) to the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$EPFQGRHS$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And the aforementioned [cone][bookofproofs$2227] (is) greater than the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] within it.
* For it encompasses it.
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$` (is) also greater than the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$EPFQGRHS$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`.
* But, (it is) also less.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] whose [base][bookofproofs$2229] (is) [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, and apex the [[point][bookofproofs$631]] `$L$`, does not have to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] less than the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] whose [base][bookofproofs$2229] (is) [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, and apex the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$N$`, the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BD$` (has) to `$EH$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that neither does [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EFGHN$` have to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] less than [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$ABCDL$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$FH$` (has) to `$BD$`.
* So, I say that neither does [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$ABCDL$` have to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] greater than [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EFGHN$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BD$` (has) to `$FH$`.
* For, if possible, let it have (such a ratio) to a greater ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]), `$O$`.
* Thus, inversely, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$` has to [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$ABCDL$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$FH$` (has) to `$BD$` [ [Prop. 5.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]1.
* And as [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$O$` (is) to [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$ABCDL$`, so [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EFGHN$` (is) to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] less than [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$ABCDL$` [ [Prop. 12.2 lem.] ][bookofproofs$6480].
* Thus, [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EFGHN$` also has to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] less than [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$ABCDL$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$FH$` (has) to `$BD$`.
* The very thing was shown (to be) impossible.
* Thus, [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$ABCDL$` does not have to some [solid][bookofproofs$2210] greater than [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EFGHN$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] than `$BD$` (has) to `$FH$`.
* And it was shown that neither (does it have such a ratio) to a lesser ([solid][bookofproofs$2210]).
* Thus, [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$ABCDL$` has to [cone][bookofproofs$2227] `$EFGHN$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BD$` (has) to `$FG$`.
* And as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] (is) to the [cone][bookofproofs$2227], so the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] (is) to the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230].
* For a [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] is three times a [cone][bookofproofs$2227] on the same base as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227], and of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] as it [[Prop. 12.10]][bookofproofs$2286].
* Thus, the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] also has to the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BD$` (has) to `$FH$`.
* Thus, "Similar cones and cylinders":https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/similar-cones,-similar-cylinders/ are in the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] of the [diameters][bookofproofs$6429] of their bases.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
