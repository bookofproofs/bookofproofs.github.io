* Let there be [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] whose bases (are) the [polygons][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCDE$` and `$FGHKL$`, and apexes the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$M$` and `$N$` (respectively).
* I say that as base `$ABCDE$` is to base `$FGHKL$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCDEM$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$FGHKLN$`.

* For let `$AC$`, `$AD$`, `$FH$`, and `$FK$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since `$ABCM$` and `$ACDM$` are two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases and equal [height][bookofproofs$1986], they are to one another as their bases [[Prop. 12.5]][bookofproofs$2281].
* Thus, as base `$ABC$` is to base `$ACD$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCM$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ACDM$`.
* And, via [composition][bookofproofs$1953], as base `$ABCD$` (is) to base `$ACD$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCDM$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ACDM$` [[Prop. 5.18]][bookofproofs$1975].
* But, as base `$ACD$` (is) to base `$ADE$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ACDM$` (is) also to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ADEM$` [[Prop. 12.5]][bookofproofs$2281].
* Thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as base `$ABCD$` (is) to base `$ADE$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCDM$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ADEM$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* And, again, via [composition][bookofproofs$1953], as base `$ABCDE$` (is) to base `$ADE$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCDEM$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ADEM$` [[Prop. 5.18]][bookofproofs$1975].
* So, similarly, it can also be shown that as base `$FGHKL$` (is) to base `$FGH$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$FGHKLN$` (is) also to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$FGHN$`.
* And since `$ADEM$` and `$FGHN$` are two [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases and equal [height][bookofproofs$1986], thus as base `$ADE$` (is) to base `$FGH$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ADEM$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$FGHN$` [[Prop. 12.5]][bookofproofs$2281].
* But, as base `$ADE$` (is) to base `$ABCDE$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ADEM$` (was) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCDEM$`.
* Thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as base `$ABCDE$` (is) to base `$FGH$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCDEM$` (is) also to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$FGHN$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* But, furthermore, as base `$FGH$` (is) to base `$FGHKL$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$FGHN$` was also to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$FGHKLN$`.
* Thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as base `$ABCDE$` (is) to base `$FGHKL$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCDEM$` (is) also to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$FGHKLN$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
