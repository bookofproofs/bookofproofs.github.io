* Let there be [similar][bookofproofs$2218], and similarly laid out, [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] whose bases are [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` and `$DEF$`, and apexes the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$H$` (respectively).
* I say that [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` has to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] of that `$BC$` (has) to `$EF$`.

* For let the [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] `$BGML$` and `$EHQP$` have been completed.
* And since [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` is [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`, angle `$ABC$` is thus equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DEF$`, and `$GBC$` to `$HEF$`, and `$ABG$` to `$DEH$`.
* And as `$AB$` is to `$DE$`, so `$BC$` (is) to `$EF$`, and `$BG$` to `$EH$` [ [Def. 11.9] ][bookofproofs$2218].
* And since as `$AB$` is to `$DE$`, so `$BC$` (is) to `$EF$`, and (so) the sides around equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BM$` is thus [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to paralleleogram `$EQ$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$BN$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$ER$`, and `$BK$` to `$EO$`.
* Thus, the three ([parallelograms][bookofproofs$909]) `$MB$`, `$BK$`, and `$BN$` are [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the three ([parallelograms][bookofproofs$909]) `$EQ$`, `$EO$`, `$ER$` (respectively).
* But, the three ([parallelograms][bookofproofs$909]) `$MB$`, `$BK$`, and `$BN$` are (both) equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the three opposite ([parallelograms][bookofproofs$909]), and the three ([parallelograms][bookofproofs$909]) `$EQ$`, `$EO$`, and `$ER$` are (both) equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the three opposite ([parallelograms][bookofproofs$909]) [[Prop. 11.24]][bookofproofs$2261].
* Thus, the solids `$BGML$` and `$EHQP$` are contained by equal [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] of [similar][bookofproofs$1983] (and similarly laid out) [planes][bookofproofs$647].
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$BGML$` is [similar][bookofproofs$2218] to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$EHQP$` [ [Def. 11.9] ][bookofproofs$2218].
* And [similar][bookofproofs$2218] [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] are in the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] of corresponding sides [[Prop. 11.33]][bookofproofs$2270].
* Thus, [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$BGML$` has to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$EHQP$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that the corresponding side `$BC$` (has) to the corresponding side `$EF$`.
* And as [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$BGML$` (is) to [solid][bookofproofs$2210] `$EHQP$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`, inasmuch as the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] is the sixth part of the [solid][bookofproofs$2210], on account of the [prism][bookofproofs$2222], being half of the [parallelepipedal solid][bookofproofs$2222] [[Prop. 11.28]][bookofproofs$2265], also being three times the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] [[Prop. 12.7]][bookofproofs$2283].
* Thus, [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` also has to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` the [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] that `$BC$` (has) to `$EF$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
