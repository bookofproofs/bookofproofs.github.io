### Euclid's Formulation

> The bases of equal [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] which also have [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights. And those [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] which have [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases whose bases are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights are equal.

* For let there be (two) equal [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having the [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases `$ABC$` and `$DEF$`, and apexes the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$H$` (respectively).
* I say that the bases of the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` and `$DEFH$` are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to their heights, and (so) that as base `$ABC$` is to base `$DEF$`, so the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$` (is) to the [height][bookofproofs$1986] of [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$`.
