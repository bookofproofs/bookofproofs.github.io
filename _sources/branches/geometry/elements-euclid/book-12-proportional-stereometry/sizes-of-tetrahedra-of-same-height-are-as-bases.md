### Euclid's Formulation

> [Pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] which are of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986], and have [triangular][bookofproofs$6432] bases, are to one another as their bases.
* Let there be [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] whose bases (are) the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` and `$DEF$`, and apexes the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$H$` (respectively).
* I say that as base `$ABC$` is to base `$DEF$`, so [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$ABCG$` (is) to [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] `$DEFH$`.
