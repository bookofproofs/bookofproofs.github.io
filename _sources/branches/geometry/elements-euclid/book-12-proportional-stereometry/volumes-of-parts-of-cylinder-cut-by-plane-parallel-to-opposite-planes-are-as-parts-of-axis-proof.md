* For let the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$AD$` have been cut by the [plane][bookofproofs$647] `$GH$` which is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the opposite [planes][bookofproofs$647] (of the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230]), `$AB$` and `$CD$`.
* And let the plane `$GH$` have met the [axis][bookofproofs$2231] at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$K$`.
* I say that as [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$BG$` is to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$GD$`, so  `$EK$` (is) to  `$KF$`.

* For let  `$EF$` have been produced in each direction to [points][bookofproofs$631] `$L$` and `$M$`.
* And let any number whatsoever (of lengths), `$EN$` and `$NL$`, equal to  `$EK$`, be set out (on the  `$EL$`), and any number whatsoever (of lengths), `$FO$` and `$OM$`, equal to () `$FK$`, (on the  `$KM$`).
* And let the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$PW$`, whose bases (are) the [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$PQ$` and `$VW$`, have been conceived on  `$LM$`.
* And let [planes][bookofproofs$647] [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AB$`, `$CD$`, and the bases of [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$PW$`, have been produced through [points][bookofproofs$631] `$N$` and `$O$`, and let them have made the [circles][bookofproofs$690] `$RS$` and `$TU$` around the [centers][bookofproofs$6428] `$N$` and `$O$` (respectively).
* And since axes `$LN$`, `$NE$`, and `$EK$` are equal to one another, the [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] `$QR$`, `$RB$`, and `$BG$` are to one another as their bases [[Prop. 12.11]][bookofproofs$2287].
* But the bases are equal.
* Thus, the [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] `$QR$`, `$RB$`, and `$BG$` (are) also equal to one another.
* Therefore, since the axes `$LN$`, `$NE$`, and `$EK$` are equal to one another, and the [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] `$QR$`, `$RB$`, and `$BG$` are also equal to one another, and the [number][bookofproofs$2315] (of the former) is equal to the [number][bookofproofs$2315] (of the latter), thus as many [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] as  `$KL$` is of  `$EK$`, so many [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] is [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$QG$` also of [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$GB$`.
* And so, for the same (reasons), as many [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] as  `$MK$` is of  `$KF$`, so many [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] is [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$WG$` also of [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$GD$`.
* And if  `$KL$` is equal to  `$KM$` then [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$QG$` will also be equal to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$GW$`, and if the  (is) greater than the  then the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] (will also be) greater than the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230], and if (the  is) less then (the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] will also be) less.
* So, there are four magnitudes - the axes `$EK$` and `$KF$`, and the [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] `$BG$` and `$GD$` - and equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] have been taken of  `$EK$` and [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$BG$` - (namely),  `$LK$` and [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$QG$` - and of  `$KF$` and [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$GD$` - (namely),  `$KM$` and [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$GW$`.
* And it has been shown that if  `$KL$` exceeds  `$KM$` then [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$QG$` also exceeds [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$GW$`, and if (the axes are) equal then (the [cylinders][bookofproofs$2230] are) equal, and if ($KL$ is) less then ($QG$ is) less.
* Thus, as  `$EK$` is to  `$KF$`, so [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$BG$` (is) to [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] `$GD$` [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
