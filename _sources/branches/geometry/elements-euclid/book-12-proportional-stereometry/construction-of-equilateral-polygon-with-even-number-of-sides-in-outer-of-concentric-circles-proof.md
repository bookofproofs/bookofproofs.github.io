* Let `$ABCD$` and `$EFGH$` be the given two [circles][bookofproofs$690], about the same [center][bookofproofs$6428], `$K$`.
* So, it is necessary to inscribe an equilateral and even-sided [polygon][bookofproofs$687] in the greater [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, not [touching][bookofproofs$1853] [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`.

* Let the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BKD$` have been drawn through the [center][bookofproofs$6428] `$K$`.
* And let `$GA$` have been drawn, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BD$`, through [point][bookofproofs$631] `$G$`, and let it have been drawn through to `$C$`.
* Thus, `$AC$` [touches circle][bookofproofs$1853] `$EFGH$` [ [Prop. 3.16 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6449].
* So, (by) cutting [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BAD$` in half, and the half of it in half, and doing this continually, we will (eventually) leave a [circumference][bookofproofs$690] less than `$AD$` [[Prop. 10.1]][bookofproofs$2095].
* Let it have been left, and let it be `$LD$`.
* And let `$LM$` have been drawn, from `$L$`, [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$BD$`, and let it have been drawn through to `$N$`.
* And let `$LD$` and `$DN$` have been joined.
* Thus, `$LD$` is equal to `$DN$` [[Prop. 3.3]][bookofproofs$1865], [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* And since `$LN$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AC$` [[Prop. 1.28]][bookofproofs$913], and `$AC$` [touches circle][bookofproofs$1853] `$EFGH$`, `$LN$` thus does not [touch][bookofproofs$1853] [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`.
* Thus, even more so, `$LD$` and `$DN$` do not [touch][bookofproofs$1853] [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`.
* And if we continuously [insert][bookofproofs$1012] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) equal to [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$LD$` into [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` [[Prop. 4.1]][bookofproofs$1925] then an equilateral and even-sided [polygon][bookofproofs$687], not touching the lesser [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$EFGH$`, will have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCD$`.[^1] 
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

[^1]: Note that the chord of the [polygon][bookofproofs$687], `$LN$`, does not touch the inner [circle][bookofproofs$690] either (translator's note).
