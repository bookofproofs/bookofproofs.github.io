* For let there be a [cone][bookofproofs$2227] (with) the same base as a [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230], (namely) the [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`, and an equal [height][bookofproofs$1986].
* I say that the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] is the third part of the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] - that is to say, that the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] is three times the [cone][bookofproofs$2227].

* For if the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] is not three times the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] then the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] will be either more than three times, or less than three times, (the [cone][bookofproofs$2227]).
* Let it, first of all, be more than three times (the [cone][bookofproofs$2227]).
* And let the square `$ABCD$` have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCD$` [[Prop. 4.6]][bookofproofs$1930].
* So, square `$ABCD$` is more than half of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` [[Prop. 12.2]][bookofproofs$2278].
* And let a [prism][bookofproofs$2222] of equal [height][bookofproofs$1986] to the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] have been set up on square `$ABCD$`.
* So, the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] set up is more than half of the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230], inasmuch as if we also circumscribe a [square][bookofproofs$909] around [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` [[Prop. 4.7]][bookofproofs$1931] then the square [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCD$` is half of the circumscribed (square).
* And the solids set up on them are [parallelepiped][bookofproofs$2222] [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] of equal [height][bookofproofs$1986].
* And [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] having the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] are to one another as their bases [[Prop. 11.32]][bookofproofs$2269].
* And, thus, the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] set up on square `$ABCD$` is half of the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] set up on the square [circumscribed about circle][bookofproofs$1921] `$ABCD$`.
* And the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] is less than the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] set up on the square [circumscribed about circle][bookofproofs$1921] `$ABCD$`.
* Thus, the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] set up on square `$ABCD$` of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] as the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] is more than half of the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230].
* Let the [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, and `$DA$` have been cut in half at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$`, and `$H$`.
* And let `$AE$`, `$EB$`, `$BF$`, `$FC$`, `$CG$`, `$GD$`, `$DH$`, and `$HA$` have been joined.
* And thus each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEB$`, `$BFC$`, `$CGD$`, and `$DHA$` is more than half of the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` about it, as was shown previously [[Prop. 12.2]][bookofproofs$2278].
* Let [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] of equal [height][bookofproofs$1986] to the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] have been set up on each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEB$`, `$BFC$`, `$CGD$`, and `$DHA$`.
* And each of the [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] set up is greater than the half part of the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] of the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] about it - inasmuch as if we draw ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, and `$DA$` through [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$`, and `$H$` (respectively), and complete the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] on `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, and `$DA$`, and set up [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] of equal [height][bookofproofs$1986] to the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] on them, then the [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] on [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEB$`, `$BFC$`, `$CGD$`, and `$DHA$` are each half of the set up ([parallelepiped][bookofproofs$2222]s).
* And the [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] are less than the set up [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222].
* Hence, the [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] on [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEB$`, `$BFC$`, `$CGD$`, and `$DHA$` are also greater than half of the [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] about them.
* So (if) the remaining [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] are cut in half, and [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are joined, and [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] of equal [height][bookofproofs$1986] to the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] are set up on each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], and this is done continually, then we will (eventually) leave some [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] whose (sum) is less than the excess by which the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] exceeds three times the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] [[Prop. 10.1]][bookofproofs$2095].
* Let them have been left, and let them be `$AE$`, `$EB$`, `$BF$`, `$FC$`, `$CG$`, `$GD$`, `$DH$`, and `$HA$`.
* Thus, the remaining [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base (is) [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$AEBFCGDH$`, and [height][bookofproofs$1986] the same as the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230], is greater than three times the [cone][bookofproofs$2227].
* But, the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$AEBFCGDH$`, and [height][bookofproofs$1986] the same as the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230], is three times the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$AEBFCGDH$`, and apex the same as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] [ [Prop. 12.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6467].
* And thus the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base [is] [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$AEBFCGDH$`, and apex the same as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227], is greater than the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] having (as) base [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`.
* But (it is) also less.
* For it is encompassed by it.
* The very thing (is) [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] is not more than three times the [cone][bookofproofs$2227].
* So, I say that neither (is) the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] less than three times the [cone][bookofproofs$2227].
* For, if possible, let the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] be less than three times the [cone][bookofproofs$2227].
* Thus, inversely, the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] is greater than the third part of the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230].
* So, let the [square][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` have been [inscribed in circle][bookofproofs$1920] `$ABCD$` [[Prop. 4.6]][bookofproofs$1930].
* Thus, square `$ABCD$` is greater than half of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`.
* And let a [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] having the same apex as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] have been set up on square `$ABCD$`.
* Thus, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] set up is greater than the half part of the [cone][bookofproofs$2227], inasmuch as we showed previously that if we circumscribe a [square][bookofproofs$909] about the [circle][bookofproofs$690] [[Prop. 4.7]][bookofproofs$1931] then the square `$ABCD$` will be half of the square [circumscribed about the circle][bookofproofs$1921] [[Prop. 12.2]][bookofproofs$2278].
* And if we set up on the [squares][bookofproofs$909] [parallelepiped solids][bookofproofs$2222] - which are also called [prisms][bookofproofs$2222] - of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227], then the ([prism][bookofproofs$2222]) set up on square `$ABCD$` will be half of the ([prism][bookofproofs$2222]) set up on the square [circumscribed about the circle][bookofproofs$1921].
* For they are to one another as their bases [[Prop. 11.32]][bookofproofs$2269].
* Hence, (the same) also (goes for) the thirds.
* Thus, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [square][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` is half of the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] set up on the square [circumscribed about the circle][bookofproofs$1921] [ [Prop. 12.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6467].
* And the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] set up on the square [circumscribed about the circle][bookofproofs$1921] is greater than the [cone][bookofproofs$2227].
* For it encompasses it.
* Thus, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [square][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$`, and apex the same as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227], is greater than half of the [cone][bookofproofs$2227].
* Let the [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$AB$`, `$BC$`, `$CD$`, and `$DA$` have been cut in half at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$`, and `$H$` (respectively).
* And let `$AE$`, `$EB$`, `$BF$`, `$FC$`, `$CG$`, `$GD$`, `$DH$`, and `$HA$` have been joined.
* And, thus, each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEB$`, `$BFC$`, `$CGD$`, and `$DHA$` is greater than the half part of the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] of [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$` about it [[Prop. 12.2]][bookofproofs$2278].
* And let [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having the same apex as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] have been set up on each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$AEB$`, `$BFC$`, `$CGD$`, and `$DHA$`.
* And, thus, in the same way, each of the [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] set up is more than the half part of the [segment][bookofproofs$1852] of the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] about it.
* So, (if) the remaining [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] are cut in half, and [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are joined, and [pyramids][bookofproofs$2221] having the same apex as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] are set up on each of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], and this is done continually, then we will (eventually) leave some [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] whose (sum) is less than the excess by which the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] exceeds the third part of the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] [[Prop. 10.1]][bookofproofs$2095].
* Let them have been left, and let them be the (segments) on `$AE$`, `$EB$`, `$BF$`, `$FC$`, `$CG$`, `$GD$`, `$DH$`, and `$HA$`.
* Thus, the remaining [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$AEBFCGDH$`, and apex the same as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227], is greater than the third part of the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230].
* But, the [pyramid][bookofproofs$2221] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$AEBFCGDH$`, and apex the same as the [cone][bookofproofs$2227], is the third part of the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$AEBFCGDH$`, and [height][bookofproofs$1986] the same as the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] [ [Prop. 12.7 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6467].
* Thus, the [prism][bookofproofs$2222] whose base is [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$AEBFCGDH$`, and [height][bookofproofs$1986] the same as the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230], is greater than the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] whose [base][bookofproofs$2232] is [circle][bookofproofs$690] `$ABCD$`.
* But, (it is) also less.
* For it is encompassed by it.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] is not less than three times the [cone][bookofproofs$2227].
* And it was shown that neither (is it) greater than three times (the [cone][bookofproofs$2227]).
* Thus, the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] (is) three times the [cone][bookofproofs$2227].
* Hence, the [cone][bookofproofs$2227] is the third part of the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230].
* Thus, every [cone][bookofproofs$2227] is the third part of the [cylinder][bookofproofs$2230] which has the same [base][bookofproofs$2232] as it, and an equal [height][bookofproofs$1986].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
