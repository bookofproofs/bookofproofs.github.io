* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` be four [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and let `$A$` be [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* I say that `$D$` is also [cube][bookofproofs$2327].

* For since two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$B$` and `$C$`, are in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$A$` and `$D$`, `$A$` and `$D$` are thus [similar solid numbers][bookofproofs$2329] [[Prop. 8.21]][bookofproofs$2040].
* And `$A$` (is) [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* Thus, `$D$` (is) also [cube][bookofproofs$2327] [ [Def. 7.21] ][bookofproofs$2329].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
