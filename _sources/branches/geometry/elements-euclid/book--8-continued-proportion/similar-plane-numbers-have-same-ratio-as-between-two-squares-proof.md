* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329].
* I say that `$A$` has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to a(nother) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].

* For since `$A$` and `$B$` are [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329], one [number][bookofproofs$2315] thus falls (between) `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] [[Prop. 8.18]][bookofproofs$2037].
* Let it (so) fall, and let it be `$C$`.
* And let the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$D$`, `$E$`, `$F$`, having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$C$`, `$B$` have been taken [[Prop. 8.2]][bookofproofs$2021].
* The outermost of them, `$D$` and `$F$`, are thus square [ [Prop. 8.2 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6456].
* And since as `$D$` is to `$F$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, and `$D$` and `$F$` are square, `$A$` thus has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to a(nother) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
