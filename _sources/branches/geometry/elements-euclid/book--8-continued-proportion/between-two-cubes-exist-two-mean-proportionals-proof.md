* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [cube numbers][bookofproofs$2327], and let `$C$` be the side of `$A$`, and `$D$` (the side) of `$B$`.
* I say that there exist two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$A$` and `$B$`, and that `$A$` has to `$B$` a [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] with respect to (that) `$C$` (has) to `$D$`.

* For let `$C$` make `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and let it make `$F$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`.
* And let `$D$` make `$G$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and let `$C$`, `$D$` make `$H$`, `$K$`, respectively, [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`.
* And since `$A$` is cube, and `$C$` (is) its side, and `$C$` has made `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, `$C$` has thus made `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`.
* And so, for the same (reasons), `$D$` has made `$G$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$G$`.
* And since `$C$` has made `$E$`, `$F$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`, `$D$`, respectively, thus as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And so, for the same (reasons), as `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$G$` [[Prop. 7.18]][bookofproofs$2348].
* Again, since `$C$` has made `$A$`, `$H$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`, `$F$`, respectively, thus as `$E$` is to `$F$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$H$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And as `$E$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* And thus as `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$H$`.
* Again, since `$C$`, `$D$` have made `$H$`, `$K$`, respectively, [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`, thus as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$K$` [[Prop. 7.18]][bookofproofs$2348].
* Again, since `$D$` has made `$K$`, `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`, `$G$`, respectively, thus as `$F$` is to `$G$`, so `$K$` (is) to `$B$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And as `$F$` (is) to `$G$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* And thus as `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$H$`, and `$H$` to `$K$`, and `$K$` to `$B$`.
* Thus, `$H$` and `$K$` are two ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$A$` and `$B$`.
* So I say that `$A$` also has to `$B$` a [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] with respect to (that) `$C$` (has) to `$D$`.
* For since `$A$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$B$` are four in [ (continued) proportion][bookofproofs$6552] [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$` thus has to `$B$` a [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] with respect to (that) `$A$` (has) to `$H$` [ [Def. 5.10] ][bookofproofs$1949].
* And as `$A$` (is) to `$H$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* And [thus] `$A$` has to `$B$` a [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] with respect to (that) `$C$` (has) to `$D$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
