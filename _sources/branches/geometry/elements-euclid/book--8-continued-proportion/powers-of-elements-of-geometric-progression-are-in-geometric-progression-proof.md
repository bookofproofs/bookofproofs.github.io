* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` be any multitude whatsoever of [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], (such that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$C$`.
* And let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` make `$D$`, `$E$`, `$F$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] themselves, and let them make `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`, `$E$`, `$F$`.
* I say that `$D$`, `$E$`, `$F$` and `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].

* For let `$A$` make `$L$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* And let `$A$`, `$B$` make `$M$`, `$N$`, respectively, [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$L$`.
* And, again, let `$B$` make `$O$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`.
* And let `$B$`, `$C$` make `$P$`, `$Q$`, respectively, (by) multplying `$O$`.
* So, similarly to the above, we can show that `$D$`, `$L$`, `$E$` and `$G$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, `$H$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$A$` to `$B$`, and, further, (that) `$E$`, `$O$`, `$F$` and `$H$`, `$P$`, `$Q$`, `$K$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$B$` to `$C$`.
* And as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$C$`.
* And thus `$D$`, `$L$`, `$E$` are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$E$`, `$O$`, `$F$`, and, further, `$G$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, `$H$` (are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945]) as `$H$`, `$P$`, `$Q$`, `$K$`.
* And the multitude of `$D$`, `$L$`, `$E$` is equal to the multitude of `$E$`, `$O$`, `$F$`, and that of `$G$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, `$H$` to that of `$H$`, `$P$`, `$Q$`, `$K$`.
* Thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$D$` is to `$E$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`, and as `$G$` (is) to `$H$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$K$` [[Prop. 7.14]][bookofproofs$2344].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
