### (Proposition 3 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If there are any multitude whatsoever of [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] (which are) the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them then the outermost of them are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` be any multitude whatsoever of [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] (which are) the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.
* I say that the outermost of them, `$A$` and `$D$`, are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].

### Modern Formulation

If `$\frac AB=\frac BC=\frac CD$` are a [geometric progression][bookofproofs$6552] and the least of these numbers, then `$A$` and `$D$` are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093].
