* For let two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$` and `$B$`, have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which the [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] `$C$` (has) to the [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] `$D$`.
* And let `$A$` be [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* So I say that `$B$` is also [cube][bookofproofs$2327].

* For since `$C$` and `$D$` are cube ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]), `$C$` and `$D$` are (thus) [similar solid (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329].
* Thus, two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] fall (between) `$C$` and `$D$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] [[Prop. 8.19]][bookofproofs$2038].
* And as many ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) as fall in between `$C$` and `$D$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], so many also (fall) in (between) those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them (in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552]) [[Prop. 8.8]][bookofproofs$2027].
* And hence two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] fall (between) `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453].
* Let `$E$` and `$F$` (so) fall.
* Therefore, since the four [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$`, `$E$`, `$F$`, `$B$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and `$A$` is [cube][bookofproofs$2327], `$B$` (is) thus also cube [[Prop. 8.23]][bookofproofs$2042].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
