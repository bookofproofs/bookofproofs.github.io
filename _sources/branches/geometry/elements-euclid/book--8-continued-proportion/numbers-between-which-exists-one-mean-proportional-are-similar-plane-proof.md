* For let one [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$` fall between the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453].
* I say that `$A$` and `$B$` are [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329].

* For let the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$D$` and `$E$`, having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$` and `$C$` have been taken [[Prop. 7.33]][bookofproofs$2363].
* Thus, `$D$` measures `$A$` as many times as `$E$` (measures) `$C$` [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* So as many times as `$D$` measures `$A$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$F$`.
* Thus, `$F$` has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* Hence, `$A$` is plane, and `$D$`, `$F$` (are) its sides.
* Again, since `$D$` and `$E$` are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$C$` and `$B$`, `$D$` thus measures `$C$` as many times as `$E$` (measures) `$B$` [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* So as many times as `$E$` measures `$B$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$G$`.
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$B$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$G$`.
* Thus, `$G$` has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* Thus, `$B$` is plane, and `$E$`, `$G$` are its sides.
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` are (both) plane [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
* So I say that (they are) also similar.
* For since `$F$` has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`, and has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`, thus as `$D$` is to `$E$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$C$` - that is to say, `$C$` to `$B$`[^1] [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* Again, since `$E$` has made `$C$`, `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`, `$G$`, respectively, thus as `$F$` is to `$G$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$B$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And as `$C$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$`.
* And thus as `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$G$`.
* And, alternately, as `$D$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$G$` [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343].
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` are [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329].
* For their sides are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [ [Def. 7.21] ][bookofproofs$2329].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: This part of the proof is defective, since it is not demonstrated that `$F\times E = C$`. Furthermore, it is not necessary to show that `$D/E=A/C$`, because this is true by hypothesis (translator's note).
