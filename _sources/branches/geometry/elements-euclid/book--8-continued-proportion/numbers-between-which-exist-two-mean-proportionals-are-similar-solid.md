### (Proposition 21 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] fall between two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] then the (latter) are [similar solid (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329].
* For let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$` and `$D$` fall between the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453].
* I say that `$A$` and `$B$` are [similar solid (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329].
