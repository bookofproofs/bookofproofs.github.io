* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$` be any multitude whatsoever of [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and let `$A$` not measure `$B$`.
* Now, (it is) clear that `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$` do not successively measure one another.
* For `$A$` does not even measure `$B$`.
* So I say that no other (number) will measure any other (number) either.
* For, if possible, let `$A$` measure `$C$`.
* And as many ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) as are `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, let so many of the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$`, have been taken of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` [[Prop. 7.33]][bookofproofs$2363].
* And since `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$` are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, and the multitude of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` is equal to the multitude of `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$`, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$A$` is to `$C$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$H$` [[Prop. 7.14]][bookofproofs$2344].
* And since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$G$`, and `$A$` does not measure `$B$`, `$F$` does not measure `$G$` either [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, `$F$` is not a [unit][bookofproofs$2314].
* For a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] measures all [numbers][bookofproofs$2315].
* And `$F$` and `$H$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 8.3]][bookofproofs$2022] [and thus `$F$` does not measure `$H$`].
* And as `$F$` is to `$H$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$C$`.
* And thus `$A$` does not measure `$C$` either [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* So, similarly, we can show that no other (number) can measure any other (number) either.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
