* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$` be three [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and let the first `$A$` be [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* I say that the third `$C$` is also [square][bookofproofs$2326].

* For since one [number][bookofproofs$2315], `$B$`, is in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$A$` and `$C$`, `$A$` and `$C$` are thus [similar plane (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329] [[Prop. 8.20]][bookofproofs$2039].
* And `$A$` is [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* Thus, `$C$` is also [square][bookofproofs$2326] [ [Def. 7.21] ][bookofproofs$2329].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
