* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [similar solid numbers][bookofproofs$2329], and let `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$` be the sides of `$A$`, and `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$` (the sides) of `$B$`.
* And since similar [solid][bookofproofs$2210] ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) are those having [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] sides [ [Def. 7.21] ][bookofproofs$2329], thus as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$G$`, and as `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$H$`.
* I say that two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] fall (between) `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453], and (that) `$A$` has to `$B$` a [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] with respect to (that) `$C$` (has) to `$F$`, and `$D$` to `$G$`, and, further, `$E$` to `$H$`.

* For let `$C$` make `$K$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`, and let `$F$` make `$L$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$G$`.
* And since `$C$`, `$D$` are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$F$`, `$G$`, and `$K$` is the (number created) from (multiplying) `$C$`, `$D$`, and `$L$` the (number created) from (multiplying) `$F$`, `$G$`, [thus] `$K$` and `$L$` are [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329] [ [Def. 7.21] ][bookofproofs$2329].
* Thus, there exits one [number][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$K$` and `$L$` [[Prop. 8.18]][bookofproofs$2037].
* Let it be `$M$`.
* Thus, `$M$` is the (number created) from (multiplying) `$D$`, `$F$`, as shown in the theorem before this (one).
* And since `$D$` has made `$K$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`, and has made `$M$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`, thus as `$C$` is to `$F$`, so `$K$` (is) to `$M$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* But, as `$K$` (is) to `$M$`, (so) `$M$` (is) to `$L$`.
* Thus, `$K$`, `$M$`, `$L$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$C$` to `$F$`.
* And since as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$G$`, thus, alternately, as `$C$` is to `$F$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$G$` [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343].
* And so, for the same (reasons), as `$D$` (is) to `$G$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$H$`.
* Thus, `$K$`, `$M$`, `$L$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$C$` to `$F$`, and of `$D$` to `$G$`, and, further, of `$E$` to `$H$`.
* So let `$E$`, `$H$` make `$N$`, `$O$`, respectively, [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$M$`.
* And since `$A$` is [solid][bookofproofs$2210], and `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$` are its sides, `$E$` has thus made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] the (number created) from (multiplying) `$C$`, `$D$`.
* And `$K$` is the (number created) from (multiplying) `$C$`, `$D$`.
* Thus, `$E$` has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$K$`.
* And so, for the same (reasons), `$H$` has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$L$`.
* And since `$E$` has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$K$`, but has, in fact, also made `$N$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$M$`, thus as `$K$` is to `$M$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$N$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And as `$K$` (is) to `$M$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$F$`, and `$D$` to `$G$`, and, further, `$E$` to `$H$`.
* And thus as `$C$` (is) to `$F$`, and `$D$` to `$G$`, and `$E$` to `$H$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$N$`.
* Again, since `$E$`, `$H$` have made `$N$`, `$O$`, respectively, [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$M$`, thus as `$E$` is to `$H$`, so `$N$` (is) to `$O$` [[Prop. 7.18]][bookofproofs$2348].
* But, as `$E$` (is) to `$H$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$F$`, and `$D$` to `$G$`.
* And thus as `$C$` (is) to `$F$`, and `$D$` to `$G$`, and `$E$` to `$H$`, so (is) `$A$` to `$N$`, and `$N$` to `$O$`.
* Again, since `$H$` has made `$O$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$M$`, but has, in fact, also made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$L$`, thus as `$M$` (is) to `$L$`, so `$O$` (is) to `$B$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* But, as `$M$` (is) to `$L$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$F$`, and `$D$` to `$G$`, and `$E$` to `$H$`.
* And thus as `$C$` (is) to `$F$`, and `$D$` to `$G$`, and `$E$` to `$H$`, so not only (is) `$O$` to `$B$`, but also `$A$` to `$N$`, and `$N$` to `$O$`.
* Thus,	 `$A$`, `$N$`, `$O$`, `$B$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the aforementioned ratios of the sides.
So I say that `$A$` also has to `$B$` a [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding side - that is to say, with respect to (that) the number `$C$` (has) to `$F$`, or `$D$` to `$G$`, and, further, `$E$` to `$H$`.
* For since `$A$`, `$N$`, `$O$`, `$B$` are four [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], `$A$` thus has to `$B$`	a [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] with respect to (that) `$A$` (has) to `$N$` [ [Def. 5.10] ][bookofproofs$1949].
* But, as `$A$` (is) to `$N$`, so it was shown (is) `$C$` to `$F$`, and `$D$` to `$G$`, and, further, `$E$` to `$H$`.
* And thus `$A$` has to `$B$` a [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding side - that is to say, with respect to (that) the number `$C$` (has) to `$F$`, and `$D$` to `$G$`, and, further, `$E$` to `$H$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
