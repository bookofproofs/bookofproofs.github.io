* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326], and let `$C$` and `$D$` be their sides (respectively).
* And let `$A$` not measure `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` does not measure `$D$` either.

* For if `$C$` measures `$D$` then `$A$` will also measure `$B$` [[Prop. 8.14]][bookofproofs$2033].
* And `$A$` does not measure `$B$`.
* Thus, `$C$` will not measure `$D$` either.
* So, again, let `$C$` not measure `$D$`.
* I say that `$A$` will not measure `$B$` either.
* For if `$A$` measures `$B$` then `$C$` will also measure `$D$` [[Prop. 8.14]][bookofproofs$2033].
* And `$C$` does not measure `$D$`.
* Thus, `$A$` will not measure `$B$` either.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
