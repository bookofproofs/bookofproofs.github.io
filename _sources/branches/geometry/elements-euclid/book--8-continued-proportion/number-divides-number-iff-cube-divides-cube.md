### (Proposition 15 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] measures a(nother) [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] then the side (of the former) will also measure the side (of the latter). And if the side (of a [cube number][bookofproofs$2327]) measures the side (of another [cube number][bookofproofs$2327]) then the (former) [cube (number) ][bookofproofs$2327] will also measure the (latter) [cube (number) ][bookofproofs$2327].

* For let the [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] `$A$` measure the [cube (number) ][bookofproofs$2327] `$B$`, and let `$C$` be the side of `$A$`, and `$D$` (the side) of `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` measures `$D$`.
* And so let `$C$` measure `$D$`.
* I say that `$A$` will also measure `$B$`.
