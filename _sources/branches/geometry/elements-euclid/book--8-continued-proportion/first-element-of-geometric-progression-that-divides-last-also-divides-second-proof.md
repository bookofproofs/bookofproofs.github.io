* For if `$A$` does not measure `$B$` (in a [geometric progression][bookofproofs$6552] `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`), then no other (number) will measure any other (number) either [[Prop. 8.6]][bookofproofs$2025].
* But `$A$` measures `$D$`.
* Thus, `$A$` also measures `$B$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
