### (Corollary to Proposition 2 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So it is clear, from this, that if three [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them then the outermost of them are [square][bookofproofs$2326], and, if four ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]), [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
### Modern Formulation

Obviously, in the geometric progression `$A^nq^i$`, `$i=0,\ldots,n$` with `$q=\frac AB$` ($A$ and `$B$` being [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093]), the first and the last numbers are the powers `$A^n$` and `$B^n.$`
