* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326], and let `$C$` and `$D$` be their sides (respectively).
* And let `$A$` measure `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` also measures `$D$`.

* For let `$C$` make `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`.
* Thus, `$A$`, `$E$`, `$B$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$C$` to `$D$` [[Prop. 8.11]][bookofproofs$2030].
* And since `$A$`, `$E$`, `$B$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and `$A$` measures `$B$`, `$A$` thus also measures `$E$` [[Prop. 8.7]][bookofproofs$2026].
* And as `$A$` is to `$E$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* Thus, `$C$` also measures `$D$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* So, again, let `$C$` measure `$D$`.
* I say that `$A$` also measures `$B$`.
* For similarly, with the same construction, we can show that `$A$`, `$E$`, `$B$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$C$` to `$D$`.
* And since as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$E$`, and `$C$` measures `$D$`, `$A$` thus also measures `$E$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* And `$A$`, `$E$`, `$B$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* Thus, `$A$` also measures `$B$`.
* Thus, if a [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] measures a(nother) [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] then the side (of the former) will also measure the side (of the latter).
* And if the side (of a [square number][bookofproofs$2326]) measures the side (of another [square number][bookofproofs$2326]) then the (former) [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] will also measure the (latter) [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
