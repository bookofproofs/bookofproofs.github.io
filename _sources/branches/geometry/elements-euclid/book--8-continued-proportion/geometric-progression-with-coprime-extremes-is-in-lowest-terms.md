### (Proposition 1 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If there are any multitude whatsoever of [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and the outermost of them are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], then the ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.

* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` be any multitude whatsoever of [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* And let the outermost of them, `$A$` and `$D$`, be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* I say that `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.

### Modern Formulation

This proposition states that if `\(a,p,q\)` are [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] (i.e. a positive integers) and `\(p/q\)` is a common ratio of the [geometric progression][bookofproofs$6552].
`\[a,a\frac pq,a \left(\frac pq\right)^2,\ldots, a \left(\frac pq\right)^n\quad\quad( * )\]`

for some `\(n\)` such that `\(a \left(\frac pq\right)^n\)` is also  [number][bookofproofs$2315] (i.e. a positive integer), which is [co-prime][bookofproofs$1288] to `\(a\)`, i.e. `\[\gcd\left(a,a \left(\frac pq\right)^n\right)=1,\]` then the numbers in the geometric progression `\( ( * ) \)` are the lowest possible with these properties (i.e. having the same common ratio `\(p/q\)` and having `\(a \left(\frac pq\right)^n\)` and `\(a\)` co-prime to each other).
