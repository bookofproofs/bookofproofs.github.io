* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329].
* And let the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$`, `$D$` be the sides of `$A$`, and `$E$`, `$F$` (the sides) of `$B$`.
* And since similar [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are those having [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] sides [ [Def. 7.21] ][bookofproofs$2329], thus as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
* Therefore, I say that there exists one [number][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$A$` and `$B$`, and that `$A$` has to `$B$` a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] with respect to that `$C$` (has) to `$E$`, or `$D$` to `$F$` - that is to say, with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding [side].

* For since as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`, thus, alternately, as `$C$` is to `$E$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$F$` [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343].
* And since `$A$` is plane, and `$C$`, `$D$` its sides, `$D$` has thus made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`.
* And so, for the same (reasons), `$E$` has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`.
* So let `$D$` make `$G$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`.
* And since `$D$` has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`, and has made `$G$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`, thus as `$C$` is to `$E$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$G$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* But as `$C$` (is) to `$E$`, [so] `$D$` (is) to `$F$`.
* And thus as `$D$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$G$`.
* Again, since `$E$` has made `$G$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`, and has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`, thus as `$D$` is to `$F$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$B$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And it was also shown that as `$D$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$G$`.
* And thus as `$A$` (is) to `$G$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$B$`.
* Thus, `$A$`, `$G$`, `$B$` are continously [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, there exists one [number][bookofproofs$2315] (namely, `$G$`) in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$A$` and `$B$`.
* So I say that `$A$` also has to `$B$` a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding side - that is to say, with respect to (that) `$C$` (has) to `$E$`, or `$D$` to `$F$`.
* For since `$A$`, `$G$`, `$B$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], `$A$` has to `$B$` a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] with respect to (that `$A$` has) to `$G$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
* And as `$A$` is to `$G$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$E$`, and `$D$` to `$F$`.
* And thus `$A$` has to `$B$` a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] with respect to (that) `$C$` (has) to `$E$`, or `$D$` to `$F$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
