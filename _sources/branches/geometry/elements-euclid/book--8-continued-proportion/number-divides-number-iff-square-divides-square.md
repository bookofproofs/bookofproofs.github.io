### (Proposition 14 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] measures a(nother) [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] then the side (of the former) will also measure the side (of the latter). And if the side (of a [square number][bookofproofs$2326]) measures the side (of another [square number][bookofproofs$2326]) then the (former) [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] will also measure the (latter) [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326].

* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326], and let `$C$` and `$D$` be their sides (respectively).
* And let `$A$` measure `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` also measures `$D$`.
* So, again, let `$C$` measure `$D$`.
* I say that `$A$` also measures `$B$`.
