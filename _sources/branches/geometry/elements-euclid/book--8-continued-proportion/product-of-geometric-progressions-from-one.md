### (Proposition 10 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If (some) [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] fall between each of two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] and a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] then, as many ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) as fall between each of the (two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) and the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], so many ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) will also fall in between the (two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) themselves in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* For let the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$`, `$E$` and `$F$`, `$G$` fall between the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively) and the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$C$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* I say that, as many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] as have fallen between each of `$A$` and `$B$` and the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$C$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], so many will also fall in between `$A$` and `$B$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
