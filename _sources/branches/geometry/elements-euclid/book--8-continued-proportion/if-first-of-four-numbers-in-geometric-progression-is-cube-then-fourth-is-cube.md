### (Proposition 23 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If four [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and the first is [cube][bookofproofs$2327], then the fourth will also be [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` be four [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and let `$A$` be [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
* I say that `$D$` is also [cube][bookofproofs$2327].
