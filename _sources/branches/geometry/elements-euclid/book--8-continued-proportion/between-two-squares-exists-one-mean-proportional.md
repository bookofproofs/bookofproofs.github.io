### (Proposition 11 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> There exists one [number][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to two (given)[^1] [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326]. And (one) [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] has to the (other) [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] a squared[^2] ratio with respect to (that) the side (of the former has) to the side (of the latter).
* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326], and let `$C$` be the side of `$A$`, and `$D$` (the side) of `$B$`.
* I say that there exists one [number][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$A$` and `$B$`, and that `$A$` has to `$B$` a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] with respect to (that) `$C$` (has) to `$D$`.
* So I say that `$A$` also has to `$B$` a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] with respect to (that) `$C$` (has) to `$D$`.

### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)

[^1]: In other words, given two [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326], their [geometric mean][bookofproofs$6453] is a [number][bookofproofs$2315] (i.e. a positive integer). 


[^2]: Literally, "double" (translator's note).
