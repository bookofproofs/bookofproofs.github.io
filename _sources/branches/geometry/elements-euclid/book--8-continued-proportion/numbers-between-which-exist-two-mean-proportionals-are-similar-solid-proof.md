* For let the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$` and `$D$` fall between the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453].
* I say that `$A$` and `$B$` are [similar solid (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329].

* For let the three least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$` having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$C$`, `$D$` have been taken [[Prop. 8.2]][bookofproofs$2021].
* Thus, the outermost of them, `$E$` and `$G$`, are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 8.3]][bookofproofs$2022].
* And since one [number][bookofproofs$2315], `$F$`, has fallen (between) `$E$` and `$G$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453], `$E$` and `$G$` are thus [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329] [[Prop. 8.20]][bookofproofs$2039].
* Therefore, let `$H$`, `$K$` be the sides of `$E$`, and `$L$`, `$M$` (the sides) of `$G$`.
* Thus, it is clear from the (proposition) before this (one) that `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$H$` to `$L$`, and of `$K$` to `$M$`.
* And since `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$` are the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, and the multitude of `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$` is equal to the multitude of `$A$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$E$` is to `$G$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$D$` [[Prop. 7.14]][bookofproofs$2344].
* And `$E$` and `$G$` (are) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]), and prime ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) are also the least (of those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them) [[Prop. 7.21]][bookofproofs$2351], and the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser - that is to say, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$E$` measures `$A$` the same number of times as `$G$` (measures) `$D$`.
* So as many times as `$E$` measures `$A$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$N$`.
* Thus, `$N$` has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* And `$E$` is the (number created) from (multiplying) `$H$` and `$K$`.
* Thus, `$N$` has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] the (number created) from (multiplying) `$H$` and `$K$`.
* Thus, `$A$` is [solid][bookofproofs$2210], and its sides are `$H$`, `$K$`, `$N$`.
* Again, since `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$` are the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$C$`, `$D$`, `$B$`, thus `$E$` measures `$C$` the same number of times as `$G$` (measures) `$B$` [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* So as many times as `$E$` measures `$C$`, so many [units][bookofproofs$2314] let there be in `$O$`.
* Thus, `$G$` measures `$B$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$O$`.
* Thus, `$O$` has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$G$`.
* And `$G$` is the (number created) from (multiplying) `$L$` and `$M$`.
* Thus, `$O$` has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] the (number created) from (multiplying) `$L$` and `$M$`.
* Thus, `$B$` is [solid][bookofproofs$2210], and its sides are `$L$`, `$M$`, `$O$`.
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` are (both) [solid][bookofproofs$2210].
* So I say that (they are) also similar.
* For since `$N$`, `$O$` have made `$A$`, `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`, thus as `$N$` is to `$O$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$C$` - that is to say, `$E$` to `$F$` [[Prop. 7.18]][bookofproofs$2348].
* But, as `$E$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$L$`, and `$K$` to `$M$`.
* And thus as `$H$` (is) to `$L$`, so `$K$` (is) to `$M$`, and `$N$` to `$O$`.
* And `$H$`, `$K$`, `$N$` are the sides of `$A$`, and `$L$`, `$M$`, `$O$` the sides of `$B$`.
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` are [similar solid numbers][bookofproofs$2329] [ [Def. 7.21] ][bookofproofs$2329].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
