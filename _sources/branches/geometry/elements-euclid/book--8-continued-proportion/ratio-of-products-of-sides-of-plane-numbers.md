### (Proposition 5 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Plane [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] have to one another the ratio compounded[^1] out of (the ratios of) their sides.
* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be plane [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], and let the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$`, `$D$` be the sides of `$A$`, and (the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) `$E$`, `$F$` (the sides) of `$B$`.
* I say that `$A$` has to `$B$` the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) their sides.

### Modern Formulation

If `$A=CD$` and `$B=EF$` then `$\frac AB=\frac CE\cdot \frac DF.$`
