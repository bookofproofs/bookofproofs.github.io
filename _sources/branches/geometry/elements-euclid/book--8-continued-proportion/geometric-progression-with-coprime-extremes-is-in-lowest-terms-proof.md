* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` be any multitude whatsoever of [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* And let the outermost of them, `$A$` and `$D$`, be [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* I say that `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.
* For if not, let `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$` be less than `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` (respectively), being in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.
* And since `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$`, and the multitude [of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`] is equal to the multitude [of `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$`], thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$A$` is to `$D$`, (so) `$E$` (is) to `$H$` [[Prop. 7.14]][bookofproofs$2344].
* And `$A$` and `$D$` (are) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]).
* And prime ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are) also the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them) [[Prop. 7.21]][bookofproofs$2351].
* And the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] (as them) an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser - that is to say, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$A$` measures `$E$`, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$`, being less than `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, are not in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.
* Thus, `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
