* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] (which are) [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], and let the ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) `$C$` and `$D$` fall in between them in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* And let the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` be set out.
* I say that, as many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] as have fallen in between `$A$` and `$B$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], so many ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) will also fall between each of `$A$` and `$B$` and the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].

* For let the least two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$F$` and `$G$`, which are in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$A$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$B$`, have been taken [[Prop. 7.33]][bookofproofs$2363].
* And the (least) three ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]), `$H$`, `$K$`, `$L$`.
* And so on, successively increasing by one, until the multitude of the (least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] taken) is made equal to the multitude of `$A$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$B$` [[Prop. 8.2]][bookofproofs$2021].
* Let them have been taken, and let them be `$M$`, `$N$`, `$O$`, `$P$`.
* So (it is) clear that `$F$` has made `$H$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and has made `$M$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$H$`.
* And `$G$` has made `$L$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and has made `$P$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$L$` [ [Prop. 8.2 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6456].
* And since `$M$`, `$N$`, `$O$`, `$P$` are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$F$`, `$G$`, and `$A$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$B$` are also the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$F$`, `$G$` [[Prop. 8.2]][bookofproofs$2021], and the multitude of `$M$`, `$N$`, `$O$`, `$P$` is equal to the multitude of `$A$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$B$`, thus `$M$`, `$N$`, `$O$`, `$P$` are equal to `$A$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$B$`, respectively.
* Thus, `$M$` is equal to `$A$`, and `$P$` to `$B$`.
* And since `$F$` has made `$H$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, `$F$` thus measures `$H$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$F$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` also measures `$F$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it.
* Thus, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` measures the number `$F$` as many times as `$F$` (measures) `$H$`.
* Thus, as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` is to the number `$F$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$H$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* Again, since `$F$` has made `$M$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$H$`, `$H$` thus measures `$M$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$F$` [ [Def. 7.15] ][bookofproofs$6437].
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` also measures the number `$F$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in it.
* Thus, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` measures the number `$F$` as many times as `$H$` (measures) `$M$`.
* Thus, as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` is to the number `$F$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$M$` [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* And it was shown that as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` (is) to the number `$F$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$H$`.
* And thus as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` (is) to the number `$F$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$H$`, and `$H$` (is) to `$M$`.
* And `$M$` (is) equal to `$A$`.
* Thus, as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` is to the number `$F$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$H$`, and `$H$` to `$A$`.
* And so, for the same (reasons), as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` (is) to the number `$G$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$L$`, and `$L$` to `$B$`.
* Thus, as many ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) as have fallen in between `$A$` and `$B$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], so many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] have also fallen between each of `$A$` and `$B$` and the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
