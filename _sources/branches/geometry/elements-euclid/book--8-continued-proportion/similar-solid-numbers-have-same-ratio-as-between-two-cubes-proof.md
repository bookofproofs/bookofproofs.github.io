* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [similar solid numbers][bookofproofs$2329].
* I say that `$A$` has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] (has) to a(nother) [cube number][bookofproofs$2327].

* For since `$A$` and `$B$` are [similar solid (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329], two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] thus fall (between) `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] [[Prop. 8.19]][bookofproofs$2038].
* Let `$C$` and `$D$` have (so) fallen.
* And let the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$`, having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$B$`, (and) equal in multitude to them, have been taken [[Prop. 8.2]][bookofproofs$2021].
* Thus, the outermost of them, `$E$` and `$H$`, are cube [ [Prop. 8.2 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6456].
* And as `$E$` is to `$H$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$`.
* And thus `$A$` has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] (has) to a(nother) [cube number][bookofproofs$2327].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
