### (Proposition 20 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If one [number][bookofproofs$2315] falls between two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] then the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] will be [similar plane (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329].
* For let one [number][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$` fall between the two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453].
* I say that `$A$` and `$B$` are [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329].
