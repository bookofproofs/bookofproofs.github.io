### (Proposition 2 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], as many as may be prescribed, (which are) in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in a given [ratio][bookofproofs$1943].
* Let the given [ratio][bookofproofs$1943], (expressed) in the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], be that of `$A$` to `$B$`.
* So it is required to find the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], as many as may be prescribed, (which are) in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$A$` to `$B$`.

### Modern Formulation

If `$q:=\frac AB$` is a reduced ratio, i.e. `$A,B$` are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093], then 

* `$C=A^2,$`
* `$D=AB=A^2q,$`
* `$E=B^2=A^2q^2.$`

It follows `$\frac CD=\frac DE=\frac AB.$` 

* `$F=A^3,$`
* `$G=A^2B=A^3q,$`
* `$H=AB^2=A^3q^2,$`
* `$K=B^3=A^3q^3.$`

It follows `$\frac FG=\frac GH=\frac HK=\frac AB.$`

And so forth with the numbers `$A^n,A^nq,\ldots,A^nq^n.$`
