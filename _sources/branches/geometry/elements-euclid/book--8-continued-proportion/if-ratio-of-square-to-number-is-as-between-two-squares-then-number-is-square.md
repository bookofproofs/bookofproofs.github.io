### (Proposition 24 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)


> If two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which a [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to a(nother) [square number][bookofproofs$2326], and the first is square, then the second will also be [square][bookofproofs$2326].

* For let two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$` and `$B$`, have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which the [square number][bookofproofs$2326] `$C$` (has) to the [square number][bookofproofs$2326] `$D$`.
* And let `$A$` be [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* I say that `$B$` is also [square][bookofproofs$2326].
