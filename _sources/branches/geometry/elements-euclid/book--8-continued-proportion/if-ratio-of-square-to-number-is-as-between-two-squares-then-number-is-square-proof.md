* For let two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$` and `$B$`, have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which the [square number][bookofproofs$2326] `$C$` (has) to the [square number][bookofproofs$2326] `$D$`.
* And let `$A$` be [square][bookofproofs$2326].
* I say that `$B$` is also [square][bookofproofs$2326].

* For since `$C$` and `$D$` are square, `$C$` and `$D$` are thus [similar plane (numbers) ][bookofproofs$2329].
* Thus, one [number][bookofproofs$2315] falls (between) `$C$` and `$D$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] [[Prop. 8.18]][bookofproofs$2037].
* And as `$C$` is to `$D$`, (so) `$A$` (is) to `$B$`.
* Thus, one [number][bookofproofs$2315] also falls (between) `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] [[Prop. 8.8]][bookofproofs$2027].
* And `$A$` is square.
* Thus, `$B$` is also [square][bookofproofs$2326] [[Prop. 8.22]][bookofproofs$2041].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
