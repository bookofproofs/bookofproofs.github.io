* For as many as `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` are in multitude, let so many of the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$L$`, having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, have been taken [[Prop. 7.33]][bookofproofs$2363].
* Thus, the outermost of them, `$G$` and `$L$`, are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 8.3]][bookofproofs$2022].
* And since `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$L$`, and the multitude of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` is equal to the multitude of `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$L$`, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$L$` [[Prop. 7.14]][bookofproofs$2344].
* And as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
* And thus as `$G$` (is) to `$L$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
* And `$G$` and `$L$` (are) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288]).
* And ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) [prime (to one another][bookofproofs$1288] are) also the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them) [[Prop. 7.21]][bookofproofs$2351].
* And the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] (as them) an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser - that is to say, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$G$` measures `$E$` the same number of times as `$L$` (measures) `$F$`.
* So as many times as `$G$` measures `$E$`, so many times let `$H$`, `$K$` also measure `$M$`, `$N$`, respectively.
* Thus, `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$L$` measure `$E$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, `$F$` (respectively) an equal number of times.
* Thus, `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$L$` are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$E$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, `$F$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* But, `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$L$` are in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$B$`.
* Thus, `$A$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$B$` are also in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$E$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, `$F$`.
* And `$A$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$B$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* Thus, `$E$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, `$F$` are also in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* Thus, as many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] as have fallen in between `$A$` and `$B$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], so many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] have also fallen in between `$E$` and `$F$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
