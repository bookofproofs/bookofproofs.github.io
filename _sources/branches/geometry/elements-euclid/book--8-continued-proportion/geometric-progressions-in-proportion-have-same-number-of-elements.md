### (Proposition 8 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If between two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] there fall (some) [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] then, as many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] as fall in between them in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], so many ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) will also fall in between (any two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] [as them] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].

* For let the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$C$` and `$D$`, fall between two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$` and `$B$`, in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and let it have been contrived (that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
* I say that, as many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] as have fallen in between `$A$` and `$B$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], so many ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) will also fall in between `$E$` and `$F$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].

### Modern Formulation

Given some equal [continued proportions][bookofproofs$6552] e.g. `$\frac AB=\frac EF=\frac GL$` (which we can also write `$B=Aq^n$` , `$F=Eq^n$`, `$L=Gq^n$` for some `$q > 0$` and some positive integer `$n\ge 3$`) there are `$n-1$` numbers falling between each of them, e.g, for `$n=3$`:

* `$C:=Aq, D:=Aq^2$`
* `$M:=Eq, N:=Eq^2$`
* `$H:=Gq, K:=Gq^2$`
