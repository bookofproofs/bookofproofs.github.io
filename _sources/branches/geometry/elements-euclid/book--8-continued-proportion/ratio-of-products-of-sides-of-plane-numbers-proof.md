* For given the ratios which `$C$` has to `$E$`, and `$D$` (has) to `$F$`, let the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the ratios `$C$` `$E$`, `$D$` `$F$` have been taken [[Prop. 8.4]][bookofproofs$2023], so that as `$C$` is to `$E$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$H$`, and as `$D$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$K$`.
* And let `$D$` make `$L$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`.
* And since `$D$` has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`, and has made `$L$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`, thus as `$C$` is to `$E$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$L$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And as `$C$` (is) to `$E$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$H$`.
* And thus as `$G$` (is) to `$H$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$L$`.
* Again, since `$E$` has made `$L$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$` [[Prop. 7.16]][bookofproofs$2346], but, in fact, has also made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`, thus as `$D$` is to `$F$`, so `$L$` (is) to `$B$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* But, as `$D$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$K$`.
* And thus as `$H$` (is) to `$K$`, so `$L$` (is) to `$B$`.
* And it was also shown that as `$G$` (is) to `$H$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$L$`.
* Thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$G$` is to `$K$`, [so] `$A$` (is) to `$B$` [[Prop. 7.14]][bookofproofs$2344].
* And `$G$` has to `$K$` the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) the sides (of `$A$` and `$B$`).
* Thus, `$A$` also has to `$B$` the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) the sides (of `$A$` and `$B$`).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
