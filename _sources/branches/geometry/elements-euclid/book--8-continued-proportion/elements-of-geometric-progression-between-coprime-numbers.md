### (Proposition 9 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] and there fall in between them (some) [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] then, as many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] as fall in between them in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], so many ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) will also fall between each of them and a [unit][bookofproofs$2314] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].

* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] (which are) [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], and let the ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) `$C$` and `$D$` fall in between them in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* And let the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$E$` be set out.
* I say that, as many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] as have fallen in between `$A$` and `$B$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], so many ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) will also fall between each of `$A$` and `$B$` and the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
