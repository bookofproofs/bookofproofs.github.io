* For let the least number, `$G$`, measured by (both) `$B$` and `$C$` have be taken [[Prop. 7.34]][bookofproofs$2364].
* And as many times as `$B$` measures `$G$`, so many times let `$A$` also measure `$H$`.
* And as many times as `$C$` measures `$G$`, so many times let `$D$` also measure `$K$`.
* And `$E$` either measures, or does not measure, `$K$`.
* Let it, first of all, measure ($K$).
* And as many times as `$E$` measures `$K$`, so many times let `$F$` also measure `$L$`.
* And since `$A$` measures `$H$` the same number of times that `$B$` also (measures) `$G$`, thus as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$G$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328], [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343].
* And so, for the same (reasons), as `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$K$`, and, further, as `$E$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$K$` (is) to `$L$`.
* Thus, `$H$`, `$G$`, `$K$`, `$L$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$A$` to `$B$`, and of `$C$` to `$D$`, and, further, of `$E$` to `$F$`.
* So I say that (they are) also the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in these ratios).
* For if `$H$`, `$G$`, `$K$`, `$L$` are not the least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the ratios of `$A$` to `$B$`, and of `$C$` to `$D$`, and of `$E$` to `$F$`, let `$N$`, `$O$`, `$M$`, `$P$` be (the least such [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]).
* And since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$N$` (is) to `$O$`, and `$A$` and `$B$` are the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] which have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them), and the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] (as them) an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser - that is to say, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350], `$B$` thus measures `$O$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$C$` also measures `$O$`.
* Thus, `$B$` and `$C$` (both) measure `$O$`.
* Thus, the least number measured by (both) `$B$` and `$C$` will also measure `$O$` [[Prop. 7.35]][bookofproofs$2365].
* And `$G$` (is) the least number measured by (both) `$B$` and `$C$`.
* Thus, `$G$` measures `$O$`, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, there cannot be any [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] less than `$H$`, `$G$`, `$K$`, `$L$` (which are) continuously ([proportional][bookofproofs$2328]) in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$A$` to `$B$`, and of `$C$` to `$D$`, and, further, of `$E$` to `$F$`.
* So let `$E$` not measure `$K$`.
* And let the least number, `$M$`, measured by (both) `$E$` and `$K$` have been taken [[Prop. 7.34]][bookofproofs$2364].
* And as many times as `$K$` measures `$M$`, so many times let `$H$`, `$G$` also measure `$N$`, `$O$`, respectively.
* And as many times as `$E$` measures `$M$`, so many times let `$F$` also measure `$P$`.
* Since `$H$` measures `$N$` the same number of times as `$G$` (measures) `$O$`, thus as `$H$` is to `$G$`, so `$N$` (is) to `$O$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328], [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343].
* And as `$H$` (is) to `$G$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$`.
* And thus as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$N$` (is) to `$O$`.
* And so, for the same (reasons), as `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$O$` (is) to `$M$`.
* Again, since `$E$` measures `$M$` the same number of times as `$F$` (measures) `$P$`, thus as `$E$` is to `$F$`, so `$M$` (is) to `$P$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328], [[Prop. 7.13]][bookofproofs$2343].
* Thus, `$N$`, `$O$`, `$M$`, `$P$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the ratios of `$A$` to `$B$`, and of `$C$` to `$D$`, and, further, of `$E$` to `$F$`.
* So I say that (they are) also the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) in the ratios of `$A$` `$B$`, `$C$` `$D$`, `$E$` `$F$`.
* For if not, then there will be some [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] less than `$N$`, `$O$`, `$M$`, `$P$` (which are) in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the ratios of `$A$` `$B$`, `$C$` `$D$`, `$E$` `$F$`.
* Let them be `$Q$`, `$R$`, `$S$`, `$T$`.
* And since as `$Q$` is to `$R$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, and `$A$` and `$B$` (are) the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them), and the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) measure those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them an equal number of times, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350], `$B$` thus measures `$R$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), `$C$` also measures `$R$`.
* Thus, `$B$` and `$C$` (both) measure `$R$`.
* Thus, the least (number) measured by (both) `$B$` and `$C$` will also measure `$R$` [[Prop. 7.35]][bookofproofs$2365].
* And `$G$` is the least number measured by (both) `$B$` and `$C$`.
* Thus, `$G$` measures `$R$`.
* And as `$G$` is to `$R$`, so `$K$` (is) to `$S$`.
* Thus, `$K$` also measures `$S$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* And `$E$` also measures `$S$` [[Prop. 7.20]][bookofproofs$2350].
* Thus, `$E$` and `$K$` (both) measure `$S$`.
* Thus, the least (number) measured by (both) `$E$` and `$K$` will also measure `$S$` [[Prop. 7.35]][bookofproofs$2365].
* And `$M$` is the least (number) measured by (both) `$E$` and `$K$`.
* Thus, `$M$` measures `$S$`, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus there cannot be any [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] less than `$N$`, `$O$`, `$M$`, `$P$` (which are) in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the ratios of `$A$` to `$B$`, and of `$C$` to `$D$`, and, further, of `$E$` to `$F$`.
* Thus, `$N$`, `$O$`, `$M$`, `$P$` are the least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the ratios of `$A$` `$B$`, `$C$` `$D$`, `$E$` `$F$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
