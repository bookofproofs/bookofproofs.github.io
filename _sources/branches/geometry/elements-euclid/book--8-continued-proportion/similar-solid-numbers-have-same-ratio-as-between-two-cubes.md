### Euclid's Formulation

> [Similar solid numbers][bookofproofs$2329] have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] (has) to a(nother) [cube number][bookofproofs$2327].
* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [similar solid numbers][bookofproofs$2329].
* I say that `$A$` has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] (has) to a(nother) [cube number][bookofproofs$2327].
