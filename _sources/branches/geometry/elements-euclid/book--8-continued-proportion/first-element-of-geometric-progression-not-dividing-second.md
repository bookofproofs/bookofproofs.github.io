### (Proposition 6 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If there are any multitude whatsoever of [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and the first does not measure the second, then no other (number) will measure any other (number) either.

* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$` be any multitude whatsoever of [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and let `$A$` not measure `$B$`.
* I say that no other (number) will measure any other (number) either.

### Modern Formulation

If `$A,B,C,D,E$` are given with `$B=An,$` `$C=An^2,$` `$D=An^3,$` `$E=An^4,$` and `$n$` is not a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075], then `$A$` is not a [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of `$B.$` In this [geometric progression][bookofproofs$6552], none of the numbers will be a [multiple][bookofproofs$700] of any of the proceeding numbers.
