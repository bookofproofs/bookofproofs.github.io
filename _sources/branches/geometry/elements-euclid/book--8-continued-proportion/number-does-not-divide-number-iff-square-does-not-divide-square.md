### (Proposition 16 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If a [square number][bookofproofs$2326] does not measure a(nother) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] then the side (of the former) will not measure the side (of the latter) either. And if the side (of a [square number][bookofproofs$2326]) does not measure the side (of another [square number][bookofproofs$2326]) then the (former) [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] will not measure the (latter) [square (number) ][bookofproofs$2326] either.
* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326], and let `$C$` and `$D$` be their sides (respectively).
* And let `$A$` not measure `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` does not measure `$D$` either.
* So, again, let `$C$` not measure `$D$`.
* I say that `$A$` will not measure `$B$` either.
