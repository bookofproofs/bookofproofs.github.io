* For let the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$D$`, `$E$` and `$F$`, `$G$` fall between the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$A$` and `$B$` (respectively) and the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$C$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* I say that, as many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] as have fallen between each of `$A$` and `$B$` and the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$C$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], so many will also fall in between `$A$` and `$B$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].

* For let `$D$` make `$H$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`.
* And let `$D$`, `$F$` make `$K$`, `$L$`, respectively, [by multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$H$`.
* As since as the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$C$` is to the number `$D$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$C$` thus measures the number `$D$` as many times as `$D$` (measures) `$E$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$C$` measures the number `$D$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$D$`.
* Thus, the number `$D$` also measures `$E$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$D$`.
* Thus, `$D$` has made `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* Again, since as the [[unit][bookofproofs$2314]] `$C$` is to the number `$D$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$A$`, the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$C$` thus measures the number `$D$` as many times as `$E$` (measures) `$A$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* And the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$C$` measures the number `$D$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$D$`.
* Thus, `$E$` also measures `$A$` according to the [units][bookofproofs$2314] in `$D$`.
* Thus, `$D$` has made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`.
* And so, for the same (reasons), `$F$` has made `$G$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$G$`.
* And since `$D$` has made `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and has made `$H$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`, thus as `$D$` is to `$F$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$H$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And so, for the same reasons, as `$D$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$G$` [[Prop. 7.18]][bookofproofs$2348].
* And thus as `$E$` (is) to `$H$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$G$`.
* Again, since `$D$` has made `$A$`, `$K$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`, `$H$`, respectively, thus as `$E$` is to `$H$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$K$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* But, as `$E$` (is) to `$H$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$F$`.
* And thus as `$D$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$K$`.
* Again, since `$D$`, `$F$` have made `$K$`, `$L$`, respectively, [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$H$`, thus as `$D$` is to `$F$`, so `$K$` (is) to `$L$` [[Prop. 7.18]][bookofproofs$2348].
* But, as `$D$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$K$`.
* And thus as `$A$` (is) to `$K$`, so `$K$` (is) to `$L$`.
* Further, since `$F$` has made `$L$`, `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$H$`, `$G$`, respectively, thus as `$H$` is to `$G$`, so `$L$` (is) to `$B$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And as `$H$` (is) to `$G$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$F$`.
* And thus as `$D$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$L$` (is) to `$B$`.
* And it was also shown that as `$D$` (is) to `$F$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$K$`, and `$K$` to `$L$`.
* And thus as `$A$` (is) to `$K$`, so `$K$` (is) to `$L$`, and `$L$` to `$B$`.
* Thus, `$A$`, `$K$`, `$L$`, `$B$` are successively in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* Thus, as many [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] as fall between each of `$A$` and `$B$` and the [unit][bookofproofs$2314] `$C$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], so many will also fall in between `$A$` and `$B$` in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
