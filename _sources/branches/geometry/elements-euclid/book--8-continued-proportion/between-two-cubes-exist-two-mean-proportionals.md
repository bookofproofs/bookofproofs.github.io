### (Proposition 12 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> There exist two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to two (given)[^1] [cube numbers][bookofproofs$2327]. And (one) [cube (number) ][bookofproofs$2327] has to the (other) [cube (number) ][bookofproofs$2327] a cubed[^2] ratio with respect to (that) the side (of the former has) to the side (of the latter).

* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [cube numbers][bookofproofs$2327], and let `$C$` be the side of `$A$`, and `$D$` (the side) of `$B$`.
* I say that there exist two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$A$` and `$B$`, and that `$A$` has to `$B$` a [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] with respect to (that) `$C$` (has) to `$D$`.
* So I say that `$A$` also has to `$B$` a [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] with respect to (that) `$C$` (has) to `$D$`.

### Modern Formulation

(not yet contributed)

[^1]: In other words, between two given [cube numbers][bookofproofs$2327] there exist two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in continued proportion (translator's note).

[^2]: Literally, "triple" (translator's note).
