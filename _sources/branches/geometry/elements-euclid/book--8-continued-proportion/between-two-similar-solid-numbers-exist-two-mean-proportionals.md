### (Proposition 19 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] fall (between) two [similar solid numbers][bookofproofs$2329] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453]. And a [solid (number) ][bookofproofs$2325] has to a similar [solid (number) ][bookofproofs$2325] a cubed[^1] ratio with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding side.

* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [similar solid numbers][bookofproofs$2329], and let `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$` be the sides of `$A$`, and `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$` (the sides) of `$B$`.
* And since similar [solid][bookofproofs$2210] ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) are those having [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] sides [ [Def. 7.21] ][bookofproofs$2329], thus as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$G$`, and as `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$H$`.
* I say that two [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] fall (between) `$A$` and `$B$` in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453], and (that) `$A$` has to `$B$` a [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] with respect to (that) `$C$` (has) to `$F$`, and `$D$` to `$G$`, and, further, `$E$` to `$H$`.
