* For let the [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] `$A$` measure the [cube (number) ][bookofproofs$2327] `$B$`, and let `$C$` be the side of `$A$`, and `$D$` (the side) of `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` measures `$D$`.

* For let `$C$` make `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* And let `$D$` make `$G$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* And, further, [let] `$C$` [make] `$F$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`, and let `$C$`, `$D$` make `$H$`, `$K$`, respectively, [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$F$`.
* So it is clear that `$E$`, `$F$`, `$G$` and `$A$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$B$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$C$` to `$D$` [[Prop. 8.12]][bookofproofs$2031].
* And since `$A$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$B$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and `$A$` measures `$B$`, ($A$) thus also measures `$H$` [[Prop. 8.7]][bookofproofs$2026].
* And as `$A$` is to `$H$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* Thus, `$C$` also measures `$D$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* And so let `$C$` measure `$D$`.
* I say that `$A$` will also measure `$B$`.
* For similarly, with the same construction, we can show that `$A$`, `$H$`, `$K$`, `$B$` are in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$C$` to `$D$`.
* And since `$C$` measures `$D$`, and as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$H$`, `$A$` thus also measures `$H$` [ [Def. 7.20] ][bookofproofs$2328].
* Hence, `$A$` also measures `$B$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
