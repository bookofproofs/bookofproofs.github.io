### Euclid's Formulation

> [Similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329] have to one another the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to a(nother) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].

* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329].
* I say that `$A$` has to `$B$` the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] which (some) [square number][bookofproofs$2326] (has) to a(nother) [square number][bookofproofs$2326].
