* For let the [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] `$A$` not measure the [cube number][bookofproofs$2327] `$B$`.
* And let `$C$` be the side of `$A$`, and `$D$` (the side) of `$B$`.
* I say that `$C$` will not measure `$D$`.

* For if `$C$` measures `$D$` then `$A$` will also measure `$B$` [[Prop. 8.15]][bookofproofs$2034].
* And `$A$` does not measure `$B$`.
* Thus, `$C$` does not measure `$D$` either.
* And so let `$C$` not measure `$D$`.
* I say that `$A$` will not measure `$B$` either.
* For if `$A$` measures `$B$` then `$C$` will also measure `$D$` [[Prop. 8.15]][bookofproofs$2034].
* And `$C$` does not measure `$D$`.
* Thus, `$A$` will not measure `$B$` either.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
