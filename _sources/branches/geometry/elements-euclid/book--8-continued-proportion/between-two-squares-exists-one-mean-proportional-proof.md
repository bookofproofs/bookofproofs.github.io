* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [square numbers][bookofproofs$2326], and let `$C$` be the side of `$A$`, and `$D$` (the side) of `$B$`.
* I say that there exists one [number][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$A$` and `$B$`, and that `$A$` has to `$B$` a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] with respect to (that) `$C$` (has) to `$D$`.

* For let `$C$` make `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`.
* And since `$A$` is square, and `$C$` is its side, `$C$` has thus made `$A$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* And so, for the same (reasons), `$D$` has made `$B$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* Therefore, since `$C$` has made `$A$`, `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`, `$D$`, respectively, thus as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$A$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And so, for the same (reasons), as `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$B$` [[Prop. 7.18]][bookofproofs$2348].
* And thus as `$A$` (is) to `$E$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$B$`.
* Thus, one [number][bookofproofs$2315] (namely, `$E$`) is in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$A$` and `$B$`.
* So I say that `$A$` also has to `$B$` a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] with respect to (that) `$C$` (has) to `$D$`.
* For since `$A$`, `$E$`, `$B$` are three in [ (continued) proportion][bookofproofs$6552] [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], `$A$` thus has to `$B$` a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] with respect to (that) `$A$` (has) to `$E$` [ [Def. 5.9] ][bookofproofs$1948].
* And as `$A$` (is) to `$E$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* Thus, `$A$` has to `$B$` a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] with respect to (that) side `$C$` (has) to (side) `$D$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
