### (Proposition 18 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> There exists one [number][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to two [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329]. And (one) plane (number) has to the (other) plane (number) a squared[^1] ratio with respect to (that) a corresponding side (of the former has) to a corresponding side (of the latter).

* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be two [similar plane numbers][bookofproofs$2329].
* And let the [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] `$C$`, `$D$` be the sides of `$A$`, and `$E$`, `$F$` (the sides) of `$B$`.
* And since similar [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] are those having [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] sides [ [Def. 7.21] ][bookofproofs$2329], thus as `$C$` is to `$D$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
* Therefore, I say that there exists one [number][bookofproofs$2315] in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$6453] to `$A$` and `$B$`, and that `$A$` has to `$B$` a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] with respect to that `$C$` (has) to `$E$`, or `$D$` to `$F$` - that is to say, with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding [side].
