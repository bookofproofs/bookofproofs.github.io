* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` be any multitude whatsoever of [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] (which are) the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them.
* I say that the outermost of them, `$A$` and `$D$`, are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* For let the two least ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) `$E$`, `$F$` (which are) in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` have been taken [[Prop. 7.33]][bookofproofs$2363].
* And the three (least [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$` [[Prop. 8.2]][bookofproofs$2021].
* And (so on), successively increasing by one, until the multitude of ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) taken is made equal to the multitude of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`.
* Let them have been taken, and let them be `$L$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, `$O$`.
* And since `$E$` and `$F$` are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them they are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 7.22]][bookofproofs$2352].
* And since `$E$`, `$F$` have made `$G$`, `$K$`, respectively, [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] themselves [ [Prop. 8.2 corr.] ][bookofproofs$6456], and have made `$L$`, `$O$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$G$`, `$K$`, respectively, `$G$`, `$K$` and `$L$`, `$O$` are thus also [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 7.27]][bookofproofs$2357].
* And since `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them, and `$L$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, `$O$` are also the least (of those [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them), being in the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$`, and the multitude of `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` is equal to the multitude of `$L$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, `$O$`, thus `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` are equal to `$L$`, `$M$`, `$N$`, `$O$`, respectively.
* Thus, `$A$` is equal to `$L$`, and `$D$` to `$O$`.
* And `$L$` and `$O$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* Thus, `$A$` and `$D$` are also [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
