### (Proposition 7 from Book 8 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If there are any multitude whatsoever of [continuously] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [numbers][bookofproofs$2315], and the first measures the last, then (the first) will also measure the second.

* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, `$C$`, `$D$` be any number whatsoever of [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
* And let `$A$` measure `$D$`.
* I say that `$A$` also measures `$B$`.

### Modern Formulation

If `$A,B,C,D,$` etc. is a [geometric progression][bookofproofs$6552], then there exist a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] `$n$` with `$B=An,$` `$C=An^2,$` `$D=An^3,$` etc.
