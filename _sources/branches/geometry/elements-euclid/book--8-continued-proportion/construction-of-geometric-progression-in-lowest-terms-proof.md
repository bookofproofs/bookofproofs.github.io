* Let four ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) have been prescribed.
* And let `$A$` make `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and let it make `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* And, further, let `$B$` make `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself.
* And, further, let `$A$` make `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$`.
* And let `$B$` make `$K$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`.
* And since `$A$` has made `$C$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, and has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`, thus as `$A$` is to `$B$`, [so] `$C$` (is) to `$D$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* Again, since `$A$` has made `$D$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`, and `$B$` has made `$E$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] itself, `$A$`, `$B$` have thus made `$D$`, `$E$`, respectively, [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$B$`.
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$E$` [[Prop. 7.18]][bookofproofs$2348].
* But, as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, (so) `$C$` (is) to `$D$`.
* And thus as `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, (so) `$D$` (is) to `$E$`.
* And since `$A$` has made `$F$`, `$G$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`, `$D$`, thus as `$C$` is to `$D$`, [so] `$F$` (is) to `$G$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* And as `$C$` (is) to `$D$`, so `$A$` was to `$B$`.
* And thus as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, (so) `$F$` (is) to `$G$`.
* Again, since `$A$` has made `$G$`, `$H$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$D$`, `$E$`, thus as `$D$` is to `$E$`, (so) `$G$` (is) to `$H$` [[Prop. 7.17]][bookofproofs$2347].
* But, as `$D$` (is) to `$E$`, (so) `$A$` (is) to `$B$`.
* And thus as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$H$`.
* And since `$A$`, `$B$` have made `$H$`, `$K$` [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$E$`, thus as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$H$` (is) to `$K$`.
* But, as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$F$` (is) to `$G$`, and `$G$` to `$H$`.
* And thus as `$F$` (is) to `$G$`, so `$G$` (is) to `$H$`, and `$H$` to `$K$`.
* Thus, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$` and `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$` are (both continuously) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] in the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of `$A$` to `$B$`.
* So I say that (they are) also the least (sets of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] in that ratio).
* For since `$A$` and `$B$` are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them, and the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 7.22]][bookofproofs$2352], `$A$` and `$B$` are thus [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288].
* And `$A$`, `$B$` have made `$C$`, `$E$`, respectively, [ (by) multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] themselves, and have made `$F$`, `$K$` [by multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] `$C$`, `$E$`, respectively.
* Thus, `$C$`, `$E$` and `$F$`, `$K$` are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288] [[Prop. 7.27]][bookofproofs$2357].
* And if there are any multitude whatsoever of [numbers in continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552], and the outermost of them are [prime to one another][bookofproofs$1288], then the ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) are the least of those ([numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as them [[Prop. 8.1]][bookofproofs$2020].
* Thus, `$C$`, `$D$`, `$E$` and `$F$`, `$G$`, `$H$`, `$K$` are the least of those (in [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] sets of [numbers][bookofproofs$2315]) having the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as `$A$` and `$B$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
