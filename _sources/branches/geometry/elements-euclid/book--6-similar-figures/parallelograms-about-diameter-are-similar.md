### (Proposition 24 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In any [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] about the diagonal are [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the whole, and to one another.
* Let `$ABCD$` be a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], and `$AC$` its diagonal.
* And let `$EG$` and `$HK$` be [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] about `$AC$`.
* I say that the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$EG$` and `$HK$` are each [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the whole ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$ABCD$`, and to one another.

### Modern Formulation

If a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] is divided into four parallelograms, then the two parallelograms lying on the [diagonal][bookofproofs$908] are [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to each other and to the whole parallelogram.
