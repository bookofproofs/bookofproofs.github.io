* So let a third (part) have been prescribed.
* And let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` have been drawn from ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$A$`, encompassing a random angle with `$AB$`.
* And let a random [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` have been taken on `$AC$`.
* And let `$DE$` and `$EC$` be made equal to `$AD$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736].
* And let `$BC$` have been joined.
* And let `$DF$` have been drawn through `$D$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to it [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* Therefore, since `$FD$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one of the sides, `$BC$`, of triangle `$ABC$`, then, proportionally, as `$CD$` is to `$DA$`, so `$BF$` (is) to `$FA$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* And `$CD$` (is) double `$DA$`.
* Thus, `$BF$` (is) also double `$FA$`.
* Thus, `$BA$` (is) triple `$AF$`.
* Thus, the prescribed third part, `$AF$`, has been cut off from the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
