* Let `$DF$` have been joined, and let `$GAB$`, equal to the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$C$`, and `$ABG$`, equal to (angle) `$CDF$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` at the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` and `$B$` on it (respectively) [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$CFD$` is equal to `$AGB$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, triangle `$FCD$` is equiangular to triangle `$GAB$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as `$FD$` is to `$GB$`, so `$FC$` (is) to `$GA$`, and `$CD$` to `$AB$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* Again, let `$BGH$`, equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DFE$`, and `$GBH$` equal to (angle) `$FDE$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BG$` at the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$G$` and `$B$` on it (respectively) [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] at `$E$` is equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] at `$H$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, triangle `$FDE$` is equiangular to triangle `$GHB$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as `$FD$` is to `$GB$`, so `$FE$` (is) to `$GH$`, and `$ED$` to `$HB$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* And it was also shown (that) as `$FD$` (is) to `$GB$`, so `$FC$` (is) to `$GA$`, and `$CD$` to `$AB$`.
* Thus, also, as `$FC$` (is) to `$AG$`, so `$CD$` (is) to `$AB$`, and `$FE$` to `$GH$`, and, further, `$ED$` to `$HB$`.
* And since angle `$CFD$` is equal to `$AGB$`, and `$DFE$` to `$BGH$`, thus the whole [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$CFE$` is equal to the whole [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$AGH$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), (angle) `$CDE$` is also equal to `$ABH$`.
* And the (angle) at `$C$` is also equal to the (angle) at `$A$`, and the (angle) at `$E$` to the (angle) at `$H$`.
* Thus, (figure) `$AH$` is equiangular to `$CE$`.
* And (the two figures) have the sides about their equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, the [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$AH$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$CE$` [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* Thus, the [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$AH$`, [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid down, to the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$CE$` has been constructed on the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
