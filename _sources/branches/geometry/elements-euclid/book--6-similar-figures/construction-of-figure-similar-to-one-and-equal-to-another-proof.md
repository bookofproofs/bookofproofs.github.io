* For let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BE$`, equal to triangle `$ABC$`, have been applied to (the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.44]][bookofproofs$961], and the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CM$`, equal to `$D$`, (have been applied) to (the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$CE$`, in the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$FCE$`, which is equal to `$CBL$` [[Prop. 1.45]][bookofproofs$963].
* Thus, `$BC$` is [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$CF$`, and `$LE$` to `$EM$` [[Prop. 1.14]][bookofproofs$767].
* And let the [mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 `$GH$` have been taken of `$BC$` and `$CF$` [[Prop. 6.13]][bookofproofs$1999].
* And let `$KGH$`, [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to `$ABC$` have been described on `$GH$` [[Prop. 6.18]][bookofproofs$2004].
* And since as `$BC$` is to `$GH$`, so `$GH$` (is) to `$CF$`, and if three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] then as the first is to the third, so the figure (described) on the first (is) to the [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly described, (figure) on the second [ [Prop. 6.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]4, thus as `$BC$` is to `$CF$`, so triangle `$ABC$` (is) to triangle `$KGH$`.
* But, also, as `$BC$` (is) to `$CF$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BE$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EF$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* And, thus, as triangle `$ABC$` (is) to triangle `$KGH$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BE$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EF$`.
* Thus, alternately, as triangle `$ABC$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BE$`, so triangle `$KGH$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EF$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* And triangle `$ABC$` (is) equal to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BE$`.
* Thus, triangle `$KGH$` (is) also equal to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EF$`.
* But, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EF$` is equal to `$D$`.
* Thus, `$KGH$` is also equal to `$D$`.
* And `$KGH$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$ABC$`.
* Thus, a single ([rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687]) `$KGH$` has been constructed (which is) [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$ABC$`, and equal to a different given ([rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687]) `$D$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
