* For Let [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$FDG$`, equal to each of `$BAC$` and `$EDF$`, and (angle) `$DFG$`, equal to `$ACB$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AF$` at the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` and `$F$` on it (respectively) [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* Thus, the remaining [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$B$` is equal to the remaining [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$G$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is equiangular to triangle `$DGF$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`, so `$GD$` (is) to `$DF$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* And it was also assumed that as `$BA$` is) to `$AC$`, so `$ED$` (is) to `$DF$`.
* And, thus, as `$ED$` (is) to `$DF$`, so `$GD$` (is) to `$DF$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, `$ED$` (is) equal to `$DG$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
* And `$DF$` (is) common.
* So, the two (sides) `$ED$`, `$DF$` are equal to the two (sides) `$GD$`, `$DF$` (respectively).
* And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EDF$` [is] equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$GDF$`.
* Thus, base `$EF$` is equal to base `$GF$`, and triangle `$DEF$` is equal to triangle `$GDF$`, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] will be equal to the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] which the equal sides subtend [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$DFG$` is equal to `$DFE$`, and (angle) `$DGF$` to `$DEF$`.
* But, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$DFG$` is equal to `$ACB$`.
* Thus, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$ACB$` is also equal to `$DFE$`.
* And (angle) `$BAC$` was also assumed (to be) equal to `$EDF$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] at `$B$` is equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] at `$E$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is equiangular to triangle `$DEF$`.
* Thus, if two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] have one angle equal to one angle, and the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], then the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] will be equiangular, and will have the [angles][bookofproofs$650] which corresponding sides subtend equal.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
