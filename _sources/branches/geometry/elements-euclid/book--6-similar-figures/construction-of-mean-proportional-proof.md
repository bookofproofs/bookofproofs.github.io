* Let ($AB$ and `$BC$`) be laid down [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] (with respect to one another), and let the [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430] `$ADC$` have been drawn on `$AC$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757].
* And let `$BD$` have been drawn from ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$B$`, at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to `$AC$` [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759].
* And let `$AD$` and `$DC$` have been joined.
* And since `$ADC$` is an [angle][bookofproofs$650] in a [semicircle][bookofproofs$6430], it is a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 3.31]][bookofproofs$1911].
* And since, in the [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431] `$ADC$`, the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$DB$` has been drawn from the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the base, `$DB$` is thus [in mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to the pieces of the base, `$AB$` and `$BC$` [ [Prop. 6.8 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]3.
* Thus, `$DB$` has been found (which is) in  to the two given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$` and `$BC$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
