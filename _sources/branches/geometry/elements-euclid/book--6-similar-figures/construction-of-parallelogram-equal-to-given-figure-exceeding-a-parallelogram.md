### (Proposition 9 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To apply a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], equal to a given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687], to a given [straight line][bookofproofs$645], (the applied [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) overshooting by a [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figure [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to a given ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]).
* Let `$AB$` be the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and `$C$` the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] to which the ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) applied to `$AB$` is required (to be) equal, and `$D$` the ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) to which the excess is required (to be) [similar][bookofproofs$1983].
* So it is required to apply a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], equal to the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$C$`, to the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, overshooting by a [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figure [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$D$`.

### Modern Formulation

This proposition is a geometric solution of the quadratic equation[^1] `\[x^2 + \alpha\,x -\beta = 0.\]`

[^1]: Here, `$x$` is the ratio of a side of the excess to the corresponding side of figure `$D$`, `$\alpha$` is the ratio of the length of `$AB$` to the length of that side of figure `$D$` which corresponds to the side of the excess running along `$AB$`, and `$\beta$` is the ratio of the areas of figures `$C$` and `$D$`. Only the positive root of the equation is found (translator's note).
