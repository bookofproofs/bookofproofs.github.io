* Let `$AB$` have been cut in half at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$E$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757], and let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BF$`, (which is) [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to `$D$`, have been described on `$EB$` [[Prop. 6.18]][bookofproofs$2004].
* And let ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$GH$` have been constructed (so as to be) both [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to `$D$`, and equal to the sum of `$BF$` and `$C$` [[Prop. 6.25]][bookofproofs$2011].
* And let `$KH$` correspond to `$FL$`, and `$KG$` to `$FE$`.
* And since ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$GH$` is greater than ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$FB$`, `$KH$` is thus also greater than `$FL$`, and `$KG$` than `$FE$`.
* Let `$FL$` and `$FE$` have been produced, and let `$FLM$` be (made) equal to `$KH$`, and `$FEN$` to `$KG$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736].
* And let ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$MN$` have been completed.
* Thus, `$MN$` is equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$GH$`.
* But, `$GH$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$EL$`.
* Thus, `$MN$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$EL$` [[Prop. 6.21]][bookofproofs$2007].
* `$EL$` is thus about the same diagonal as `$MN$` [[Prop. 6.26]][bookofproofs$2012].
* Let their (common) diagonal `$FO$` have been drawn, and let the (remainder of the) figure have been described.
* And since ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$GH$` is equal to ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$EL$` and (figure) `$C$`, but `$GH$` is equal to ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$MN$`, `$MN$` is thus also equal to `$EL$` and `$C$`.
* Let `$EL$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remaining [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$XWV$` is equal to (figure) `$C$`.
* And since `$AE$` is equal to `$EB$`, ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$AN$` is also equal to ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$NB$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], that is to say, ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$LP$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959].
* Let ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$EO$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the whole ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$AO$` is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$VWX$`.
* But, the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$VWX$` is equal to (figure) `$C$`.
* Thus, ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$AO$` is also equal to (figure) `$C$`.
* Thus, the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AO$`, equal to the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$C$`, has been applied to the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, overshooting by the [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figure `$QP$` which is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$D$`, since `$PQ$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$EL$` [[Prop. 6.24]][bookofproofs$2010].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
