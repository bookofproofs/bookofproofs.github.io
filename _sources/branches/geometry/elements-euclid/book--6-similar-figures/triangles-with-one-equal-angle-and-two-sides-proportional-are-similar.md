### (Proposition 6 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] have one angle equal to one angle, and the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], then the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] will be equiangular, and will have the [angles][bookofproofs$650] which corresponding sides subtend equal.
* Let `$ABC$` and `$DEF$` be two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having one angle, `$BAC$`, equal to one angle, `$EDF$` (respectively), and the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], (so that) as `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`, so `$ED$` (is) to `$DF$`.
* I say that triangle `$ABC$` is equiangular to triangle `$DEF$`, and will have angle `$ABC$` equal to `$DEF$`, and (angle) `$ACB$` to `$DFE$`.

### Modern Formulation (Special Case of the "Side-Angle-Side" Theorem for the Similarity of Triangle)

Two triangles ($\bigtriangleup{ABC}$,$\bigtriangleup{DEF}$) are [similar][bookofproofs$2782] if:
* they have one [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] [angle][bookofproofs$650] ($\angle{BAC}\cong\angle{EDF}$)
* and two corresponding sides are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442]:
`$$\frac{|\overline{AB}|}{|\overline{AC}|}=\frac{|\overline{DE}|}{|\overline{DF}|}.$$`
