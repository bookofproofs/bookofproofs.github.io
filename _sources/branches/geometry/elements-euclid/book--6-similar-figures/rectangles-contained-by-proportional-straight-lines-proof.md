* Let `$AB$`, `$CD$`, `$E$`, and `$F$` be four [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], (such that) as `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$` 
* I say that the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$F$` is equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CD$` and `$E$`.
   * For let `$AG$` and `$CH$` have been drawn from [points][bookofproofs$631] `$A$` and `$C$` at [right angles][bookofproofs$653] to the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` and `$CD$` (respectively) [[Prop. 1.11]][bookofproofs$759].
   * And let `$AG$` be made equal to `$F$`, and `$CH$` to `$E$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736].
   * And let the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$BG$` and `$DH$` have been completed.
   * And since as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`, and `$E$` (is) equal `$CH$`, and `$F$` to `$AG$`, thus as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$CH$` (is) to `$AG$`.
   * Thus, in the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$BG$` and `$DH$` the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
   * And those equiangular [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] in which the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] are equal [[Prop. 6.14]][bookofproofs$2000].
   * Thus, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BG$` is equal to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$DH$`.
   * And `$BG$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$F$`.
   * For `$AG$` (is) equal to `$F$`.
   * And `$DH$` (is) the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CD$` and `$E$`.
   * For `$E$` (is) equal to `$CH$`.
   * Thus, the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$F$` is equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CD$` and `$E$`.
* And so, let the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$AB$` and `$F$` be equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$CD$` and `$E$`.
* I say that the four [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] will be [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], (so that) as `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
   * For, with the same construction, since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$F$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CD$` and `$E$`.
   * And `$BG$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$AB$` and `$F$`.
   * For `$AG$` is equal to `$F$`.
   * And `$DH$` (is) the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$CD$` and `$E$`.
   * For `$CH$` (is) equal to `$E$`.
   * `$BG$` is thus equal to `$DH$`.
   * And they are equiangular.
   * And in equal and equiangular [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [[Prop. 6.14]][bookofproofs$2000].
   * Thus, as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$CH$` (is) to `$AG$`.
   * And `$CH$` (is) equal to `$E$`, and `$AG$` to `$F$`.
   * Thus, as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$E$` (is) to `$F$`.
   * Thus, if four [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] then the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the (two) outermost is equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the middle (two).
   * And if the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the (two) outermost is equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the middle (two) then the four [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] will be [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
