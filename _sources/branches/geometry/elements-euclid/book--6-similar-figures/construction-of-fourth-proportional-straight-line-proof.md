* Let the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$DE$` and `$DF$` be set out encompassing the [random] angle `$EDF$`.
* And let `$DG$` be made equal to `$A$`, and `$GE$` to `$B$`, and, further, `$DH$` to `$C$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736].
* And `$GH$` being joined, let `$EF$` have been drawn through ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$E$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to it [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* Therefore, since `$GH$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one of the sides `$EF$` of triangle `$DEF$`, thus as `$DG$` is to `$GE$`, so `$DH$` (is) to `$HF$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* And `$DG$` (is) equal to `$A$`, and `$GE$` to `$B$`, and `$DH$` to `$C$`.
* Thus, as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$C$` (is) to `$HF$`.
* Thus, a fourth ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), `$HF$`, has been found (which is) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to the three given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
