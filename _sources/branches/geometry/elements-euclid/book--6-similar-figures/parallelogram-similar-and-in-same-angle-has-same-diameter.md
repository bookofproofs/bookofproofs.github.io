### (Proposition 26 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If from a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] a(nother) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] is subtracted (which is) [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to the whole, having a common angle with it, then (the subtracted [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) is about the same diagonal as the whole.

* For, from [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$`, let ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$AF$` have been subtracted (which is) [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to `$ABCD$`, having the common angle `$DAB$` with it.
* I say that `$ABCD$` is about the same diagonal as `$AF$`.

### Modern Formulation

If from a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] ($ABCD$) a [similar][bookofproofs$1983] parellelogram ($AF$) is subtracted and both parallelograms share a common [angle][bookofproofs$650] ($\angle{GAE}$), then their [diagonals][bookofproofs$908] going through this angle lie on the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
