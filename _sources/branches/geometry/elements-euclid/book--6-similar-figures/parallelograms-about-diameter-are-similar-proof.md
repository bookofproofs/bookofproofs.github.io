* For since `$EF$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one of the sides `$BC$` of triangle `$ABC$`, proportionally, as `$BE$` is to `$EA$`, so `$CF$` (is) to `$FA$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* Again, since `$FG$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one (of the sides) `$CD$` of triangle `$ACD$`, proportionally, as `$CF$` is to `$FA$`, so `$DG$` (is) to `$GA$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* But, as `$CF$` (is) to `$FA$`, so it was also shown (is) `$BE$` to `$EA$`.
* And thus as `$BE$` (is) to `$EA$`, so `$DG$` (is) to `$GA$`.
* And, thus, compounding, as `$BA$` (is) to `$AE$`, so `$DA$` (is) to `$AG$` [[Prop. 5.18]][bookofproofs$1975].
* And, alternately, as `$BA$` (is) to `$AD$`, so `$EA$` (is) to `$AG$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* Thus, in [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` and `$EG$` the sides about the common angle `$BAD$` are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* And since `$GF$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$DC$`, angle `$AFG$` is equal to `$DCA$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* And [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DAC$` (is) common to the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ADC$` and `$AGF$`.
* Thus, triangle `$ADC$` is equiangular to triangle `$AGF$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* So, for the same (reasons), triangle `$ACB$` is equiangular to triangle `$AFE$`, and the whole [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` is equiangular to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EG$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as `$AD$` (is) to `$DC$`, so `$AG$` (is) to `$GF$`, and as `$DC$` (is) to `$CA$`, so `$GF$` (is) to `$FA$`, and as `$AC$` (is) to `$CB$`, so `$AF$` (is) to `$FE$`, and, further, as `$CB$` (is) to `$BA$`, so `$FE$` (is) to `$EA$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* And since it was shown that as `$DC$` is to `$CA$`, so `$GF$` (is) to `$FA$`, and as `$AC$` (is) to `$CB$`, so `$AF$` (is) to `$FE$`, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$DC$` is to `$CB$`, so `$GF$` (is) to `$FE$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* Thus, in [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` and `$EG$` the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EG$` [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* So, for the same (reasons), [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$KH$`.
* Thus, [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$EG$` and `$HK$` are each [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [[parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]] `$ABCD$`.
* And ([rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687]) [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the same [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] are also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to one another [[Prop. 6.21]][bookofproofs$2007].
* Thus, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EG$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$HK$`.
* Thus, in any [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] about the diagonal are [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the whole, and to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
