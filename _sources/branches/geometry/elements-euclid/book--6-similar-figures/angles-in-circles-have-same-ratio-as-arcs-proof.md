* For let any number whatsoever of consecutive ([circumferences][bookofproofs$690]), `$CK$` and `$KL$`, be made equal to [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BC$`, and any number whatsoever, `$FM$` and `$MN$`, to [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$EF$`.
* And let `$GK$`, `$GL$`, `$HM$`, and `$HN$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$BC$`, `$CK$`, and `$KL$` are equal to one another, [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BGC$`, `$CGK$`, and `$KGL$` are also equal to one another [[Prop. 3.27]][bookofproofs$1907].
* Thus, as many times as [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BL$` is (divisible) by `$BC$`, so many times is angle `$BGL$` also (divisible) by `$BGC$`.
* And so, for the same (reasons), as many times as [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$NE$` is (divisible) by `$EF$`, so many times is angle `$NHE$` also (divisible) by `$EHF$`.
* Thus, if [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BL$` is equal to [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$EN$` then angle `$BGL$` is also equal to `$EHN$` [[Prop. 3.27]][bookofproofs$1907], and if [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BL$` is greater than [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$EN$` then angle `$BGL$` is also greater than `$EHN$`,[^1] and if ($BL$ is) less (than `$EN$` then `$BGL$` is also) less (than `$EHN$`).
* So there are four magnitudes, two [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] `$BC$` and `$EF$`, and two [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BGC$` and `$EHF$`.
* And equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] have been taken of [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BC$` and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BGC$`, (namely) [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BL$` and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BGL$`, and of [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$EF$` and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EHF$`, (namely) [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$EN$` and [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EHN$`.
* And it has been shown that if [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BL$` exceeds [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$EN$` then angle `$BGL$` also exceeds angle `$EHN$`, and if ($BL$ is) equal (to `$EN$` then `$BGL$` is also) equal (to `$EHN$`), and if ($BL$ is) less (than `$EN$` then `$BGL$` is also) less (than `$EHN$`).
* Thus, as [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BC$` (is) to `$EF$`, so angle `$BGC$` (is) to `$EHF$` [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* But as angle `$BGC$` (is) to `$EHF$`, so (angle) `$BAC$` (is) to `$EDF$` [[Prop. 5.15]][bookofproofs$1972].
* For the former (are) double the latter (respectively) [[Prop. 3.20]][bookofproofs$1900].
* Thus, also, as [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$BC$` (is) to [circumference][bookofproofs$690] `$EF$`, so angle `$BGC$` (is) to `$EHF$`, and `$BAC$` to `$EDF$`.
* Thus, in [equal circles][bookofproofs$1850], [angles][bookofproofs$650] have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as the (ratio of the) [circumferences][bookofproofs$690] on which they stand, whether they are standing at the [centers][bookofproofs$6428] (of the [circles][bookofproofs$690]) or at the [circumferences][bookofproofs$690].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
