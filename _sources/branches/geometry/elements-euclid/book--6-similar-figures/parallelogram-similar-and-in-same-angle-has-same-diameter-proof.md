* For (if) not, then, if possible, let `$AHC$` be [$ABCD$'s] diagonal.
* And producing `$GF$`, let it have been drawn through to ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$H$`.
* And let `$HK$` have been drawn through ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$H$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to either of `$AD$` or `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* Therefore, since `$ABCD$` is about the same diagonal as `$KG$`, thus as `$DA$` is to `$AB$`, so `$GA$` (is) to `$AK$` [[Prop. 6.24]][bookofproofs$2010].
* And, on account of the similarity of `$ABCD$` and `$EG$`, also, as `$DA$` (is) to `$AB$`, so `$GA$` (is) to `$AE$`.
* Thus, also, as `$GA$` (is) to `$AK$`, so `$GA$` (is) to `$AE$`.
* Thus, `$GA$` has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to each of `$AK$` and `$AE$`.
* Thus, `$AE$` is equal to `$AK$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966], the lesser to the greater.
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, `$ABCD$` is not not about the same diagonal as `$AF$`.
* Thus, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ABCD$` is about the same diagonal as [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AF$`.
* Thus, if from a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] a(nother) [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] is subtracted (which is) [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to the whole, having a common angle with it, then (the subtracted [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) is about the same diagonal as the whole.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
