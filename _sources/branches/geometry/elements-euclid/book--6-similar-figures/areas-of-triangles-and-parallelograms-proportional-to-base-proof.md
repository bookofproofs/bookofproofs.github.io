* For let the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$BD$` have been produced in each direction to [points][bookofproofs$631] `$H$` and `$L$`, and let [any number] (of [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$BG$` and `$GH$` be made equal to base `$BC$`, and any number (of [straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$DK$` and `$KL$` equal to base `$CD$`.
* And let `$AG$`, `$AH$`, `$AK$`, and `$AL$` have been joined.
* And since `$CB$`, `$BG$`, and `$GH$` are equal to one another, [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$AHG$`, `$AGB$`, and `$ABC$` are also equal to one another [[Prop. 1.38]][bookofproofs$949].
* Thus, as many times as base `$HC$` is (divisible by) base `$BC$`, so many times is triangle `$AHC$` also (divisible) by triangle `$ABC$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), as many times as base `$LC$` is (divisible) by base `$CD$`, so many times is triangle `$ALC$` also (divisible) by triangle `$ACD$`.
* And if base `$HC$` is equal to base `$CL$` then triangle `$AHC$` is also equal to triangle `$ACL$` [[Prop. 1.38]][bookofproofs$949].
* And if base `$HC$` exceeds base `$CL$` then triangle `$AHC$` also exceeds triangle `$ACL$`.[^1] 
* And if ($HC$ is) less (than `$CL$` then `$AHC$` is also) less (than `$ACL$`).
* So, their being four magnitudes, two bases, `$BC$` and `$CD$`, and two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], `$ABC$` and `$ACD$`, equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] have been taken of base `$BC$` and triangle `$ABC$` - (namely), base `$HC$` and triangle `$AHC$` - and other random equal [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] of base `$CD$` and triangle `$ADC$` - (namely), base `$LC$` and triangle `$ALC$`.
* And it has been shown that if base `$HC$` exceeds base `$CL$` then triangle `$AHC$` also exceeds triangle `$ALC$`, and if ($HC$ is) equal (to `$CL$` then `$AHC$` is also) equal (to `$ALC$`), and if ($HC$ is) less (than `$CL$` then `$AHC$` is also) less (than `$ALC$`).
* Thus, as base `$BC$` is to base `$CD$`, so triangle `$ABC$` (is) to triangle `$ACD$` [ [Def. 5.5] ][bookofproofs$1945].
* And since [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EC$` is double triangle `$ABC$`, and [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FC$` is double triangle `$ACD$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933], and [parts][bookofproofs$2316] have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as similar [multiples][bookofproofs$6440] [[Prop. 5.15]][bookofproofs$1972], thus as triangle `$ABC$` is to triangle `$ACD$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EC$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FC$`.
* In fact, since it was shown that as base `$BC$` (is) to `$CD$`, so triangle `$ABC$` (is) to triangle `$ACD$`, and as triangle `$ABC$` (is) to triangle `$ACD$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EC$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CF$`, thus, also, as base `$BC$` (is) to base `$CD$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EC$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FC$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] and [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] which are of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] are to one another as their bases.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: This is a straight-forward generalization of [[Prop. 1.38]][bookofproofs$949] (translator's note).
