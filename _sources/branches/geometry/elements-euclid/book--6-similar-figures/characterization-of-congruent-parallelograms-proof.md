* For let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FE$` have been completed.
* Therefore, since [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AB$` is equal to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BC$`, and `$FE$` (is) some other ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]), thus as ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$AB$` is to `$FE$`, so ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$BC$` (is) to `$FE$` [[Prop. 5.7]][bookofproofs$1964].
* But, as ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$AB$` (is) to `$FE$`, so `$DB$` (is) to `$BE$`, and as ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$BC$` (is) to `$FE$`, so `$GB$` (is) to `$BF$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, also, as `$DB$` (is) to `$BE$`, so `$GB$` (is) to `$BF$`.
* Thus, in [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] `$AB$` and `$BC$` the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are reciprocally [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* And so, let `$DB$` be to `$BE$`, as `$GB$` (is) to `$BF$`.
* I say that [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AB$` is equal to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BC$`.
* For since as `$DB$` is to `$BE$`, so `$GB$` (is) to `$BF$`, but as `$DB$` (is) to `$BE$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AB$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FE$`, and as `$GB$` (is) to `$BF$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BC$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FE$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], thus, also, as ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$AB$` (is) to `$FE$`, so ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$BC$` (is) to `$FE$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AB$` is equal to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$BC$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
* Thus, in equal and equiangular [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are reciprocally [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* And those equiangular [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] in which the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are reciprocally [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] are equal.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
