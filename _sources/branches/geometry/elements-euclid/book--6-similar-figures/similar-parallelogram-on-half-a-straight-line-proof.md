* For since [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$DB$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$FB$`, they are about the same diagonal [[Prop. 6.26]][bookofproofs$2012].
* Let their (common) diagonal `$DB$` have been drawn, and let the (rest of the) figure have been described.
* Therefore, since (complement) `$CF$` is equal to (complement) `$FE$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959], and ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$FB$` is common, the whole ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$CH$` is thus equal to the whole ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$KE$`.
* But, ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$CH$` is equal to `$CG$`, since `$AC$` (is) also (equal) to `$CB$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$GC$` is also equal to `$EK$`.
* Let ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$CF$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the whole ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$AF$` is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$LMN$`.
* Hence, [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$DB$` - that is to say, `$AD$` - is greater than [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AF$`.
* Thus, for all [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] applied to the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and falling short by a [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figure [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to the ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) described on half (the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), the greatest is the [[parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]] applied to half (the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
