* For let ($BA$ and `$AC$`) have been produced to [points][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` and `$E$` (respectively), and let `$BD$` be made equal to `$AC$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736].
* And let `$BC$` have been joined.
* And let `$DE$` have been drawn through ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$D$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to it [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* Therefore, since `$BC$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one of the sides `$DE$` of triangle `$ADE$`, proportionally, as `$AB$` is to `$BD$`, so `$AC$` (is) to `$CE$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* And `$BD$` (is) equal to `$AC$`.
* Thus, as `$AB$` is to `$AC$`, so `$AC$` (is) to `$CE$`.
* Thus, a third ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), `$CE$`, has been found (which is) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to the two given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$` and `$AC$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.[^1]

[^1]: It has been shown that it is possible to construct a segment with a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] to two segments with a given [ratio][bookofproofs$1943]. This construction can be repeated to construct a segment with a [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] or an arbitrary [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552] (editor's note).
