* Let `$BC$` be placed [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$CE$`.
* And since [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` and `$ACB$` are less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.17]][bookofproofs$789], and `$ACB$` (is) equal to `$DEC$`, thus `$ABC$` and `$DEC$` are less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$BA$` and `$ED$`, being produced, will meet [ [C.N. 5] ][bookofproofs$6423].
* Let them have been produced, and let them meet at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$F$`.
* And since angle `$DCE$` is equal to `$ABC$`, `$BF$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$CD$` [[Prop. 1.28]][bookofproofs$913].
* Again, since (angle) `$ACB$` is equal to `$DEC$`, `$AC$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$FE$` [[Prop. 1.28]][bookofproofs$913].
* Thus, `$FACD$` is a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909].
* Thus, `$FA$` is equal to `$DC$`, and `$AC$` to `$FD$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* And since `$AC$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one (of the sides) `$FE$` of triangle `$FBE$`, thus as `$BA$` is to `$AF$`, so `$BC$` (is) to `$CE$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* And `$AF$` (is) equal to `$CD$`.
* Thus, as `$BA$` (is) to `$CD$`, so `$BC$` (is) to `$CE$`, and, alternately, as `$AB$` (is) to `$BC$`, so `$DC$` (is) to `$CE$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* Again, since `$CD$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BF$`, thus as `$BC$` (is) to `$CE$`, so `$FD$` (is) to `$DE$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* And `$FD$` (is) equal to `$AC$`.
* Thus, as `$BC$` is to `$CE$`, so `$AC$` (is) to `$DE$`, and, alternately, as `$BC$` (is) to `$CA$`, so `$CE$` (is) to `$ED$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* Therefore, since it was shown that as `$AB$` (is) to `$BC$`, so `$DC$` (is) to `$CE$`, and as `$BC$` (is) to `$CA$`, so `$CE$` (is) to `$ED$`, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`, so `$CD$` (is) to `$DE$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* Thus, in equiangular [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], and those (sides) subtending equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] correspond.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
