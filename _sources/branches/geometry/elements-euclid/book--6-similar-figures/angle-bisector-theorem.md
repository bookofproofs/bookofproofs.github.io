### (Proposition 3 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If an [angle][bookofproofs$650] of a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] is cut in half, and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] cutting the [angle][bookofproofs$650] also cuts the base, then the [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the base will have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as the remaining sides of the triangle. And if the [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the base have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as the remaining sides of the triangle, then the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining the vertex to the cutting ([point][bookofproofs$631]) will cut the [angle][bookofproofs$650] of the triangle in half.
* Let `$ABC$` be a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432].
* And let the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` have been cut in half by the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AD$`.
* I say that as `$BD$` is to `$CD$`, so `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`.

### Modern Formulation

Let a straight line `$AD$` cut the base `$BC$` of a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$\bigtriangleup{ABC}$` at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$D.$` Then the straight line `$AD$` [bisects][bookofproofs$755] the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$\angle{BAC}$` if and only if the lengths of the cut subsements of the base ($\overline{BD},\overline{DC}$) are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] to the lengths of the remaining sides ($\overline{AB},\overline{AC}$)  of the triangle: `$$\frac{|\overline{BD}|}{|\overline{DC}|}=\frac{|\overline{AB}|}{|\overline{AC}|}.$$`
