### (Corollary to Proposition 8 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So (it is) clear, from this, that if, in a [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431], a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is drawn from the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the base then the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645] so) drawn is in mean proportion to the pieces of the base. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

### Modern Formulation (Geometric Mean Theorem)

In any [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431] with the sides `\(a\)`, `\(b\)` with a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] between the sides `\(a\)` and `\(b\)`, the ([segment][bookofproofs$645]) `\(h\)` drawn from the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the base `\(c\)` will cut it into pieces `\(p\)` and `\(q\)` and is equal the **geometric mean** of these pieces, formally

`\[h=\sqrt{pq}.\]`


![meanproportion](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/meanproportion.png?raw=true)


Euclid calls in the  “Elements” such a segment `\(h\)` as being the [mean proportional][bookofproofs$1999]  to the pieces `\(p\)` and `\(q\)`  of the base `\(c\)`.
