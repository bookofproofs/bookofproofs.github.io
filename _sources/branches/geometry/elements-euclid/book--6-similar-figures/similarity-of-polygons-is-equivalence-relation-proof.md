* For since `$A$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$C$`, ($A$) is equiangular to ($C$), and has the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* Again, since `$B$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$C$`, ($B$) is equiangular to ($C$), and has the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* Thus, `$A$` and `$B$` are each equiangular to `$C$`, and have the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [hence, `$A$` is also equiangular to `$B$`, and has the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328]].
* Thus, `$A$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$B$` [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
