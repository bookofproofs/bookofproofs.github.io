### (Corollary to Proposition 20 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> And, in the same manner, it can also be shown for [[similar][bookofproofs$1983] [quadrilaterals][bookofproofs$687] that they are in the [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] of (their) corresponding sides. And it was also shown for [triangles][bookofproofs$6432]. Hence, in general, [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687] are also to one another in the [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] of (their) corresponding sides. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.



### Modern Formulation

The [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of the areas of two [similar rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$1983] is [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] to the [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] of the lengths of corresponding sides.[^1]

[^1]: Euclid formulates this corollary as a generalization of [Prop. 6.20][bookofproofs$2006] with a triangularization argument and a reference to [Prop 6.19][bookofproofs$2005] (editor's note).
