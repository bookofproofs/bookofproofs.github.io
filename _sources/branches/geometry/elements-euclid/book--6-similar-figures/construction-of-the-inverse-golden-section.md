### (Proposition 30 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To cut[^1] a given finite [straight line][bookofproofs$645] [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985].

* Let `$AB$` be the given finite [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* So it is required to cut the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985].

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to cut a given [segment][bookofproofs$645] at a point being its [inverse golden ratio][bookofproofs$1985].
[^1]: This method of cutting a [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is sometimes called the [Golden Section" - see " [Prop. 2.11] ][bookofproofs$1025] (translator's note).
