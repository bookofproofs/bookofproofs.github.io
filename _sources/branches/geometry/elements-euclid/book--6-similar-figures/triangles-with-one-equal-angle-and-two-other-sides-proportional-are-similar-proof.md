Let each of the ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) at `$C$` and `$F$` be assumed (to be) less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* For if angle `$ABC$` is not equal to (angle) `$DEF$` then one of them is greater.
* Let `$ABC$` be greater.
* And Let [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$ABG$`, equal to (angle) `$DEF$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$B$` on it [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* And since angle `$A$` is equal to (angle) `$D$`, and (angle) `$ABG$` to `$DEF$`, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$AGB$` is thus equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$DFE$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, triangle `$ABG$` is equiangular to triangle `$DEF$`.
* Thus, as `$AB$` is to `$BG$`, so `$DE$` (is) to `$EF$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* And as `$DE$` (is) to `$EF$`, [so] it was assumed (is) `$AB$` to `$BC$`.
* Thus, `$AB$` has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to each of `$BC$` and `$BG$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, `$BC$` (is) equal to `$BG$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
* And, hence, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$C$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BGC$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* And the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$C$` was assumed (to be) less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BGC$` is also less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Hence, the adjacent angle to it, `$AGB$`, is greater than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.13]][bookofproofs$763].
* And ($AGB$) was shown to be equal to the (angle) at `$F$`.
* Thus, the (angle) at `$F$` is also greater than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* But it was assumed (to be) less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* The very thing is [absurd][bookofproofs$744].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` is not unequal to (angle) `$DEF$`.
* Thus, (it is) equal.
* And the (angle) at `$A$` is also equal to the (angle) at `$D$`.
* And thus the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] at `$C$` is equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] at `$F$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is equiangular to triangle `$DEF$`.

But, again, let each of the ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) at `$C$` and `$F$` be assumed (to be) not less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* I say, again, that triangle `$ABC$` is equiangular to triangle `$DEF$` in this case also.
* For, with the same construction, we can similarly show that `$BC$` is equal to `$BG$`.
* Hence, also, the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$C$` is equal to (angle) `$BGC$`.
* And the (angle) at `$C$` (is) not less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, `$BGC$` (is) not less than a [right angle][bookofproofs$653] either.
* So, in [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$BGC$` the (sum of) two [angles][bookofproofs$650] is not less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* The very thing is [impossible][bookofproofs$744] [[Prop. 1.17]][bookofproofs$789].
* Thus, again, angle `$ABC$` is not unequal to `$DEF$`.
* Thus, (it is) equal.
* And the (angle) at `$A$` is also equal to the (angle) at `$D$`.
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] at `$C$` is equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] at `$F$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is equiangular to triangle `$DEF$`.
* Thus, if two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] have one angle equal to one angle, and the sides about other [angles][bookofproofs$650] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] both less than, or both not less than, [right angles][bookofproofs$653], then the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] will be equiangular, and will have the [angles][bookofproofs$650] about which the sides (are) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] equal.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
