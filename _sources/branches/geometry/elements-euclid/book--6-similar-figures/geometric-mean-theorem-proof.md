* By hypothesis, the triangle with with the sides `\(a\)`, `\(b\)`, `\(c\)` is a [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431], with the  with the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] between the sides `\(a\)` and `\(b\)`.
* By [proposition 6.08][bookofproofs$1994], if, in a [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431], a [segment][bookofproofs$645] `\(h\)` is drawn from the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the base `\(c\)`, cutting it into pieces `\(p\)` and `\(q\)`, then the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] with the sides `\(b\)`, `\(h\)`, `\(p\)` and `\(a\)`,`\(q\)` `\(h\)` are [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the whole (triangle) with the sides `\(c\)`, `\(a\)`, `\(b\)`, and to one another.
* Therefore, the side lengths  are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442]:
`\[\frac hp=\frac qh\]`
* Equivalently [by proposition 7.19][bookofproofs$2349], `\(h^2=pq\)`.
* Thus, `\(h=\sqrt{pq}\)`.
* Thus, `\(h\)` is the geometric mean of `\(p\)` and `\(q\)`.
