### (Proposition 1 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)[^1]

> [Triangles][bookofproofs$6432] and [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] which are of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] are to one another as their bases.
* Let `$ABC$` and `$ACD$` be [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], and `$EC$` and `$CF$` [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909], of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] `$AC$`.
* I say that as base `$BC$` is to base `$CD$`, so triangle `$ABC$` (is) to triangle `$ACD$`, and [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$EC$` to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CF$`.

### Modern Formulation

The [proportion][bookofproofs$6442] of areas of [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] ([parallelograms][bookofproofs$909]) of the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] is equal to the proportion of the lengths of their bases.

[^1]: As is easily demonstrated, this proposition holds even when the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], or [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909], do not share a common side, and/or are not right-angled (translator's note).
