### (Proposition 2 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one of the sides of a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] then it will cut the (other) sides of the triangle proportionally. And if (two of) the sides of a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] are cut proportionally then the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining the cutting ([points][bookofproofs$631]) will be [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the remaining side of the triangle.

* For let `$DE$` have been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one of the sides `$BC$` of triangle `$ABC$`.
* I say that as `$BD$` is to `$DA$`, so `$CE$` (is) to `$EA$`.

### Modern Formulation ("Side-Angle-Side" Theorem for the Similarity of Triangle)

Two triangles ($\bigtriangleup{ABC}$,$\bigtriangleup{ADE}$) are [similar][bookofproofs$2782] if and only if:
* they have one [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] [angle][bookofproofs$650] ($\angle{CAB}\cong\angle{EAD}$)
* and two corresponding sides are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442]:
`$$\frac{|\overline{AB}|}{|\overline{AD}|}=\frac{|\overline{AC}|}{|\overline{AE}|}.$$`
The same holds also if this proportion is replaced by one of the following proportionalities:
`$$\frac{|\overline{AD}|}{|\overline{AE}|}=\frac{|\overline{AB}|}{|\overline{AC}|},\quad\frac{|\overline{AD}|}{|\overline{DB}|}=\frac{|\overline{AE}|}{|\overline{EC}|},\quad\frac{|\overline{AB}|}{|\overline{BC}|}=\frac{|\overline{AD}|}{|\overline{DE}|}.$$`
