* For since `$AB$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$DC$`, and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` has fallen across them, the alternate [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` and `$ACD$` are equal to one another [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$CDE$` is also equal to `$ACD$`.
* And, hence, `$BAC$` is equal to `$CDE$`.
* And since `$ABC$` and `$DCE$` are two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having the one angle at `$A$` equal to the one angle at `$D$`, and the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], (so that) as `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`, so `$CD$` (is) to `$DE$`, triangle `$ABC$` is thus equiangular to triangle `$DCE$` [[Prop. 6.6]][bookofproofs$1992].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` is equal to `$DCE$`.
* And (angle) `$ACD$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$BAC$`.
* Thus, the whole [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$ACE$` is equal to the two ([angles][bookofproofs$650]) `$ABC$` and `$BAC$`.
* Let `$ACB$` have been added to both.
* Thus, `$ACE$` and `$ACB$` are equal to `$BAC$`, `$ACB$`, and `$CBA$`.
* But, `$BAC$`, `$ABC$`, and `$ACB$` are equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, `$ACE$` and `$ACB$` are also equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653].
* Thus, the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] `$BC$` and `$CE$`, not lying on the same side, make adjacent [angles][bookofproofs$650] `$ACE$` and `$ACB$` (whose sum is) equal to two [right angles][bookofproofs$653] with some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$`, at the [point][bookofproofs$631] `$C$` on it.
* Thus, `$BC$` is [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$CE$` [[Prop. 1.14]][bookofproofs$767].
* Thus, if two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], having two sides [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to two sides, are placed together at a single angle such that the corresponding sides are also [parallel][bookofproofs$788], then the remaining sides of the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] will be [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] (with respect to one another).
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
