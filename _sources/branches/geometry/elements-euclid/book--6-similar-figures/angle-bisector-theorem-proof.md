* For let `$CE$` have been drawn through ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$C$` [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$DA$`.
* And, `$BA$` being drawn through, let it meet ($CE$) at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$E$`.[^1]
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AC$` falls across the [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$` and `$EC$`, angle `$ACE$` is thus equal to `$CAD$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* But, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$CAD$` is assumed (to be) equal to `$BAD$`.
* Thus, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BAD$` is also equal to `$ACE$`.
* Again, since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$BAE$` falls across the [parallel][bookofproofs$788] ([straight lines][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$` and `$EC$`, the external angle `$BAD$` is equal to the internal (angle) `$AEC$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* And (angle) `$ACE$` was also shown (to be) equal to `$BAD$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ACE$` is also equal to `$AEC$`.
* And, hence, side `$AE$` is equal to side `$AC$` [[Prop. 1.6]][bookofproofs$743].
* And since `$AD$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one of the sides `$EC$` of triangle `$BCE$`, thus, proportionally, as `$BD$` is to `$DC$`, so `$BA$` (is) to `$AE$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* And `$AE$` (is) equal to `$AC$`.
* Thus, as `$BD$` (is) to `$DC$`, so `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`.
* And so, let `$BD$` be to `$DC$`, as `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`.
* And let `$AD$` have been joined.
* I say that [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` has been cut in half by the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AD$`.
* For, by the same construction, since as `$BD$` is to `$DC$`, so `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`, then also as `$BD$` (is) to `$DC$`, so `$BA$` is to `$AE$`.
* For `$AD$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one (of the sides) `$EC$` of triangle `$BCE$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* Thus, also, as `$BA$` (is) to `$AC$`, so `$BA$` (is) to `$AE$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, `$AC$` (is) equal to `$AE$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
* And, hence, angle `$AEC$` is equal to `$ACE$` [[Prop. 1.5]][bookofproofs$740].
* But, `$AEC$` [is] equal to the external (angle) `$BAD$`, and `$ACE$` is equal to the alternate (angle) `$CAD$` [[Prop. 1.29]][bookofproofs$915].
* Thus, [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BAD$` is also equal to `$CAD$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` has been cut in half by the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AD$`.
* Thus, if an [angle][bookofproofs$650] of a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] is cut in half, and the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] cutting the [angle][bookofproofs$650] also cuts the base, then the [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the base will have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as the remaining sides of the triangle.
* And if the [segments][bookofproofs$1852] of the base have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] as the remaining sides of the triangle, then the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining the vertex to the cutting ([point][bookofproofs$631]) will cut the [angle][bookofproofs$650] of the triangle in half.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: The fact that the two [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] meet follows because the sum of `$ACE$` and `$CAE$` is less than two [right angles][bookofproofs$653], as can easily be demonstrated. See [ [Post. 5] ][bookofproofs$939] (translator's note).
