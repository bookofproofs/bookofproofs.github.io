* Let `$AB$` be the given uncut [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and `$AC$` a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) cut at [points][bookofproofs$631] `$D$` and `$E$`, and let ($AC$) be laid down so as to encompass a random angle (with `$AB$`).
* And let `$CB$` have been joined.
* And let `$DF$` and `$EG$` have been drawn through ([points][bookofproofs$631]) `$D$` and `$E$` (respectively), [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BC$`, and let `$DHK$` have been drawn through ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$D$`, [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.31]][bookofproofs$921].
* Thus, `$FH$` and `$HB$` are each [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909].
* Thus, `$DH$` (is) equal to `$FG$`, and `$HK$` to `$GB$` [[Prop. 1.34]][bookofproofs$933].
* And since the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$HE$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one of the sides, `$KC$`, of triangle `$DKC$`, thus, proportionally, as `$CE$` is to `$ED$`, so `$KH$` (is) to `$HD$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* And `$KH$` (is) equal to `$BG$`, and `$HD$` to `$GF$`.
* Thus, as `$CE$` is to `$ED$`, so `$BG$` (is) to `$GF$`.
* Again, since `$FD$` has been drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one of the sides, `$GE$`, of triangle `$AGE$`, thus, proportionally, as `$ED$` is to `$DA$`, so `$GF$` (is) to `$FA$` [[Prop. 6.2]][bookofproofs$1988].
* And it was also shown that as `$CE$` (is) to `$ED$`, so `$BG$` (is) to `$GF$`.
* Thus, as `$CE$` is to `$ED$`, so `$BG$` (is) to `$GF$`, and as `$ED$` (is) to `$DA$`, so `$GF$` (is) to `$FA$`.
* Thus, the given uncut [straight line][bookofproofs$645], `$AB$`, has been cut similarly to the given cut [straight line][bookofproofs$645], `$AC$`.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
