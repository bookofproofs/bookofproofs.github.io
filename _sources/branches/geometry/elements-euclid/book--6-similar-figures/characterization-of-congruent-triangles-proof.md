* For let `$CA$` be laid down so as to be [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] (with respect) to `$AD$`.
* Thus, `$EA$` is also [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] (with respect) to `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.14]][bookofproofs$767].
* And let `$BD$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since triangle `$ABC$` is equal to triangle `$ADE$`, and `$BAD$` (is) some other (triangle), thus as triangle `$CAB$` is to triangle `$BAD$`, so triangle `$EAD$` (is) to triangle `$BAD$` [[Prop. 5.7]][bookofproofs$1964].
* But, as (triangle) `$CAB$` (is) to `$BAD$`, so `$CA$` (is) to `$AD$`, and as (triangle) `$EAD$` (is) to `$BAD$`, so `$EA$` (is) to `$AB$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* And thus, as `$CA$` (is) to `$AD$`, so `$EA$` (is) to `$AB$`.
* Thus, in [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` and `$ADE$` the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] (are) reciprocally [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* And so, let the sides of [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` and `$ADE$` be reciprocally [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], and (thus) let `$CA$` be to `$AD$`, as `$EA$` (is) to `$AB$`.
* I say that triangle `$ABC$` is equal to triangle `$ADE$`.
* For, `$BD$` again being joined, since as `$CA$` is to `$AD$`, so `$EA$` (is) to `$AB$`, but as `$CA$` (is) to `$AD$`, so triangle `$ABC$` (is) to triangle `$BAD$`, and as `$EA$` (is) to `$AB$`, so triangle `$EAD$` (is) to triangle `$BAD$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], thus as triangle `$ABC$` (is) to triangle `$BAD$`, so triangle `$EAD$` (is) to triangle `$BAD$`.
* Thus, ([triangles][bookofproofs$6432]) `$ABC$` and `$EAD$` each have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to `$BAD$`.
* Thus, [triangle] `$ABC$` is equal to triangle `$EAD$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
* Thus, in equal [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] also having one angle equal to one (angle) the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] (are) reciprocally [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* And those [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having one angle equal to one angle for which the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] (are) reciprocally [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] are equal.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
