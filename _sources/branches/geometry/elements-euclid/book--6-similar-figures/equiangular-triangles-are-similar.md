### (Proposition 4 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In equiangular [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], and those (sides) subtending equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] correspond.
* Let `$ABC$` and `$DCE$` be equiangular [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], having angle `$ABC$` equal to `$DCE$`, and (angle) `$BAC$` to `$CDE$`, and, further, (angle) `$ACB$` to `$CED$`.
* I say that in [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` and `$DCE$` the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], and those (sides) subtending equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] correspond.

### Modern Formulation

Equiangular [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] are [similar][bookofproofs$2782].
