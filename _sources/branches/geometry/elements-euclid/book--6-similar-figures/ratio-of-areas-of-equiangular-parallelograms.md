### (Proposition 23 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Equiangular [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] have to one another the ratio compounded[^1] out of (the ratios of) their sides.
* Let `$AC$` and `$CF$` be equiangular [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] having angle `$BCD$` equal to `$ECG$`.
* I say that [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AC$` has to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CF$` the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) their sides.

### Modern Formulation

The proportion of the areas of equiangular [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] equals the product of proportions of their sides building the legs of equal angles. More precisely, if `$\boxdot{ABCD}$` and `$\boxdot{CEFG}$` are parallelograms with equal angles `$\gamma:=\angle{BCD}$` (with the legs of lengths `$a:|\overline{BC}|,$` `$b:=|\overline{DC}|$`) and `$\gamma':=\angle{BCD}$` (with the legs of lengths `$a':|\overline{CG}|,$` `$b':=|\overline{CE}|$`), then the following formula holds:

`$$\frac{\operatorname{area}\boxdot{ABCD}}{\operatorname{area}\boxdot{CEFG}}=\frac{ab\sin(\gamma)}{a'b'\sin(\gamma')}=\frac{a}{a'}\cdot\frac{b}{b'}.$$`

[^1]: In modern terminology, if two ratios are "compounded" then they are multiplied together (translator's note).
