* For let a third ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]), `$BG$`, have been taken (which is) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to `$BC$` and `$EF$`, so that as `$BC$` (is) to `$EF$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$BG$` [[Prop. 6.11]][bookofproofs$1997].
* And let `$AG$` have been joined.
* Therefore, since as `$AB$` is to `$BC$`, so `$DE$` (is) to `$EF$`, thus, alternately, as `$AB$` is to `$DE$`, so `$BC$` (is) to `$EF$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* But, as `$BC$` (is) to `$EF$`, so `$EF$` is to `$BG$`.
* And, thus, as `$AB$` (is) to `$DE$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$BG$`.
* Thus, for [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABG$` and `$DEF$`, the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* And those [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having one (angle) equal to one (angle) for which the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] are equal [[Prop. 6.15]][bookofproofs$2001].
* Thus, triangle `$ABG$` is equal to triangle `$DEF$`.
* And since as `$BC$` (is) to `$EF$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$BG$`, and if three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] then the first has a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] to the third with respect to the second [ [Def. 5.9] ][bookofproofs$1948], `$BC$` thus has a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] to `$BG$` with respect to (that) `$CB$` (has) to `$EF$`.
* And as `$CB$` (is) to `$BG$`, so triangle `$ABC$` (is) to triangle `$ABG$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` also has a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] to (triangle) `$ABG$` with respect to (that side) `$BC$` (has) to `$EF$`.
* And triangle `$ABG$` (is) equal to triangle `$DEF$`.
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` also has a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] to triangle `$DEF$` with respect to (that side) `$BC$` (has) to `$EF$`.
* Thus, [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] are to one another in the [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] of (their) corresponding sides.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
