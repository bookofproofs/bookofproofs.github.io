### (Proposition 8 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If, in a [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431], a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is drawn from the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the base then the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] around the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] are [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the whole (triangle), and to one another.
* Let `$ABC$` be a [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431] having the [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` a [right angle][bookofproofs$653], and let `$AD$` have been drawn from `$A$`, [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.12]][bookofproofs$760].
* I say that [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABD$` and `$ADC$` are each [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the whole (triangle) `$ABC$` and, further, to one another.

### Modern Formulation

If in a [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431] a straight line is drawn from the vertex of the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] to the [hypotenuse][bookofproofs$968], then the resulting two triangles are [similar][bookofproofs$2782].
