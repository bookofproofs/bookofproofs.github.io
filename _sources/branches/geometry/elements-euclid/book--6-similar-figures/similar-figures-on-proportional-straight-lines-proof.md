* Let `$AB$`, `$CD$`, `$EF$`, and `$GH$` be four [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], (such that) as `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$GH$`.
* And let the [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, [rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687] `$KAB$` and `$LCD$` have been described on `$AB$` and `$CD$` (respectively), and the [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, [rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687] `$MF$` and `$NH$` on `$EF$` and `$GH$` (respectively).
* I say that as `$KAB$` is to `$LCD$`, so `$MF$` (is) to `$NH$`.
   * For let a third ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$O$` have been taken (which is) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to `$AB$` and `$CD$`, and a third ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$P$` [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to `$EF$` and `$GH$` [[Prop. 6.11]][bookofproofs$1997].
   * And since as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$GH$`, and as `$CD$` (is) to `$O$`, so `$GH$` (is) to `$P$`, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$AB$` is to `$O$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$P$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
   * But, as `$AB$` (is) to `$O$`, so [also] `$KAB$` (is) to `$LCD$`, and as `$EF$` (is) to `$P$`, so `$MF$` (is) to `$NH$` [ [Prop. 5.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]2.
   * And, thus, as `$KAB$` (is) to `$LCD$`, so `$MF$` (is) to `$NH$`.
* And so let `$KAB$` be to `$LCD$`, as `$MF$` (is) to `$NH$`.
* I say also that as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$GH$`.
   * For if as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$EF$` (is) not to `$GH$`, let `$AB$` be to `$CD$`, as `$EF$` (is) to `$QR$` [[Prop. 6.12]][bookofproofs$1998].
   * And let the [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$SR$`, [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid down, to either of `$MF$` or `$NH$`, have been described on `$QR$` [[Prop. 6.18]][bookofproofs$2004], [[Prop. 6.21]][bookofproofs$2007].
   * Therefore, since as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$QR$`, and the [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, ([rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687]) `$KAB$` and `$LCD$` have been described on `$AB$` and `$CD$` (respectively), and the [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, ([rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687]) `$MF$` and `$SR$` on `$EF$` and `$QR$` (resespectively), thus as `$KAB$` is to `$LCD$`, so `$MF$` (is) to `$SR$` (see above).
   * And it was also assumed that as `$KAB$` (is) to `$LCD$`, so `$MF$` (is) to `$NH$`.
   * Thus, also, as `$MF$` (is) to `$SR$`, so `$MF$` (is) to `$NH$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
   * Thus, `$MF$` has the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to each of `$NH$` and `$SR$`.
   * Thus, `$NH$` is equal to `$SR$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
   * And it is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to it.
   * Thus, `$GH$` (is) equal to `$QR$`.[^1] 
   * And since `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, as `$EF$` (is) to `$QR$`, and `$QR$` (is) equal to `$GH$`, thus as `$AB$` is to `$CD$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$GH$`.
* Thus, if four [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], then [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly described, [rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687] (drawn) on them will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* And if [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly described, [rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687] (drawn) on them are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] then the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] themselves will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[^1]: Here, Euclid assumes, without proof, that if two [similar][bookofproofs$1983] figures are equal then any pair of corresponding sides is also equal (translator's note).
