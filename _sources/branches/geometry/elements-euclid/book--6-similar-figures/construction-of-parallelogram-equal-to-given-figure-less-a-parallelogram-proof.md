* Let `$AB$` have been cut in half at [point][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757], and let ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$EBFG$`, (which is) [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$D$`, have been described on `$EB$` [[Prop. 6.18]][bookofproofs$2004].
* And let [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AG$` have been completed.
* Therefore, if `$AG$` is equal to `$C$` then the thing prescribed has happened.
* For a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AG$`, equal to the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$C$`, has been applied to the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, falling short by a [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figure `$GB$` which is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$D$`.
* And if not, let `$HE$` be greater than `$C$`.
* And `$HE$` (is) equal to `$GB$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$GB$` (is) also greater than `$C$`.
* So, let ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$KLMN$` have been constructed (so as to be) both [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to `$D$`, and equal to the excess by which `$GB$` is greater than `$C$` [[Prop. 6.25]][bookofproofs$2011].
* But, `$GB$` [is] [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$D$`.
* Thus, `$KM$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$GB$` [[Prop. 6.21]][bookofproofs$2007].
* Therefore, let `$KL$` correspond to `$GE$`, and `$LM$` to `$GF$`.
* And since ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$GB$` is equal to (figure) `$C$` and ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$KM$`, `$GB$` is thus greater than `$KM$`.
* Thus, `$GE$` is also greater than `$KL$`, and `$GF$` than `$LM$`.
* Let `$GO$` be made equal to `$KL$`, and `$GP$` to `$LM$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736].
* And let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$OGPQ$` have been completed.
* Thus, [$GQ$] is equal and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$KM$` [but, `$KM$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$GB$`].
* Thus, `$GQ$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$GB$` [[Prop. 6.21]][bookofproofs$2007].
* Thus, `$GQ$` and `$GB$` are about the same diagonal [[Prop. 6.26]][bookofproofs$2012].
* Let `$GQB$` be their (common) diagonal, and let the (remainder of the) figure have been described.
* Therefore, since `$BG$` is equal to `$C$` and `$KM$`, of which `$GQ$` is equal to `$KM$`, the remaining [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$UWV$` is thus equal to the remainder `$C$`.
* And since (the complement) `$PR$` is equal to (the complement) `$OS$` [[Prop. 1.43]][bookofproofs$959], let ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$QB$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the whole ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$PB$` is equal to the whole ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$OB$`.
* But, `$OB$` is equal to `$TE$`, since side `$AE$` is equal to side `$EB$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* Thus, `$TE$` is also equal to `$PB$`.
* Let ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$OS$` have been added to both.
* Thus, the whole ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$TS$` is equal to the [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$VWU$`.
* But, [gnomon][bookofproofs$2776] `$VWU$` was shown (to be) equal to `$C$`.
* Therefore, ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$TS$` is also equal to (figure) `$C$`.
* Thus, the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$ST$`, equal to the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$C$`, has been applied to the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, falling short by the [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figure `$QB$`, which is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$D$` [inasmuch as `$QB$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$GQ$` " [Prop. 6.24] ":https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/parallelograms-about-diameter-are-similar/\,].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
