* Let the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] `$AD$` have been drawn [[Prop. 1.12]][bookofproofs$760].
* Therefore, since, in the [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431] `$ABC$`, the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) `$AD$` has been drawn from the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] at `$A$` [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the base `$BC$`, the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABD$` and `$ADC$` about the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] are [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the whole (triangle) `$ABC$`, and to one another [[Prop. 6.8]][bookofproofs$1994].
* And since `$ABC$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$ABD$`, thus as `$CB$` is to `$BA$`, so `$AB$` (is) to `$BD$` [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* And since three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], as the first is to the third, so the figure (drawn) on the first is to the [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly described, (figure) on the second [ [Prop. 6.19 corr.] ][bookofproofs$645]4.
* Thus, as `$CB$` (is) to `$BD$`, so the figure (drawn) on `$CB$` (is) to the [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly described, (figure) on `$BA$`.
* And so, for the same (reasons), as `$BC$` (is) to `$CD$`, so the figure (drawn) on `$BC$` (is) to the (figure) on `$CA$`.
* Hence, also, as `$BC$` (is) to `$BD$` and `$DC$`, so the figure (drawn) on `$BC$` (is) to the (sum of the) [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly described, (figures) on `$BA$` and `$AC$` [[Prop. 5.24]][bookofproofs$1981].
* And `$BC$` is equal to `$BD$` and `$DC$`.
* Thus, the figure (drawn) on `$BC$` (is) also equal to the (sum of the) [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly described, figures on `$BA$` and `$AC$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
* Thus, in [right-angled triangles][bookofproofs$6431], the figure (drawn) on the side subtending the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] is equal to the (sum of the) [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly described, figures on the sides surrounding the [right angle][bookofproofs$653].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
