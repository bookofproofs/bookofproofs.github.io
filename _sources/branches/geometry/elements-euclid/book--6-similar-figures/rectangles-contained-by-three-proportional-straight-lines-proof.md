* Let `$A$`, `$B$` and `$C$` be three [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], (such that) as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$C$`.
* I say that the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$A$` and `$C$` is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`.
   * Let `$D$` be made equal to `$B$` [[Prop. 1.3]][bookofproofs$736].
   * And since as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$C$`, and `$B$` (is) equal to `$D$`, thus as `$A$` is to `$B$`, (so) `$D$` (is) to `$C$`.
   * And if four [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] then the [[rectangle][bookofproofs$909]] contained by the (two) outermost is equal to the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the middle (two) [[Prop. 6.16]][bookofproofs$2002].
   * Thus, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$C$` is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$B$` and `$D$`.
   * But, the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$B$` and `$D$` is the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`.
   * For `$B$` (is) equal to `$D$`.
   * Thus, the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by `$A$` and `$C$` is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`.
* And so, let the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$C$` be equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`.
* I say that as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$C$`.
   * For, with the same construction, since the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$C$` is equal to the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$`.
   * But, the [ (square) ][bookofproofs$909] on `$B$` is the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$B$` and `$D$`.
   * For `$B$` (is) equal to `$D$`.
   * The ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$A$` and `$C$` is thus equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by `$B$` and `$D$`.
   * And if the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by the (two) outermost is equal to the ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014]) by the middle (two) then the four [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [[Prop. 6.16]][bookofproofs$2002].
   * Thus, as `$A$` is to `$B$`, so `$D$` (is) to `$C$`.
   * And `$B$` (is) equal to `$D$`.
   * Thus, as `$A$` (is) to `$B$`, so `$B$` (is) to `$C$`.
   * Thus, if three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] then the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the (two) outermost is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the middle (one).
   * And if the [rectangle][bookofproofs$909] [contained][bookofproofs$1014] by the (two) outermost is equal to the [square][bookofproofs$909] on the middle (one) then the three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] will be [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
