> A [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is said to have been **cut in extreme and mean ratio** when as the whole is to the greater segment so the greater (segment is) to the lesser.

### Modern Formulation

A [segment][bookofproofs$645] with the length `$a+b$` is cut in **inverse golden ratio** if `$$\phi:=\frac{a+b}b=\frac ba.$$`


![goldenratio](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/goldenratio.png?raw=true)


It is possible to determine that this ratio must be 
`$$\phi=\frac{\sqrt 5-1}{2}=0.61803398875\ldots$$`

This number is the inverse of the **golden ratio** `$$\Phi:=\frac{1}{\phi}=\frac{\sqrt 5+1}{2}=1.61803398875\ldots$$`
