* For since (angle) `$BAC$` is equal to `$ADB$` - for each (are) [right angles][bookofproofs$653] - and the (angle) at `$B$` (is) common to the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` and `$ABD$`, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$ACB$` is thus equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$BAD$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is equiangular to triangle `$ABD$`.
* Thus, as `$BC$`, subtending the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] in [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`, is to `$BA$`, subtending the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] in [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABD$`, so the same `$AB$`, subtending the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$C$` in [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$`, (is) to `$BD$`, subtending the equal (angle) `$BAD$` in [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABD$`, and, further, (so is) `$AC$` to `$AD$`, (both) subtending the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$B$` common to the two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is equiangular to triangle `$ABD$`, and has the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` [is] [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to triangle `$ABD$` [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* So, similarly, we can show that triangle `$ABC$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to triangle `$ADC$`.
* Thus, [[triangles][bookofproofs$6432]] `$ABD$` and `$ADC$` are each [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the whole (triangle) `$ABC$`.
* So I say that [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABD$` and `$ADC$` are also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to one another.
* For since the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] `$BDA$` is equal to the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] `$ADC$`, and, indeed, (angle) `$BAD$` was also shown (to be) equal to the (angle) at `$C$`, thus the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] at `$B$` is also equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$DAC$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, triangle `$ABD$` is equiangular to triangle `$ADC$`.
* Thus, as `$BD$`, subtending (angle) `$BAD$` in [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABD$`, is to `$DA$`, subtending the (angle) at `$C$` in [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ADC$`, (which is) equal to (angle) `$BAD$`, so (is) the same `$AD$`, subtending the [angle][bookofproofs$650] at `$B$` in [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABD$`, to `$DC$`, subtending (angle) `$DAC$` in [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] `$ADC$`, (which is) equal to the (angle) at `$B$`, and, further, (so is) `$BA$` to `$AC$`, (each) subtending [right angles][bookofproofs$653] [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* Thus, triangle `$ABD$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to triangle `$ADC$` [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* Thus, if, in a [right-angled triangle][bookofproofs$6431], a ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) is drawn from the [right angle][bookofproofs$653] [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to the base then the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] around the [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] are [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the whole (triangle), and to one another.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
