* For let `$BE$` and `$CD$` have been joined.
* Thus, triangle `$BDE$` is equal to triangle `$CDE$`.
* For they are on the same base `$DE$` and between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788] `$DE$` and `$BC$` [[Prop. 1.38]][bookofproofs$949].
* And `$ADE$` is some other triangle.
* And equal (magnitudes) have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to the same (magnitude) [[Prop. 5.7]][bookofproofs$1964].
* Thus, as triangle `$BDE$` is to [triangle] `$ADE$`, so triangle `$CDE$` (is) to triangle `$ADE$`.
* But, as triangle `$BDE$` (is) to triangle `$ADE$`, so (is) `$BD$` to `$DA$`.
* For, having the same [height][bookofproofs$1986] - (namely), the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) drawn from `$E$` [perpendicular][bookofproofs$653] to `$AB$` - they are to one another as their bases [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* So, for the same (reasons), as triangle `$CDE$` (is) to `$ADE$`, so `$CE$` (is) to `$EA$`.
* And, thus, as `$BD$` (is) to `$DA$`, so `$CE$` (is) to `$EA$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* And so, let the sides `$AB$` and `$AC$` of triangle `$ABC$` have been cut proportionally (such that) as `$BD$` (is) to `$DA$`, so `$CE$` (is) to `$EA$`.
* And let `$DE$` have been joined.
* I say that `$DE$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BC$`.
* For, by the same construction, since as `$BD$` is to `$DA$`, so `$CE$` (is) to `$EA$`, but as `$BD$` (is) to `$DA$`, so triangle `$BDE$` (is) to triangle `$ADE$`, and as `$CE$` (is) to `$EA$`, so triangle `$CDE$` (is) to triangle `$ADE$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], thus, also, as triangle `$BDE$` (is) to triangle `$ADE$`, so triangle `$CDE$` (is) to triangle `$ADE$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$BDE$` and `$CDE$` each have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to `$ADE$`.
* Thus, triangle `$BDE$` is equal to triangle `$CDE$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
* And they are on the same base `$DE$`.
* And equal [triangles][bookofproofs$6432], which are also on the same base, are also between the same [parallels][bookofproofs$788] [[Prop. 1.39]][bookofproofs$951].
* Thus, `$DE$` is [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to `$BC$`.
* Thus, if some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] is drawn [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to one of the sides of a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432], then it will cut the (other) sides of the triangle proportionally.
* And if (two of) the sides of a [triangle][bookofproofs$6432] are cut proportionally, then the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] joining the cutting ([points][bookofproofs$631]) will be [parallel][bookofproofs$788] to the remaining side of the triangle.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
