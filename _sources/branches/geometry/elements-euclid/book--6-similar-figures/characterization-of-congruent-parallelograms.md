### (Proposition 14 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In equal and equiangular [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328]. And those equiangular [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] in which the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] are equal.

* Let `$AB$` and `$BC$` be equal and equiangular [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] having the [angles][bookofproofs$650] at `$B$` equal.
* And let `$DB$` and `$BE$` be laid down [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] (with respect to one another).
* Thus, `$FB$` and `$BG$` are also [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] (with respect to one another) [[Prop. 1.14]][bookofproofs$767].
* I say that the sides of `$AB$` and `$BC$` about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], that is to say, that as `$DB$` is to `$BE$`, so `$GB$` (is) to `$BF$`.

### Modern Formulation

Two [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] are [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] if and only if their [angles][bookofproofs$650] and the products[^1] of the side lengths of an angle are in both paralleograms equal.

`$$\begin{array}{rclc} \boxdot{ADBF}\cong\boxdot{BCEG}&\Longleftrightarrow&(\angle{ADB}=\angle{BGC})&\wedge\\
&&(\angle{FAD}=\angle{EBG})&\wedge\\
&&(|\overline{DB}|\cdot|\overline{BF}|=|\overline{BE}|\cdot|\overline{GB}|).
\end{array}$$`  

[^1]: The product is equivalent to Euclid's "reciprocal proportion" `$$\frac{|\overline{DB}|}{|\overline{BE}|}=\frac{|\overline{GB}|}{|\overline{BF}|},$$` which is not to be confused with the concept of [reciprocal ratio][bookofproofs$1952].
