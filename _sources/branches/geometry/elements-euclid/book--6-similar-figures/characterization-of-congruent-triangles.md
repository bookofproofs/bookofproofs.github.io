### (Proposition 15 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> In equal [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] also having one angle equal to one (angle) the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328]. And those [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having one angle equal to one angle for which the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] (are) [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] are equal.
* Let `$ABC$` and `$ADE$` be equal [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having one angle equal to one (angle), (namely) `$BAC$` (equal) to `$DAE$`.
* I say that, in [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` and `$ADE$`, the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], that is to say, that as `$CA$` is to `$AD$`, so `$EA$` (is) to `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

Two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] are [congruent][bookofproofs$2781] if and only if they have one [angle][bookofproofs$650] equal and the products[^1] of the side lengths of this angle are in both triangles equal.

`$$\begin{array}{rclc} \bigtriangleup{ABC}\cong\bigtriangleup{ADE}&\Longleftrightarrow&(\angle{BAC}=\angle{DAE})&\wedge\\
&&(|\overline{CA}|\cdot|\overline{AB}|=|\overline{EA}|\cdot|\overline{AD}|).
\end{array}$$`  

[^1]: The product is equivalent to Euclid's "reciprocal proportion" `$$\frac{|\overline{CA}|}{|\overline{AD}|}=\frac{|\overline{EA}|}{|\overline{AB}|},$$` which is not to be confused with the concept of [reciprocal ratio][bookofproofs$1952].
