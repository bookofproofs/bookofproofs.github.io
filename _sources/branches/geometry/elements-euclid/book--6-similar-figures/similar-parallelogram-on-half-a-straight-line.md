### (Proposition 27 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> Of all the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] applied to the same [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and falling short by [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figures [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to the ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) described on half (the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]), the greatest is the [[parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]] applied to half (the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) which (is) [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to (that [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) by which it falls short.
* Let `$AB$` be a [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and let it have been cut in half at ([point][bookofproofs$631]) `$C$` [[Prop. 1.10]][bookofproofs$757].
* And let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AD$` have been applied to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, falling short by the [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figure `$DB$` (which is) applied to half of `$AB$` - that is to say, `$CB$`.
* I say that of all the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] applied to `$AB$`, and falling short by [[parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909]] figures [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, to `$DB$`, the greatest is `$AD$`.

### Modern Formulation

Let a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] ($\boxdot{AE}$) be bisected by the [segment][bookofproofs$645] `$\overline{DC}.$` For all points `$F$` lying on the segment `$\overline{DB}$`, among the parallelogramic figures ($\boxdot{AF}$ like drawn above), the parallelogram `$\boxdot{AD}$` has the greatest area.
