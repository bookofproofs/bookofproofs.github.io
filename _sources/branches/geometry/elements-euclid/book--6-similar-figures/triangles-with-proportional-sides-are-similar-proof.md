* For Let [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$FEG$`, equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$`, and (angle) `$EFG$`, equal to `$ACB$`, have been constructed on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$EF$` at the [points][bookofproofs$631] `$E$` and `$F$` on it (respectively) [[Prop. 1.23]][bookofproofs$897].
* Thus, the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] at `$A$` is equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] at `$G$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is equiangular to [triangle] `$EGF$`.
* Thus, for [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABC$` and `$EGF$`, the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], and (those) sides subtending equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] correspond [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* Thus, as `$AB$` is to `$BC$`, [so] `$GE$` (is) to `$EF$`.
* But, as `$AB$` (is) to `$BC$`, so, it was assumed, (is) `$DE$` to `$EF$`.
* Thus, as `$DE$` (is) to `$EF$`, so `$GE$` (is) to `$EF$` [[Prop. 5.11]][bookofproofs$1968].
* Thus, `$DE$` and `$GE$` each have the [same ratio][bookofproofs$1945] to `$EF$`.
* Thus, `$DE$` is equal to `$GE$` [[Prop. 5.9]][bookofproofs$1966].
* So, for the same (reasons), `$DF$` is also equal to `$GF$`.
* Therefore, since `$DE$` is equal to `$EG$`, and `$EF$` (is) common, the two (sides) `$DE$`, `$EF$` are equal to the two (sides) `$GE$`, `$EF$` (respectively).
* And base `$DF$` [is] equal to base `$FG$`.
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DEF$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$GEF$` [[Prop. 1.8]][bookofproofs$753], and triangle `$DEF$` (is) equal to triangle `$GEF$`, and the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] (are) equal to the remaining [angles][bookofproofs$650] which the equal sides subtend [[Prop. 1.4]][bookofproofs$738].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$DFE$` is also equal to `$GFE$`, and (angle) `$EDF$` to `$EGF$`.
* And since (angle) `$FED$` is equal to `$GEF$`, and (angle) `$GEF$` to `$ABC$`, angle `$ABC$` is thus also equal to `$DEF$`.
* So, for the same (reasons), (angle) `$ACB$` is also equal to `$DFE$`, and, further, the (angle) at `$A$` to the (angle) at `$D$`.
* Thus, triangle `$ABC$` is equiangular to triangle `$DEF$`.
* Thus, if two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] have [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] sides then the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] will be equiangular, and will have the [angles][bookofproofs$650] which corresponding sides subtend equal.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
