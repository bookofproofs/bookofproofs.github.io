### (Proposition 21 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> ([Rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687]) [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the same rectilinear figure are also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to one another.
* Let each of the [rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687] `$A$` and `$B$` be [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to (the [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687]) `$C$`.
* I say that `$A$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$B$`.

### Modern Formulation

The [similarity][bookofproofs$1983] of [rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687] is [transitive][bookofproofs$572].
