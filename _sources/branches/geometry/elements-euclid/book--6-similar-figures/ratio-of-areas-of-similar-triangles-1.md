### (Corollary to Proposition 19 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> So it is clear, from this, that if three [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], then as the first is to the third, so the figure (described) on the first (is) to the [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly described, (figure) on the second. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.


### Modern Formulation

With the same labels as in [Prop. 6.19][bookofproofs$2005], if `$\gamma=\gamma'$` and `$\frac {a}{b}=\frac {b}{b'}$` then 

`$$\frac{\operatorname{area}\triangle{ABC}}{\operatorname{area}\triangle{DEF}}=\frac {\frac 12ab\sin(\gamma)}{\frac 12bb'\sin(\gamma')}=\frac {a}{b'}=\frac {b^2}{b'^2}.$$`
