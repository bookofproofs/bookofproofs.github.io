* Let the square `$BC$` have been described on `$AB$` [[Prop. 1.46]][bookofproofs$965], and let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CD$`, equal to `$BC$`, have been applied to `$AC$`, overshooting by the figure `$AD$` (which is) [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$BC$` [[Prop. 6.29]][bookofproofs$2015].
* And `$BC$` is a square.
* Thus, `$AD$` is also a square.
* And since `$BC$` is equal to `$CD$`, let ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$CE$` have been subtracted from both.
* Thus, the remaining ([rectangle][bookofproofs$909]) `$BF$` is equal to the remaining (square) `$AD$`.
* And it is also equiangular to it.
* Thus, the sides of `$BF$` and `$AD$` about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] are [reciprocally][bookofproofs$1952] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [[Prop. 6.14]][bookofproofs$2000].
* Thus, as `$FE$` is to `$ED$`, so `$AE$` (is) to `$EB$`.
* And `$FE$` (is) equal to `$AB$`, and `$ED$` to `$AE$`.
* Thus, as `$BA$` is to `$AE$`, so `$AE$` (is) to `$EB$`.
* And `$AB$` (is) greater than `$AE$`.
* Thus, `$AE$` (is) also greater than `$EB$` [[Prop. 5.14]][bookofproofs$1971].
* Thus, the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$` has been cut [in extreme and mean ratio][bookofproofs$1985] at `$E$`, and `$AE$` is its greater piece.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
