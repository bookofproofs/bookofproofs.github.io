* For let `$BC$` be laid down so as to be [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$CG$`.
* Thus, `$DC$` is also [straight-on][bookofproofs$649] to `$CE$` [[Prop. 1.14]][bookofproofs$767].
* And let the [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$DG$` have been completed.
* And let some [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$K$` have been laid down.
* And let it be contrived that as `$BC$` (is) to `$CG$`, so `$K$` (is) to `$L$`, and as `$DC$` (is) to `$CE$`, so `$L$` (is) to `$M$` [[Prop. 6.12]][bookofproofs$1998].
* Thus, the ratios of `$K$` to `$L$` and of `$L$` to `$M$` are the same as the ratios of the sides, (namely), `$BC$` to `$CG$` and `$DC$` to `$CE$` (respectively).
* But, the ratio of `$K$` to `$M$` is compounded out of the ratio of `$K$` to `$L$` and (the ratio) of `$L$` to `$M$`.
* Hence, `$K$` also has to `$M$` the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) the sides (of the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909]).
* And since as `$BC$` is to `$CG$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AC$` (is) to `$CH$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], but as `$BC$` (is) to `$CG$`, so `$K$` (is) to `$L$`, thus, also, as `$K$` (is) to `$L$`, so ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$AC$` (is) to `$CH$`.
* Again, since as `$DC$` (is) to `$CE$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CH$` (is) to `$CF$` [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987], but as `$DC$` (is) to `$CE$`, so `$L$` (is) to `$M$`, thus, also, as `$L$` (is) to `$M$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CH$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CF$`.
* Therefore, since it was shown that as `$K$` (is) to `$L$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$AC$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CH$`, and as `$L$` (is) to `$M$`, so [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CH$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CF$`, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$K$` is to `$M$`, so ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$AC$` (is) to [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909] `$CF$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* And `$K$` has to `$M$` the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) the sides (of the [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909]).
* Thus, ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$AC$` also has to ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) `$CF$` the ratio compounded out of (the ratio of) their sides.
* Thus, equiangular [parallelograms][bookofproofs$909] have to one another the ratio compounded out of (the ratio of) their sides.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
