### (Proposition 11 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find a third ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to two given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].

* Let `$BA$` and `$AC$` be the [two] given [[straight lines][bookofproofs$645]], and let them be laid down encompassing a random angle.
* So it is required to find a third ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to `$BA$` and `$AC$`.

### Modern Formulation

Given two segments `$\overline{AB}$`, `$\overline{AC}$` with the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] `$$\frac{|\overline{AB}|}{|\overline{AC}|},$$` it is possible to construct a third segment `$\overline{CE}$` with a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948].
`$$\frac{|\overline{AB}|}{|\overline{AC}|}=\frac{|\overline{AC}|}{|\overline{CE}|}.$$`

This construction can be repeated `$2$` times to construct a segment with a [cubed ratio][bookofproofs$1949] or an arbitrary number `$n$` of times to construct a segment with the `$n-1$`-th [continued proportion][bookofproofs$6552].
