### (Proposition 13 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)[^1]

> To find the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to two given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* Let `$AB$` and `$BC$` be the two given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* So it is required to find the ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) in [mean proportion][bookofproofs$645]3 to `$AB$` and `$BC$`.

### Modern Formulation

It is possible to construct a [segment][bookofproofs$645] with a length being the [geometric mean][bookofproofs$645]3 of the lengths of two given other segments.

[^1]: In other words, to find the geometric mean of two given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] (translator's note).
