* Let `$BE$`, `$EC$`, `$GL$`, and `$LH$` have been joined.
* And since [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCDE$` is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$FGHKL$`, angle `$BAE$` is equal to [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$GFL$`, and as `$BA$` is to `$AE$`, so `$GF$` (is) to `$FL$` [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* Therefore, since `$ABE$` and `$FGL$` are two [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] having one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650] [proportional][bookofproofs$2328], triangle `$ABE$` is thus equiangular to triangle `$FGL$` [[Prop. 6.6]][bookofproofs$1992].
* Hence, (they are) also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990], [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$ABE$` is equal to (angle) `$FGL$`.
* And the whole [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$ABC$` is equal to the whole [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$FGH$`, on account of the similarity of the [polygons][bookofproofs$687].
* Thus, the remaining [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$EBC$` is equal to `$LGH$`.
* And since, on account of the similarity of [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] `$ABE$` and `$FGL$`, as `$EB$` is to `$BA$`, so `$LG$` (is) to `$GF$`, but also, on account of the similarity of the [polygons][bookofproofs$687], as `$AB$` is to `$BC$`, so `$FG$` (is) to `$GH$`, thus, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$EB$` is to `$BC$`, so `$LG$` (is) to `$GH$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979], and the sides about the equal [angles][bookofproofs$650], `$EBC$` and `$LGH$`, are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* Thus, triangle `$EBC$` is equiangular to triangle `$LGH$` [[Prop. 6.6]][bookofproofs$1992].
* Hence, triangle `$EBC$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to triangle `$LGH$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990], [ [Def. 6.1] ][bookofproofs$1983].
* So, for the same (reasons), triangle `$ECD$` is also [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to triangle `$LHK$`.
* Thus, the [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [polygons][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCDE$` and `$FGHKL$` have been divided into equal [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] of [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [triangles][bookofproofs$6432].
I also say that (the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432]) correspond (in proportion) to the wholes.
* That is to say, the [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328]: `$ABE$`, `$EBC$`, and `$ECD$` are the leading (magnitudes), and their (associated) following (magnitudes are) `$FGL$`, `$LGH$`, and `$LHK$` (respectively).
* (I) also (say) that [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCDE$` has a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$FGHKL$` with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding side - that is to say, (side) `$AB$` to `$FG$`.
* For let `$AC$` and `$FH$` have been joined.
* And since angle `$ABC$` is equal to `$FGH$`, and as `$AB$` is to `$BC$`, so `$FG$` (is) to `$GH$`, on account of the similarity of the [polygons][bookofproofs$687], triangle `$ABC$` is equiangular to triangle `$FGH$` [[Prop. 6.6]][bookofproofs$1992].
* Thus, [angle][bookofproofs$650] `$BAC$` is equal to `$GFH$`, and (angle) `$BCA$` to `$GHF$`.
* And since angle `$BAM$` is equal to `$GFN$`, and (angle) `$ABM$` is also equal to `$FGN$` (see earlier), the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$AMB$` is thus also equal to the remaining [ (angle) ][bookofproofs$650] `$FNG$` [[Prop. 1.32]][bookofproofs$924].
* Thus, triangle `$ABM$` is equiangular to triangle `$FGN$`.
* So, similarly, we can show that triangle `$BMC$` is also equiangular to triangle `$GNH$`.
* Thus, proportionally, as `$AM$` is to `$MB$`, so `$FN$` (is) to `$NG$`, and as `$BM$` (is) to `$MC$`, so `$GN$` (is) to `$NH$` [[Prop. 6.4]][bookofproofs$1990].
* Hence, also, [via equality][bookofproofs$1956], as `$AM$` (is) to `$MC$`, so `$FN$` (is) to `$NH$` [[Prop. 5.22]][bookofproofs$1979].
* But, as `$AM$` (is) to `$MC$`, so [triangle] `$ABM$` is to `$MBC$`, and `$AME$` to `$EMC$`.
* For they are to one another as their bases [[Prop. 6.1]][bookofproofs$1987].
* And as one of the leading (magnitudes) is to one of the following (magnitudes), so (the sum of) all the leading (magnitudes) is to (the sum of) all the following (magnitudes) [[Prop. 5.12]][bookofproofs$1969].
* Thus, as triangle `$AMB$` (is) to `$BMC$`, so (triangle) `$ABE$` (is) to `$CBE$`.
* But, as (triangle) `$AMB$` (is) to `$BMC$`, so `$AM$` (is) to `$MC$`.
* Thus, also, as `$AM$` (is) to `$MC$`, so triangle `$ABE$` (is) to triangle `$EBC$`.
* And so, for the same (reasons), as `$FN$` (is) to `$NH$`, so triangle `$FGL$` (is) to triangle `$GLH$`.
* And as `$AM$` is to `$MC$`, so `$FN$` (is) to `$NH$`.
* Thus, also, as triangle `$ABE$` (is) to triangle `$BEC$`, so triangle `$FGL$` (is) to triangle `$GLH$`, and, alternately, as triangle `$ABE$` (is) to triangle `$FGL$`, so triangle `$BEC$` (is) to triangle `$GLH$` [[Prop. 5.16]][bookofproofs$1973].
* So, similarly, we can also show, by joining `$BD$` and `$GK$`, that as triangle `$BEC$` (is) to triangle `$LGH$`, so triangle `$ECD$` (is) to triangle `$LHK$`.
* And since as triangle `$ABE$` is to triangle `$FGL$`, so (triangle) `$EBC$` (is) to `$LGH$`, and, further, (triangle) `$ECD$` to `$LHK$`, and also as one of the leading (magnitudes is) to one of the following, so (the sum of) all the leading (magnitudes is) to (the sum of) all the following [[Prop. 5.12]][bookofproofs$1969], thus as triangle `$ABE$` is to triangle `$FGL$`, so [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCDE$` (is) to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$FGHKL$`.
* But, triangle `$ABE$` has a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] to triangle `$FGL$` with respect to (that) the corresponding side `$AB$` (has) to the corresponding side `$FG$`.
* For, [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] are in the [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] of corresponding sides [[Prop. 6.14]][bookofproofs$2000].
* Thus, [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$ABCDE$` also has a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] to [polygon][bookofproofs$687] `$FGHKL$` with respect to (that) the corresponding side `$AB$` (has) to the corresponding side `$FG$`.
* Thus, [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [polygons][bookofproofs$687] can be divided into equal [numbers][bookofproofs$2315] of [similar][bookofproofs$1983] [triangles][bookofproofs$6432] corresponding (in proportion) to the wholes, and one [polygon][bookofproofs$687] has to the (other) [polygon][bookofproofs$687] a [squared ratio][bookofproofs$1948] with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding side.
* (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
