### (Proposition 18 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To describe a [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid down, to a given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] on a given [straight line][bookofproofs$645].
* Let `$AB$` be the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and `$CE$` the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687].
* So it is required to describe a [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid down, to the rectilinear figure `$CE$` on the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`.

### Modern Formulation

Given a [segment][bookofproofs$645] `$\overline{AB}$` and an arbitrary [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] it is possible to construct a [similar][bookofproofs$2782] figure containing the segment `$\overline{AB}$`  as one of its sides.
