### (Proposition 22 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> If four [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] then [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly described, [rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687] (drawn) on them will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$2328]. And if [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly described, [rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687] (drawn) on them are [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] then the [straight lines][bookofproofs$645] themselves will also be [proportional][bookofproofs$2328].
* Let `$AB$`, `$CD$`, `$EF$`, and `$GH$` be four [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] [straight lines][bookofproofs$645], (such that) as `$AB$` (is) to `$CD$`, so `$EF$` (is) to `$GH$`.
* And let the [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, [rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687] `$KAB$` and `$LCD$` have been described on `$AB$` and `$CD$` (respectively), and the [similar][bookofproofs$1983], and similarly laid out, [rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$687] `$MF$` and `$NH$` on `$EF$` and `$GH$` (respectively).
* I say that as `$KAB$` is to `$LCD$`, so `$MF$` (is) to `$NH$` (and conversely).

### Modern Formulation

Let four [similar rectilinear figures][bookofproofs$1983], `$\mathcal A,\mathcal D,\mathcal C,\mathcal D$` with four correspondings sides be given: the first side in figure `$\mathcal A$` of the length `$a:=|\overline{AB}|$`, the second side in figure `$\mathcal B$` of the length `$b:=|\overline{CD}|,$` the third side in figure `$\mathcal C$` of the length `$c:=|\overline{EF}|$` and the fourth side in figure `$\mathcal D$` of the length `$d:=|\overline{GH}|.$` Then these sides are [proportional][bookofproofs$6442] if and only if the areas of the figures are proportional, formally 

`$$\frac {a}{b}=\frac {c}{d}\Longleftrightarrow \frac {\operatorname{area}\mathcal A}{\operatorname{area}\mathcal B}=\frac {\operatorname{area}\mathcal C}{\operatorname{area}\mathcal D}.$$`
