### (Proposition 12 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To find a fourth ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to three given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* Let `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` be the three given [straight lines][bookofproofs$645].
* So it is required to find a fourth ([straight line][bookofproofs$645]) [proportional][bookofproofs$2328] to `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$`.

### Modern Formulation

Given two segments `$\overline{A}$`, `$\overline{B}$` with the [ratio][bookofproofs$1943] of lengths `$$\frac{|\overline{A}|}{|\overline{B}|},$$` and a third segment `$\overline{C}$` it is possible to construct a segment `$\overline{D}$` with the [proportion][bookofproofs$6442].
`$$\frac{|\overline{A}|}{|\overline{B}|}=\frac{|\overline{C}|}{|\overline{D}|}.$$`
