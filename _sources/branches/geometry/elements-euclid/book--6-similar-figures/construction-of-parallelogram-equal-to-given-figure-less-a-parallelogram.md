### (Proposition 8 from Book 6 of Euclid's “Elements”)

> To apply a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], equal to a given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687], to a given [straight line][bookofproofs$645], (the applied [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) falling short by a [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figure [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to a given ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]). It is necessary for the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] [to which it is required to apply an equal ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909])] not to be greater than the ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) described on half (of the [straight line][bookofproofs$645]) and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the deficit.
* Let `$AB$` be the given [straight line][bookofproofs$645], and `$C$` the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] to which the ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) applied to `$AB$` is required (to be) equal, [being] not greater than the ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) described on half of `$AB$` and [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to the deficit, and `$D$` the ([parallelogram][bookofproofs$909]) to which the deficit is required (to be) [similar][bookofproofs$1983].
* So it is required to apply a [parallelogram][bookofproofs$909], equal to the given [rectilinear figure][bookofproofs$687] `$C$`, to the [straight line][bookofproofs$645] `$AB$`, falling short by a [parallelogrammic][bookofproofs$909] figure which is [similar][bookofproofs$1983] to `$D$`.

### Modern Formulation

This proposition is a geometric solution of the quadratic equation[^1] `\[x^2 - \alpha\,x +\beta = 0.\]`

[^1]: Here, `$x$` is the ratio of a side of the deficit to the corresponding side of figure `$D$`, `$\alpha$` is the ratio of the length of `$AB$` to the length of that side of figure `$D$` which corresponds to the side of the deficit running along `$AB$`, and `$\beta$` is the ratio of the areas of figures `$C$` and `$D$`. The constraint corresponds to the condition `$\beta < \alpha^2/4$` for the equation to have real roots. Only the smaller root of the equation is found. The larger root can be found by a similar method (translator's note).
