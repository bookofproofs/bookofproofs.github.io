Geometry is probably the oldest branch of mathematics. It developed, as people decided to give up their tribal life and settle down. This created the need to measure the land to claim its ownership. The word **geometry** (Greek:  "geos" - the Earth and "metrain" - to measure) actually means the **measurement of the earth**.

In this branch of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>, we will start with the history of geometry and then, in the theoretical part, we will follow its historical development, starting with different axiomatic systems as they evolved during centuries.
