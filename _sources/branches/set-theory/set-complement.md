Let `$X$` and `$A$` be [sets][bookofproofs$550]. Based on the [conjunction][bookofproofs$712] "`\(\wedge\)`", and the [negation][bookofproofs$714] "`\(\neg\)`", the **complement** of the [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(A\subseteq  X\)` is defined by

`\[A^C :=\{x \mid x\in X\wedge x\notin A\}.\]`

In particular, `$A^C\subseteq X.$` Thus, for a subset `$A\subseteq X$`, The complement `$A^C$` contains all elements `\(x\)` of `\(X\)`, which are not contained in `\(A\)`. 

A set complement can be drawn in a Venn diagram using its [universal set][bookofproofs$7984] as follows:

### Examples:

1. The complement of the even numbers in the universal set of all whole numbers are the odd numbers.
