If `$A$` and `$B$` are the [set of real numbers][bookofproofs$6194] `$A=B=\mathbb R$`, the [graph of a function][bookofproofs$6679] `$f:\mathbb R\mapsto \mathbb R$` can be drawn in a plane. In this case, the coordinates of the graph `$(x,y)\in \Gamma_f$` are exactly the pairs of numbers `$x,y\in \mathbb R$`, for which `$f(x)=y$`. As an example, a graph of the function `$y=f(x):=x^2$` is shown:
