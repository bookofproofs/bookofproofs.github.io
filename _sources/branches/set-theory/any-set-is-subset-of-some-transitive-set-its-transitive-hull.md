The following lemma shows that transitive sets play a prominent role in the set theory. They are omnipresent.

---

For every set `$X$` there exists a [transitive set][bookofproofs$720] `$Y$`, such that `$X$` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of `$Y,$` formally `$X\subseteq Y.$` This set is called the **transitive hull** of the set `$X$`.
