* Assume, the [set complement][bookofproofs$6829] `$B^C$` was an "absolute complement".
* This would mean that the [set union][bookofproofs$6827] `$B^C\cup B$` would contain all sets.
* This is a [contradiction][bookofproofs$744] to a [previously proven corollary][bookofproofs$8020] of the [axiom of separation][bookofproofs$675].
