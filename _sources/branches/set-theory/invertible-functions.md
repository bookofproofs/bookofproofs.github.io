The c[haracterization of bijective functions][bookofproofs$8545] motivates the following definition.

---

A [function][bookofproofs$592]  `\(f:A\to B\)` is called **invertible**, if there exists a function `\(f^{-1}:B\to A\)` such that `$f^{-1}(y)=x$` if and only if `$f(x)=y.$` If `\(f\)` is invertible, then `\(f^{-1}\)` is called the **inverse** function of `\(f\)`.
