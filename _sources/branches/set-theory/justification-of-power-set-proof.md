* Let `$X$` be a set.
* The [axiom of power][bookofproofs$716] set ensures the existence of a set which contains all [subsets][bookofproofs$552] of `$X.$`
* The [axiom of separation][bookofproofs$675] ensures the existence of a set which contains exactly the [subsets][bookofproofs$552] of `$X.$`
* The [axiom of extensionality][bookofproofs$551] ensures the uniqueness of such a set.
* This set is the power set `$\mathcal P(X).$`
