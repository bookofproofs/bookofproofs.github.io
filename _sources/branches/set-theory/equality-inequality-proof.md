Please note that [there is no set of all sets][bookofproofs$8020]. Therefore, our [universal set][bookofproofs$7984] `$U$` is some given set. We want to show that the [equality of sets][bookofproofs$6841] "`$=$`" fulfills all the defining properties of an [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574] for every [subset][bookofproofs$552] of `$A\subseteq U:$`

* For any subset `$A\subseteq U$` we have `$A=A$` by the axiom of [extensionality][bookofproofs$551]. Thus "`$=$`" is [reflexive][bookofproofs$572].
* If `$A,B\subset U$`, then, by the same axiom, from `$A=B$` it follows `$B=A.$` Thus, "`$=$`" is [symmetric][bookofproofs$572].
* If `$A,B,C\subset U$`, then, by the same axiom, from `$A=B$`, and `$B=C$`, it follows `$A=C$`. Thus, "`$=$`" is "[transitive][bookofproofs$572].
