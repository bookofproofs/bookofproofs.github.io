In this part, we will be dealing with _cardinal nubers_ or short _cardinals_. Cardinals are a mathematical clarification of the intuitive concept of how many elements a set has.  For finite sets, it is possible to "count" the elements and tell the number corresponding to the number of elements in this set, or its _cardinality_. It turns out that cardinals represent the cardinalities of both, finite and infinite sets. But not only this. Cardinals do not only represent the cardinalities of other sets of but they _are_ sets themselves. In the following text, we will see, how this all fits together.
