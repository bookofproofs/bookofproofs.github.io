### Poset Version

If a [poset][bookofproofs$576] `$(V,\preceq)$` has the property that each of its non-empty [subsets][bookofproofs$552] `$S\subseteq V$` has a [minimum][bookofproofs$7995], then it is called a **well-ordered** set. Moreover, the [partial order][bookofproofs$576] "`$\preceq$`" is called a **well-order** on `$V.$`

### Strictly-ordered Set Version

If a [strictly ordered set][bookofproofs$7993] `$(V,\prec)$` has the property, that each of its non-empty [subsets][bookofproofs$552] `$S\subseteq V$` has a [minimal element][bookofproofs$7995], it is called a **well-ordered** set, and the strict order "`$\prec$`" is called a **well-order** on `$V.$`
