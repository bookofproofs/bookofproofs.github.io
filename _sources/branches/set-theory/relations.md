*Relations* describe the relationships between different elements of the same [set][bookofproofs$550] or different sets. They are another fundamental concept in mathematics, for instance, they provide a foundation of [functions][bookofproofs$592], which turn out to be special cases of relations.

We will see in this part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong> that, from the set-theoretical point of view, relations are sets. As such, being the [set element][bookofproofs$550] "`$\in$`" or being the subset "`$\subseteq$`" are not relations, but [predicates][bookofproofs$6223]. Loosely speaking, they _are_ relations in a metalanguage, which deals with sets.

Apart from these "metarelations", there are many examples of "usual" relations we deal with in mathematics, for instance  [order relations][bookofproofs$189] "`$\ge$`", the [perpendicularity][bookofproofs$653] "`$\perp$`" of straight lines in a plane, the [equivalence relations][bookofproofs$574] and many, many more.
