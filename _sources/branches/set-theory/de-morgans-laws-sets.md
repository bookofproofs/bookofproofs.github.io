Let `$A,B$` be two [sets][bookofproofs$550]. The following laws hold for the [set intersection][bookofproofs$6828] "`$\cap$`", [set union][bookofproofs$6827] "`$\cup$`" and [set complent][bookofproofs$6829] "$^C$":

`$$\begin{array}{rcl}(A\cap B)^C&=&(A^C)\cup (B^C),\\(A\cup B)^C&=&(A^C)\cap (B^C).\end{array}$$`


This law is named after [Augustus De Morgan][bookofproofs$De_Morgan] (1806 - 1871).
