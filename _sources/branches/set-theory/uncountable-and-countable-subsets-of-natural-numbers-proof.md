### Ad `$(1)$`

* The set of all functions `$2^{\mathbb N}=\{f\mid \mathbb N\to \{0,1\}\}$` is [equipotent][bookofproofs$978] to the [power set][bookofproofs$6831] `$\mathcal P(\mathbb N)$`, since every [function][bookofproofs$592] mapping all [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] to the set `$\{0,1\}$` is an [indicator function][bookofproofs$8299] (see also explanation about the [connection between the power set and mapping to two elements][bookofproofs$8301])
* Thus, `$|\mathcal P(\mathbb N)|=|2^{\mathbb N}|.$`
* On the other hand, there is [no surjective function of a set to its power set][bookofproofs$8047], and therefore neither a [surjective function][bookofproofs$770].
* Trivially, there is an [injective function][bookofproofs$769] `$f:\mathbb N\to\mathcal P(\mathbb N)$` (just set `$f(a)=\{a\}$` for all `$a\in\mathbb N.$`)
* [Comparing both cardinal numbers][bookofproofs$984] yields `$|\mathbb N| < \mathcal P(\mathbb N)=2^{\mathbb N}.$`
* Thus, `$2^{\mathbb N}$` is [uncountable][bookofproofs$772].
### Ad `$(2)$`
