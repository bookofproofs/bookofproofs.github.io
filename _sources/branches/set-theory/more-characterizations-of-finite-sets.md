Let `$X,Y$` be [finite sets][bookofproofs$985] with equal [cardinalities][bookofproofs$980] `$|X|=|Y|<\infty.$` Then:

1. If `$f:X\to Y,$` is [surjective][bookofproofs$770], then `$f$` is [injective][bookofproofs$769].
1. If `$f:X\to Y,$` is injective, then `$f$` is surjective.

Note: This implies `$$f\text{ invective }\Leftrightarrow f\text{ surjective }\Leftrightarrow f\text{ bijective }$$`


#3 If `$|Y| < |X|,$` then no injective function `$f:X\to Y$` exists.
#3 If `$|Y| < |X|,$` then no injective function `$f:X\to Y$` exists.
