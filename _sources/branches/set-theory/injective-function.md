A [function][bookofproofs$592] `\(f:A\mapsto B\)` is called **injective**, (or **injection**, or **embedding**, or, less formally, *one-to-one*), if for all `\(a_1,a_2\in A\)` with `$f(a_1)=f(a_2)$` it follows that `$a_1=a_2.$` This corresponds to the [left-unique][bookofproofs$1308] property, in addition to the defining properties of a function.

By a [contraposition][bookofproofs$1330] argument the following definition is equivalent: For all `\(a_1,a_2\in A\)`, it follows from `$a_1\neq a_2$` that `$f(a_1)\neq f(a_2).$`

### Notes

* An injective function allows for every `$b\in B$` _at most_ an `$a\in A$` such that `$f(a)=b.$`
* In other words, either there is exactly one or no such element `$a\in A.$`
