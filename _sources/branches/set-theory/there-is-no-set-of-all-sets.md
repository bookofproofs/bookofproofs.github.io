As you recall from the [historical development][bookofproofs$8012], Cantor's [naive set definition][bookofproofs$550] also allowed constructing a "set of all sets".
With the [axiom of separation][bookofproofs$675], such a set cannot exist.

There is no such set `$X$` which contains the set `$\{z\in X\mid z\not\in z\}$` as an element. In other words, a "set of all sets" does not exist.
