Let `$f:A\to B$` be a [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f$` is [bijective][bookofproofs$771] if and only if there is a _unique_ function `$g:B\to A$` such that:
* its [composition][bookofproofs$1314] with `$f$` is the [identity function][bookofproofs$371] on `$A$`, formally `$g\circ f=id_A$`, and
* `$f$`'s composition with `$g$` is the identity function on `$B$`, formally `$f\circ g=id_B.$`
