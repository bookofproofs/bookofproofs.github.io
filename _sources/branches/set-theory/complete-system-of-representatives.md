The [quotient set][bookofproofs$7991] is the result of an abstraction process in our mind: It does not play any role which element of an equivalence class `$[a]$` we choose to regain the same class. It can be any element `$x\in V$`, we only have to make sure that `$x\sim a$` and we achieve immediately `$[x]=[a]$`. This motivates the following definition:

Let `$V/_R$` be a [quotient set][bookofproofs$7991] generated by a given [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574] `$R\subseteq V\times V.$` The element `$a\in V$`,  of which there is an [equivalence class][bookofproofs$7990] `$[a]\in V/_R$`, is called a **representative** of `$[a]$`. A [set][bookofproofs$550] of representatives `$Q=\{a\in V : [a]\in V/_R\}$` is called a **complete system of representatives** of `$V/_R.$`
