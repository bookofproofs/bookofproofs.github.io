Since [ordinals are downward closed][bookofproofs$727], the elements `$\alpha, \beta\in X$` are ordinals themselves if `$(X,\in_X)$` is an [ordinal][bookofproofs$723]. This leads to the following lemma, concerning _any_ ordinals.

For two [ordinals][bookofproofs$723] `$\alpha$` and `$\beta$` the following are equivalent:

* `$\alpha\subseteq\beta$`
* `$\alpha\in\beta$` or `$\alpha = \beta.$`
