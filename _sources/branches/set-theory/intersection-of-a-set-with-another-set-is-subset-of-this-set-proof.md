### Context

* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [sets][bookofproofs$550].
* Let `$A\cap B$` be the [intersection][bookofproofs$6828] of `$A$` and `$B$`.
* We will prove `$A\cap B\subseteq A$`. The proof for `$A\cap B\subseteq B$` is similar. 

### Hypothesis

* Let `$x\in A\cap B$`. 


### Implications

* By the [definition of intersection][bookofproofs$6827], it is true that `$x\in A\wedge x\in B.$`
* By the [truth table of conjunction][bookofproofs$713] "and" ("$\wedge$") it must be true that `$x\in A$`. 

### Conclusion

* Since `$x\in A$` for all `$x\in A\cap B$`, then by definition of [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$A\cap B\subseteq A$`.
