* By hypothesis, `\(f:A\mapsto B\)` and `\(g:B\mapsto C\)` are [functions][bookofproofs$592].
* Let `$f\subseteq A\times B$` and `$g\subseteq B\times C$` be the corresponding corresponding [relations][bookofproofs$571].
* Let `$g\circ f\subseteq A\times C$` be the [composition][bookofproofs$1309] of these relations.
* We have [already shown][bookofproofs$1310] that `$g\circ f$` is [right-unique][bookofproofs$1308].
* We have [already shown][bookofproofs$1312] that `$g\circ f$` is [left-total][bookofproofs$1308].
* By definition of a [function][bookofproofs$592], `$g\circ f$` is a function.
