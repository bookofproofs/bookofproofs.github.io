Let `\(X\)` be a [set][bookofproofs$550]. A set `\(A\)` is called a **subset** of `\(X\)` and denoted by `\(A\subseteq X\)`, if each element of `\(A\)` is also an element of `\(X\)`. Equivalently, X is a **superset** of `\(A\)`, denoted as `\(X\supseteq A\)`.

If, in addition, `\(A\neq X\)`, then `\(A\)` is called a **proper subset** of `\(X\)` and denoted by `\(A\subset X\)`. Equivalently, X is then a **proper superset** of `\(A\)`, and denoted as `\(X\supset A\)`. 

We can draw supersets and subsets as Venn diagrams. In the following figure, `$B$` is a subset of `$A$` and `$A$` is a subset of the universal set `$U$`:

### Examples

1. The set of all animals is the superset of all dogs.
1. The set of `$A=\{\text{Italy,Georgia,Brasil}\}$` is a subset of the set `$C=\{x:\, x \text{ is a country}\}.$` 
1. The set of `$\mathbb Z$` of all integers is a subset of the set `$\mathbb Q$` of all rational numbers.
