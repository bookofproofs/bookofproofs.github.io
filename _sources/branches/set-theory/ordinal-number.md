The [corollary to the Mostowski's Theorem][bookofproofs$8087] provides a possibility to create a [transitive set][bookofproofs$720] `$(X,\in_X)$` which is ordered with respect to the [contained relation][bookofproofs$8066] `$\in_X$` in exactly the same way as any given [strictly-ordered][bookofproofs$7993], [well-ordered][bookofproofs$7997] set. 

This leads to a possibility for choosing transitive sets, which are well-ordered with respect to the [contained relation][bookofproofs$8066] `$\in_X$` as standard representatives of all strictly-ordered, well-ordered sets. This is the concept _ordinals_ or _ordinal numbers_.

An **ordinal** (or **ordinal number**)[^1] is a [transitive set][bookofproofs$720] `$(X,\in_X)$` which is [strictly-ordered][bookofproofs$7993] and [well-ordered][bookofproofs$7997] with respect to the [contained relation][bookofproofs$8066] `$\in_X.$` 

[^1]: Please note that ordinal numbers are not "numbers" in the traditional sense, but sets.
