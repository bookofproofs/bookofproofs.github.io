The introduced set-theoretical concepts allow us to formulate a famous lemma which was stated by "Max Zorn":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/max-august-zorn/ (1906 - 1993).

If every [chain][bookofproofs$6191] `$S\subseteq X$` in a [poset][bookofproofs$576] `$(V,\preceq )$` has an [upper bound][bookofproofs$7995], then the poset `$V$` contains at least one [maximal][bookofproofs$7995] element.
