In [comparing cardinal numbers][bookofproofs$984] we have set `$|A| < |B|,$` if there is an injective, but no surjective function `$f:A\to B$`. This is motivated by a result by [Georg Cantor][bookofproofs$Cantor] (1845 - 1918) who realized that there is no surjective function between any set and its power set:

There is no surjective function between a given set `$S,$` and its [power set][bookofproofs$6831] `$\mathcal P(S).$`
