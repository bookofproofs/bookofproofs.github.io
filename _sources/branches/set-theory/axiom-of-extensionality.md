If each element of the set `\(X\)` is also an element of the set `\(Y\)` and vice versa, then both are the same. In other words, a set is determined by its elements[^1], which is known as the **extensionality principle**.

`\[\forall X~\forall Y (\forall z~(z\in X \Leftrightarrow z\in  Y)\Rightarrow X=Y)\]`
