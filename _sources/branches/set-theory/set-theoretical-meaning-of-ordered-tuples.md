Let `\(X\)` be a [set][bookofproofs$550]. If for `$n\ge 1,$` two [$n$-tuples][bookofproofs$747] `$(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$` and `$(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$` of elements of `$X$` are equal, then `$x_i=y_i$` for all `$i=1,\ldots,n,$` formally

`$$(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=(y_1,\ldots,y_n)\Rightarrow x_1=y_1\wedge \ldots \wedge x_n=y_n.$$`
