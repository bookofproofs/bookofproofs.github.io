* In order to show that `$(X,\in_X)$` is a [strictly ordered set][bookofproofs$7993], we have to show that the [contained][bookofproofs$8066] relation `$\in_X$` is a [strict total order][bookofproofs$7993], i.e. that it is [irreflexive][bookofproofs$575], [asymmetric][bookofproofs$575], [transitive][bookofproofs$572], and [connex][bookofproofs$1308].
* Since we require that it is transitive and connex, it remains to be shown that it is irreflexive ($x\not\in_X x$ for all `$x\in X$`) and asymmetric (if `$x\in_X y$`, then `$y\not\in_X x$` for all `$x,y\in X$`). 
* But these two properties follow immediately from the [axiom of foundation][bookofproofs$717].
