In a [strictly ordered set][bookofproofs$7993] `$(V,\prec)$`, for all elements `\(a,b\in V\)` exactly one of the following cases holds:

* Either `$a \prec b$` ($a$ is [smaller][bookofproofs$6190] than `$b$`),
* or `$a \succ b$` ($a$ is [greater][bookofproofs$6190] than `$b$`).
* else `$a=b$` ($a$ [equals][bookofproofs$6190] `$b$`).

Because of these three possibilities, the strict order "`$\prec$`" is sometimes also called a **trichotomous** order.
