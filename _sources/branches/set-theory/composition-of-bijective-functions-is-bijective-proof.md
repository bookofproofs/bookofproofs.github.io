* By hypothesis, Let `$f:A\to B$` and `$g:B\to C$` are [bijective][bookofproofs$771].
* Since `$f,g$` are bijective, `$f,g$` are in particular [injective][bookofproofs$769].
* By the [corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$6864], the [composition][bookofproofs$1314] `$(g\circ f)$` is also injective.
* Since `$f,g$` are bijective, `$f,g$` are in particular [surjective][bookofproofs$770].
* By the [corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$123], the [composition][bookofproofs$1314] `$(g\circ f)$` is also surjective.
* Altogether, the composition `$(g\circ f)$` is bijective.
