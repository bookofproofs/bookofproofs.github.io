* The existence of a superset `$X$` is ensured by the [axiom of existence][bookofproofs$8015].
* The existence of a [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$A\subseteq X$` follows immediately from the [axiom of separation][bookofproofs$675]. Thus, we have `$A=\{z\in X\mid p(z,X_1,\ldots,X_n)\}$` for some logical formula `$p(z,X_1,\ldots,X_n).$`
* The [axiom of extensionality][bookofproofs$551] ensures the uniqueness of such a set.

Remark: In particular, a subset can be empty, which is ensured by the [axiom of empty set][bookofproofs$666].
