* According to the [a property of transitive sets][bookofproofs$721], stating that with any [transitive set][bookofproofs$720] `\(X\)` also `\(X\cup\{X\}\)` must be transitive.
* Thus, the building rule `\(s(\alpha)=\alpha\cup\{\alpha\}\)` ensures the transitivity of `\(s(\alpha)\)`. 
* Since all of its elements `$x\in s(\alpha)$` are also transitive sets, it must be an [ordinal][bookofproofs$723], because of [equivalent notions of ordinals][bookofproofs$8089].
