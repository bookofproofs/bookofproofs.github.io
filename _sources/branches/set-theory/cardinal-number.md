The next key idea of <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor/">Georg Cantor</a> (1845 - 1918) was to use a given set `$A$` as a representative for all sets, which are equipotent to it. In order to be able to do so, Cantor realized that any given set can be selected as a representative of a whole class of sets which are equipotent to it. This abstraction process allowed Cantor to ignore _which_ elements a set has and to concentrate on _how many_ elements it has.

Let `$\mathcal X$` be a [universal set][bookofproofs$7984]. Being [equipotent][bookofproofs$978] for any two sets `\(A,B\subseteq \mathcal X\)` is an [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574] `\(\sim\)` on `\(\mathcal X\)`. Each [equivalence class][bookofproofs$7990] `$[A]\in \mathcal X/\sim$`[^1] is called the **cardinal number** or **cardinality** of `$A$`. 

Instead of `$[A]$`, the notation `$|A|$` is more commonly used for the cardinality of `$A.$` Note that all **cardinalities** are disjoint. 



[^1]: "`$\mathcal X/\sim$`" denotes the [quotient set][bookofproofs$7991] induced by the relation of being equipotent.
