Let `\(V\)` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] and let `\(R\subseteq V\times V\)` be a [relation][bookofproofs$571] `\(R\)` is called an **equivalence relation**, if it is [reflexive][bookofproofs$572], [symmetric][bookofproofs$572] and [transitive][bookofproofs$572]. Elements of `$V$` with `$aRb$` are called **equivalent**. Other common notations are `\(a\sim_R b\)` or `\(a\sim b\)`, if `$R$` is known from the context.
