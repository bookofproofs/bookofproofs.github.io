It turns out that the occurence of forbidden self-contained sets is only a technical problem and we can circumvent it by skillfully defining a _contained relation_, as follows:

Let `$X$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550]. The **contained** relation `$\in_X\subseteq X \times X$` is a [relation][bookofproofs$571] defined by `$$\in_X:=\{(a,b)\in X\times X\mid a\in b\}.$$`
