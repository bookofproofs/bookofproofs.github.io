### Context

* Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [sets][bookofproofs$550].
* We will prove `$A\subseteq A\cup B$`. The proof for `$B\subseteq A\cup B$` is similar. 

### Hypothesis

* Let `$x\in A$`. 


### Implications

* Since `$x\in A$`, by the [truth table of disjunction][bookofproofs$713] "or" ("$\vee$") it is true that `$x\in A \vee x\in B$`. 
* By the [definition of union][bookofproofs$6827], `$x\in A\cup B.$`



### Conclusion

* Since `$x\in A\cup B$` for all `$x\in A$`, then by definition of [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$A\subseteq A\cup B$`.
