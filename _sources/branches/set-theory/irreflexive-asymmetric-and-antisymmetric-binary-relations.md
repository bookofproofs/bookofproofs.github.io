The abovementioned reflexive, symmetric and transitive relations and the following three further properties of binary relations are important for the concept of [order relations][bookofproofs$189], which we also will be discussing later.

Let `\(V\)` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] and `\(R\subseteq V\times V\)` be a [relation][bookofproofs$571] `\(R\)` is called:

1. **irreflexive**, if `\((x,x)\not\in R\)` for all `\(x\in V\)`,
1. **asymmetric**, if from `$(x,y)\in R$` it follows `$(y,x)\not\in R$` for all `\(x,y\in V\)`,
1. **asymmetric**, if from `$(x,y)\in R$` it follows `$(y,x)\not\in R$` for all `\(x,y\in V\)`,
