A [function][bookofproofs$592] `\(f:A\mapsto B\)` is called **surjective** (or **surjection**), if for every `\(y\in B\)` there is an `\(x\in A\)` with `\(f(x)=b\)`. This corresponds to the [right-total][bookofproofs$1308] property, in addition to its the properties of a function.

### Notes

* A surjective function aims at _every_ element `$b\in B.$` 
* In other words, every element `$b\in B$` has a [fiber][bookofproofs$592].
* In other words, the [image][bookofproofs$592] `$f(A)$` is the whole set `$B.$`
