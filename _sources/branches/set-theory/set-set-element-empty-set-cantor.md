In the [historical development of set theory][bookofproofs$8012], it was mentioned that <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Russell/">Russell</a> demonstrated, the following classical definition is not sufficient since it leads to paradoxical constructs. If you are a beginning student of the set theory, the classical definition of <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor/">Georg Cantor</a> (1845 - 1918) is a good starting point, because it is highly intuitive.

(Original, naive set definition of <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor/">Georg Cantor</a> (1895))[^1]

A **set** is a combination of well-distinguishable, mathematical objects. Let `\(X\)` be a set. 
* If an object `\(x\)` belongs to the set `\(X\)`, it is called ist **element** and written as `\(x\in X\)`. 
* We write `\(x\notin X\)`, if `\(x\)` is not an element of the set `\(X\)`. 
* If `$X$` has no elements, we call `$X$` **empty**, and write `$X=\emptyset,$` otherwise *non-empty* and write  `$X\neq\emptyset.$`

[^1]: Nowadays, we use the [Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms][bookofproofs$1427] (ZFA) to define sets.
