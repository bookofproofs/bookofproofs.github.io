Let `$X$` be an arbitrary [set][bookofproofs$550], and let `$I$` be a [non-empty set][bookofproofs$550], called the **index set**. A **sets family** `$X_{i}{\text{ , }}i\in I$` is a [map][bookofproofs$64] `$I\to \mathcal P(X),$` where `$\mathcal P(X)$` is the [power set][bookofproofs$6831] of `$X.$` 

### Notes

* In other words, each `$X_i$` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of `$X.$`
* The elements `$i\in I$` are called **indices** of the family of sets `$X_{i}{\text{ , }}i\in I.$`
