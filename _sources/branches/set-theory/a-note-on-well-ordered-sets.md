In literature, the above two different versions of [well-ordered][bookofproofs$7997] sets can be found, one for [partial orders][bookofproofs$576] and one for [strict orders][bookofproofs$7993]. Because partial orders are [reflexive][bookofproofs$572], and because strict orders are [irreflexive][bookofproofs$575], the alternative definitions require the existence of either a [minimum][bookofproofs$7995] or a [minimal][bookofproofs$7995] element in the subset `$S.$` Both definitions have their advantages and disadvantages, but only the latter has the advantage that it is compatible with the definition of [well-founded][bookofproofs$8058] relations, which are very useful in introducing the [ordinal numbers][bookofproofs$112], which we learn more about later.  

For the time being, we will use the poset version, unless otherwise stated.
