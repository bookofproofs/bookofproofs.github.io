Not only [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718], but also [ordinal numbers][bookofproofs$723] are [well-ordered][bookofproofs$7997]. The usual [recursion][bookofproofs$8679] can be extended to ordinal numbers. However, functions defined like are only of theoretical interest, since they have only little to do with practical combinatorial problems like it was the case for usual recursive functions.

Let `$X$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] and let `$\Omega$` be the proper [class of all ordinals][bookofproofs$8091]. A [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f:\mathbb \Omega\to X$` can be defined by specifying
1. the **initial values** of `$f(\alpha)$` for all `$\alpha \subseteq \omega$` and some ordinal number `$\omega\in\mathbb\Omega,$` and
1. the **initial values** of `$f(\alpha)$` for all `$\alpha \subseteq \omega$` and some ordinal number `$\omega\in\mathbb\Omega,$` and
