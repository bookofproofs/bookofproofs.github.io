If the two sets of a binary relation are in fact one and the same set, other properties become relevant. The following properties are fundamental to the concept of [equivalence relations][bookofproofs$122], which we will learn about later.

Let `\(V\)` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] and `\(R\subseteq V\times V\)` be a binary [relation][bookofproofs$571] `\(R\)` is called:

1. **reflexive**, if `\(xRx\)` for all `\(x\in V\)`
1. **symmetric**, if from `\(xRy\)` it follows that `$yRx$` for all `\(x,y\in V\)`.
1. **symmetric**, if from `\(xRy\)` it follows that `$yRx$` for all `\(x,y\in V\)`.
