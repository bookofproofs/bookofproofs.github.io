The converse of the [previous proposition][bookofproofs$7998] is not true in general, for instance, the ordered set of integers `$(\mathbb Z,\ge)$` is a chain, but it is not well-ordered, since not every of it subsets contains a minimum, e.g. the infinite subset `$\{-1,-2,-3,\ldots \}.$` It is only true, if `$V$` is finite:

Every finite [chain][bookofproofs$6191] `$V$` is [well-ordered][bookofproofs$7997].
