Let `$V$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] and let `$R\subseteq V\times V$` be a binary [relation][bookofproofs$571] `$R$` is called **extensional** if all elements of `$x\in V$` are uniquely determined by ordered pairs `$(z,x)\in R,$` formally

`$$\{z\in V\mid zRx\}=\{z\in V\mid zRy\} \Rightarrow x=y,$$`

or, by [contraposition][bookofproofs$1328],

`$$x\neq y  \Rightarrow \{z\in V\mid zRx\}\neq \{z\in V\mid zRy\} .$$`
