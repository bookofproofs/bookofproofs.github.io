The third important type of order relation is the so-called _strict total order_, a formal definition of which you can find below. It is an order relation, in which each element is not comparable to itself. This means that the order relation is irreflexive. An example of a strictly ordered set is `$(\mathbb N,<)$`. The irreflexive order relation "`$<$`" puts all natural numbers into the same order as it was the case in the totally ordered chain `$(\mathbb N,\le)$`, in which "`$\le$`" was reflexive. Moreover, a strict order is antisymmetric, i.e. `$a < b$` implies `$b\not < a$`.

A [total order][bookofproofs$6191] "`$\preceq$`", in which the property of being [reflexive][bookofproofs$572] is replaced by the property of being [irreflexive][bookofproofs$575] and the property of being [antisymmetric][bookofproofs$575] is replaced by the property of being [asymmetric][bookofproofs$575] is called a **strict total order**.

A chain `$(V,\preceq )$` with a strict total order "`$\preceq$`$ is called a **strictly-ordered** set. We will change the notation to `$(V,\prec)$`, whenever we want to indicate that we deal with a strictly-ordered set and not with a chain.
