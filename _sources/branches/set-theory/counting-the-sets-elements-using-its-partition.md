The following proposition is a generalization of the [previous lemma (no. 1) ][bookofproofs$988].
---

Let `\(S\)` be a finite set and let its subsets `\(S_1,\ldots S_n\subset S\)` form a [partition][bookofproofs$7991] of `\(S\)`, i.e. 

`\[S=\bigcup_{i=1}^n S_i,~~~~~~S_i\cap S_j=\emptyset,\forall i\neq j.\]`

Further let the cardinalities `\(|S_i|\)` be known for all `\(i=1,\ldots n\)`. Then the [cardinality][bookofproofs$980]  of the set `\(S\)` is given by the sum of the known cardinalities of its subsets.

`\[|S|=\sum_{i=1}^n |S_i|.\]`
