Historically, the Italian [Cesare Burali-Forti](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Burali-Forti/) (1861 - 1931) discovered that using the  [Cantor's definition of a set][bookofproofs$550], we could build the set `$\Omega$` of all [ordinal numbers][bookofproofs$723]. However, this set would lead to the following [paradox][bookofproofs$7847]:

* Since all elements `\(\alpha\in\Omega\)` are ordinals, they are also [transitive sets][bookofproofs$720].
* Therefore it follows `\(\alpha\subseteq \Omega\)`. 
* Since [ordinals are downward closed][bookofproofs$727], so `\(\Omega\)` must be an ordinal itself. 
* But then, both, `\(\Omega\in\Omega\)` and `\(\Omega=\Omega\)`, which is a [contradiction][bookofproofs$7880].
This so-called *Burali-Forti paradox* remained a paradox until the set theory got a better axiomatic foundation in the form of the [Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms][bookofproofs$1427]. Since then, the Burali-Forti paradox is only a paradox if we insist `$\Omega$` to be a [set][bookofproofs$550]. Today, `$\Omega$` is no more considered a set, since it violates one of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, the [axiom of foundation][bookofproofs$717].
Also, other paradoxes were discovered in the original <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor/">Cantor</a>'s set theory, including the [Russel's paradox][bookofproofs$7987], but those paradoxes were similarly removed by another Zermelo-Fraenkel axiom, when the Cantor's [principle of comprehension][bookofproofs$8012] was replaced by the more cautious [axiom of separation][bookofproofs$675].
