In the midst of the crisis the [Russel's paradox][bookofproofs$7987] caused, "Ferdinand Zermelo":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/ernst-friedrich-ferdinand-zermelo and "Adolf Fraenkel":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/adolf-abraham-halevi-fraenkel created a much more simple, as compared to Russel's and Whitehead's _Principia Mathematica_, set of __axioms__, also avoiding this paradox. 
At least until now, nobody was able to discover any other contradictions and paradoxes resulting from their axioms. Therefore, [Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms][bookofproofs$1427] are today a standard form of axiomatic set theory. 

It is now time to revise our [first definition of the set][bookofproofs$550] and provide a more thorough fundament of the set theory, based on these axioms.
