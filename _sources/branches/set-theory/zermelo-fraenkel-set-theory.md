In the midst of the crisis the [Russell's paradox][bookofproofs$7987] caused, [Ernst Zermelo][bookofproofs$Zermelo] and [Abraham Fraenkel][bookofproofs$Fraenkel] created a much more simple, as compared to 
[Russell][bookofproofs$Russell]'s and [Whitehead][bookofproofs$Whitehead]'s "Principia Mathematica", set of __axioms__, also avoiding this paradox. 
At least until now, nobody was able to discover any other contradictions and paradoxes resulting from their axioms. Therefore, [Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms][bookofproofs$1427] are today a standard form of axiomatic set theory. 

It is now time to revise our [first definition of the set][bookofproofs$550] and provide a more thorough fundament of the set theory, based on these axioms.
