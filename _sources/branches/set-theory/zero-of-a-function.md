Let `$X$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550], `$(R, +, \cdot)$` be a [ring][bookofproofs$683] and let `$f:X\mapsto R$` be a [function][bookofproofs$592]. A **zero** of a function `$f$` is a point `$\alpha\in X$` such that `$f(\alpha)=0$`, where `$0\in R$` denotes the [zero element][bookofproofs$661] of the ring `$R$`. A zero of a function is sometimes called a **root** of the function.
