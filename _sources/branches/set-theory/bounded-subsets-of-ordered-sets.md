Let `$(V,\preceq )$` be a [poset][bookofproofs$576] or a [strictly ordered set][bookofproofs$7993] and let `$S\subseteq V$` be its [non-empty][bookofproofs$550] [subset][bookofproofs$552].
1. `\(S\)`  is called **bounded above** if it has an [upper bound][bookofproofs$7995], i.e. there is an element `$B\in V$` with `$x\preceq B$` for all `$x\in S.$` 
1. `\(S\)`  is called **bounded below** if it has a [lower bound][bookofproofs$7995], i.e. there is an element `$B\in V$` with `$x\succeq B$` for all `$x\in S.$` 

If `\(S\)` is bounded above and bounded below, then we say that `$S$` is **bounded**.

### Examples and Notes

* Bounded subsets exist if we replace `$V$` by the natural numbers `$\mathbb N,$` the integers `$\mathbb Z,$` the rational numbers `$\mathbb Q,$` and the real numbers `$\mathbb R,$` since they all are strictly ordered.
* If the underlying set is a poset, then only its chains can be bounded. If a subset of a poset is not a chain, then some of its elements might be not comparable with the bound in question, and then it does not make sense to speak about "the bound" of the subset.
