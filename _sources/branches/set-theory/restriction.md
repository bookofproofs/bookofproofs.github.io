Informally, a restriction of a function is the same function but restricted to a subset of its domain. A formal definition follows now:

---

Let `$f:A\mapsto B$` be a [function][bookofproofs$592] and `\(C\subset A\)` is a [proper subset][bookofproofs$552] of `\(A\)`. The function
`\[{f|}_C : A \to B:=f:C\to B.\]`

is called the **restriction** of `\(f\)` to `\(C.\)`
