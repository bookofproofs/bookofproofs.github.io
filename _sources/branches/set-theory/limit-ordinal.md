The following definition shows that not all [ordinal numbers][bookofproofs$723] are the [successors][bookofproofs$774] of other ordinal numbers. 

As an example, the [minimal inductive set][bookofproofs$8038] `$\omega$` is by construction [transitive][bookofproofs$720] and all of its elements are transitive. Therefore it is an [ordinal][bookofproofs$723] by the proposition about [equivalent notions of ordinals][bookofproofs$8089]. But there is no ordinal number `$\alpha$` such that `$s(\alpha)=\omega.$`

A **limit ordinal** is an [ordinal][bookofproofs$723], which is not a [successor][bookofproofs$774] of any other ordinal, i.e. if `\[\forall\alpha\in\Omega:~\gamma\neq\alpha\cup\{\alpha\}.\]`
