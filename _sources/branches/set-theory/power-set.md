Let `$X$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550]. The [axiom of power set][bookofproofs$716] and the [axiom of empty][bookofproofs$666] ensure 
* the existence of the **power set**, `\(\mathcal P(X) :=\{A\mid  A\subseteq X\}\)`, i.e. the set of all possible [subsets][bookofproofs$552] of `\(X\)`[^1], and  
* that the empty set `\(\emptyset\)` is a subset any non-empty set `\(X\)`.


[^1]: Please note that the power set of the empty set is `\(\mathcal P(\emptyset)=\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}\)`.
