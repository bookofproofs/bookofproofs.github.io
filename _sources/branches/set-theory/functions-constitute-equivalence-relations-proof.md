* By hypothesis, `$f:A\mapsto B$` is a [function][bookofproofs$592] and the [relation][bookofproofs$571] "`$\sim$`" defined by `$x\sim y:\Leftrightarrow f(x)=f(y).$`
* Clearly, `$\sim$` is [reflexive][bookofproofs$572], since `$f(x)=f(x)$` for every `$x\in A.$`
* Also, `$\sim$` is [symmetric][bookofproofs$572], since `$f(x)=f(y)$` if and only if `$f(y)=f(x)$` for all `$x,y\in A.$`
* Finally, `$\sim$` is [transitive][bookofproofs$572], since if `$f(x)=f(y),$` and `$f(y)=f(z)$`, then `$f(x)=f(z)$` for all corresponding `$x,y,z\in A.$`
* This proves that `$\sim$` is an [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574] with the corresponding [quotient set][bookofproofs$7991] `$A/_{f}$` of elements in `$A$` having the same [image][bookofproofs$592] in `$B.$`
