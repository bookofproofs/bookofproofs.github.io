A [set][bookofproofs$550] `\(D\)` is called 

* **countable**, if the [comparison of the cardinal numbers][bookofproofs$984] of `$D$` and the [set of natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `$\mathbb N$` gives us the the relation `$|D|\le |\mathbb N|.$` i.e. if there is an [injective function][bookofproofs$769] `$f:D\to\mathbb N.$`[^1].
* else **uncountable**, i.e. if `$|D|>|\mathbb N|.$`

[^1]: This is equivalent with saying that there is a [surjective function][bookofproofs$770] function `\(f:\mathbb N\mapsto D.\)`  Some books define countability by requiring a [bijective function][bookofproofs$771] between `$D$` and `$\mathbb N,$` but the above definition has the advantage that it is also applicable for a [finite][bookofproofs$985] set `$D.$` Thus, all finite sets are countable.
