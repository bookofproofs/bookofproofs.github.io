Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [sets][bookofproofs$550]. The set **difference** of the sets `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` is defined using the [conjunction operation][bookofproofs$712] "`\(\wedge\)`", 

`\[A\setminus B :=\{x \mid x\in A \wedge x\notin B\}.\]` 

It is the set of all elements contained in `\(A\)` and not contained in `\(B\)`. The following Venn diagram shows a set difference:

### Examples:

1. The set difference `$A\setminus B$` of the set `$A=\{2,3,4,7,8,9\}$` and `$B=\{1,2,3\}$` equals `$\{4,5,6,9\}.$` 
1. The set difference `$A\setminus B$` of the set `$A=\{2,3,4,7,8,9\}$` and `$B=\{1,2,3\}$` equals `$\{4,5,6,9\}.$`
