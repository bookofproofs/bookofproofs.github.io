While the existence of [inductive sets][bookofproofs$8037] is ensured by the [axiom of infinity][bookofproofs$678], there is one particular inductive set worth a closer look - the minimal inductive set. We can use the [axiom of separation][bookofproofs$675], to define it uniquely:

The set `$\omega:=\{W\mid \forall X(X\text{ is an inductive set }\Rightarrow W\in X)\}$` is the minimal set, which fulfills the [axiom of infinity][bookofproofs$678]. It is called the **minimal inductive set**.
