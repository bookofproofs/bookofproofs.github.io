* Let `$(V,\prec)$` be a [strictly ordered set][bookofproofs$7993].
* By [definition][bookofproofs$7993], "`$\prec$`" is a [total order][bookofproofs$6191]. Therefore it is ensured that _at least one_ of the possibilities `$a \prec b,$` `$a \succ b,$` or  `$a=b$` is fulfilled. It remains to be shown that _exactly one_ is possible:
   * The possibilities `$a \prec b$` and `$a=b$` cannot occur simultaneously, because "`$\prec$`" is [irreflexive][bookofproofs$575], by definition.
   * The same argument holds for the possibilities `$a \succ b$` and `$a=b$` occurring simultaneously.
   * Neither can the possibilities `$a \succ b$` and `$a \prec b$` occur simultaneously, because "`$\prec$`" is [asymmetric][bookofproofs$575], by definition.
