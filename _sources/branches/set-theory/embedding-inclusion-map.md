Let `\(M\)` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] and let `\(T\subseteq M\)` be its [subset][bookofproofs$552]. The  **canonical**) **embedding** (or **inclusion map**) is a [function][bookofproofs$592].
`\[\iota :\cases{T\longmapsto M,\cr \iota (x)\longmapsto x},\]`

i.e. it maps each element `\(x\in T\)` into itself, treated as an element `\(x\in M\)`.
