In a [poset][bookofproofs$576], it is not required that _all_ elements are comparable. However, there are sets, in which this is the case, for instance, the set of natural numbers `$(\mathbb N,\le)$` with the usual order relation "`$\le$`". We want now to define such types of order relations and sets formally and give them another name.

The [partial order][bookofproofs$576] "`$\preceq$`" of a [poset][bookofproofs$576] `$(V,\preceq )$` is called a **total order** (or **linear order**), if [$\preceq$" is "connex][bookofproofs$1308], i.e. if all pairs of elements `$(a,b)\in V\times V$` can be ordered by `$"\preceq".$` 

A poset `$(V,\preceq )$` with a total order "`$\preceq$`" is called a **chain**.
