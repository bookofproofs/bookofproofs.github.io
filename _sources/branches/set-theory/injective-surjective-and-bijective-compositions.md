We have just shown that a [composition][bookofproofs$1314] of [injective][bookofproofs$769] (resp. [surjective][bookofproofs$770], resp. [bijective][bookofproofs$771]) functions are again injective (resp. surjective resp. bijective). In general, we cannot presume that the converse of these statements is true. However, the following statements can be proven:

Let `$f:A\mapsto B$` and `$g:B\mapsto C$` be [functions][bookofproofs$592].
1. If the [composition][bookofproofs$1314] `$g\circ f$` is [injective][bookofproofs$769], then `$f$` is injective.
1. If the composition `$g\circ f$` is [surjective][bookofproofs$770], then `$g$` is surjective.
1. If `$f$` is surjective and `$g\circ f$` is injective, then `$g$` is injective.
1. If `$f$` is surjective and `$g\circ f$` is injective, then `$g$` is injective.
