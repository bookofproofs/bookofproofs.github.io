As a warm-up, almost trivial, example, we verify the property of being an equivalence relation for the equality of sets.

---

Let `$U$` be a [universal set][bookofproofs$7984]. The [equality of sets][bookofproofs$6841] "`$=$`" defines an [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574] on every [subset][bookofproofs$552] of `$A\subseteq U.$`
