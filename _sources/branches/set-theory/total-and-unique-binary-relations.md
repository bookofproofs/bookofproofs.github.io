The following properties of binary relations are fundamental to the concept of [maps][bookofproofs$592], which we will introduce later.

Let `\(V, W\)` be (not necessarily different) [sets][bookofproofs$550] and `\(R\subseteq V\times W\)` be a [relation][bookofproofs$571] `\(R\)` is called:

1. *right-unique* (also called **functional**, **univalent** or *right-definite*), if from `$vRw_1$` and `$vRw_2$` it follows that `$w_1=w_2$` for the respective `$v\in V$`, `$w_1,w_2\in W,$`
1. *left-unique* (also called **injective**), if from `$v_1Rw$` and `$v_2Rw$` it follows that `$v_1=v_2$`  for the respective `$v_1,v_2\in V$`, `$w\in W,$`
1. **unique** if `$R$` is right-unique and left-unique,
1. *left-total*, if for all `\(v\in V\)` there is a `\(w\in W\)` with `\(vRw\)`,
1. *right-total*, (also called **surjective**), if for all `\(w\in W\)` there is a `\(v\in V\)` with `\(vRw\)`,
1. **total**, if `$R$` is left-total and right-total.
1. **total**, if `$R$` is left-total and right-total.
