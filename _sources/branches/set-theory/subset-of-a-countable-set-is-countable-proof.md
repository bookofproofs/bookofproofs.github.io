* By hypothesis, `$M$` is a [countble][bookofproofs$985] and `$A\subseteq M$` its [subset][bookofproofs$552].
* If `$M$` is [finite][bookofproofs$985], then `$A$` is finite, by the proposition about [subsets of finite sets][bookofproofs$986], and therefore countable.
* Assume `$M$` is infinite. 
* Since `$A\subseteq M$`, there is an [injective function][bookofproofs$769] `$f:A\to M.$` 
* By the [comparison of cardinal numbers][bookofproofs$984], it follows `$|A|\le |M|$`.
* Thus, `$A$` is countable.
