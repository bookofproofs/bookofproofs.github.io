We have seen in an [example][bookofproofs$8060] above that the [contained][bookofproofs$8066] relation `$\in_X$` is [well-founded][bookofproofs$8058]. The following proposition shows that it can be used to create a strict order on a set `$X.$`

---

Let `$X$` be a set and let `$\in_X$` be the [contained][bookofproofs$8066] relation defined on it. Then `$(X,\in_X)$` is a [strictly ordered set][bookofproofs$7993], if all `$x,y,z\in X$` the relation `$\in_X$` fulfills the following properties:

* [transitive][bookofproofs$572]: If `$x\in_X y$` and `$y\in_X z$`, then `$x\in_X z,$`
* [connex][bookofproofs$1308]: `$x\in_X y$` or `$y\in_X x.$`
