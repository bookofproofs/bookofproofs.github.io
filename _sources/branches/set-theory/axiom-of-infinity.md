---
All of the axioms introduce so far do not ensure the existence of infinite sets. The following axiom closes this gap.

---

There exists a set `\(X\)` containing the empty set and also with every element `$z$` also the element `$z\cup \{z\}.$`

`\[\exists X~(\emptyset \in X \wedge \forall~z(z\in X \Rightarrow z\cup \{z\}\in X).\]`
