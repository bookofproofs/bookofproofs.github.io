Let `\(X, Y, U\)` and `\(W\)` be [finite sets][bookofproofs$985]. The the following properties of [cardinal numbers][bookofproofs$980] are fulfilled:

> (1) From `\(|X|=|Y|, |U|=|W|\)` and `\(X\cap U=\emptyset, Y\cap W=\emptyset\)` it follows that `\(|X\cup U|=|Y\cup W|=|X| + |U|=|Y| + |W|\)`.

> (2) From `\(|X|=|Y|\)` and `\(|U|=|W|\)` it follows that `\(|X\times U|=|Y\times W|=|X|\cdot|U|=|Y|\cdot|W|\)`.
