For every [strictly-ordered set][bookofproofs$7993] `$(V,\prec),$` which is a [well-order][bookofproofs$7997], there is a unique [transitive set][bookofproofs$720] `$(X,\in_X)$` with the following properties:

* `$(X,\in_X)$` is also a strictly-ordered and well-ordered set with respect to the [contained relation][bookofproofs$8066] `$\in_X$` 
* Between the two orders `$(V,\prec)$` and `$(X,\in_X)$` there is an [order embedding][bookofproofs$8083] `$\pi:V\to X,$` i.e. an [injective][bookofproofs$769] function `$\pi$` fulfilling the property `$u\prec v\Longleftrightarrow \pi(u)\in_X\pi(v).$`
