p. *1.* If `\(X\)` is a [transitive set][bookofproofs$720], so is:

p(. **1a)** the set `\(X\cup\{X\}\)`, and 

p(. **1b)** the [power set][bookofproofs$552] `\(\mathcal P(X)\)`.

p. *2.* If `\(X\)` is a set of [transitive sets][bookofproofs$720], so is:

p(. **2a)** the [union][bookofproofs$552] of its elements `\(\bigcup X\)`, and

p(. **2b)** the [intersection][bookofproofs$552] of its elements `\(\bigcap X\)`.
