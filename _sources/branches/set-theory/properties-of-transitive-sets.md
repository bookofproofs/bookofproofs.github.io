1. If `\(X\)` is a [transitive set][bookofproofs$720], so is:
   1. the set `\(X\cup\{X\}\)`, and 
   2. the [power set][bookofproofs$552] `\(\mathcal P(X)\)`.

2. If `\(X\)` is a set of [transitive sets][bookofproofs$720], so is:
   1. the [union][bookofproofs$552] of its elements `\(\bigcup X\)`, and 
   2. the [intersection][bookofproofs$552] of its elements `\(\bigcap X\)`.
