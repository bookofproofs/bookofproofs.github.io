When <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor/">Georg Cantor</a> studied sets at the end of the 19th century, he searched for a way to compare the number of elements between sets, which would fit for both, finite and infinite sets. He was the first to realize that the existence of a bijective map between the elements would do the trick. This motivates the following definition:

---

Two [sets][bookofproofs$550] `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` are called **equipotent**, if and only if there is a [bijective function][bookofproofs$771] `\(f:A\to B\)`.
