Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [sets][bookofproofs$550]. Based on the [disjunction operation][bookofproofs$713] "`\(\vee\)`", the set **union** of `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` is defined as `\[A\cup B:=\{x | x\in A \vee x\in B\}.\]` 

The union is the set containing all elements `\(x\)` belonging either to `\(A\)` or to `\(B\)` (including those belonging to both). It can be visualized as the following Venn diagram:

### Examples

1. Let `$A=\{1,2,3,4\}$` and let `$B=\{3,4,5,6\}.$` Then the set union is `$A\cup B=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$`. Please note that we do not have to list the repeating elements twice in the union set.
