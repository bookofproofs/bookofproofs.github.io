Although the idea of a [function][bookofproofs$592] will be introduced later, we anticipate it here already and mention a special kind of functions which naturally occur along with equivalence relations: the _canonical projections_.

---

Let `\(V\)` be a [set][bookofproofs$550], `\(R\subseteq V\times V\)` an [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574] and let `\(V/_R\)` be the corresponding [quotient set][bookofproofs$7991]. The [function][bookofproofs$592] `$q\colon V\rightarrow V/_R,\,a\mapsto [a]\,$` is called the **canonical projection** of `\(R\)`.
