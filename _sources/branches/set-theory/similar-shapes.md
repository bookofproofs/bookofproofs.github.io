It is easy to verify the [reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity][bookofproofs$572] of the following properties. Thus, all these properties are [equivalence relations][bookofproofs$574].
1. [Equality][bookofproofs$1539] of numbers
1. [Parallelity][bookofproofs$788] of straight lines in the plane
1. Sets having the same [cardinality][bookofproofs$980].
1. [Similarity][bookofproofs$2782] of shapes in the plane. Two shapes in a plane are said to be **similar** if one can be transformed into another by a combination of enlargements, reflections, translations or rotations. The similarity of shapes is an equivalence class. The following figure shows two similar shapes.

#5. Some cleverly chosen equivalence relations can be used to define [integers][bookofproofs$844], [rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033], and [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105].
1. Integers having the same [modulus][bookofproofs$1283].
1. [Connectivity][bookofproofs$1221] of graphs
1. [Subspaces][bookofproofs$6328] of vector spaces
1. [Subspaces][bookofproofs$6328] of vector spaces
