For each set `$X$` there is a set containing all elements of the elements of `$X$`, formally

`$$\forall X~\exists Y~\forall xz (x\in X\wedge z\in x\Rightarrow z\in Y).$$`

### A note on notation:

The set, existence of which is ensured by the axiom of union, is denoted by `$\bigcup X$` or, more detailed, `$\bigcup_{u\in X} u.$` Both notations mean the following set:

`$$z\in \bigcup X:\Leftrightarrow z\in u\text{ for an }u\in X.$$`
