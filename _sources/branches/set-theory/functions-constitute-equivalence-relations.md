Let `$f:A\mapsto B$` be a [function][bookofproofs$592]. A [relation][bookofproofs$571] "`$\sim$`" defined by `$x\sim y:\Leftrightarrow f(x)=f(y)$` is an [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574]. In particular, the [domain][bookofproofs$592] `$A$` can be partitioned into the [quotient set][bookofproofs$7991] `$A/_{f}$` of elements in `$A$` having the same [image][bookofproofs$592] in `$B.$`
