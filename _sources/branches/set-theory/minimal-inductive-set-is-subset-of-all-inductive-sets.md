We have defined the set `$\omega$` as minimal with respect to the inclusion "`$\in$`" in relation to all inductive sets. The following corollary states that `$\omega$` is also minimal, if we look at that relation of being the subset `$\subseteq$` of inductive sets:

The [minimal inductive set][bookofproofs$8038] `$\omega$` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of all [inductive sets][bookofproofs$8037], formally:
`$$\forall W(W\text{ is inductive }\Rightarrow \omega\subseteq W).$$`
