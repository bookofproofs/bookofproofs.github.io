We have seen that the [composition of two bijective functions is again bijective][bookofproofs$6866]. Moreover, bijective functions are always [invertible][bookofproofs$407]. The following proposition establishes the link between the composition of functions and invertible functions.

Let `$f:A\mapsto B$` and `$g:B\mapsto C$` be [bijective functions][bookofproofs$771]. Then the [composition][bookofproofs$1314] `$g\circ f$` is [invertible][bookofproofs$407] and its [inverse][bookofproofs$407] can be calculated as `$(g\circ f)^{-1}=f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}.$`
