* Let `$X$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550].
* Assume that in a [contained relation][bookofproofs$8066] `$\in_X\subset X\times X$` for any two elements `$x,y\in X$` the following sets are equal: `$\{z\in X\mid z\in x\}=\{z\in X\mid z\in y\}.$`
* Assume that `$\in_X$` is not [extensional][bookofproofs$8059].
* Then `$x\neq y.$`
* But this contradicts the [axiom of extensionality][bookofproofs$551], because the sets `$x$` and `$y$` are determined by their elements `$z.$`
* Therefore, `$x=y$` and `$\in_X$` is [extensional][bookofproofs$8059].
