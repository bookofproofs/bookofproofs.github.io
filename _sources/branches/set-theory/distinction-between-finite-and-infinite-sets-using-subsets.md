The previous concepts allow making a distinction between [finite and infinite][bookofproofs$985] sets. In some literature, you will find this result not as a _theorem_, but as a _definition_ of finite and infinite sets.

Let `$X$` be a [non-empty set][bookofproofs$550] and `$S\subset X$` its [proper subset][bookofproofs$552]. Then

* `$X$` is [finite][bookofproofs$985], if and only if there is no [injective function][bookofproofs$769] `$f:X\to S.$`
* `$X$` is [infinite][bookofproofs$985], if and only if there is at least one injective function `$f:X\to S.$`
