Let `\(V\)` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] and let `\([\preceq"\subseteq V\times V\)` be a binary [relation][bookofproofs$571]. We call `\("\preceq "\)` 

* a **preorder**  **quasiorder**), if "`$\preceq$`" is [reflexive][bookofproofs$572] and [transitive][bookofproofs$572],
* a  **partial order** if "`$\preceq$`" is, in addition, [antisymmetric][bookofproofs$575].
A set `$V$` with a partial order "`$\preceq$`" defined on it is called a **poset** (_p_artially _o_rdered _set_) and denoted by `$(V,\preceq ).$` 

### A note on the notation `$(V,\preceq )$` 

Because `$V$` and "`$\preceq$`" are both sets, a poset `$(V,\preceq )$` is nothing else than an [ordered pair][bookofproofs$747] of two sets. This notation was established by [Kuratowski][kk].
