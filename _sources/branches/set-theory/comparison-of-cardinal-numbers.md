The power of <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor/">Cantor</a>'s idea of a [cardinal number][bookofproofs$980] lies in the fact that it is good for classifying and comparing not only finite but also infinite sets with respect to the number of their elements.

Let `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` be [sets][bookofproofs$550]. We define for the [cardinals][bookofproofs$980] `\(|A|\)` and `\(|B|\)`:

* `$|A|\le |B|$`, if and only if there is a [injective function][bookofproofs$769] `\(f:A\to B\)`. 
* `$|A| < |B|$`, if and only if there is an injective, but no [surjective function][bookofproofs$770] `\(f:A\to B\)`.
