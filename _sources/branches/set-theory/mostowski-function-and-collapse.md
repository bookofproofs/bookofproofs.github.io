The following two definitions are due to [Andrzej Mostowski][mo] (1913 - 1975) and play a prominent role in the theory of ordinal numbers:

Let `$V$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] and `$U$` be a [universal set][bookofproofs$7984] let `$R$` be a [well-founded][bookofproofs$8058] relation defined on it. A [function][bookofproofs$592] `$\pi:V\to U$` defined recursively by
`$$\pi(x):=\{\pi(y)\mid y\in V\wedge yRx\}$$`
is called the **Mostowski function** of `$R.$` Its [image][bookofproofs$592] `$p[V]$` is called the **Mostowski collapse** of `$R.$`
