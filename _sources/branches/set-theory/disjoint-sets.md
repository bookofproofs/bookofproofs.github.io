Two [sets][bookofproofs$550] are called **disjoint** if their [intersection][bookofproofs$6828] is [empty][bookofproofs$550]. The Venn diagram (named after <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Venn/">John Venn</a> (1834-1923)), below illustrates two disjoint sets `$A$` and `$B:$`
