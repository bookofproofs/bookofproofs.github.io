Two [sets][bookofproofs$550] `$A$` and `$B$` are considered **equal**, if `$A$` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of `$B$`, and vice versa. Formally:

`$$A=B\Longleftrightarrow (A\subseteq B)\wedge (B\subseteq A).$$`

The [negation][bookofproofs$714] of the **equality** of sets is their **inequality** and denoted by `$A\neq B.$`


### Examples

1. The set of all animals and the set of all whales are not equal since every whale is an animal but not every animal is a whale.
1. The set of all whole numbers `$a\ge 0$` equals the set `$\mathbb N$` of all natural numbers. 
1. The set of all whole numbers `$a\ge 0$` equals the set `$\mathbb N$` of all natural numbers.
