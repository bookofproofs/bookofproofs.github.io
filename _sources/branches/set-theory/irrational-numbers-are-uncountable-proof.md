* The set of real numbers `$\mathbb R$` is [uncountable][bookofproofs$6660], which [was proven here][bookofproofs$6661].
* The set of rationals numbers `$\mathbb Q$` is countable, which [was proven here][bookofproofs$6659].
* Since the set of [irrational numbers][bookofproofs$6663] is defined as the [set difference][bookofproofs$6830] `$\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$`, they are uncountable.
