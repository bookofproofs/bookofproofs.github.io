There are at least three ways we can describe sets:

1. Using a **Venn diagram**, (named after [John Venn][bookofproofs$Venn] (1834-1923)), we can represent a set with as a circle and its elements as dots, for example:


![venn0](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/venn0.png?raw=true)


2. Using a **list notation** (sometimes also called the **roster notation**), where we write the set `$A$` listing all its elements in curly brackets, for instance: `$$A=\{a,b,c,d\}.$$` 
3. Using a *set-builder notation*. In this case, we also use curly brackets. Inside the brackets, we describe the **definite properties** of the set elements. Examples of set-builder notations are
`$$\begin{array}{rcl}
A&=&\{x\in A\mid \; x\text{ is an even number}\}\\
B&=&\{y\in B\mid \; y\text{ is an elephant}\}\\
C&=&\{z\in C\mid \; z\text{ is a right-angled triangle.}\}
\end{array} $$`
Please note that in the set-builder notation, we always have to make use of properties, which have to be introduced already. Otherwise, we risk that our set definition will contain some ambiguities.
