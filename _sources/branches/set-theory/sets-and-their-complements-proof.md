* By hypothesis, `$A,B$` are [sets][bookofproofs$550].
### Ad "`$(1)$`"

* Assume the [intersection][bookofproofs$6828] is empty `$A\cap B=\emptyset.$`.
* Then, all `$x\in A$` are not elements of `$B$`: `$x\not in B$`.
* It follows, all `$x\in A$` are elements of the [complement][bookofproofs$6829] `$x\in B^C.$`.

### Ad "`$(2)$`"

* "`$\Rightarrow$`"
   * Assume `$A$` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of the complement `$B^C$`:  `$A\subseteq B^C.$`.
   * Then, for all `$x\in A$` we have `$x\not\in B.$`.
   * Therefore, if `$y\in B,$` then surely `$y\not in A.$`.
   * It follows `$B\subseteq A^C.$`

* "`$\Leftarrow$`"
   * Exchange `$A$` by `$B$` and vice versa in "`$\Leftarrow$`" to get the other direction of the proof.
