When dealing with particular situations in mathematics, it is often easier to have a set which contains all the elements we deal with. This set is called a universal set and we want to define it properly.

---

A **universal set** `$U$` is a [set][bookofproofs$550] of elements fulfilling all the necessary or sufficient properties that we deal with in a particular situation. 

In a Venn diagram, we draw the universal set as a frame in which we place the sets of our consideration (here a set `$A$`).

### Examples:

1. If you are considering all vans, the universal set could be the set of all cars.
1. The set of all possibilities to win in a coupon-based lottery could be considered as the universal set of all the possibilities printed on the coupons produced for this lottery.
