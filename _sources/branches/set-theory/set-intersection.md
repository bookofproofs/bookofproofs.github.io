Let `$A$` and `$B$` be [sets][bookofproofs$550]. Based on the [conjunction operation][bookofproofs$712] "`\(\wedge\)`", the set  **intersection** of `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` is defined as `\[A\cap B:=\{x | x\in A\wedge x\in B\}.\]`
The intersection contains all elements `\(x\)`, which are contained in both, `\(A\)` and `\(B\)`. It can be visualized by a Venn diagram like this:

### Examples

1. Let `$A=\{1,2,3,4\}$` and let `$B=\{3,4,5,6\}.$` Then the intersection set is `$A\cap B=\{3,4\}$`. Please note that we do not have to list the repeating elements twice in the intersection set.
1. The intersection of the set of countries of Europe and the set of the countries of Asia is the set of all countries belonging to both, Asia and Europe, i.e. the set `$\{\text{Azerbaijan}, \text{Georgia}, \text{Kazakhstan}, \text{Russia},\text{Turkey}\}$`[^1].
