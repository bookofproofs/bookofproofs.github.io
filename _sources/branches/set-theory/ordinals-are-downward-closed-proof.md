* Let `$X$` be an [ordinal][bookofproofs$723].
* From the [equivalent notions of ordinals][bookofproofs$8089] it follows that if `$w\in X$` then `$w$` is a [transitive][bookofproofs$720] set and a [proper subset][bookofproofs$552] `$w\subset X.$` 
* Since all elements of `$x\in X$` are transive, this holds also for the elements `$x\in X\cap w.$`
* Therefore, all elements `$x\in w$` are transitive. 
* This means that `$w$` is an ordinal.
