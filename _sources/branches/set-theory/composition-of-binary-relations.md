Let `\(A,B,C\)` be [sets][bookofproofs$550] and let let `\(R_1\subseteq A\times B\)` and `\(R_2\subseteq B\times C\)` be binary [relations][bookofproofs$571]. If there are `$a\in A,$` `$b\in B,$` and `$c\in C$` such that `$aR_1b$` and `$bR_2c,$` then there exists a binary relation `$(R_2\circ R_1)\subseteq A\times C$` called the **composition** of the relations `$R_1$` and `$R_2$`, and defined by this property `$$(R_2\circ R_1):=\{(a,c)\in A\times C:aR_1b\;\wedge\;bR_2c,\;a\in A,\; b\in B,\; c\in C\}.$$`
