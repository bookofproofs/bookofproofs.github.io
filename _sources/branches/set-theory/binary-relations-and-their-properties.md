*Binary relations*, i.e. those [relations][bookofproofs$571] `$R\subseteq S\times T$` defined on elements of some two (not necessarily different) sets `$S$` and `$T$`, are considered particularly important in mathematics. They can be interpreted as assignments of the elements `$s\in S$` to the elements `$t\in T$`. We write such assignments as [ordered pairs][bookofproofs$747] `$(s,t)\in R$` or also as `$sRt$`.
