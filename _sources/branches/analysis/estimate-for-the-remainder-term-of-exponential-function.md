The [absolute value][bookofproofs$583] of the remainder term `\(r_{N + 1}(x)\)` of the [exponential series][bookofproofs$281].
`\[r_{N + 1}(x):=\sum_{n=N+1}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n! }\]`

can be estimated by the inequation
`\[
|r_{N + 1}(x)|\le 2\frac{|x|^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}\quad\text{for }|x|\le \frac {N+2}2.\]`
