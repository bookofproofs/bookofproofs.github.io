Let `$U\subseteq\mathbb C$` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of the [complex plane][bookofproofs$216].
* A point `$b\in U$` is said to be in the **interior** of `$U$`, if there is a [disc][bookofproofs$8551] `$B(b,r)$` contained in `$U.$`
* A point `$b$` is called a **boundary point** of `$U,$` if every [disc][bookofproofs$8551] centered at `$b$` contains both, the points of the interior of `$U$` and outside the interior of `$U.$`
* The **closure** of `$U$` is the [set union][bookofproofs$6827] of `$U$` with its boundary points. 

### Note

* The above definitions are specific instances of the general definitions in topology, which can be found [here][bookofproofs$1202].
* With this respect, the complex plane is a specific [topological space][bookofproofs$6189] together with [absolute value][bookofproofs$1247] as a distance measure.
