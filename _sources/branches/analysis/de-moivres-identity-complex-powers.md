The following identity is a formula found by [Abraham De Moivre](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/De_Moivre/) (1667 - 1754).

For all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$\phi\in\mathbb R$` and all [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `$n\in\mathbb N,$` the formula

`$$[\cos(\phi)+i\sin(\phi)]^n=\cos(n\phi)+i\sin(n\phi)$$`

holds, where `$\cos$` and `$\sin$` denote the [cosine][bookofproofs$1745] and [sine][bookofproofs$1746] functions.

In particular, the **power** `$z^n$` of a [complex number][bookofproofs$216] written in [polar coordinates][bookofproofs$6750] `$z=r\exp(i\phi)$`  can be calculated by the formula `$$z^n=r^n\exp(in\phi).$$`
