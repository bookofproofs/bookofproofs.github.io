Let `\((V,\| \|)\)` and `\((W,\| \|)\)` be [finitely dimensional][bookofproofs$1041] [normed vector spaces][bookofproofs$846], `\(G\subseteq V\)` an [open][bookofproofs$852] [subset][bookofproofs$552], and `\(f\colon G\rightarrow W\)` a [function][bookofproofs$592]. Furthermore, let `\(x\in G\)` be a point and `\(v\in V\)` a fixed [vector][bookofproofs$560]. Then we call the **directional derivative** of `\(f\)` along `\(v\)`, if the [limit][bookofproofs$6203].
`\[\operatorname {lim} _{\substack{t\rightarrow 0,\\t\neq 0}}\,{\frac {f(x+tv)-f(x)}{t}}\]`

exists. We also denote the directional derivative as 

`\[\left(D_{v}f\right)\left(x\right),\]`

(read "directional derivative of `\(f\)` along the vector `\(v\)` at the point `\(x\)`").
