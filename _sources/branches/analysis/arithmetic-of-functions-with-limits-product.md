Let `$D\subseteq R$` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] with an [accumulation point][bookofproofs$174] `$a.$` Let `$f,g:D\to\mathbb R$` be [functions][bookofproofs$592] with [limits][bookofproofs$6683] `$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L$` and `$\lim_{x\to a}g(x)=H.$` Then the limit of the [product][bookofproofs$1532] of both functions is given by `$$\lim_{x\to a}(f(x)\cdot g(x))=L\cdot H.$$`


Please note that the proposition does not require the functions `$f,g$` to be [continuous][bookofproofs$219] at `$a$`, i.e. that `$f(a)=L$` and `$g(a)=H$`. In this case, please refer to [another proposition][bookofproofs$1261].
