Let `\(x\)` be a [real number][bookofproofs$1105] with the [absolute value][bookofproofs$583] `\(|x| < 1\)`. Then the [real infinite series][bookofproofs$1109], called  the **infinite geometric series**,

`\[\sum_{k=0}^\infty x^n\]`

is [convergent][bookofproofs$175], and its limit is

`\[\sum_{k=0}^\infty x^n=\frac{1}{1-x}.\]`
