We have already seen that the [absolute value][bookofproofs$1247] induces a [metric space on the complex numbers][bookofproofs$1253]. This fact allows applying many topological concepts also for the [complex plane][bookofproofs$216]. We restate these concepts here for the special case of complex numbers.
