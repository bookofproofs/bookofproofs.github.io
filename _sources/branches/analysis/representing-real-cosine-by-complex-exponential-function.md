The [cosine of a real variable][bookofproofs$1745] `\(\cos:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R\)` can be represented by the [exponential function of a complex variable][bookofproofs$312] by the following formula:

`\[\cos(x)=\frac 12(\exp(ix)+\exp(-ix)).\]`

An alternative notation for this formula is

`\[\cos(x)=\frac 12(e^{ix}+e^{-ix}).\]`
