* According to the [respective proposition, closed `$n$`-dimensional cuboids][bookofproofs$6582]  of `\(\mathbb R^n\)` are [compact][bookofproofs$6575].
* A [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] `$[a,b]\subset\mathbb R$` is a special case of an `$n$`-dimensional closed cuboid for `\(n=1\)`.
* Thus, it follows from the general case that it is a [compact][bookofproofs$6575] [subset][bookofproofs$552] of the [metric space of real numbers][bookofproofs$618] `\(\mathbb R\)`.
