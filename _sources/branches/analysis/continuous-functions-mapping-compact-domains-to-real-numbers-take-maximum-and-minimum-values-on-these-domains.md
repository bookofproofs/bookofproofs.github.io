Let `$X$` be a [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617], `$D\subset X$` be a [compact][bookofproofs$6575] [subset][bookofproofs$552] and `$f:D\mapsto \mathbb R$` a [continuous function][bookofproofs$1205] mapping the domain `$D$` to the [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$\mathbb R$`. Then there are points `\(p,q\in X\)`, for which the function `$f$` takes the [maximum][bookofproofs$6602] and the [minimum][bookofproofs$6603] values of the image `$f(D)$`, formally `$$\exists p,q\in X:~f(p)=\max(f(D)),\quad f(q)=\min(f(D)).$$`
