Let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and `\((b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be [convergent real sequences][bookofproofs$141] with the limits `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n=a\)` and `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} b_n=b\)`. Using the [definition of the order relation for real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] "`\(\le\)`" and "`\( < \)`" the following holds:

1. From `\(a_n \le b_n\)` for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` it follows that `\(a \le b\)`.
1. From `\(a_n \le b_n\)` for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` it follows that `\(a \le b\)`.
