The [continuous real functions][bookofproofs$1260] `$f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$`, which fulfill the [functional equation][bookofproofs$6726] `$f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y),$` are exactly the [linear functions][bookofproofs$1377] `$f(x)=ax$` for some `$a\in\mathbb R.$`

The [continuous real functions][bookofproofs$1260] `$f:\mathbb R_+^*\to\mathbb R$`, which fulfill the functional equation `$f(xy)=f(x)+f(y),$` are exactly the [logarithmic functions][bookofproofs$1421] `$f(x)=a\ln(x)$` for some `$a\in\mathbb R.$`

The [continuous real functions][bookofproofs$1260] `$f:\mathbb R_+^*\to\mathbb R$`, which fulfill the functional equation `$f(xy)=f(x)f(y),$` are either the [constant][bookofproofs$1371] zero function or the [exponential functions][bookofproofs$1626] `$f(x)=x^a$` for some `$a\in\mathbb R.$`
