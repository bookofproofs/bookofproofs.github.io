From the [ratio test for absolutely convergent series][bookofproofs$1337] it follows that

`\[\left|\frac{\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1) ! }}{\frac{x^n}{n ! }}\right|=\frac{|x|}{n+1}\le\frac 12.\]`

Therefore, the exponential series

`\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n!}\]`

is [absolutely convergent][bookofproofs$198] for every [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`, where `\(n!\)` denotes the [factorial][bookofproofs$1005] of the index `\(n\)`.
