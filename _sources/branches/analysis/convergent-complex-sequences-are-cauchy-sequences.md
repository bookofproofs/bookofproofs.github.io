If the [complex sequence][bookofproofs$1249] `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is [convergent][bookofproofs$1700], then it is also a [complex Cauchy sequence][bookofproofs$1250].
### Notes

* Together with the [completeness principle for complex numbers][bookofproofs$1709], this proposition shows that in the set of complex numbers, the set of all convergent sequences is exactly the same as the set of all Cauchy sequences.
* A similar [result can be proven for real sequences][bookofproofs$8677].
