Let `\(V\)` be a [finitely dimensional][bookofproofs$1041] [real vector space][bookofproofs$560], let `\(I\subseteq \mathbb {R} \)` be a [real interval][bookofproofs$1153], `\(U\subseteq V\)` an  [open set][bookofproofs$852] and let

`\[f\colon \begin{cases}
I\times U&\mapsto V,\\
(t,v)&\mapsto f(t,v),
\end{cases}\]`

be a [vector field][bookofproofs$222] on `\(U\)`. 

A [function][bookofproofs$592].
`\[v\colon \begin{cases}
J&\mapsto V,\\
t&\mapsto v(t),
\end{cases}\]`

on an [open subinterval][bookofproofs$1153] `\(J\subseteq I\)` is called a **solution of the ordinary differential equation** `\(v'=f(t,v)\)`, if the following properties are fulfilled:

1. `\(v'(t)=f(t,v(t))\)` for all `\(t\in J\)`.
1. `\(v(t)\in U\)` for all `\(t\in J\)`.
1. `\(v(t)\in U\)` for all `\(t\in J\)`.
