Let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be a [convergent complex sequence][bookofproofs$1700] with `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n=a\)` and let `\(x\in\mathbb R\)` be a [complex number][bookofproofs$1698]. Consider the complex sequence `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` with `\(c_n:=x a_n\)`. Then `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is also convergent and its limit equals `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} c_n=xa\)`.

This proposition can be expressed in the short form:

`\[\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} (x \cdot a_n)=x \cdot \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n.\]`
