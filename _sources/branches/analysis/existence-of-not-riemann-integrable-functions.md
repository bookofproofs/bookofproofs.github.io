The proceeding propositions show that there are quite a lot of functions which are [Riemann integrable][bookofproofs$1763]. A question arises if there are any functions that are not. The following function `$f:[0,1]\to\mathbb R$` is an example of a non-Riemann-itegrable function.

`$$f(x):=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }x\text{ is rational}\\0&\text{if }x\text{ is irrational}\end{cases}.$$`

The function is [bounded][bookofproofs$302] on the [closed interval][bookofproofs$1153] `$[0,1].$` Howerver, the [Riemann upper and lower integrals][bookofproofs$1761]  are not equal each other:

`$$\int_{0~*}^{1}f(x)dx=0\quad\neq \quad \int_{0}^{1~*}f(x)dx=1.$$`
