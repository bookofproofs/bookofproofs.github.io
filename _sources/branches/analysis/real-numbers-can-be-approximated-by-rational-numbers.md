Every [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `\(x\in\mathbb R\)` can be approximated by a sequence `\((q_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` of rational numbers `\(q_n\in\mathbb Q\)`. More formally: For every `\(x\in\mathbb R\)` there is a [convergent sequence][bookofproofs$148] of [rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033] `\(q_n\in\mathbb Q\)`, i.e.

`\[\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} q_n=x.\]`
