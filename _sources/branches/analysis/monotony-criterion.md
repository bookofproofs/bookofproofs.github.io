An [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\)` with [non-negative][bookofproofs$1107] terms `\(x_k\ge 0\)` for all `\(k\in\mathbb N\)` is [convergent][bookofproofs$175] if and only if the sequence `\((s_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` of its partial sums `\(s_n:=\sum_{k=0}^n x_k\)` is [bounded][bookofproofs$1136].
