To calculate the derivative of a [linear function][bookofproofs$1377] `\(f(x)=ax +b\)`, `\(a,b\in\mathbb R\)` we can apply the [basic arithmetic operations involving derivatives][bookofproofs$1375] and conclude

`\[f'(x)=(ax +b)'=(ax)' +(b)'=a+0=a.\]`

Herein, we have applied the rule `\((1)\)`, the rule `\((3)\)`, and the rule of a [derivative of a constant function][bookofproofs$1372].
