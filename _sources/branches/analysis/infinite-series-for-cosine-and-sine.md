For the [cosine][bookofproofs$1745] and [sine][bookofproofs$1746] functions have the following [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109]:

§§§1
These two infinite series are [absolutely convergent][bookofproofs$198] for all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$x\in\mathbb R$`.

§§§1

`\[\begin{array}{rcl} 
\cos(x)&=&\sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k\frac{x^{2k}}{(2k)!}=1-\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}-\frac{x^6}{6 !}+-\ldots,\\
\sin(x) &=&\sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k\frac{x^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}=x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7 !}+-\ldots.
\end{array}\]`
