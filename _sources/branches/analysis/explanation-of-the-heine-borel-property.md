The [definition of the Heine-Borel property][bookofproofs$6575] causes sometimes great difficulties to students. This definition does not(!) state that  

> "$U$ is compact, if `$U$` has a finite cover".

This interpretation is wrong, since `\(U\subset X\)` has always a finite cover, for instance the cover consisting of the open set `\(X\)` alone. The definition rather requires that any given open cover of `\(U\)` contains is a finite subcover.
