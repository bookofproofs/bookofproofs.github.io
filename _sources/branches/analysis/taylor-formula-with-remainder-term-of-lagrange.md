Let `$I\subset\mathbb R$` be an [interval][bookofproofs$1153] and `$f:I\to\mathbb R$` be a [$(n+1)$ times continuously differentiable function][bookofproofs$6205]. For any values `$a,x\in I,$` there is a value `$\xi$` between `$a$` and `$x$` such that `$f(x)$` can be written as

`$$f(x)=f(a)+\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{f^{\{k\}}(a)}{k !}(x-a)^k+\frac{f^{\{n+1\}}(\xi)}{(n+1) !}(x-a)^{n+1}.$$`
