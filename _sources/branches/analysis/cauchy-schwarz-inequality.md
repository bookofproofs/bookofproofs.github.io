Let `$x_1,x_2,\ldots x_n$` and `$y_1,y_2,\ldots y_n$` be [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105]. Then the sum of [absolute values][bookofproofs$583] of the products `$\sum _{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}y_{i}|$` can be estimated from above by the so-called *Cauchy-Schwarz inequality*
`$$\sum _{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}y_{i}|\leq \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}\right)^{\frac 12}\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}\right)^{\frac 12}.$$`
