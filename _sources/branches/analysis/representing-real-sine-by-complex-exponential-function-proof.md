By [definition of the sine function of a real variable][bookofproofs$1746], we have
`\[\sin(x)=\Im(\exp(ix)),\quad\quad x\in\mathbb R.\]`

From the [formula of extracting the real part from a complex number][bookofproofs$1248], we get the result

`\[\sin(x)=\Im(\exp(ix))=\frac 1{2i}(\exp(ix)-(\exp(ix))^*),\quad\quad x\in\mathbb R.\]`

By the [formula for calculating the complex conjugate of the complex exponential function][bookofproofs$1747], it follows

`\[\sin(x)=\frac 1{2i}(\exp(ix)-\exp((ix)^*),\quad\quad x\in\mathbb R.\]`

The [definition of the complex conjugate][bookofproofs$1245] leads to the desired result:

`\[\sin(x)=\frac 1{2i}(\exp(ix)-\exp(-ix)),\quad\quad x\in\mathbb R.\]`
