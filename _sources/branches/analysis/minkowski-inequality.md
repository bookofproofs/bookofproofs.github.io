This inequality is named after "Hermann Minkowski":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/hermann-minkowski/ (1864 - 1909). It is a generalization of the [triangle inequality][bookofproofs$588] for `$p=1.$`

Let `$p\in[1,\infty)$`. Let `$x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots x_n)$` and `$y=(y_1,y_2,\ldots y_n)$` be two [vectors][bookofproofs$560] of a vector space `\(V\)` over the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$1638] `\(\mathbb R\)` or the [field of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690] `\(\mathbb C\)`. Then the sum of the [p-norms][bookofproofs$6789] `$||x||_p+||y||_p$` can be used as an upper bound of the p-norm of the vector sum `$||x+y||_p$`, formally:

`$$||x+y||_p\le ||x||_p+||y||_p.$$`
