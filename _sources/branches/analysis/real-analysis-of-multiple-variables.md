In this part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong> we will be dealing with the real analysis of multiple variables. In particular, we will treat topics like the [continuity][bookofproofs$129], [differentiability][bookofproofs$144] and [integrability][bookofproofs$163] of real-valued functions with multiple variables. 

It is the continuation of the study of [real analysis of one variable][bookofproofs$28], which in some sense is a prerequisite to this part. In particular, readers familiar with the concepts of real analysis of one variable `$x\in\mathbb R$` will recognize that many of these concepts can be generalized for higher dimensions, where `$x$` is a vector of a `$n$`-dimensional Euclidean vector space `$x\in\mathbb R^n$`, `$n > 1$`. 


### Theoretical minimum (in a nutshell)

With respect to this, before you dive deeper into the material to follow, you might find it helpful to make sure that you are acquainted with some basic facts treated elsewhere in <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>. Ideally, you should be already acquainted with:

* Some basic facts from [linear algebra][bookofproofs$121], including:
   * The definition of [vector spaces and scalar multiplication][bookofproofs$560],
   * Handling and calculations involving [matrices][bookofproofs$343], 
   * The notion of the [basis][bookofproofs$299] of vector spaces and [linearly independent][bookofproofs$1036] vectors.
* Some basic concepts from [topology][bookofproofs$57], including:
   * The notions of a [metric][bookofproofs$614] and [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617],
   * The terms [norm and normed vector space][bookofproofs$846],
   * [Continuous functions][bookofproofs$1205]  in such spaces,
   * The notions of [neighborhood][bookofproofs$849], [open and closed][bookofproofs$852] subsets of a space,
   * [Compactness][bookofproofs$408] of spaces.
 
### Concepts you will learn in this part of BookofProofs

* Generalizations of __continuous functions__ and __convergent sequences__ in `$\mathbb R^n$`, including __uniform convergence__ of functions with multiple real-valued variables.
* How to determine the length of curves in `$\mathbb R^n$`, using __rectification__ techniques?
* What are __partial derivatives__, their applications and how to handle them?
* What is a [total derivative][bookofproofs$6215], how it is different from partial derivatives, and what are its applications?
* What is the __Taylor formula__ and how to find the __local extrema__ of functions in `$\mathbb R^n$`?
* What are __implicite functions__ and their applications?
* How to handle __integrals__ depending on many parameters.
