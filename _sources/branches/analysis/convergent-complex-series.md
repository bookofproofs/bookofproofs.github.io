A [complex series][bookofproofs$1724] `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\)` is called **convergent**, if the [complex sequence][bookofproofs$1249] `\((s_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` of **partial sums** `\[s_n:=\sum_{k=0}^n x_k,\quad\quad n\in\mathbb N\]` is a [convergent complex sequence][bookofproofs$1700].
For convergent complex series, the notation 

`\[\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\]`

can, depending on the context, denote two things:

1. the convergent real series itself or 
1. the convergent real series itself or
