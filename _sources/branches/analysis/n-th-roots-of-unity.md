Let `$n\in\mathbb Z$` be an [integer][bookofproofs$844]. The equality `$z^n=1$` has exactly `$n$` complex solutions, i.e. `$$\zeta_k=\exp\left(2\pi i\frac{k}{n}\right),\quad\quad k=0,1,\ldots,n-1,$$`
called the *$n$-th roots of unity*. In particular, `$\zeta_k=\zeta_m$` for any two [integers][bookofproofs$844]  `$k,m$` being [congruent][bookofproofs$8153] `$k(n)\equiv m(n)$` modulo `$n.$`
