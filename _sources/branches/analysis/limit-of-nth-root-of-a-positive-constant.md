Let `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` be a real sequence defined by `$a_n=\sqrt[n]{a}$` for some [positive real number][bookofproofs$1107] `$a > 0$` and all `$n\in\mathbb N$`, where `$\sqrt[n]{a}$` denotes its [nth-root][bookofproofs$46]. Then [limit][bookofproofs$141] of `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` exists and we have `$$\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{a}=1,\quad\quad (a > 0).$$`
