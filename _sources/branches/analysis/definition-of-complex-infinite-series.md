Let `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be a [complex sequence][bookofproofs$1249]. The complex sequence `\((s_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` of **partial sums** 
`\[s_n:=\sum_{k=0}^n x_k,\quad\quad n\in\mathbb N\]`
is called the *(infinite) complex series*
`\[\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\quad\quad( * ).\]`

Note: If the sequence of partial sums is convergent, the expression `\( ( * ) \)`  also denotes the limit to which the sequence converges.
