This test criterion for convergent is due to "Johann Lejeune Dirichlet":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/johann-peter-gustav-lejeune-dirichlet (1805 - 1859).

If the [sequence of partial sums][bookofproofs$1109] `$(A_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` with `$A_n:=\sum_{k=0}^n a_k$` of the [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] `$\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k$` is [bounded][bookofproofs$1136] and the [sequence][bookofproofs$875] `$(b_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}$` is [monotonic][bookofproofs$1155] and[^1] [convergent][bookofproofs$141] to zero `$\lim_{k\to\infty} b_k=0,$` then the infinite series of products `$\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kb_k$` is [convergent][bookofproofs$175].
[^1]: If you want to apply this convergence criterion to complexed-valued series `$\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kb_k$`, you have to make sure that `$(b_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}$` remains a real-valued sequence. Otherwise, the monotonicity criterion will lose its sense.
