A [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(U\)` of a [metric][bookofproofs$617] (or [topological][bookofproofs$6189]) space[^1] `\(X\)` is called **compact**, if for every [open cover][bookofproofs$150] `$(U_i)_{i\in I}$` of `$U$` there exist only [finitely many][bookofproofs$985] indices `\(i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_k\in I\)` with 

`\[U\subset U_{i_1}\cup U_{i_2}\cup \ldots \cup U_{i_n}.\]`

### Notes

* The finite union `$U_{i_1}\cup U_{i_2}\cup \ldots \cup U_{i_n}$` is sometimes referred to as an **open subcover**.
* The existence of a finite subcover for every open cover of `$U$` is called the *Heine-Borel property* of `\(U\)` (and is due to "Heinrich Eduard Heine":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/heinrich-eduard-heine/ and "Émile Borel":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/f%C3%A9lix-edouard-justin-%C3%A9mile-borel/.

[^1]: The above definition makes no reference to any kind of a  [metric][bookofproofs$614] of the space `$X$`. Thus, it can be used in more generalized [topological spaces][bookofproofs$6189] rather than [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617].
