Following the [representation of the real cosine by the complex exponential function][bookofproofs$1786], the [rules of multiplying positive and negative real numbers][bookofproofs$1598], the [commutativity of multiplying][bookofproofs$1671] and the [commutativity of adding complex numbers][bookofproofs$1660], we get 

`\[\begin{array}{rcll}
\cos(-x)&=&\frac 12(\exp(i(-x))+\exp(-i(-x))&\text{representing of cosine by complex exponential function}\\
&=&\frac 12(\exp((-x)  i)+\exp((-1)(-x)i)&\text{commutativity of multiplying complex numbers}\\
&=&\frac 12(\exp(-ix)+\exp(ix))&\text{multiplying positive and negative real numbers}\\
&=&\frac 12(\exp(ix)+\exp(-ix))&\text{commutativity of adding complex numbers}\\
&=&\cos(x)&\text{representing of cosine by complex exponential function}
\end{array}\]`

Thus, the cosine of a real variable is an [even function][bookofproofs$416].
