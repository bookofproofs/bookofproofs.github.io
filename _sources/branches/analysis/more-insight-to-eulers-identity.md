The [Euler's identity][bookofproofs$6744] `$\exp(i\pi)+1=0$` is only a special case of a more general result:

For some special [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$x\in\mathbb R$` the following equations hold:

`$$\exp(ix)=\pm 1.\quad\quad (*) $$`

These special cases for `$x$` are as follows:

* If and only if `$x=k\pi$` for all [odd][bookofproofs$8130] [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$k\in\mathbb Z$`, we can put a "$+$" sign in the equation `$(*),$`
* otherwise, we can put a "`$-$`" sign in the equation `$(*)$` if and only if `$x=k\pi$` for all [even][bookofproofs$8130] [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$k\in\mathbb Z.$`
