If the [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is [convergent][bookofproofs$175], then it is also a [Cauchy sequence][bookofproofs$1704].
### Notes

* Together with the [completeness principle for real numbers][bookofproofs$1108], this proposition shows that in the set of real numbers, the set of all convergent sequences is exactly the same as the set of all Cauchy sequences.
* An example of a [Cauchy sequence that is not convergent, can be given in the set of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1092].
* A similar [result can be proven for complex sequences][bookofproofs$1394].
