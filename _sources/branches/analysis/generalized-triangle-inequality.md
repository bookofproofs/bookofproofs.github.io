For all [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `$n\ge 1$` and all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] (respectively [complex numbers][bookofproofs$216]) `$a_1,\ldots,a_n$` the following inequality holds: `$$\left|\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\right|\le\sum_{k=1}^n|a_k|,$$`

where `$|\cdot|$` denotes the [absolute value of real numbers][bookofproofs$583] (respectively [absolute value of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1247]).
