For all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$x\in\mathbb R$`, we can shift the argument of the [real cosine][bookofproofs$1745] and [real sine][bookofproofs$1746]  by the [$\pi$ constant][bookofproofs$6738] to get the negative values of these functions, formally `$$\cos(x+\pi)=-\cos(x),\quad\quad\sin(x+\pi)=-\sin(x).$$`
