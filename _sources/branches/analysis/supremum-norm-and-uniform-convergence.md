The [supremum norm][bookofproofs$8392] simplifies the definition of [uniformly convergent functions][bookofproofs$8382], which is shown in the following proposition:

---

Let `$D$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] and let `$\mathbb F$` denote the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$1640] or the [field of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690]. A sequence of functions `$f_n:D\to\mathbb F$` is [uniformly convergent][bookofproofs$8382] to a limit function `$f:D\to\mathbb F,$` if and only if `$$\lim_{n\to\infty}||f_n-f||_\infty=0,$$` where `$||\cdot||_\infty$` denotes the [supremum norm][bookofproofs$8392] of the functions `$f_n-f$` on `$D.$`
