For any two [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$a,b$` we call the expression `$$\frac {a+b}2$$` the **arithmetic mean** of these numbers.

More generally, for any `$n\ge 2$` real numbers `$a_1,\ldots,a_n$` the expression `$$\frac {a_1+\cdots+a_n}n$$` is called the  *(generalized) arithmetic mean* of these numbers.

Let `$p_1,\ldots,p_n$` be [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] ("weights"). Then we call the expression `$$\frac {p_1a_1+\cdots+p_na_n}{p_1+\cdots+p_n}$$` the **weighted arithmetic mean**.
