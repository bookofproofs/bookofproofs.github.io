Every [real Cauchy sequence][bookofproofs$1704] `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` in the [metric space][bookofproofs$618] `\((\mathbb R,|~|)\)` [converges against a limit][bookofproofs$141] `\(a\in\mathbb R\)`. This is also known as the **completeness principle** for real numbers.[^2]

fn1. Please note that this proposition is the converse to the corresponding lemma stating that [all convergent real sequences are also Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1394], which is valid for any metric spaces. The converse is valid only for special metric spaces, like `\((\mathbb R,|~|)\)`.

[^2]: In some bibliography sources (e.g. [^581]), the completeness principle is introduced as an axiom rather than proven (as it is the case in <strong><span style='color:orange'>BookOf</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>). At <strong><span style='color:orange'>BookOf</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>, one of many axiomatic systems is used for the foundation of real numbers. For more details how this is done at <strong><span style='color:orange'>BookOf</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>, please refer to the [definition of real numbers][bookofproofs$1105].
