Let `\(z, z_1,z_2\in \mathbb C\)` be [elements of the field of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690]. The [absolute value][bookofproofs$1247] of the [difference][bookofproofs$1701] `\(|z_1-z_2|\)` is called the **distance** of the complex numbers `\(z_1\)` and `\(z_2\)`. It defines a [metric][bookofproofs$614]  on `\(\mathbb C\)`. In other words, `\((\mathbb C,|~|)\)` is a [metric space][bookofproofs$617] and the distance `\(|~|\)` fulfills the following properties:

1. `$|z|=0$` if and only if `$z=0$`.
1. `$|z_1-z_2|=|z_2-z_1|$` for all `$z_1,z_2\in\mathbb C$` (symmetry)
1. `$|z_1+z_2|\le |z_1| + |z_2|$`  for all `$z_1,z_2\in\mathbb C$` (triangle inequality)

### Notes

* This is a [generalization of a corresponding proposition for real numbers][bookofproofs$618].
* Because `$(\mathbb C,|~|)$` is a metric space and `$(\mathbb C, + ,\cdot)$` is a field, we also say, that the field of complex numbers is a **valuated field**.
