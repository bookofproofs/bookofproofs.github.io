Let `\(a_\nu,b_\nu\in\mathbb R\)` be [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] with `\(a_\nu \le b_\nu\)` for `\(\nu=1,\ldots,n\)`. The [closed][bookofproofs$852] *$n$-dimensional cuboid* `\[Q:=\{(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in\mathbb R^n:\quad a_\nu \le x_\nu \le b_\nu\}\]`
is a [compact][bookofproofs$6575] [subset][bookofproofs$552] of the the [`\(n\)`-dimensional metric space of real numbers][bookofproofs$1206] `\(\mathbb R^n\)`.
