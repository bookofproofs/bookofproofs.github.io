Let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and `\((b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be [convergent real sequences][bookofproofs$141] to the limits `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n=a\)` and `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} b_n=b\)`. Consider the real sequence `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` with `\(c_n:=a_n + b_n\)`. Then `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is also convergent and its limit equals `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} c_n=a + b\)`.

### Notes

* This proposition can be expressed in the short form: `\[\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} (a_n + b_n)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n + \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} b_n.\]`
* The proposition's proof can be transferred also to sequences of other kinds than real numbers, for example, the complex numbers.
