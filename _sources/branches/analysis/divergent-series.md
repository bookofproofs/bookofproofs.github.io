A [real series][bookofproofs$1109] `$\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k$` is called **divergent**, if it is not [convergent][bookofproofs$175].
This  is equivalent to the statement that the [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] `$(s_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` of partial sums `$$s_n:=\sum_{k=0}^n x_k,\quad\quad n\in\mathbb N$$` [tends to infinity, (respectively tends to minus infinity) ][bookofproofs$1345]. In this case, we write 
`$$\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_n =\infty\quad\text{(respectively }\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_n =-\infty\text{)}.$$`
