Let `\([a,b]\)` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] and let `\(f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R\)` be a [continuous real function][bookofproofs$1260]. Then `\(f\)` takes any value between `\(f(a)\)` and `\(f(b)\)`, i.e. for each `\(u\in [f(a),f(b)]\)` there is at least one `\(c\in[a,b]\)` with `\(f( c)=u\)`.
