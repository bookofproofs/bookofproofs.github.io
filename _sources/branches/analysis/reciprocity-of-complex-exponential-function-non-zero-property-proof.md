By virtue of the [functional equation of the complex exponential function][bookofproofs$1735], we have
`\[\exp(x)\cdot \exp(-x)=\exp(x-x)=\exp(0).\quad\quad( * )\]`
From the [result][bookofproofs$1739] that `\[\exp(0)=1\]` it follows
`\[\exp(-x)=\exp(x)^{-1}=\frac{1}{\exp(x)}.\]`
In particular, `\(\exp(x)\neq 0\)` for all `\(x\in\mathbb C\)`, otherwise we would have `\(0\cdot\exp(-x)=0=1\)`, which cannot be fulfilled for any complex number `\(\exp(-x)\)`.
