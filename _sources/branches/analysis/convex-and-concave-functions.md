Let `$D\subset\mathbb R$` be a [real (finite or infinite) interval][bookofproofs$1153]. A [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f:D\to\mathbb R$` is said to be *convex on `$D$`*, if `$$f(t x_1 +(1-t)x_2)\le tf(x_1)+(1-t)f(x_2)$$` for all `$x_1,x_2\in D$` and for all `$0 < t < 1.$` The function `$f$` is called **concave** if `$-f$` is convex, i.e. if `$$f(t x_1 +(1-t)x_2)\ge tf(x_1)+(1-t)f(x_2)$$` for all `$0 < t < 1.$`

From a graphical point of view, the condition means that (for `$x_1 < x_2$`) the graph of `$f$` in the interval `$[x_1,x_2]$` lies below the secant drawn through the points `$(x_1,f(x_1))$`, `$(x_2,f(x_2))$` (see figure below):
