Based on the [order relation for real numbers][bookofproofs$1107],  [real][bookofproofs$1105] [functions][bookofproofs$592] `\(f:\mathbb R\mapsto\mathbb R\)` can be classified by the way the values of `\(f(x)\)` increase (decrease), depending on increasing `\(x\)`. The function `\(f\)` is called: 

> **monotonically increasing**, if for all `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` such that `\(x \le y\)` one has `\(f(x) \le f(y)\)`,

> **strictly monotonically increasing**, if for all `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` such that `\(x < y\)` one has `\(f(x) < f(y)\)`,

> **monotonically decreasing**, if for all `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` such that `\(x \le y\)` one has `\(f(x) \ge f(y)\)`,

> **strictly monotonically decreasing**, if for all `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` such that `\(x  y\)` one has `\(f(x) > f(y)\)`.

If `\(f\)` is either (strictly) monotonically increasing or decreasing, it is called **monotonic**.
