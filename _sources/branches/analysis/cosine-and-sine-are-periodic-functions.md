For all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$x\in\mathbb R$`, [real cosine][bookofproofs$1745] and [real sine][bookofproofs$1746] are [periodic][bookofproofs$376] with the period `$2\pi$`, i.e. `$\cos(x+2\pi)=\cos(x),\sin(x+2\pi)=\sin(x),$` (where `$\pi$` denotes the [$\pi$ constant][bookofproofs$6738]).
