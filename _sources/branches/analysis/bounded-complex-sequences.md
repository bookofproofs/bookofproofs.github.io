Let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`  be a [complex sequence][bookofproofs$1249]. Since the [absolute value of a complex number is a real number][bookofproofs$1247], we can compare it to other real number using the [order relation for real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] "`\(\le\)`".

We call the complex sequence `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` **bounded**, if there is a [positive real number][bookofproofs$1107] `\(B\)` with `\(|a_n|\le B\)` for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)`.
