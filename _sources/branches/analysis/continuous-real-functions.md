Let `\(D\subseteq\mathbb R\)`[^1] and let `\(f:D\to\mathbb R\)` be a [function][bookofproofs$592] `\(f\)` is called *continuous on the subset `\(D\)`* (or just **continuous**, if the domain `\(D\)` is clear from the context), if `\(f\)` is [continuous at every point][bookofproofs$219] `\(a\in D\)`. 

[^1]: Example, `\(D\)` could be a real interval `\(I\in \mathbb R\)`, or all real numbers `\(\mathbb R\)`, or any other subset of real numbers.
