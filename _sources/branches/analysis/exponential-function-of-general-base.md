Let `\(a > 0\)` be a [positive real number][bookofproofs$1107], and let `\(\ln(a)\)` be the [natural logarithm][bookofproofs$1421] of `\(a\)`. The *exponential function of general base `\(a\)`* is defined as the [exponential function][bookofproofs$281]:

`\[a^x:=\exp_a(x):=\begin{cases}\mathbb R&\mapsto \mathbb R\\x&\mapsto \exp(x\cdot \ln(a)).\end{cases}\]`
