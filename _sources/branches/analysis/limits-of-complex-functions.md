Let `$U\subseteq\mathbb C$` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of [complex numbers][bookofproofs$216] and let `$f:U\to\mathbb C$` be a [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f(x)$` is said to **converge** to a **limit at the point** `$\alpha$`,
formally `$$w=\lim_{\substack{z\in U\\z\to\alpha}} f(z)$$`

if given `$\epsilon > 0$` there exist `$\delta > 0$` such that if `$$|z-\alpha| < \delta,\quad z\in U,$$` then `$$|f(z)-w| < \epsilon.$$`
