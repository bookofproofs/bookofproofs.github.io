For `$x=\pi,$`, the value of the [complex exponential function][bookofproofs$1749] `$\exp(ix)=-1.$` Therefore, the following result holds:

`\[e^{i\pi}+1=0\]`

This result is known as *Euler's identity*. It is remarkable since it unifies `$4$` important numbers in only one equation:
* the [real number zero][bookofproofs$34] `$0,$`
* the [real number one][bookofproofs$40] `$1,$`
* the [$\pi$ constant][bookofproofs$6738], and 
* the [imaginary unit][bookofproofs$1160] `$i.$`
