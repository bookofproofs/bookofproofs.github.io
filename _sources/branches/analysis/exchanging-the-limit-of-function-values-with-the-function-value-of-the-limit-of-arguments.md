Let `$D\subset\mathbb R$` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] and let `$(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` be a [convergent real sequence][bookofproofs$141] with `$x_n\in D$`, `$a\in D$` and  `$\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=a.$` If a [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f:D\to\mathbb R$` is [continuous][bookofproofs$219] at `$a\in D,$` then  `$$\lim_{n\to\infty} f(x_n)=f(\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n)=f(a).$$`

Roughly speaking, it is possible to "exchange the limits" between the limit of function values and the respective function value of the limit of function arguments.
