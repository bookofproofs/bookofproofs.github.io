If the "squared" [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n^2$` and `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n^2$` are both [convergent][bookofproofs$175] then 
the "product" infinite series `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n b_n$` is [absolutely convergent][bookofproofs$198], 
and the following generalized Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds:

`$$\left|\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n b_n\right|\le \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a_n b_n|\le \left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n^2 \right)^{\frac 12}\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n^2 \right)^{\frac 12}.$$`
