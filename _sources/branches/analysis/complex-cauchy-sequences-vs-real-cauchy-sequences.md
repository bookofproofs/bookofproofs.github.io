Let `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be a [complex sequence][bookofproofs$1249] `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is a [complex Cauchy sequence][bookofproofs$1250], if and only if the [real sequences][bookofproofs$875] of the real parts `\((\Re(c_n))_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and imaginary parts `\((\Im(c_n))_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` are [real Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1704].
