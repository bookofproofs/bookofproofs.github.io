Let `\(n\in\mathbb Z\)` be an [integer][bookofproofs$844]. Then the [exponential function of general base][bookofproofs$1603] `\(a > 0\)`  is identical with the [n-th power function][bookofproofs$1618], formally 

`\[\exp_a(n)=a^n\]`
for all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(a > 0\)` and all integers `\(n\in\mathbb Z\)`.
