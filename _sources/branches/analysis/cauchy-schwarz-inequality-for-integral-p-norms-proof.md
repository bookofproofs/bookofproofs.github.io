* By hypothesis, `$[a,b]$` is a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] and `$f,g:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$` are two [Riemann-integrable functions][bookofproofs$1763].
* By definition of [integral p-norms][bookofproofs$6804], and since `$|y^2|=y^2$` for all `$y\in\mathbb R$`,  `$$||f||_2=\left(\int_{a}^b (f(x))^2dx\right)^{\frac 12},\quad ||g||_2=\left(\int_{a}^b (g(x))^2dx\right)^{\frac 12}.$$`
* Now, the statement follows as a simple corollary from the [Hölder's inequality for integral p-norms][bookofproofs$8385] for the special case `$p=q=2.$`
