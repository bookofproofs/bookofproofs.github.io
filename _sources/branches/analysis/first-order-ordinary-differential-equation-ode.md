Let `\(U\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{2}\)` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] and let 
`$$f\colon\begin{cases}
U & \mapsto  \mathbb {R},\cr 
(t,y)  & \mapsto  f(t,y),
\end{cases}$$` be a [funktion][bookofproofs$592]. The equation

`\[\frac{dy(t)}{dt}=f(t,y(t)),\quad\text{short form notation: }y'=f(t,y)\]`

is called a *first-order ordinary differential equation*   **1st order ODE**) of `\(y\)`.

Please note that the 1st order ODE of `\(y\)` represents a whole class of many functions `\(y\)`, for which the [derivative][bookofproofs$1370] of `\(y\)` at `\(t\)` equals the value of the [vector field][bookofproofs$222] `\(f\)` on `\(y\)` at `\(t\)`.
