* Let `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be a [complex Cauchy sequence][bookofproofs$1250] and let `\(c_n=a_n+ib_n\)` for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)`.
* From the [proposition about complex Cauchy sequences versus real Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1705], it follows that `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and `\((b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` are [real Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1704].
* According to the [completeness principle for real numbers][bookofproofs$1108], they are [convergent real sequences][bookofproofs$141].
* From the [proposition about convergent complex sequences versus convergent real sequences][bookofproofs$1702] it follows that `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is a [convergent complex sequence][bookofproofs$1700].
