Let `$[a,b]$` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153], `$p,q > 1$` be a [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] with `$1/p+1/q=1,$` and let `$f,g:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$` be two [Riemann-integrable functions][bookofproofs$1763]. The for the [integral p-norms][bookofproofs$6804] the *Hölder's inequality* holds:

`$$\int_{a}^b|f(x)g(x)|dx\le ||f||_p||g||_q,\quad\forall p,q  > 1:\;\frac 1p+\frac 1q=1.$$`
