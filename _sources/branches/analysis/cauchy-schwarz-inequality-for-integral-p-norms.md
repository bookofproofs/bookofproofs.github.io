Let `$[a,b]$` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153], and let `$f,g:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$` be two [Riemann-integrable functions][bookofproofs$1763]. The for the [integral p-norms][bookofproofs$6804] the *Cauchy-Schwarz inequality* holds:

`$$\int_{a}^b|f(x)g(x)|dx\le \left(\int_{a}^b (f(x))^2dx\right)^{\frac 12}\left(\int_{a}^b (g(x))^2dx\right)^{\frac 12}.$$`
