The [zeros][bookofproofs$6736] the [real sine][bookofproofs$1746] `$\sin(x)=0$` are exactly the numbers `$x=k\pi,$` and of the [real cosine][bookofproofs$1745] `$\cos(x)=0$` are exactly the numbers `$x=\left(k+\frac 12\right)\pi,$` in which `$k\in\mathbb Z$` denotes an [integer][bookofproofs$844] and `$\pi$` denotes the [$\pi$ constant][bookofproofs$6738]. Formally,

`$$\sin(x)=0\Longleftrightarrow x=k\pi,\quad k\in\mathbb Z.$$`
`$$\cos(x)=0\Longleftrightarrow x=\left(k+\frac 12\right)\pi,\quad k\in\mathbb Z.$$`
