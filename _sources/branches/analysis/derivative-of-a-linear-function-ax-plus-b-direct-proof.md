Given a [linear function][bookofproofs$1377] `\(f(x)=ax +b\)`, `\(a,b\in\mathbb R\)` , and by definition is of the [derivative][bookofproofs$1370] we have

`\[f'(x)=\lim_{\substack{\xi\to x\\\xi\neq x}}\frac {f(\xi)-f(x)}{\xi-x}=\frac{a\xi+b-ax-b}{\xi-x}=a\cdot\frac{\xi-x}{\xi-x}=a.\]`

Note that the derivative of a linear function does not depend on the constant `\(b\)`, because it cancels out.
