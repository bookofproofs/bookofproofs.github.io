If `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is a [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] of [positive (or negative) real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] [tending to zero][bookofproofs$141], i.e. with `$\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n=0,$` then the real sequence `$(1/a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is [tending to infinity][bookofproofs$1345], i.e. either to `$+\infty$` (if `$a_n > 0$` for all `$n$`) or to `$-\infty$` (if `$a_n < 0$` for all `$n$`).
