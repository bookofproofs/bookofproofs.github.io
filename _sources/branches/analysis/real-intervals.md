Let `\(a,b\in\mathbb R\)` be [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105]. Using the [order relation for real numbers][bookofproofs$1107], we call a subset `\(I\subseteq\mathbb R\)` of real numbers a **real interval**, if it satisfies the following properties:

* `\(I:=\{x\in\mathbb R: a\le x \le b\}\)`. In this case we call `\(I\)` a **closed real interval** and denoted it by `\([a,b]\)`.
* `\(I:=\{x\in\mathbb R: a < x < b\}\)`. In this case we call `\(I\)` an **open real interval** and denoted it by `\((a,b)\)`. Please note that with `\(y:=(a+b)/2,~ r=|b-y|=|a-y|\)`, an open real interval can equivalently be defined as the [open ball][bookofproofs$849] `\(B(y,r)\)` in the metric space `\((\mathbb R,|~|)\)`.
* `\(I:=\{x\in\mathbb R: a < x \le b\}\)`. In this case we call `\(I\)` an *left-open, right-closed real interval* and denoted it by `\((a,b]\)`.
* `\(I:=\{x\in\mathbb R: a \le x < b\}\)`. In this case we call `\(I\)` an *right-open, left-closed real interval* and denoted it by `\([a,b)\)`.

By allowing either `\(a\)`, or `\(b\)` to be unbounded, i.e. `\(a,b\in\{\mathbb R,+ \infty, -\infty\}\)` we define 

* `\(I:=\{x\in\mathbb R: - \infty < x < b\}\)`. In this case we call `\(I\)` a *left-unbounded, right-open real interval* and denoted it by `\((- \infty,b)\)`.
* `\(I:=\{x\in\mathbb R: - \infty < x \le b\}\)`. In this case we call `\(I\)` a *left-unbounded, right-closed real interval* and denoted it by `\((- \infty,b]\)`.
* `\(I:=\{x\in\mathbb R: a < x < +  \infty\}\)`. In this case we call `\(I\)` a *right-unbounded, left-open real interval* and denoted it by `\((a,   + \infty)\)`.
* `\(I:=\{x\in\mathbb R: a \le x < + \infty\}\)`. In this case we call `\(I\)` a *right-unbounded, left-closed real interval* and denoted it by `\([a,+ \infty)\)`.
