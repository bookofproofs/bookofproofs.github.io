The following are examples of [subsets][bookofproofs$552] of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] _with_ [accumulation points][bookofproofs$174]:

* The [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] `$\left(\frac 1n\right)_{n > 0}$` has the accumulation point `$0,$` since for any `$\epsilon > 0$` there is an index `$n\in\mathbb N$` such that `$|1/n - 0| < \epsilon.$`
* By [definition of convergence][bookofproofs$141], the limit of every convergent sequence is at the same time its accumulation point.
* If `$[a,b]$` is a [real interval][bookofproofs$1153], then any real sequences `$(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` with `$x_n\in[a,b]$` is bounded, and contains according to the theorem of [Bolzano-Weierstrass][bookofproofs$1152] a convergent subsequence. Thus, any such sequence `$(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` has an accumulation point.
* All points of the real interval `$[a,b]$` are its accumulation points.
* All rational points in the real interval `$[a,b]\cap\mathbb Q$` are its accumulation points.


The following are examples of [subsets][bookofproofs$552] of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] _without_ [accumulation points][bookofproofs$174]:

* The set of [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `$\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$` has no accumulation points.
* The set of [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$\{\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots\}$` has no accumulation points.
