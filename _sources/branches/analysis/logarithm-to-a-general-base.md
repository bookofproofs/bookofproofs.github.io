The [exponential function of general base][bookofproofs$1603] `$\mathbb R\to\mathbb R,~x\to a^x$`, is [invertible][bookofproofs$1381] for all [positive][bookofproofs$1107] bases `$a > 0$`.  Its inverse function is [continuous][bookofproofs$1260], [strictly monotonically increasing][bookofproofs$282] and called the **logarithm to the base** `$a$`
`\[\log_a:\mathbb R_{+}^*\to\mathbb R.\]`

Furthermore, `$\log_a$` (the logarithm to the base `$a$`) can be calculated using `$\ln$` (i.e. the [natural logarithm][bookofproofs$1421]) by the formula
`$$\log_a(x)=\frac{\ln (x)}{\ln(a)},$$`
for all `$x\in\mathbb R_{+}^*.$`
