### "`\(\Rightarrow\)`"

Let `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\)` be an [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] with [non-negative][bookofproofs$1107] terms `\(x_n\ge 0\)` for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` and let sequence `\((s_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` of its partial sums `\(s_n:=\sum_{k=0}^n x_k\)` be [bounded][bookofproofs$1136].
Then the sequence `\((s_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is monotonically increasing, and it follows from the [monotone convergence theorem][bookofproofs$197] that `\((s_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is [convergent][bookofproofs$175].
### "`\(\Leftarrow\)`"

Let the infinite series be convergent. Then the sequence `\((s_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` of its partial sums is convergent. It follows from the corresponding proposition that [convergent sequences are bounded][bookofproofs$1137].
