The *$n$-th order Legendre polynomial* is defined by `$$P_{n}(x)={1 \over 2^{n}n!}{d^{n} \over dx^{n}}\left[(x^{2}-1)^{n}\right].$$` 

It is the solution of the following ordinary **Legendre differential equations**:

`$$(1-x^2)P_n^{\prime\prime}(x)-2xP_n^\prime(x)+n(n+1)P_{n}(x)=0.$$`

The equations are named after "Adrien-Marie Legendre":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/adrien-marie-legendre/
