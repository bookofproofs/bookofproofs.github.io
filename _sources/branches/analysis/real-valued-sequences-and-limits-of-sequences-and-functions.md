In this chapter, we study the behavior of the sequences in the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$1638] `$(\mathbb R, +, \cdot)$` but most of the theorems and definitions will be also applicable for the [field of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1647] `$(\mathbb Q, +, \cdot),$` and also the field of [complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690] `$(\mathbb C, +, \cdot).$` Whenever this is the case, we will indicate it by a marker like this:

> applicability: `$\mathbb {Q, R, C}$`

Sometimes, also the sets of [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `$\mathbb N$` or of [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$\mathbb Z$` will be listed, if a definition is applicable also for them, exploring the set inclusion `$\mathbb N\subset \mathbb Z\subset\mathbb Q\subset\mathbb R.$`
