Let `\(M\)` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] and let `\({\mathcal {R}}\)` be a system of its [subsets][bookofproofs$552] `\({\mathcal {R}}\)` is called a **ring of sets**, if is is closed under [set-theoretic differences and set-theoretic unions][bookofproofs$552], i.e. if 

`\[S,T\in {\mathcal {R}}\Longrightarrow \cases{S\setminus T\in {\mathcal {R}},\\S\cup T\in {\mathcal {R}}.}\]`


Please note that in particular `\(\emptyset \in {\mathcal {R}}\)`, if we take `\(S=T\)`.
