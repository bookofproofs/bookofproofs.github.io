Let  `\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\)` and `\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n\)` be two [convergent series][bookofproofs$198]. For a fixed index `\(n\)`, we set  
`\[c_n:=\sum_{k=0}^n a_{n-k}b_k.\]`
Then the series `\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n\)`, also called the **Cauchy product** of the initial two series, is not necessarily convergent[^1].

[^1]: A sufficient condition for the Cauchy product to converge is the absolute convergence of the initial two series - [see corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$1390]. In this case, the Cauchy product is even absolutely convergent.
