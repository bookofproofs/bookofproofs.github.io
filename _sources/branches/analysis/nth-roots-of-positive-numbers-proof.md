By hypothesis, `\(n\)` is an [integer][bookofproofs$844] with `\(|n|\ge 2\)` and  `\(\mathbb R_{+}\)` denotes the set of [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107], including `\(0\)`. 

Note that the `\(n\)`-th [power function][bookofproofs$1618] `\(f:x\to x^n\)` means a multiplication of the continuous function `\(id:x\to x\)` with each other (`\(n\)` times). Because [arithmetic operations (like multiplication of continuous functions with each other) preserve the continuity][bookofproofs$1261], the `\(n\)`-th power is a  [continuous function][bookofproofs$1260].
Moreover, for all `\(x\ge 0\)` it follows from `\(y > x\)` that `\(y^n > x^n\)`, if `\(n\ge 2\)`, and `\(y^n < x^n\)`, if `\(-n\le -2\)`. Thus, the `\(n\)`-th power is [strictly monotonically increasing][bookofproofs$282], if `\(n\ge 2\)` and strictly monotonically decreasing, if `\(-n\le -2\)` on any [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] `\([0,y]\)` for every `\(y > 0\)`. 

For these reasons, the `\(n\)`-th power is [invertible][bookofproofs$407] on whole `\(\mathbb R_{ + }\)` and the inverse function `\(g:x\to\sqrt[n]{x}\)` [exists, is continuous and strictly monotonically increasing][bookofproofs$1381] (respectively decreasing) on whole `\(\mathbb R_{ + }\)`.
