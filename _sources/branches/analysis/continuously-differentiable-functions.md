Let `$D\subset\mathbb R$` and let `$f:D\to\mathbb R$` be a [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f$` is called **continuously differentiable**, if its [derivative][bookofproofs$1370] `$f':D\to\mathbb R$` is [continuous][bookofproofs$1260].
Correspondingly, if `$f$` has a [derivative of order `$n$`][bookofproofs$6771] `$f^{(n)}$` on `$D$` and if `$f^{(n)}$` is continous, the function `$f$` is called *$n$ times continuously differentiable*.
