* By hypothesis, `$a_1,\ldots,a_n$` are given [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] and `$p_1,\ldots,p_n$` are [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107].
* Let `$m:=\min(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$` be the [minimum][bookofproofs$6603] and let `$M:=\max(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$` be the [maximum][bookofproofs$6602] of the numbers `$a_1,\ldots,a_n.$`
* Since `$p_1,\ldots,p_n$` are positive, by rules [3rd and 6th of calculation wih inequalities][bookofproofs$594], we get for the [weighted arithmetic mean][bookofproofs$8369] the [order relation][bookofproofs$1107] `$$(p_1+\cdots+p_n)m\le p_1a_1+\cdots+p_na_n \le (p_1+\cdots+p_n)M.$$`
* Applying the 6th rule once again, we get `$$m\le\frac {p_1a_1+\cdots+p_na_n}{p_1+\cdots+p_n} \le M.$$`
