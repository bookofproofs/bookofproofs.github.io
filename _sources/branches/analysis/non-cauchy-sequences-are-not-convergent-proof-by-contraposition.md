### Context

* Let  `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` be a [real sequence][bookofproofs$875].
### Hypothesis

* Let `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` be not a [Cauchy sequence][bookofproofs$1704].
### Implications

* Since [all Cauchy sequences converge][bookofproofs$1108], it follows that  `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` cannot [converge][bookofproofs$141], by [contraposition][bookofproofs$1330].
### Conclusion

* Thus, `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is not convergent.
