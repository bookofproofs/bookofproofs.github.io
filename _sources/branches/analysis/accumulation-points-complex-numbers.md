Let `$(z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` be a [complex sequence][bookofproofs$1249]. An **accumulation point** of `$(z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is a complex number `$\alpha$` such that, for every `$\epsilon > 0$` the [open disc][bookofproofs$8551] `$B(\alpha,\epsilon)$` contains [infinitely many][bookofproofs$985] sequence members `$z_n.$`

More generally, an **accumulation point** of an infinite subset `$U\subseteq\mathbb C$` is a complex number `$\alpha$` such that, for every `$\epsilon > 0,$` the [open disc][bookofproofs$8551] `$B(\alpha,\epsilon)$` contains [infinitely many][bookofproofs$985] elements of `$U.$`
