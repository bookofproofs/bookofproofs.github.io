If either the [sequence][bookofproofs$875] of [n-th roots][bookofproofs$46] `$(\sqrt[n]{|a_n|})_{n\in\mathbb N},$` or the sequence of ratios `$\left(\frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_n|}\right)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is [convergent][bookofproofs$141] to a limit `$\alpha > 0,$` then the [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109]  `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$` is [convergent][bookofproofs$175] if `$0 < \alpha < 1,$` and [divergent][bookofproofs$217], if `$\alpha > 1.$`

Note: In the case `$\alpha=1,$` this criterion allows no conclusion whatsoever on the convergence behavior of the series `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n,$` and further investigation is needed!
