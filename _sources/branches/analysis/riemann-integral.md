This subsection of bookofproofs.org is dedicated to the [Riemann integral][bookofproofs$1763], which is defined on some [closed real intervals][bookofproofs$1153] `$[a,b]$`. The Riemann integral `$\int_a^b f(x)dx$` can be interpreted as the area enclosed by the `$x$`-axis and the graph of the function `$f$` on the interval `$[a,b]$`. 

In some sense, the integration is inverse to the differentiation, which is shown in the [corresponding theorem][bookofproofs$1768]. This fact allows in many cases to calculate the integral of a function using an explicit formula.
