Let `$c$` be a constant and `$f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$` be a [differentiable][bookofproofs$1370] function with the [first-order ODE][bookofproofs$247].
> `$f'(x)=cf(x)$` for all `$x\in\mathbb R$`.

Let `$A:=f(0).$` Then the [exponential function][bookofproofs$281].
> `$f(x)=A\exp(cx)$`

is the solution of the above first-order ODE.

In particular, the exponential function `$\exp:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$` is the differential function `$f,$` which is uniquely defined by `$f'=f$` and `$f(0)=1$`.
