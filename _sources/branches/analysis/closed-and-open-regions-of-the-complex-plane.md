Let `$U\subseteq\mathbb C$` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of the [complex plane][bookofproofs$216]. We call `$U$` an **open region** if for every point `$u\in U$` there is a [disc][bookofproofs$8551] `$D(u,r)$` centered at `$u$` and some radius `$r > 0$` such that the entire disc `$D(u,r)$` is contained in `$U$`.

### Notes:

* `$U$` is an [open subset][bookofproofs$852] of the specific [topological space][bookofproofs$6189] which is the complex plane, together with [absolute value][bookofproofs$1247] as a distance measure.
