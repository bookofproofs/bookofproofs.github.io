A **real sequence** `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is a [sequence][bookofproofs$874] of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `\(a_n\in\mathbb R\)`.

### Examples

* `$(2^n)_{n\in\mathbb N}=(1,2,4,8,\ldots)$`
* `$(\sqrt{n})_{n\in\mathbb N}=(0,1,\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\ldots)$`
* `$(3)_{n\in\mathbb N}=(3,3,3,3,\ldots)$`
* `$(\frac{n}{n+1})_{n\in\mathbb N}=(0,\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{3}{4},\ldots)$`
* [recursively defined][bookofproofs$8679] sequences.
