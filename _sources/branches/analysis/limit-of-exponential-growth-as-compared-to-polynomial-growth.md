For all (fixed) [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `$n$`, we have that `$$\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac {\exp(x)}{\exp_x(n)}=\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac {e^x}{x^n}=\infty,$$`
`$$\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac {\exp_x(n)}{\exp(x)}=\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac {x^n}{e^x}=0.$$`
These [limits][bookofproofs$6683] show that if `$x$` is growing, the growth of the [exponential function][bookofproofs$281] of `$x$` is faster than the growth of any [$n$-th power][bookofproofs$1618] of `$x$`, no matter how big `$n$` is.
