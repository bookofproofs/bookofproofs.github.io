Let `$D\subset\mathbb R$` and let `$f_n:D\to\mathbb R$` be [continuous functions][bookofproofs$1260] on `$D$` and let the sequence `$(f_n)_{n\to\mathbb N}$` be [uniformly convergent][bookofproofs$8382] to the limit function `$f:D\to\mathbb R.$` Then `$f$` is also continuous on `$D.$`

The limit function `$f$` does not have to be continuous if the continous functions `$f_n$` [converge only pointwise][bookofproofs$8382] to `$f.$`
