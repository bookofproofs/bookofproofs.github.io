Let `\((\mathbb R,|~|)\)` be the [metric space of all real numbers][bookofproofs$618],  together with the distance defined by the [absolute value][bookofproofs$583] "`\(|~|\)`", 
and let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be a [sequence of real numbers][bookofproofs$875] in `\((\mathbb R,|~|)\)`. The sequence `\((a_n)\)` is called a **real Cauchy sequence**, if for all `\(\epsilon > 0\)` there exists an index[^1] `\(N(\epsilon)\in\mathbb N\)` with
`\[|a_i-a_j| < \epsilon\quad\quad\text{ for all }i,j\ge N(\epsilon).\]`

[^1]: `\(N(\epsilon)\)` means that the natural number `\(N\)` depends only on the rational number `\(\epsilon\)`.
