For all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$x\in\mathbb R$`, the values of the [real cosine][bookofproofs$1745] and [real sine][bookofproofs$1746] are equal to each other for the arguments `$x$` and `$\pi/2-x,$` (where `$\pi$` denotes the [$\pi$ constant][bookofproofs$6738]), formally `$$\cos\left(\frac\pi2-x\right)=\sin(x),\quad\quad\sin\left(\frac\pi2-x\right)=\cos(x).$$`
