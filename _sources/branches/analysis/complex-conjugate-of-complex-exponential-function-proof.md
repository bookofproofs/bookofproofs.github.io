* By hypothesis, `$z\in\mathbb C.$` It follows: 
* `$\exp(z)^*=\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n! }\right)^*$` by definition of the [complex exponential function][bookofproofs$312] and the [complex conjugate][bookofproofs$1245].
* `$=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{z^n}{n! }\right)^*,$` by [rules of calculating with complex conjugates][bookofproofs$1251].
* `$=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(z^*)^n}{n! },$` 
* `$=\exp(z^\ast),$` by definition of the [complex exponential function][bookofproofs$312] and the [complex conjugate][bookofproofs$1245].
