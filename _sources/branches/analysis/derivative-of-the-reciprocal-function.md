The [derivative][bookofproofs$1370] of the [reciprocal function][bookofproofs$6756] `$f(x)=1/x,$` `$x\in\mathbb R,$` `$x\neq 0$`  is `$$f'(x)=-\frac{1}{x^2}.$$`

The graph of the derivative of the reciprocal function is shown in the following figure:

<div style ='float:left'>
	<div id="box" class="jxgbox" style="width:500px; height:500px;"></div>
</div>
<div style ='clear:both'></div>
