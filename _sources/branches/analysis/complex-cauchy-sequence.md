Let `\((\mathbb C,|~|)\)` be the [mectric space of all complex numbers][bookofproofs$1253],  together with the distance defined by the [absolute value][bookofproofs$1247] "`\(|~|\)`", and let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`  be a [sequence of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1249] in `\((\mathbb C,|~|)\)`. The sequence `\((a_n)\)` is called a **complex Cauchy sequence**, if for all real `\(\epsilon > 0\)` there exists an index[^1] `\(N(\epsilon)\in\mathbb N\)` with
`\[|a_i-a_j| < \epsilon\quad\quad\text{ for all }i,j\ge N(\epsilon).\]`

[^1]: `\(N(\epsilon)\)` means that the natural number `\(N\)` depends only on the real number `\(\epsilon\)`.
