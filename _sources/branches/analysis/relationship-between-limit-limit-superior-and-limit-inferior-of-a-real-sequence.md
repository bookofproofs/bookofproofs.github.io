A [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is [convergent][bookofproofs$141], if and only if its [limit][bookofproofs$141] equals its [limit superior][bookofproofs$6673] and its [limit inferior][bookofproofs$6674], formally

`$$\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n=\overline{\lim_{n\to\infty}} a_n=\underline{\lim_{n\to\infty}} a_n.$$`
