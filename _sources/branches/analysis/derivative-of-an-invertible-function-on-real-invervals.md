Let `\([a,b]\)` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] and let `\(f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R\)` be a [continuous][bookofproofs$1260], [strictly monotonically increasing][bookofproofs$282]  (respectively decreasing) real function, and let `$\phi:=f^*:D\to\mathbb R$` be its [inverse function][bookofproofs$1381], where `$D=f^*([a,b]).$` 
If `$f$` is [differentiable][bookofproofs$1370] at a point `$x\in[a,b]$` and if `$f(x)\neq 0$`, then the function `$\phi$` is differentiable at a point `$y=f(x).$` In particular,  `$$\phi'(x)=\frac1{f'(x)}=\frac1{f'(\phi(y))}.$$`
