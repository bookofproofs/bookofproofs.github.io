Let `$0 < a < b$` and let `$s\in\mathbb R,$` but `$s\not\in\mathbb  Z$`, then the [Riemann integral][bookofproofs$1763] of the [general power function of positive numbers][bookofproofs$1626].
`$$\int_a^bx^s dx=\frac{x^{s+1}}{s+1}\begin{array}{|l}a\\\\b\end{array}.$$`

The above formula also holds for the following cases:
* `$s\in\mathbb N$` and arbitrary `$a,b$` with `$a < b$`,
* `$s\in\mathbb Z$` with `$s\le -2$`, and `$0\not\in [a,b]$`.

For `$s=-1$` the above formula is not defined.
