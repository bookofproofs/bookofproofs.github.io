The proposition follows immediately from the corresponding proposition for the [product of convergent complex sequences][bookofproofs$1715].
`\[\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} (a_n \cdot b_n)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n \cdot \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} b_n,\]`

if we set `\(b_n\)` to a constant [complex number][bookofproofs$1698] `\(b_n:=x\)` for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)`.
