Let `$D$` be a [set][bookofproofs$550], `$\mathbb F$` be a either the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$1640] or the [field of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690] and let `$f:D\to\mathbb F$` be a [function][bookofproofs$592]. We set `$$||f||_\infty:=\sup\{|f(x)|\mid x\in D\},$$` where `$|f(x)|$` is the [absolute value of real numbers][bookofproofs$583] (or the [absolute value of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1247]) and call `$||f||_\infty$` the **supremum norm** of `$f$` on `$D.$`

### Notes

* `$||f||_\infty$` is either a [non-negative real number][bookofproofs$1107] or `$+\infty,$` because `$f$` can be an arbitrary function.
* `$||f||_\infty\neq+\infty$` if and only if `$|f|$` is [bounded][bookofproofs$302] on `$D.$`
* The supremum norm is a generalization of the [maximum norm][bookofproofs$6794] which was defined for vectors. For functions, the maximum value of `$|f(x)|$` for all `$x\in D$` does not have to exist (i.e. be an element of the [image][bookofproofs$592] of the absolute value of the function `$|f(D)|$`). Therefore, the [supremum][bookofproofs$6669] replaces the maximum used in the original definition.
* Note that the supremum norm works fine even in the case if `$D$` has infinitely many (even uncountably infinitely many) elements. This was not the case for the maximum norm.
