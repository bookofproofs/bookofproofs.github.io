### Context

* Let `$c\in\mathbb R$` and let `$a\in\mathbb R.$` 
* Let `$f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R,$` `$f(x)=c$` be the [constant function][bookofproofs$1371].
### Hypothesis

* Given `$\epsilon > 0$`.

### Implications

* Then for `$\delta:=\epsilon$` we have that for all `$x$` with `$0 < |x-a| < \delta$` we have that `$|f(x)-c|=|c-c|=0 < \epsilon.$`

### Conclusion

* By the [definition of limit][bookofproofs$6683], we have `$\lim_{x\to a }f(x)=c.$`
