Let `\(x,y\)` be [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] and let `\(a,b\)` be [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107]. Then the [general power function][bookofproofs$1626] obeys the following calculation rules:

`\[\begin{array}{rl}
(i)&a^{x+y}=a^x\cdot a^y,\\
(ii)&(a^x)^y=a^{x\cdot y},\\
(iii)&a^x\cdot b^x=(ab)^x,\\
(iv)&a^{-x}=\frac 1{a^x}.\\
\end{array}\]`
