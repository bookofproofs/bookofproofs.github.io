Let `\(D\subseteq \mathbb R\)`, `\(a\in D\)`  and let `\(f,g:D\to\mathbb R\)` be two real functions [continuous at `\(a\)` ][bookofproofs$219] and let `\(\lambda\in\mathbb R\)`. Then the functions

> `\((1)\)` `\(f + g:D\to\mathbb R\)`

> `\((2)\)` `\(\lambda f:D \to \mathbb R\)`

> `\((3)\)` `\(f\cdot g:D \to \mathbb R\)`

are continuous at `\(a\)`. 

Moreover, if `\(g(a)\neq 0\)`, then the function 

> `\((4)\)` `\(\frac fg:D' \to \mathbb R\)` with the new domain `\(D':=\{x\in D:g(x)\neq 0\}\)`

is also continuous at `\(a\)`.
