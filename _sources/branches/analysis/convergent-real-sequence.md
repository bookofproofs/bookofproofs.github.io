A **convergent real sequence** is a [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`, which is [convergent][bookofproofs$148] in the [metric space of real numbers][bookofproofs$618] `\((\mathbb R,|~|)\)`. In other words, `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is convergent to the number `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`, i.e.  for each `\(\epsilon > 0\)` there exists an `\(N\in\mathbb N\)` with
`\[ | x_n-x | < \epsilon\quad\quad \text{ for all }n\ge N.\]`

If `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is convergent to the number `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`, we write
`\[\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n=x.\]`

In this case, the convergent sequence is also said to be **convergent to the number** (or **tending to the number**) `$x$`.
