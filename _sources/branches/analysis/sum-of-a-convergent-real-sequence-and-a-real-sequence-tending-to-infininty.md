Let `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` be a [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] [tending to infinity][bookofproofs$1345] (i.e. either `$+\infty$` or `$-\infty$`). Let `$(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` be a real sequence [tending to some real number][bookofproofs$141] `$b$`, i.e. with `$\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n=b.$` Then the real sequence `$(a_n+b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is [tending to infinity][bookofproofs$1345] as `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` does.
