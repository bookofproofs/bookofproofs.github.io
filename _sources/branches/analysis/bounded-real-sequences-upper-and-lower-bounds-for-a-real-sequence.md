Let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`  be a [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] and let `\(D\)` be its [carrier set][bookofproofs$6658].
1. `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is called **bounded above**, if `\(D\)` is [bounded above][bookofproofs$584].
1. `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is called **bounded below**, if `\(D\)` is [bounded below][bookofproofs$584].
1. `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is called **bounded**, if `\(D\)` is [bounded][bookofproofs$584].
### Examples

* The [alternating sequence][bookofproofs$1346] is [bounded above][bookofproofs$1136] by `$1$` and bounded below by `$-1.$`
* The sequence `$\left(\frac{2n+1}{n+1}\right)_{n\in\mathbb N}=\left(2-\frac{1}{n+1}\right)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is bounded above by `$2$` and bounded below by `$1.$` 
* The sequence `$(n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is bounded below by `$0$` and unbounded above.
