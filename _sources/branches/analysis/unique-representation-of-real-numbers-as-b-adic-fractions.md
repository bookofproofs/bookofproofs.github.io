Let `\(b \ge 2\)` be a natural number. Every real number `\(x\in\mathbb R\)` can be represented as a [`\(b\)`-adic number][bookofproofs$1110].
`\[x=\pm \sum_{k=-n}^\infty a_kb^{-k}.\]`

This means that it can be written as a floating point number[^1] with the radix `\(b\)`:

`\[x=\pm a_{-k}a_{-k+1}\cdots a_{-1}a_{0}  .  a_{1}a_{2}a_{3}\cdots \]`

[^1]: Floating point refers to the fact that the radix point can "float"; that is, it can be place anywhere depending on where the last significant digit `\(a_0\)` is.
