The [convergence][bookofproofs$175] of a series `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\)` to the limit `\(L\)` is  a necessary but not a sufficient criterion for the convergence of any [rearrangement][bookofproofs$1363] of this series, formally

`\[\begin{array}{l}\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k=L\text{ convergent } \cancel\Longrightarrow (\text{ it follows not! })\\\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_{\sigma(k)}\text{ convergent  for every permutation }\sigma:\mathbb N\to \mathbb N.\end{array}\]`
