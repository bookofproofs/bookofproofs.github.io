Differential equations are mathematical objects which belong to the basic equipment for the work mathematicians, physicists, technicians, chemists and other scientists. They help to describe, evaluate or forecast the behavior of some simple dynamic systems, including motion, growth, and other changing systems. From a theoretical point of view, they are equations including the derivative(s) of an unknown function, which have to be found either explicitly or approximated numerically. The purpose of the theory of differential equations to classify the different types of differential equations and derive methods and conditions of solving them.

As a prerequisite to study differential equations, you should be acquainted with the [real analysis of multiple variables][bookofproofs$29].
In this part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>, you will:

* get an overview of the different types of of __differential equations__ (DE)
* Learn to solve explicitly or approximately the so called __ordinary DE__ and their various applications
* Learn different methods to tackle the so called __partial DE__ and some of their applications.
