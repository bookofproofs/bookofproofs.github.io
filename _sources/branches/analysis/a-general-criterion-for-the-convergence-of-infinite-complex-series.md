A [complex infinite series][bookofproofs$1724] `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\)` is a [convergent complex series][bookofproofs$147], if and only if for every `\(\epsilon  > 0\)` there is an index `\(N(\epsilon)\in\mathbb N\)` such that

`\[\left|\sum_{k=m}^n x_k\right| < \epsilon\quad\quad \text{for all}\quad n\ge m\ge N(\epsilon).\]`
