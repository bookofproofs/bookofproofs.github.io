For all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `\(x,y\in\mathbb R\)` the so-called **triangle inequality** holds: `$|x+y|\le |x|+|y|,$` where `$|.|$` denotes the [absolute value][bookofproofs$583].
The same inequality holds if we replace `$x,y$` by [complex numbers][bookofproofs$216] and use the [absolute value of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1247].
