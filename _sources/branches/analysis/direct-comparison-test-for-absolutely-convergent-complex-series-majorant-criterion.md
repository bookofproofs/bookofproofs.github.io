In order to test, if a [complex series][bookofproofs$1724] `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\)` is an [absolutely convergent complex series][bookofproofs$1725], it suffices to find a [convergent real series][bookofproofs$175] `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty y_k\)` with `\(|x_k|\le y_k\)` for all `\(k\)`. Such a series  `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty y_k\)` is called the **majorant** of the series `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\)`.
