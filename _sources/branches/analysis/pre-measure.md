Let `\(M\)` be a [set][bookofproofs$550] and let `\({\mathcal {P}}\)` be a [ring of sets][bookofproofs$6216] defined on `\(M\)`. A [function][bookofproofs$592] mapping `\(\mathcal {P}\)` to the set of [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\[\mu\colon  \cases{{\mathcal {P}}\longrightarrow \mathbb {R_{+}},\cr T\longmapsto \mu (T),}\]` is called a *pre-measure on `\(M\)`*, if `\(\mu (\emptyset)=0\)` and if for every [countable][bookofproofs$772] [family][bookofproofs$6198] of [mutually disjoint][bookofproofs$6227] [subsets][bookofproofs$552] `\(T_{i}\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}\)`, `\(i\in I\)`, the measure of the [union of these subsets][bookofproofs$552] equals the sum of the measures of each subset, formally: 
`\[\mu \left(\bigcup _{i\in I}T_{i}\right)=\sum _{i\in I}\mu (T_{i}).\]`
The second property is called *`\(\sigma\)`-additivity*.

Please note that the only difference between a [pre-measure][bookofproofs$6236] and a [measure][bookofproofs$6232] is that a pre-measure is defined on a [ring of sets][bookofproofs$6216], while a measure is defined on a [`\(\sigma\)`-algebra][bookofproofs$6212].
