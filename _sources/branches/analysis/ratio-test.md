Let `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$` be an [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] with `$a_n\neq 0$` for all `$n \ge N$`, where `$N\in\mathbb N$` is some index (i.e. all but the first `$N$` sequence members `$a_n$` must be different from `$0$`). Furthermore, assume that there exists a [positive][bookofproofs$1107] `$q$` with `$0 < q < 1$` such that `$$\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|\le q$$` for all `$n \ge N.$` Then `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$` is an [absolutely convergent series][bookofproofs$198].
But if for an index `$N\in\mathbb N$` we have `$$\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|\ge 1\text{ for all }n \ge N,$$` then the series is [divergent][bookofproofs$217].
