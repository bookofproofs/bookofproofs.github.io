Let `$[a,b]$` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] and let `$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$` be a [continuously differentiable function][bookofproofs$6812]. For `$y\in\mathbb R,$` we define the [Riemann integral][bookofproofs$1763].
`$$F(y):=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\sin(yx)dx.$$`
Then the [limit][bookofproofs$6683] of `$F(y)$` tends to `$0$` as `$y$` [tends to infinity][bookofproofs$1345]. Formally, then `$$\lim_{|y|\to\infty}F(y)=0.$$`
