A [curve][bookofproofs$1208] `\(f:I\to\mathbb R^n.\)` is called **closed** if the interval `\(I\)` is closed, i.e. `\(I=[a,b]\)` and if `\(f(a)=f(b)\)`.

A closed curve `\(f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R^n\)`, whose [restriction][bookofproofs$1170] to the open real interval `\((a,b)\)`, i.e. the function `\({f|}_{(a,b)} : I \to \mathbb R^n\)`, is a [simple curve][bookofproofs$1210], is called a **simple closed curve**. 

### Examples of closed curves in the plane `\(\mathbb R^2\)` 

The closed curve to the left is a simple closed curve, while the curve right to that curve is a closed curve, but not a simple closed curve.
