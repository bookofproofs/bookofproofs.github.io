Let `$U\subseteq\mathbb C$` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of [complex numbers][bookofproofs$216] and let `$f:U\to\mathbb C$` be a [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f$` is called **continuous** at `$\alpha\in U$` if `$f$` [converges][bookofproofs$8555] to `$\alpha$` and `$$\lim_{z\to\alpha} f(z)=f(\alpha).$$` `$f$` is said to be **continuous** in `$U$`, if `$f$` is continuous at every point `$\alpha\in U.$`
