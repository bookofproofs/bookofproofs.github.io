Let `$D$` be a [real interval][bookofproofs$1153] and `$f:D\to\mathbb R$` a [function][bookofproofs$592]. Using the [order-relation for real numbers][bookofproofs$1107], we define:

* the **positive part** of the function `$$f_+(x):=\cases{f(x)&if `$f(x) > 0$`\\0&else.}$$`
* the **negative part** of the function `$$f_-(x):=\cases{-f(x)&if `$f(x) < 0$`\\0&else.}$$`

Note that `$f_+\ge 0$` and `$f_-\ge 0$` and that `$f=f_+-f_-$` as well as `$|f|=f_++f_-.$`
