Let `$a < b$`. The [Riemann-integral][bookofproofs$1370] of the [inverse tangent][bookofproofs$6749] `$\arctan(x)$` on the [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] is given by the formula

`$$\int_a^b\arctan(x)dx= \left(x\arctan(x)-\frac 12\log(1+x^2)\right)\;\begin{array}{|l}a\\\\b\end{array}.$$`
