The [exponential function][bookofproofs$281] `\(\exp:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R_{+}^*\)` is [invertible][bookofproofs$1381] on any [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] `\([a,b]\)`. Its inverse function is [continuous][bookofproofs$1260], [strictly monotonically increasing][bookofproofs$282] and called the **natural logarithm**
`\[\ln:\mathbb R_{+}^*\to\mathbb R.\]`
