Let `$X$` be a [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617], `$D\subset X$` be a [compact][bookofproofs$6575] [subset][bookofproofs$552] and `$f:D\mapsto \mathbb R$` a [continuous function][bookofproofs$1205] mapping the domain `$D$` to the [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$\mathbb R$`. Then the function `$f$` is [bounded][bookofproofs$302].
