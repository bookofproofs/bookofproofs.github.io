A [real series][bookofproofs$1109] `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\)` is called **convergent**, if the [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] `\((s_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` of **partial sums** `\[s_n:=\sum_{k=0}^n x_k,\quad\quad n\in\mathbb N\]` is [convergent][bookofproofs$141].
For convergent real series, the notation 

`\[\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\]`

can, depending on the context, denote two things:

1. the convergent real series itself or 
1. the convergent real series itself or
