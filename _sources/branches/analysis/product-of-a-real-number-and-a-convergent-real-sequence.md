Let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be a [convergent real sequence][bookofproofs$141] with `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n=a\)` and let `\(x\in\mathbb R\)` be a [real number][bookofproofs$1105]. Consider the real sequence `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` with `\(c_n:=x a_n\)`. Then `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is also convergent and its limit equals `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} c_n=xa\)`.

### Notes

* This proposition can be expressed in the short form: `\[\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} (x \cdot a_n)=x \cdot \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n.\]`
* The proposition's proof can be transferred also to sequences of other kinds than real numbers, for example, the complex numbers.
