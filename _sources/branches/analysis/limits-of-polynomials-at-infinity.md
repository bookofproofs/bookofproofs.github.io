Let `$p:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$` be a [real polynomial][bookofproofs$199] with the degree `$n$`, i.e. `$$p(x):=a_nx^n + \ldots + a_1x + a_0.$$`

Then there are the following [limits][bookofproofs$6683] of `$p$` at infinity:

`$$\begin{array}{rcl}\lim_{x\to+\infty}p(x)&=&+\infty\\\lim_{x\to-\infty}p(x)&=&\cases{+\infty,& if `$n$` is even\\-\infty,&if `$n$` is odd.}\end{array}$$`
