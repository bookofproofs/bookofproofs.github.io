Let `\(D\subset\mathbb R\)` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$\mathbb R$` and let `$f:D\mapsto \mathbb R$` be a [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f$` is called **uniformly continuous**, if and only if for every `$\epsilon > 0$` there is a `$\delta > 0$` such that 
`$$|f(x)-f(y)| < \epsilon$$`
for all `$x,y\in D$` with `$$|x-y| < \delta.$$`
