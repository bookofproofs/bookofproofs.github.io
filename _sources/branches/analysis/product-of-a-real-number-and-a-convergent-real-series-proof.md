* Let `$\lambda$` be a [real number][bookofproofs$1105].
* Let `$\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k$` be a [convergent real series][bookofproofs$175].
* Let `$c_n:=\sum_{k=0}^n a_k$` be the corresponding [partial sum][bookofproofs$1109].
* The [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] `$(c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is a  [convergent real sequence][bookofproofs$141] by hypothesis.
* From the [distributivity law for real numbers][bookofproofs$520] it follows  `$$\sum_{k=0}^n \lambda a_k=\lambda \sum_{k=0}^n a_k=\lambda c_n.$$`
* By the [law for the product of a real number and a convergent real sequence][bookofproofs$1131] it follows 
`$$\lim_{n\to\infty}(\lambda c_n)=\lambda \lim_{n\to\infty}c_n.$$`
* By construction, it follows 
`$$\sum_{k=0}^\infty(\lambda a_k)=\lambda \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k.$$`
* Therefore, the [real series][bookofproofs$1109] `$\sum_{k=0}^\infty (\lambda a_k)$` is a [convergent real series][bookofproofs$175].
