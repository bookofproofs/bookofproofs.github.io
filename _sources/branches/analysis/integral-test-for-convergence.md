Let `$N\in\mathbb N$` be a non-negativ [natural number][bookofproofs$718] ($N\ge 1$) and let `$f:[N,\infty)\to\mathbb R_+$` be a [monotonically decreasing][bookofproofs$282] and [non-negative-valued][bookofproofs$1107] function. The [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] `$$\sum_{n=N}^\infty f(n)$$` is [convergent][bookofproofs$175] if and only if the [improper integral][bookofproofs$8343].
`$$\int_{N}^\infty f(n)dx$$`
is convergent.
