The above example calls for a sufficient condition, under which a function is Riemann-integrable. The following proposition provides such a condition.

---

Let `\([a,b]\)` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153]. A [function][bookofproofs$592] `\(f:[a,b]\mapsto\mathbb R\)` is [Riemann integrable][bookofproofs$1763], if and only if

* `\(f\)` is [bounded][bookofproofs$302], and 
* for every `\(\epsilon > 0\)` there exist some [step functions][bookofproofs$1751] `\(\phi:[a,b]\mapsto\mathbb R\)` and `\(\psi:[a,b]\mapsto\mathbb R\)` with `\[\phi\le f\le \psi\]` and `\[\int_a^b\psi(x)dx-\int_a^b\phi(x)dx\le \epsilon.\]`
