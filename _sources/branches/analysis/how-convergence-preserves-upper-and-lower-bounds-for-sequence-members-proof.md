This follows immediately from the corresponding rule, [how convergence preserves the order relation of sequence members][bookofproofs$1144], if we define the constant sequences 

* `\((u_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` with `\(u_n:=U\)` for and `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` and the upper bound `\(U\)` and
* `\((l_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` with `\(l_n:=L\)` for and `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` and the lower bound `\(L\)` and consider the order relation

`\[l_n\le a_n\le u_n.\]`

For the limits `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n=a\)`, `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} l_n=L\)` and `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} u_n=U\)` it follows then that

`\[L\le a\le U.\]`
