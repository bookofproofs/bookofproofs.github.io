Let `$a < b$`, `$]a,b[$` be an [open real interval][bookofproofs$1153], `$f:]a,b[\to\mathbb R$` be a [twice differentiable function][bookofproofs$1370] at a point `$x\in ]a,b[$` with

> `$f'(x)=0$` and `$f'\;'(x) > 0$` (respectively `$f'\;'(x) < 0$`).[^1]

Then `$x$` is a [local maximum][bookofproofs$6775] (respectively a [local minimum][bookofproofs$6775]) of `$f$`.

[^1]: Note that the condition is only sufficient but not necessary for a local extremum. For instance, the function `$f(x)=x^4$` has for `$x=0$` a local minimum, but `$f'\;'(x)=0.$`
