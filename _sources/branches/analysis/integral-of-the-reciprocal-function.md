Let `$0 < a < b$` or let `$a < b < 0$`. Then the [Riemann integral][bookofproofs$1763] of the [reciprocal function][bookofproofs$6756] is given by

`$$\int_a^b\frac 1x dx=\log(|x|)\;\begin{array}{|l}a\\\\b\end{array}.$$`

Where `$\log(|x|)$` is the [natural logarithm][bookofproofs$1421] of the [absolute value][bookofproofs$583] of `$x$`.
