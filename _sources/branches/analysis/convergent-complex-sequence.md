A **convergent complex sequence** is a [complex sequence][bookofproofs$1249] `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`, which is [convergent][bookofproofs$148] in the [metric space of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1253] `\((\mathbb C,|~|)\)`. In other words, `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is convergent to the number `\(x\in\mathbb C\)`, if and only if for each `\(\epsilon > 0\)` there exists an `\(N\in\mathbb N\)` with 
`\[ | x_n-x | < \epsilon\quad\quad \text{ for all }n\ge N.\]`

If `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is convergent to the number `\(x\in\mathbb C\)`, we write 
`\[\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n=x.\]`
