Let `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$` and `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n$` be [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] with [positive][bookofproofs$1107] terms `$a_n > 0$` and `$b_n > 0$` for all `$n\in\mathbb N$` and let the [sequence][bookofproofs$875] of ratios `$\left(\frac{a_n}{b_n}\right)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` [converge][bookofproofs$141] to a _positive_ limit `$$\lim_{n\to\infty }\frac{a_n}{b_n}=c > 0.$$` Then the two series are either both [convergent][bookofproofs$175] or both [divergent][bookofproofs$217].
If the limit is zero ($c=0$), then the convergence of `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n$` implies the convergence of `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n.$`
