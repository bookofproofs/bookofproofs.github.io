Let `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k\)` be an [infinite complex series][bookofproofs$1724] with `\(a_k\neq 0\)` for all `\(k \ge K\)`, where `\(K\in\mathbb N\)` is some index (i.e. all but the first `\(K\)` sequence members `\(a_k\)` must be different from `\(0\)`). Furthermore, assume that there exists a [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `\(\theta\)` with `\(0 < \theta < 1\)` such that
`\[\left|\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}\right|\le \theta\text{ for all }k \ge K.\]`
 
Then it follows that `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k\)` is an [absolutely convergent complex series][bookofproofs$1725].
