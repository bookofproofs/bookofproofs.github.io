A generalization of a [polynomial of one variable][bookofproofs$199] is a **polynomial function**. 

`\[f\colon\cases{ \mathbb {R} ^{n}\longrightarrow \mathbb {R} ,\`\(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\longmapsto f(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}),}\]`

which can be written as a sum

`\[f(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})=\sum _{\nu \in \mathbb {N} ^{n}}a_{\nu }x^{\nu }=\sum _{\nu \in \mathbb {N} ^{n}}a_{\nu }x_{1}^{\nu _{1}}x_{2}^{\nu _{2}}\cdots x_{n}^{\nu _{n}}\,\]`

with `\(a_{\nu }\in \mathbb {R} \)` and `\(a_{\nu }\neq 0\)` for finitely many `\(a_{\nu }\)`.
