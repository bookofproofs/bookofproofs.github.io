Let `$D\subseteq\mathbb R$` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] and let `$f:D\to\mathbb R$` be a [function][bookofproofs$592] having the [limit][bookofproofs$6683] `$L$` at `$x=a\in D$`. Then this limit is unique. Formally `$$\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L\wedge \lim_{x\to a} f(x)=M\Longrightarrow L=M.$$`
