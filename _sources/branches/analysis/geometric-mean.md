Let any two [non-negative real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `$a,b$` we call the expression `$$\sqrt{a+b}$$` the **geometric mean** of these numbers.

More generally, for any `$n\ge 2$` non-negative real numbers `$a_1,\ldots,a_n$` the expression (using [n-th roots][bookofproofs$46]) `$$\sqrt[n] {a_1+\cdots+a_n}$$` is called the  *(generalized) geometric mean* of these numbers.
