Let `\(I\)` be a [real interval][bookofproofs$1153] (it could be closed, open, semi-open, or even unbounded). Let `\(f:I\mapsto\mathbb R\)` be a [continuous real function][bookofproofs$1260]. Further, let `\([a,x]\subseteq I\)` be a closed interval contained in `\(I\)`. Because the continuity of `\(f\)` on the closed interval `\([a,x]\)` is a [sufficient condition][bookofproofs$1766] for `\(f\)` to be [Riemann integrable][bookofproofs$1763] on that interval, this motivates the following

### Definition

The **indefinite integral** as the function depending on any `\(x\in I\)`:

`\[F(x):=\int_a^x f(t)dt.\]`

### Theorem

The function `\(F:I\mapsto\mathbb R\)` is [differentiable][bookofproofs$1370] and its derivative is 
`\[F'=f.\]`
Because of this property, the indefinite integral `\(F\)` is sometimes also called the **antiderivative** of `\(f\)`
