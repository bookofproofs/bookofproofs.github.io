The following proposition establishes a connection between the [gamma function][bookofproofs$457] the [factorial][bookofproofs$1005].
---

For all [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `$x > 0$`, the [gamma function][bookofproofs$457] fulfills the functional equation `$$\Gamma(x+1)=x\Gamma(x).$$` In particular, for all [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] it equals the [factorial][bookofproofs$1005] `$n,$` formally `$$\Gamma(n+1)=n!.$$`
