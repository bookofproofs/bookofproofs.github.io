Let `\((V,\| \|)\)` and `\((W,\| \|)\)` be [finitely dimensional][bookofproofs$1041] [normed vector spaces][bookofproofs$846], `\(G\subseteq V\)` an [open][bookofproofs$852] [subset][bookofproofs$552], and `\(f\colon G\rightarrow W\)` a [function][bookofproofs$592]. Furthermore, let `\(x\in G\)` be a point and `\(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{n}\)` be fixed [vectors][bookofproofs$560] in `\(V\)` in a fixed order `\(1,2,\ldots,n\)`. Then we call the **higher order directional derivative** of `\(f\)` along `\(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{n}\)`, if 

* the higher order directional derivative of `\(f\)` along `\(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{n-1}\)` exists and if
* its [directional derivative][bookofproofs$256] along `\(v_{n}\)` exists.

We also denote the higher order directional derivative as 

`\[D_{v_{n}}(...D_{v_{2}}(D_{v_{1}}f(x)))\]`

(read "`\(n\)`-order directional derivative of `\(f\)` along the vectors `\(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{n}\)` at the point `\(x\)`").

Please note that the order of vectors, along which we take the higher order directional derivative is fixed.
