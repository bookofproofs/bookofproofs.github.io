Let `$A$` be a non-empty [compact][bookofproofs$6575] [subset][bookofproofs$552] of a the [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$\mathbb R$`. Then `$$\max(A)\in A,~\min(A)\in A,$$` where `$\max(A)$` and `$\min(A)$` denote the [maximum][bookofproofs$6602] and [minimum][bookofproofs$6603] of `\(A\)`, respectively.
