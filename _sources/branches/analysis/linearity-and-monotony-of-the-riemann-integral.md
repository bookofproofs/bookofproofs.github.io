The following proposition shows that the [Riemann integrable][bookofproofs$1763] functions on an arbitrary [closed interval][bookofproofs$1153] `$[a,b]$` for a [vector space][bookofproofs$560] and that the integral is monotonic.

Let `\(f,g:[a,b]\mapsto\mathbb R\)` be [Riemann integrable functions on the closed interval][bookofproofs$1763] `\([a,b]\)` and let `$\lambda\in\mathbb R$`. Then the functions `$f+g$` and `$\lambda f$` are Riemann-integrable and their Riemann integral fulfills the following rules:


### Linearity Rules:

`\[\int_a^b(f+g)(x)dx=\int_a^bf(x)dx+\int_a^bg(x)dx\]`
`\[\int_a^b(\lambda\cdot f)(x)dx=\lambda\cdot\int_a^bf(x)dx\quad\quad(\text{for all }\lambda\in\mathbb R)\]`

### Monotony Rule:

`\[f\le g\Rightarrow \int_a^bf (x)dx\le \int_a^bg(x)dx\]`
