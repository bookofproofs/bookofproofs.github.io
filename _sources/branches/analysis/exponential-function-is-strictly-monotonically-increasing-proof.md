Following the [order relation for real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] let `\(x < y\)`. If we set `\(\xi=y-x\)` then `\(\xi > 0\)`. Therefore, it follows from the [definition of the exponential function][bookofproofs$281] that 

`\[\exp(\xi)=1+\xi+\frac {\xi^2}2+\ldots > 1.\]`

From the [functional equation of exponential function][bookofproofs$1415], it follows
`\[\exp(y)=\exp(x+y-x)=\exp(x+\xi)=\exp(x)\exp(\xi)>\exp(x),\]`

which proves that the exponential function is [strictly monotonically increasing][bookofproofs$282].
