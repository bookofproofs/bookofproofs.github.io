Let `$I$` be a [real interval][bookofproofs$1153] and let `$F:I\to\mathbb R$` be an [antiderivative][bookofproofs$1768] of a [continuous function][bookofproofs$1260] `$f:I\to\mathbb R$`. Then, for all `$a,b\in I$` the following holds for the [Riemann integrals][bookofproofs$1763] of `$f$` on the [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] `$[a,b]$`:

`$$\int_a^bf(x)dx=F(b)-F(a).$$`

### Different Notation

`$$\int_a^bf(x)dx=F(x)\;\Rule{1px}{4ex}{2ex}^{b}_{a}.$$`
