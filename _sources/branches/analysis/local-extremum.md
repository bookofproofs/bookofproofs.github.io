Let `$a < b$` and `$]a,b[$` be an [open real interval][bookofproofs$1153] and `$f:]a,b[\to\mathbb R$` a [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f$` is said to have a **local maximum** (respectively a **local minimum**) `$x$`, if there is a [positive number][bookofproofs$1107] `$\epsilon > 0$` such that 

> `$f(x)\ge f(\xi)$` (respectively `$f(x)\le f(\xi)$`) for all `$\xi$` with `$|x-\xi| < \epsilon.$`

If the equality `$f(x)=f(\xi)$` holds only for `$\xi=x$`, then the local maximum (respectively minimum) is said to be **isolated**. 

The general term for a local maximum (or a local minimum) is **local extremum** (plurals: **extrema**, **maxima**, **mimima**).
