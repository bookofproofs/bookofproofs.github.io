Let `\(A\subset\mathbb R^n\)` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(A\)` of the [$n$-dimensional metric space of real numbers][bookofproofs$1206] `$\mathbb R^n$`. `$A$` is [compact][bookofproofs$6575] if and only if `$A$` is [closed][bookofproofs$852] and [bounded][bookofproofs$6574].

This theorem was first proven by <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Heine/">Eduard Heine</a> (1821 - 1881) and <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Borel/">Ã‰mile Borel</a> (1871 - 1956)
