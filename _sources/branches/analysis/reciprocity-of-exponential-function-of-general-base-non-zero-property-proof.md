By [definition][bookofproofs$1603], we have `\[\exp_a(0)=\exp(0\cdot\ln(a))=\exp(0)=1\]` by the [corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$1423]. The [functional equation of the exponential function of general base][bookofproofs$1612] gives us
`\[\exp_a(x+y)=\exp_a(x)\cdot \exp_a(x)\]`
for all real numbers `\(x,y,a\)` with `\(a > 0\)`. If we set `\(y=-x\)`, we get 
`\[1=\exp_a(x-x)=\exp_a(x)\cdot \exp_a(-x)\]`
This implies with the [uniqueness of reciprocal numbers][bookofproofs$51] `\[\exp_a(-x)=\frac 1{\exp_a(x)}.\]`
In particular, we have `\[\exp_a(x)\neq 0\]` for all `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`.
