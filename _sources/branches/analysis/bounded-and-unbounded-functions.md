Let `\(X\)` be a "set":https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/set-set-element-empty-set-cantor/[^1]. A [function][bookofproofs$592]  `\(f:X\to \mathbb R\)`, i.e. a function mapping this set to the set of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105]  is called 

1. **bounded above**, if `\(f(X)\)` is [bounded above][bookofproofs$584].
1. **bounded below**, if `\(f(X)\)` is [bounded below][bookofproofs$584].
1. **bounded**, if `\(f(X)\)` is both, bounded below and bounded above.

If `\(f(X)\)` is not bounded, (i.e. not bounded above or it is not bounded below or neither bounded above nor bounded below), we call `\(f\)` **unbounded**.

[^1]: Please note that `$X$` does not necessarily have to be a subset of real numbers `$\mathbb R$`. The concept of bounded functions can be defined more generally for any kind sets. The only important detail is that the image set of the function is a subset of `$\mathbb R$`.
