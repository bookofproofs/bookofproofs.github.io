A [real infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\)` is a [convergent real series][bookofproofs$175], if and only if the sequence of its [partial sums][bookofproofs$1109] is a [Cauchy sequence][bookofproofs$1704], i.e. for every `\(\epsilon  > 0\)` there is an index `\(N(\epsilon)\in\mathbb N\)` such that

`\[\left|\sum_{k=m}^n x_k\right| < \epsilon\quad\quad \text{for all}\quad n\ge m\ge N(\epsilon).\]`
