Let `\(D\)` be a [non-empty subset][bookofproofs$552] of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105]. The real number `\(\inf(D)\)` is called the **infimum** (or the **greatest lower bound**) of `\(D\)`, if  


1. `\(\inf(D)\)` is a [lower bound][bookofproofs$584] of `\(D\)` and 
1. it is [greater than or equal to][bookofproofs$1107] every lower bound of `\(D\)`, i.e. if `$B$` is any lower bound of `$D$` then `\(\inf(D) \ge B\)`. 

Equivalently, for every `\(\epsilon > 0\)` there exists an `\(y\in D\)` with `\(\inf(D) + \epsilon > y\)`.

### Example

* The real number `$a$` in the semi-open interval `$(a,b]$` is the infimum of this interval because for every `$\epsilon > 0$` (no matter how small) there is an `$y\in(a,b]$` lying between the numbers `$a$` and `$a+\epsilon.$` 
* Please note that the `$\inf(D)$` does not have to be an element of `$D$`, like `$a\not\in(a,b].$`
