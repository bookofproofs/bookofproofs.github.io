Let `\(f:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R\)` be any [continuous real function][bookofproofs$219] that obeys the functional equation 

`\[f(x+y)=f(x)\cdot f(y)\]`

for all `\(x,y\in\mathbb R\)`. Then there are two possible cases:

* either `\(f\)` is [constant][bookofproofs$1371] and equals `\(0\)`, formally `\(f(x)=0\)` for all `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`, or
* `\(f\)` equals the [exponential function of general base][bookofproofs$1603] `\(f(x)=\exp_a(x)\)` for all `\(x\in\ \mathbb R\)` for the base `\(a:=f(1) > 0 \)`.
