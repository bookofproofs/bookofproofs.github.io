According to the definitions of the [unit circle in the complex plane][bookofproofs$1749] and the real functions [cosine][bookofproofs$1745] `\(\cos:\mathbb R\mapsto \mathbb R\)` and [sine][bookofproofs$1746] `\(\sin:\mathbb R\mapsto \mathbb R\)` we get the result

`\[\exp(ix)=\cos(x)+i\sin(x).\]`

This result is known as *Euler's formula*.
