This chapter introduces the important concept of **compact sets**. [Compact sets][bookofproofs$6575] defined in any [metric][bookofproofs$617] (or [topological][bookofproofs$6189]) spaces are a generalizations of [closed real intervals][bookofproofs$1153] known from the [real analysis of one variable][bookofproofs$28].
The study of compact sets allows a deeper understanding of theorems known from the analysis of continuous functions with one real variable on bounded and closed intervals. The following table compares the results about compact sets with some basic results known from the real analysis of one variable:
