Given two [real polynomials][bookofproofs$199] `$$\begin{array}{rcl}p(x)&=&a_nx^n + \ldots + a_1x + b_0,\\p(x)&=&b_mx^m + \ldots + b_1x + b_0,\end{array}$$`
with the degrees `$n$` an `$m$`, let `$D:=\{x\in\mathbb R:~q(x)\neq 0\}$`. A **rational function** is a [function][bookofproofs$592] defined by

`\[r:=\begin{cases}
\mathbb D&\to\mathbb R\\
x&\to r(x):=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}.
\end{cases}\]`
