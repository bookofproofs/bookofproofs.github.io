By [definition of the cosine function of a real variable][bookofproofs$1745], we have
`\[\cos(x)=\Re(\exp(ix)),\quad\quad x\in\mathbb R.\]`

From the [formula of extracting the real part from a complex number][bookofproofs$1248], we get the result

`\[\cos(x)=\Re(\exp(ix))=\frac 12(\exp(ix)+(\exp(ix))^*),\quad\quad x\in\mathbb R.\]`

By the [formula for calculating the complex conjugate of the complex exponential function][bookofproofs$1747], it follows

`\[\cos(x)=\frac 12(\exp(ix)+\exp((ix)^*),\quad\quad x\in\mathbb R.\]`

The [definition of the complex conjugate][bookofproofs$1245] leads to the desired result:

`\[\cos(x)=\frac 12(\exp(ix)+\exp(-ix),\quad\quad x\in\mathbb R.\]`
