Let `$(b_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}$` be a [convergent sequence][bookofproofs$141]. Then the telescoping series `$\sum_{k=0}^\infty (b_k-b_{k+1})$` is a [convergent series][bookofproofs$198]. In the case `$(b_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}$` is [monotonic][bookofproofs$1155], the series is [absolutely convergent][bookofproofs$198].
