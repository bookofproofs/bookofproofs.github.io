Let `\([a,b]\)` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] and let `\(f,\phi:[a,b]\mapsto\mathbb R\)` be [continuous functions][bookofproofs$1260] with `\(\phi(x)\ge 0\)` for all `\(x\in[a,b]\)`. Then there exists a value  **mean value**) `\(\xi\in[a,b]\)` such that

`\[\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\phi(x)dx=f(\xi)\cdot\int_{a}^{b}\phi(x)dx.\]`

For the special case `\(\phi(x)=1\)` for all `\(x\in[a,b]\)`, we have

`\[\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=f(\xi)\cdot\int_{a}^{b}1dx=f(\xi)(b-a).\]`
