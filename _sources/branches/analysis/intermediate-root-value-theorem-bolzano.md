Let `\([a,b]\)` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] and let `\(f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R\)` be a [continuous real function][bookofproofs$1260] with `$f(a) < 0$` and `$f(b) > 0$` (or `$f(a) > 0$` and `$f(b) < 0$`). Then there is a [root value][bookofproofs$6736] `$x\in[a,b]$` with `\(f(x)=0\)`.
