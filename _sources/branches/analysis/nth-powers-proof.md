By hypothesis, `\(n\in\mathbb Z\)` is an [integer][bookofproofs$844]. Note that, together the with the [multiplication operation of real numbers][bookofproofs$1532] "`\(\cdot\)`", the set `\((\mathbb R,\cdot )\)` is an [Abelian group][bookofproofs$553].
Therefore, the `\(n\)`-th power function `\(f:x\to x^n\)` is well-defined as an [exponentiation][bookofproofs$673] of `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`.
