The famous formula of [Euler][bookofproofs$Euler] follows immediately from the definitions of the [unit circle in the complex plane][bookofproofs$1749] and the real functions [cosine][bookofproofs$1745] `\(\cos:\mathbb R\mapsto \mathbb R\)` and [sine][bookofproofs$1746] `\(\sin:\mathbb R\mapsto \mathbb R\)`.
