Let `\(D\)` be a subset of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `\(\mathbb R\)`, `\(a\in D\)`, and let `\(f:D\to\mathbb R\)` be [continuous at `$a$`][bookofproofs$219] with `$f(a)\neq 0.$` Then `$f$` is non-zero in a whole neighborhood of `$a$`, i.e. there exists a real number `$\delta > 0$` such that `$f(x)\neq 0$` for all `$x\in D$` with `$|x-a| < \delta.$`
