For any two [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `\(x,y\in\mathbb R\)` the [maximum][bookofproofs$6602] and [minimum][bookofproofs$6603] can be calculated using the following formulae:

`$$\begin{array}{rcl}\max(x,y)&=&\frac 12(x+y+|x-y|),\\
\min(x,y)&=&\frac 12(x+y-|x-y|),\end{array}$$`

where `$|x-y|$` denotes the [distance][bookofproofs$583] between `$x$` and `$y$`.
