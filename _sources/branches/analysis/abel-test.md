If the [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] `$\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$` is [convergent][bookofproofs$175] and the sequence[^1] `$(b_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}$` is [bounded][bookofproofs$1136] and [monotonic][bookofproofs$1155], then the series `$\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_kb_k$` is also convergent.

[^1]: If you want to apply this convergence criterion to complexed-valued series `$\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_kb_k$`, you have to make sure that `$(b_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}$` remains a real-valued sequence. Otherwise, the monotonicity criterion will lose its sense.
