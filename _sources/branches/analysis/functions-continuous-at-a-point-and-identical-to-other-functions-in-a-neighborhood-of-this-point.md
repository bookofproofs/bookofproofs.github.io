Let `\(D\)` be a subset of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `\(\mathbb R\)`, `\(a\in D\)`, and let `\(f,g:D\to\mathbb R\)` be two [function][bookofproofs$592].
Let `$f$` be [continuous at `$a$`][bookofproofs$219] and let it be identical to `$g$` in a neighborhood of `$a$`, i.e. for an (arbitrarily small) positive real number `$\epsilon > 0$`, let `$f(x)=g(x)$` for all `$x$` with `$a a-\epsilon < x < a+\epsilon$`. Then `$g$` is continuous at `$g$`.
