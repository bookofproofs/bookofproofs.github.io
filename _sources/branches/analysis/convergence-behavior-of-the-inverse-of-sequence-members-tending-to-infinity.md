If `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is a [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] [tending to infinity][bookofproofs$1345] (i.e. either `$+\infty$` or `$-\infty$`), then there exists an index `$N\in\mathbb N$` such that `$a_n\neq 0$` for all `$n\ge N$` and the real sequence  `$(1/a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is a [convergent real sequence][bookofproofs$141] with `$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac 1{a_n}=0.$$`
