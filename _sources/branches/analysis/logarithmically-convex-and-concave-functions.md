Let `$I\in\mathbb R$` be a [real interval][bookofproofs$1153]. A  [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f:I\to\mathbb R^*_+$` with [positive][bookofproofs$1107] values is called **logarithmically convex** (or **concave**) if the [composition][bookofproofs$1314] of the `$f$` and the  [logarithm][bookofproofs$1421] `$(\ln\circ f):I\to\mathbb R$` is [convex][bookofproofs$6785] (or [concave][bookofproofs$6785]).

Using the inverse [exponential][bookofproofs$281] functions ([real case][bookofproofs$281] or [complex case][bookofproofs$312]), this is equivalent to the following:
 `$f$` is convex if for every `$x_1,x_2$` and `$0 < t < 1$` `$$|f(tx_1+(1-t)x_2|\le |f(x)^tf(x_2)^{1-t}|.$$`  `$f$` is concave if for every `$x_1,x_2$` and `$0 < t < 1$` `$$|f(tx_1+(1-t)x_2|\ge |f(x)^tf(x_2)^{1-t}|.$$`
