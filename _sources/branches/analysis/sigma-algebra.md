A [system of subsets][bookofproofs$552] `\({\mathcal {A}}\)` on a set `\(M\)` is called a *`\(\sigma \)`-algebra* (read "sigma-algebra") if the following conditions are fulfilled:

* `\(M\in {\mathcal {A}}\)`.
* With `\(T\in {\mathcal {A}}\)` also the [set complement][bookofproofs$552] `\(M\setminus T\)` is contained in `\({\mathcal {A}}\)`.
* For each [countable][bookofproofs$772] [family][bookofproofs$6198] `\(T_{i}\in {\mathcal {A}}\)`, `\(i\in I\)`, we have `\(\bigcup _{i\in I}T_{i}\in {\mathcal {A}}.\)`
