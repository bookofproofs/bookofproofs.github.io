If a [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is not a [Cauchy sequence][bookofproofs$1704], then it does not [converge][bookofproofs$141].
### Note

If `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is not Cauchy, there is some `$\epsilon > 0$` and a natural number `$N(\epsilon)$` such that `$|a_{m}-a_n|\ge \epsilon$` for all `$m,n > N(\epsilon).$` 

Thus, to prove that a sequence is not convergent, finding corresponding numbers `$\epsilon > 0$` and `$N(\epsilon)$` such that `$|a_{m}-a_n|\ge \epsilon$` for all `$m,n > N(\epsilon)$` will do.
