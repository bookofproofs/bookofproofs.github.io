The proposition follows immediately from the corresponding proposition for the [product of convergent real sequences][bookofproofs$1135].
`\[\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} (a_n \cdot b_n)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n \cdot \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} b_n.\]`

if we set `\(b_n\)` to a constant [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `\(b_n:=x\)` for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)`.
