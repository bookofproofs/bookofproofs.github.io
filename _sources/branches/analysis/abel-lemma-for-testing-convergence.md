The [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] `$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nb_n$` is [convergent][bookofproofs$175], if (by setting `$A_0:=0$`, `$A_k:=\sum_{i=1}^k a_i$`):

* the series `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty A_k(b_k-b_{k+1})$` is [a convergent series][bookofproofs$175] and
* the [sequence][bookofproofs$875] `$(A_n b_{n+1})_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is [convergent sequence][bookofproofs$141].
