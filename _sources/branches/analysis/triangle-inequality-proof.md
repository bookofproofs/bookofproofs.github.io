### Real case

* From the [definition of absolute value for real numbers][bookofproofs$583] it follows `\(x \le |x|\)` and `\(y\le|y|\)` for all `\(x,y\in\mathbb R\)`. 
* Together with the [rules of calculation with inequalities][bookofproofs$594] (in particular the rule 4), it follows that, if we add both inequalities, we get `$x+y\le |x|+|y|.$`
* Using the same argument, we get from the sum of the inequations  `$-x \le |x|$` and `$-y\le|y|$` that `$-(x+y)=-x-y\le |x|+|y|.$`
* Using the [definition of absolute value for real numbers][bookofproofs$583] once again, we get `$|x+y|\le |x|+|y|$` for all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$x,y\in\mathbb R.$`

### Complex case

* Since the [absolute value of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1247] defines a [distance of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1253], it fulfills the properties of a metric, in particular the triangle inequality.
