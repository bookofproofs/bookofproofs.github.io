Let `$(I_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` be a [sequence][bookofproofs$874] of [closed real intervals][bookofproofs$1153]. The sequence members `$I_n$` are called **nested**, if `$I_{n+1}$` is a [proper subset][bookofproofs$552] of `$I_n$` for all `$n\in\mathbb N$`, formally `$$I_{n+1}\subset I_n,\quad n\in\mathbb N.$$`
