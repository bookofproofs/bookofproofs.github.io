A [curve][bookofproofs$1208] `\(f:I\to\mathbb R^n.\)` is called **simple** or a **Jordan arc**, if it is [injective][bookofproofs$769], i.e. if for any two `\(x,y\in I\)` from `\(f(x)=f(y)\)` it follows that `\(x=y\)`.

### Example

Please note that the injectivity of `\(f\)` assures that there are no two points `\(x,y\)` with `\(x\neq y\)`, for which `\(f(x)=f(y)\)`. In other words, the curve has no "intersection points". For a curve in the plane `\(\mathbb R^2\)` this can be visualized as follows:
