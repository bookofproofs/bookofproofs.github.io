### Context

* Let `$p$`, `$q$` be any [polynomials][bookofproofs$199].
### Hypothesis

* Let `$a$` be a [real number][bookofproofs$1105] with `$q(a)\neq 0.$`

### Implications

* Since `$p$` and `$q$` are polynomials, it follows from the [limit of polynomials][bookofproofs$6897] that `$\lim_{x\to a}p(x)=p(a),$` and `$\lim_{x\to a}q(x)=q(a).$` 

### Conclusion

* From the [limit of a quotient][bookofproofs$6886] it follows for `$q(a)\neq 0$` and the 
 [rational function][bookofproofs$218] `$\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$` that `$$\lim_{x\to a}\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}=\frac{p(a)}{q(a)}.$$`
