Let `$D\subseteq\mathbb R$` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105], `$a\in\mathbb R$` be a [real number][bookofproofs$1105], and let `$f:D\to\mathbb R$` be a [function][bookofproofs$592] with the [limit][bookofproofs$6683] `$\lim_{x\to a}f=L.$` Then, 

* If `$f(x) > 0$`  for all `$x\in D,$` then `$L \ge 0.$`
* If `$f(x) < 0$`  for all `$x\in D,$` then `$L \le 0.$`
