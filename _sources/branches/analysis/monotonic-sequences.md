Based on the [order relation for real numbers][bookofproofs$1107], a [real sequences][bookofproofs$875]  `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` can be classified by the way the values `\(a_n\)` increase (decrease), depending on increasing index `\(n\)`. The sequence `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`  is called: 

* **monotonically increasing**, if for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` one has `\(a_n \le a_{n+1}\)`,
* **strictly monotonically increasing**, if for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` one has `\(a_n < a_{n+1}\)`,
* **monotonically decreasing**, if for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` one has `\(a_n \ge a_{n+1}\)`,
* **strictly monotonically decreasing**, if for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` one has `\(a_n > a_{n+1}\)`.

If `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is either (strictly) monotonically increasing or decreasing, it is called **monotonic**.
