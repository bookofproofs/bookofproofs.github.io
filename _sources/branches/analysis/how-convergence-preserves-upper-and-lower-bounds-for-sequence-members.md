Let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be a [convergent real sequences][bookofproofs$141] with the limit `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n=a\)` and let `\(L\in\mathbb R\)` and `\(U\in\mathbb R\)` be any given [lower and upper bounds][bookofproofs$1136] of its sequence members:

`\[L\le a_n\le U\quad\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N.\]`

Then `\(L\)` and `\(U\)` are also the bounds for the limit `\(a\)`:

`\[L\le a\le U.\]`
