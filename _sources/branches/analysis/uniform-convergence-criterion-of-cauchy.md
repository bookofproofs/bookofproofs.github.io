Let `$\mathbb F$` be a either the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$1640] or the [field of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690] and let `$D\subset \mathbb F.$` The [sequence of functions][bookofproofs$8382] `$f_n:D\to\mathbb F$` is [uniformly convergent][bookofproofs$8382] to a function `$f:D\to\mathbb F$` if and only for every `$\epsilon > 0$` there is an index `$N$` such that the [supremum norm][bookofproofs$8392] `$||f_n-f_m||_\infty < \epsilon$` for all `$n,m\ge N.$`
