1. Every [absolutely convergent series][bookofproofs$198] is also [convergent][bookofproofs$175] (in the usual sense).
1. The converse does not hold: there are some convergent series, which are not absolutely convergent.

In that sense, the absolute convergence is a stronger property than the convergence.
