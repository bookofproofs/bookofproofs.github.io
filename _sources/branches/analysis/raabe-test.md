This convergence test is due to [Joseph Raabe](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Raabe/) (1801 - 1859).

Let `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$` be an [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] with such that for a given [positive][bookofproofs$1107] number `$\beta > 1$` there exists an index `$N$` such that `$a_n\neq 0$` and `$$\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|\le 1-\frac{\beta}{n}$$` for all `$n\ge N,$` then the infinite series `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$` is [absolutely convergent][bookofproofs$198].
But if there is an index `$N\in\mathbb N$` such that `$$\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|\ge 1-\frac{1}{n}\quad\forall n\ge N,$$` then `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$` is [divergent][bookofproofs$217].
