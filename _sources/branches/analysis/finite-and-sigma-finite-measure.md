Let `\((M, {\mathcal {A}})\)` be a [measurable set][bookofproofs$6230] with the [`\(\sigma\)`-algebra][bookofproofs$6212] `\(\mathcal{A}\,\)`. A [measure][bookofproofs$6232] `\(\mu\)` defined on this `\(\sigma\)`-algebra is called **finite**, if for all subsets `\(T_i\in\mathcal{A}\)` there exists a [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `\(t_i\)` with 
`\[\mu(T_i) = t_i &lt; \infty.\]`

The measure is called *`\(\sigma\)`-finite*, if `\(M\)` can be written as a [union][bookofproofs$552] of a [countable][bookofproofs$772] [family][bookofproofs$6198] of [subsets][bookofproofs$552] `\(T_{i}\subseteq {\mathcal {A}}\)`, `\(i\in I\)` with a finite measure, formally: 
`\[M=\left(\bigcup _{i\in I}T_{i}\right)\quad\text{with}=\mu(T_i) = t_i &lt; \infty\quad\text{for all }i.\]`
