Let `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be a [complex sequence][bookofproofs$1249] `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is a [convergent complex sequence][bookofproofs$1700], if and only if the [real sequences][bookofproofs$875] of the real parts `\((\Re(c_n))_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and imaginary parts `\((\Im(c_n))_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` are [convergent real sequences][bookofproofs$141]. In case of convergence, the following equation is fulfilled:

`\[\lim_{n\to\infty}c_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}\Re(c_n) + i\cdot \lim_{n\to\infty}\Im(c_n).\]`
