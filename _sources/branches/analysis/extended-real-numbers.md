The set `$\mathbb R\cup \{-\infty,+\infty\},$` i.e  the [set of real numbers][bookofproofs$6194] extended by the improper real numbers `$-\infty$`  **minus infinity**) and `$+\infty$`  **plus infinity**), is called the **extended real numbers** and denoted by  `$\overline{\mathbb R}.$`

Extending the [order relation for real numbers][bookofproofs$1107], we define `$-\infty < x < +\infty$` for all `$x\in\mathbb R.$`
