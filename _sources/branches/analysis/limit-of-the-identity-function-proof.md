### Context

* Let `$a\in\mathbb R.$` 
* Let `$f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R,$` `$f(x)=x$` be the [identity function][bookofproofs$6680].
### Hypothesis

* Given `$\epsilon > 0$`.

### Implications

* Then for `$\delta:=\epsilon$` it holds that for all `$x$` with `$0 < |x-a| < \delta$` we have that `$|f(x)-a|=|x-a| < \epsilon.$`

### Conclusion

* By the [definition of limit][bookofproofs$6683], we have `$\lim_{x\to a }f(x)=a.$`
