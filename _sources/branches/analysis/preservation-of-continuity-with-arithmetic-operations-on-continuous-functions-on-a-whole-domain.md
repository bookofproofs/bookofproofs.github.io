Let `\(D\subseteq \mathbb R\)` and let `\(f,g:D\to\mathbb R\)` be two real functions, which are [continuous][bookofproofs$219] on their whole domain `\(D\)` and let `\(\lambda\in\mathbb R\)`. Then the functions

`\[\begin{array}{rcl}
f + g:D&\to&\mathbb R\\
\lambda f:D&\to&\mathbb R\\
f\cdot g:D&\to&\mathbb R\\
\end{array}\]`

are continuous on `\(D\)`. Moreover, if `\(g(a)\neq 0\)` for all `\(a\in D\)`, then the function 

`\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\frac fg:D&\to&\mathbb R
\end{array}\]`

is also continuous on `\(D\)`.
