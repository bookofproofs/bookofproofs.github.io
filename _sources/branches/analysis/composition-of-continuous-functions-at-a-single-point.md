Let `\(f:D\to\mathbb R\)` and `\(g:E\to\mathbb R\)` be real functions with `\(f(D)\subseteq E\)` such that `\(f\)` is [continuous at][bookofproofs$219] `\(a\in D\)` and `\(g\)` is continuous at `\(f(a)\in E\)`. Then their [composition][bookofproofs$1314].
`\[g\circ f:D\to\mathbb R\]`
is continuous at `\(a\)`.
