Let `$a < b,$` `$[a,b]$` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153], and `$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$` a [continuous function][bookofproofs$1260] with `$f(a)=f(b)$`. Further, let `$f$` be [differentiable][bookofproofs$1370] on the [open real interval][bookofproofs$1153] `$]a,b[.$` Then there is an `$\xi\in ]a,b[$` with `$f'(\xi)=0.$`

In particular, between any two [roots][bookofproofs$6736] of `$f$` there is a root of `$f'$`.

This theorem is named after "Michael Rolle":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/michel-rolle/.
