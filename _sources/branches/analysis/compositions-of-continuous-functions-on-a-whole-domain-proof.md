This is a simple corollary to the [composition of continuous functions at a single point][bookofproofs$1606] `\(a\)`, because `\(f:D\to\mathbb R\)` is a [real function continuous at][bookofproofs$1260] every point `\(a\in D\)` and the real function `\(g:f(D)\to\mathbb R\)` is continuous in every point `\(f(a)\in E\)`, by hypothesis. Thus, it is [continuous][bookofproofs$1260] on `$D$`.
