Two [real sequences][bookofproofs$875] `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` and `$(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N},$` `$a_n,b_n\neq 0,$` are called **asymptotically equivalent**, notated by `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\sim (b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N},$` if the following [limit][bookofproofs$141] equals `$1$`: `$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_n}{b_n}=1.$$`

### Notes

* In this definition, the sequences `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` and `$(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` do not have to be [convergent][bookofproofs$141] themselves.
* In general, the sequence of the differences `$(a_n-b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` does not have to converge, either.
* If `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\sim(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N},$` we say also that `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` can be **asymptotically approximated** by `$(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` and vice versa.
