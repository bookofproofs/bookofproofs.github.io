For the [cosine][bookofproofs$1745] and [sine][bookofproofs$1746] functions, the following additivity theorems hold for all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$x,y\in\mathbb R$`:

`$$\begin{array}{rcl}\cos(x+y)&=&\cos(x)\cos(y)-\sin(x)\sin(y),\\\sin(x+y)&=&\sin(x)\cos(y)+\cos(x)\sin(y).\end{array}$$`
