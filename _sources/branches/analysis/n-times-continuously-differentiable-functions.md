Let `\((V,\| \|)\)` and `\((W,\| \|)\)` be [finitely dimensional][bookofproofs$1041] [normed vector spaces][bookofproofs$846], `\(G\subseteq V\)` an [open][bookofproofs$852] [subset][bookofproofs$552], and `\(f\colon G\rightarrow W\)` a [function][bookofproofs$592]. Furthermore, let `\(x\in G\)` be a point and `\(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{n}\)` be fixed [vectors][bookofproofs$560] in `\(V\)`. Then we say the function `\(f\)` is *`\(n\)` times continuously differentiable*, if 

* for any [permutation][bookofproofs$188] `\(\pi(i)\)` of the vectors `\(v_i\)`, `\(i=1,2,\ldots,n\)`, the [higher order directional derivative][bookofproofs$6204] `\(D_{v_{\pi(n)}}(...D_{v_{\pi(2)}}(D_{v_{\pi(1)}}f(x)))\)` exists and 
* this higher order directional derivative is [continuous][bookofproofs$1254].
