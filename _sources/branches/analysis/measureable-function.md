Let `\((M,{\mathcal {A}})\)` und `\((N,{\mathcal {B}})\)` be two [measurable sets][bookofproofs$6230]. A [function][bookofproofs$592] `\(\varphi \colon M\longrightarrow N\,\)` is called **measureable** (or *`\({\mathcal {A}}-{\mathcal {B}}\)`-measureable*), if for all `\(T\in {\mathcal {B}}\)` the [inverse image][bookofproofs$592] `\(\varphi ^{-1}(T)\)` is in `\({\mathcal {A}}\)`.
