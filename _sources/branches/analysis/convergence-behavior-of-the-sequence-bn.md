The convergence behavior of the [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] `\((b^n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` depends on the value of the [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `\(b\)`. There are four possible cases:

> `\((1)\)` For `\(|b| < 1\)` we have that `\((b^n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is [convergent][bookofproofs$141] with `\(\lim_{n\to\infty} b^n=0\)`.

> `\((2)\)` For `\(b = 1\)` we have `\(\lim_{n\to\infty} b^n=1\)`.

> `\((3)\)` For `\(b = - 1\)`, the sequence `\((b^n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is [divergent][bookofproofs$1332].
> `\((4)\)` For `\(|b| > 1\)` we have that `\((b^n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` [tends to infinity][bookofproofs$1345].
