Let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be a [monotonically decreasing real sequence][bookofproofs$1155], which is convergent to `\(0\)`, i.e. with `\(\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n=0\)`. Then the **alternating** series `\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n a_n\]` is a [convergent series][bookofproofs$175]. This convergence criterion is also known as the Leibniz criterion and was first proven by the <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Leibniz/">Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz</a> (1646 - 1716).
