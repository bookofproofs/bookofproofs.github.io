Let `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` be a [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] and let `$D_n:=\{a_k:~k\ge n\}$` be consecutive subsets of its [carrier set][bookofproofs$6658]. Consider the [infimum of extended real numbers][bookofproofs$6669] `$\inf D_n$` for each `$D_n$`. Then `$\inf D_n\in \overline{\mathbb R}$` (are elements of the [extended real numbers][bookofproofs$6668]) for all `$n$`, and the sequence `$(\inf D_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is [monotonically increasing][bookofproofs$1155].
