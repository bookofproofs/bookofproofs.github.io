Let the points `\(x_n\)` of a [sequence][bookofproofs$874] `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be contained in the [metric space][bookofproofs$617] `\((X,d)\)`, i.e.   `\(x_n\in X\)`,  for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)`. Let this sequence be [convergent][bookofproofs$148] and let `\(X\)` also contain its limit 

`\[x=\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n,\]` 
i.e. `\(x\in X\)`. Then the [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$U\subset X$` defined by `\[U:=\{x_n:~n\in\mathbb N\},\]` i.e. the subset consisting of all sequence members `\(x_n\)`, but which does not contain the limit `$x$`, is not [compact][bookofproofs$6575].
