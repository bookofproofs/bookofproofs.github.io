We observe that every [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] `$(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` can be interpreted as a [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f:\mathbb N\to\mathbb R.$` With this observation in mind, all theorems we can prove about the limits of functions will also apply to the limits of sequences.  In this section, we present some of these theorems.
