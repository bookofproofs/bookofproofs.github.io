Let `$a < b,$` `$[a,b]$` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153], and `$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$` a [continuous function][bookofproofs$1260], which is [differentiable][bookofproofs$1370] on the [open real interval][bookofproofs$1153] `$]a,b[.$` Furthermore, let `$f'$` be [bounded from below and from above][bookofproofs$302] by some constants `$m,M\in\mathbb R$` with 

> `$m\le f'(\xi)\le M$` for all `$\xi\in]a,b[.$`

Then for all `$x,y$` with `$a\le x\le y\le b$`, the difference `$f(y)-f(x)$` can be estimated by 

> `$m(y-x)\le f(y)-f(x)\le M(y-x).$`
