Let `\(V\)` be a [finitely dimensional][bookofproofs$1041] [vectorspace][bookofproofs$560] over the field of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1153] and let `\(I\subseteq \mathbb {R}\)` be a  [real interval][bookofproofs$6194] and `\(U\subseteq V\)` an [open set][bookofproofs$852]. Then the [function][bookofproofs$592] `\[f\colon \cases{I\times U\longrightarrow V,\cr(t,v)\longmapsto f(t,v)}\]` is called a *vector field (on `\(U\)`)*.
