If a series `\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\)` [converges absolutely][bookofproofs$198] to the limit `\(L\)`, then every [rearrangement][bookofproofs$1363] of this series [converges][bookofproofs$175] to this limit, formally

`\[\begin{array}{l}\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k=L\text{ absolutely convergent }\Longrightarrow \\\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_{\sigma(k)}=L\text{ convergent  for every permutation }\sigma:\mathbb N\to \mathbb N.\end{array}\]`
