Let `\(X\)` be a [complete][bookofproofs$377] [metric space][bookofproofs$617], and let `$$A_0\supset A_1\supset A_2\supset A_3\supset \ldots$$` be a [sequence][bookofproofs$874] of non-empty [subsets][bookofproofs$552] of `\(X\)` with [diameters][bookofproofs$6581] [converging][bookofproofs$141] against `\(0\)`, formally
`$$\lim_{k\to\infty}\operatorname{diam}(A_k)=0.$$`
Then the [intersection][bookofproofs$552] of all of these subsets a single point.
