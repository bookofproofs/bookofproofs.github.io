Unlike the real numbers, the set of [complex numbers][bookofproofs$6788] `$\mathbb C$` cannot be ordered. Therefore, only some concepts applicable to real numbers `$\mathbb R$` can be applied to [complex numbers as an extension of real numbers][bookofproofs$1243]. One of these concepts are bounded and unbounded sets.

---

A [region][bookofproofs$8552] `$U\subseteq\mathbb C$` of [complex plane][bookofproofs$216] is called:

* **bounded**, if there exists a [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `$C > 0$` such that the [absolute value][bookofproofs$1247] of all points in `$U$` does not exceed `$C$`, formally `$$|z|\le C\quad\forall z\in U.$$`
* Otherwise, `$U$` is called **unbounded**. 

### Notes

* This is an example of how [bounded subsets can be defined for an unordered set][bookofproofs$6667].
### Examples:

* The second quadrant of the complex plane, i.e. the set `$U=\{z=a+bi\in\mathbb C\mid a\ge 0, b\le 0\}$` is unbounded.
* The following region is bounded:
