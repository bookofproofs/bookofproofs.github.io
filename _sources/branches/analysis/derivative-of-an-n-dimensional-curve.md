Let `\(I\)` be a [real interval][bookofproofs$1153] and `\(V\subseteq\mathbb R^n\)` be an [`\(n\)`-dimenstional euclidean vector space][bookofproofs$1206]. An [`\(n\)`-dimensional curve][bookofproofs$1208] `\(f\colon I\longrightarrow V\,\)` is called *differentiable at `\(t\in I\)`*, if the [limit][bookofproofs$6203].
`\[\operatorname {lim} _{h\rightarrow 0}\,{\frac {f(t+h)-f(t)}{h}}\]`

exists. If `\(f\)` is differentiable at every `\(t\in I\)`, then we call the limit the **derivative** of `\(f\)` and is denote it by `\(f'(t)\)`.
