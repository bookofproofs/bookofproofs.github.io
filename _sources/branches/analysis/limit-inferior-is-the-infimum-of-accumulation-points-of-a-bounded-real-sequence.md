Let `$H$` be the non-empty[^1] [set][bookofproofs$550] of all [accumulation points][bookofproofs$174] of a [bounded real sequence][bookofproofs$1136] `$(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}.$` The [limit inferior][bookofproofs$6674] of `$a_n$` equals the [infimum][bookofproofs$1755] of `$H$`, formally
`$$\underline{\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n}=\inf H.$$`

[^1]: Please note that `$H$` is not empty due to the [theorem of Bolzano-Weierstrass][bookofproofs$1152], since the sequence is bounded by hypothesis.
