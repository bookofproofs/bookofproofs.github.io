For `\(x \ge 0\)` it follows from the [definition of the exponential function][bookofproofs$281] that 

`\[\exp(x)=1+x+\frac {x^2}2+\ldots\ge 1 > 0.\]`
If `\(x < 0\)`, then `\(-x > 0\)`, and thus `\(\exp(-x) > 0\)`, by the same argument. From the [reciprocity of exponential function][bookofproofs$1417] it follows in this case that
`\[\exp(x)=\frac 1{\exp(-x)} > 0.\]`

Therefore, the exponential function produces only [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107], for all `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`.
