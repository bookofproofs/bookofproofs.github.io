Let `\(X,Y\)` be [metric spaces][bookofproofs$617] and let `$f:X\mapsto Y$` a [continuous function][bookofproofs$1205]. If `\(C\subset X\)` is [compact][bookofproofs$6575], then the [image][bookofproofs$592] of `$C$` under `$f$`, i.e. the [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(f( C)\subset Y\)`, is also compact.
