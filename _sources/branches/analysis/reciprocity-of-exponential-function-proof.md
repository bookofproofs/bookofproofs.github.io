By virtue of the [functional equation of the exponential function][bookofproofs$1415] we have
`\[\exp(x)\cdot \exp(-x)=\exp(x-x)=\exp(0).\quad\quad( * )\]`
From the [result][bookofproofs$1423] that `\[\exp(0)=1\]` it follows from the [uniqueness of reciprocal numbers][bookofproofs$51] that 
`\[\exp(-x)=\exp(x)^{-1}.\]`
In particular, `\(\exp(x)\neq 0\)` for all `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`.[^1]

[^1]: `\(\exp(x)=0\)` for some `\(x\)` would imply `\(0\cdot\exp(-x)=1\)`, which cannot be fulfilled for any real number `\(\exp(-x)\)`.
