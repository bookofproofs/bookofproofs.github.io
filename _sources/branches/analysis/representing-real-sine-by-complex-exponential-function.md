The [sine of a real variable][bookofproofs$1746] `\(\sin:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R\)` can be represented by the [exponential function of a complex variable][bookofproofs$312] by the following formula:

`\[\sin(x)=\frac 1{2i}(\exp(ix)-\exp(-ix)).\]`

An alternative notation for this formula is

`\[\sin(x)=\frac 1{2i}(e^{ix}-e^{-ix}).\]`
