Let `$a < b,$` `$[a,b]$` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153], and `$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$` a [continuous function][bookofproofs$1260], which is [differentiable][bookofproofs$1370] on the [open real interval][bookofproofs$1153] `$]a,b[$` with `$f'(x)=0$` for all `$x\in]a,b[.$` Then `$f$` is a [constant function][bookofproofs$1371].
