* Let `$\phi\in T[a,b]$` be a [step function][bookofproofs$6796].
* By [definition of Riemann upper and Riemann lower integrals][bookofproofs$1761], we have `$$\int_{a~*}^{b} \phi(x)dx = \int_a^b \phi(x)dx=\int_a^{b~*} \phi(x)dx.$$`
* Thus, by definition, `$\phi$` is [Riemann integrable][bookofproofs$1763].
