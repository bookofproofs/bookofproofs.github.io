Many properties of real-valued functions are reflected by their [derivatives][bookofproofs$1370]. Thus, the study of [differentiation][bookofproofs$1370] of real-valued functions helps to better understand the following:
* The occurrence of their local minima or maxima (see [example][bookofproofs$6776]),
* Their [monotonic behavior][bookofproofs$282] (see [example][bookofproofs$6783]),
* Their [convexity][bookofproofs$6785] (see [example][bookofproofs$6786]).

Moreover, the growth and fluctuations of the functions can be estimated by boundaries of their derivatives (see [example][bookofproofs$6780]).
