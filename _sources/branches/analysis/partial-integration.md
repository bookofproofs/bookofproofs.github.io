Let `$[a,]$` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153], let `$f,g:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$` be [continouosly differentiable functions][bookofproofs$6812]. Then 

`$$\int_a^bf(x)g'(x)dx=f(x)g(x)\;\Rule{1px}{4ex}{2ex}^b_a  -\int_{a}^{b}g(x)f'(x)dx.$$`

### Mnemonic Notation

`$$\int fdg=fg-\int gdf.$$`
