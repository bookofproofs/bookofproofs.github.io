Let `\(x,y\)` be elements of the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$1638] `\((\mathbb R, + ,\cdot)\)`. The [absolute value][bookofproofs$583] of the [difference][bookofproofs$1588] `\(|x-y|\)` of two real numbers `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` is called their **distance**.  This distance defines a [metric][bookofproofs$614]  on `\(\mathbb R\)`. 

In other words, `\((\mathbb R,|~|)\)` is a [metric space][bookofproofs$617] and the distance `\(|~|\)` fulfills the following properties:

1. `\(|x|=0\)` if and only if `\(x=0\)` for all `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`.
1. `\(|x-y|=|y-x|\)` for all `\(x,y\in\mathbb R\)` (symmetry)
1. `\(|x+y|\le |x| + |y|\)`  for all `\(x,y\in\mathbb R\)` (triangle inequality)

### Notes

* A generalization of this proposition can be [formulated also for the complex numbers][bookofproofs$1253].
* Because `\((\mathbb R,|~|)\)` is a metric space and `\((\mathbb R, + ,\cdot)\)` is a field, we also say, that the field of real numbers is a **valuated field**.
