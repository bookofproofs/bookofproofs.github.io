Many functions, for example, the [exponential function][bookofproofs$281], [sine and cosine][bookofproofs$6731] can be expressed as [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109]. This chapter explores the expressibility of functions as infinite series in a systematic way, which was first discovered by "Brook Taylor":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/brook-taylor (1685 - 1731).
