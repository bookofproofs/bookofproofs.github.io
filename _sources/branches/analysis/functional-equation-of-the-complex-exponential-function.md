For all [complex numbers][bookofproofs$1698] `\(x,y\in\mathbb C\)`, the [complex exponential function][bookofproofs$312] fulfills the following [functional equation][bookofproofs$6726]:

`\[\exp(x+y)=\exp(x)\cdot \exp(y).\]`

In particular, for any complex number `\(z=a+ib\)` with the real part `\(\Re (z)=a\)` and the imaginary part `\(\Im (z)=b\)`, we have

`\[\exp(z)=\exp(a+ib)=\exp(a)\cdot \exp(ib).\]`
