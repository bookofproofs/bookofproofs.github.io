* Let `\(X\)` be a [metric space][bookofproofs$617].
* Let `$(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` be any [convergent sequence][bookofproofs$148] in `\(X\)`.
* It is to be shown that  `$(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is a [bounded sequence][bookofproofs$6591].
   * From the [proposition about convergent sequences together with limits in `\(X\)` ][bookofproofs$6577], it follows that the subset `$\{x_n:~n\in\mathbb N\}\subset X$` is [compact][bookofproofs$6575].
   * Because [compact subsets in metric spaces are bounded and closed][bookofproofs$6589], it follows that the subset `$\{x_n:~n\in\mathbb N\}\subset X$`  is [bounded][bookofproofs$6574].
   * By [definition of bounded sequences][bookofproofs$6591], `$(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is a bounded sequence.
