It has been shown already, that for [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(a > 0\)` and an [integer][bookofproofs$844] `\(n\ge 0\)`, the [n-th-power function][bookofproofs$1618] equals the [exponential function of general base with natural exponents][bookofproofs$1616]:
`\[a^n=\exp_a(n).\quad\quad( * )\]`
Let `\(n < 0\)`. From the [reciprocity law][bookofproofs$1614], it follows
`\[a^{-n}=\frac{1}{a^n}=\frac{1}{\exp_a(n)}=\exp_a(-n).\]`
Thus, `\( ( * )\)` is valid for all integers `\(n\in\mathbb Z\)`.
