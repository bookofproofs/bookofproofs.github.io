Let `\(D\)` be a [non-empty subset][bookofproofs$552] of the [extended real numbers][bookofproofs$6668] `$\overline{\mathbb R}.$` The **supremum** `$\sup(D)$` is the element of `$\overline{\mathbb R},$` which 

* Case 1: is equal to the [supremum][bookofproofs$1754] of `$D$` defined for the [set of real numbers][bookofproofs$6194] `$\mathbb R$`, if `$D$` is [bounded above][bookofproofs$584],
* Case 2: equals `$+\infty$`, if  `$D$` is [not bounded above][bookofproofs$584].
