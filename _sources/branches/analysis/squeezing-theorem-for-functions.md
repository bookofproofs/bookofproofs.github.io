Let `$D\subseteq\mathbb R$` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] and let `$f,g,h:D\to\mathbb R$` be  [functions][bookofproofs$592] with `$g(x)\le f(x)\le h(x)$` for all `$x\in D$`. Let `$g,h$` have a [limit][bookofproofs$6683] `$L$` at `$x=a\in D.$` Then `$f$` has also the limit `$L$` at `$x=a\in D.$` Formally, `$$\left\lbrace\begin{array}{l}\lim_{x\to a}g(x)=L\\\lim_{x\to a} h(x)=L\\g(x)\le f(x)\le h(x)\;\forall x\in D\end{array}
\right\rbrace\Longrightarrow \lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L.$$`
This is what is known as the **Squeezing Theorem** of the **Sandwich Theorem** or the **Scrunch Theorem**.
