* Let `$\epsilon > 0$` be an (arbitrarily small) [real number][bookofproofs$1105].
* It follows from the [existence of natural numbers exceeding any positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1340] that there is a natural number `$N(\epsilon)$` such that `$N > \frac 1\epsilon.$`
* It follows that `$\frac 1n=|\frac 1n-0| < \epsilon$` for all `$n\ge N(\epsilon).$`
* By [definition of convergence][bookofproofs$141], it means that the [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] with `$x_n:=\frac 1n$`, `$n\in\mathbb N,$` `$n > 0$` is convergent with `$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac 1n=0.$`
