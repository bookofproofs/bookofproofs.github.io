Let `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$` be an [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] such that for a given [positive][bookofproofs$1107] number `$0 < q < 1$` there exists an index `$N$` such that for all `$n\ge N$` the [n-th root][bookofproofs$46] of [absolute values][bookofproofs$583] is smaller than or equal `$q$`, i.e. 
`$$\sqrt[n]{|a_n|}\le q\quad\forall n\ge N,$$` then the infinite series `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$` is [absolutely convergent][bookofproofs$198].
But if there is an index `$N\in\mathbb N$` such that `$$\sqrt[n]{|a_n|}\ge 1\quad\forall n\ge N,$$` or at least `$\sqrt[n]{|a_n|}\ge 1$` for infinitely many `$n\in\mathbb N,$` then `$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$` is [divergent][bookofproofs$217].
