From the [Euler's formula][bookofproofs$1783] and the [definition of the unit circle][bookofproofs$1749], it follows

`\[|\cos(x)+i\sin(x)|^2=|\exp(ix)|^2=1\quad\quad x\in\mathbb R.\]`

From the [definition of the absolute value for complex numbers][bookofproofs$1247], it follows

`\[\left(\sqrt{\cos^2(x)+\sin^2(x)}\right)^2=1\quad\quad x\in\mathbb R.\]`

From the [properties of `\(n\)`-th roots][bookofproofs$46], it follows

`\[\cos^2(x)+\sin^2(x)=1\quad\quad x\in\mathbb R.\]`
