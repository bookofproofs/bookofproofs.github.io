Let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and `\((b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be [convergent real sequences][bookofproofs$141] with the limits `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n=a\)` and `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} b_n=b\)` with `\(b\neq 0\)`.  Then there is a some index `\(N\in\mathbb N\)` such that `\(b_n\neq 0\)` for all `\(n \ge N\)` and the real sequence `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N,~n\ge N}\)` with `\(c_n:=a_n/b_n\)` is convergent to the number `\(a/b\)`.

### Notes

* This proposition can be expressed in the short form: `\[\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty,~n\ge N} \frac{a_n}{b_n}=\frac{\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty,~n\ge N} a_n}{\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty,~n\ge N} b_n}.\]`
* The proposition's proof can be transferred also to sequences of other kinds than real numbers, for example, the complex numbers.
