Let `$a < b,$` `$[a,b]$` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153], and `$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$` a [continuous function][bookofproofs$1260]. Further, let `$f$` be [differentiable][bookofproofs$1370] on the [open real interval][bookofproofs$1153] `$]a,b[.$`

The function `$f$` is:

* [strictly monotonically increasing][bookofproofs$282] if `$f'(x) > 0,$` 
* [monotonically increasing][bookofproofs$282] if `$f'(x) \ge 0,$` 
* [monotonically decreasing][bookofproofs$282] if `$f'(x) \le 0,$` 
* [strictily monotonically decreasing][bookofproofs$282] if `$f'(x) < 0,$` 

for all `$x\in]a,b[.$`
