Let `$I\subset\mathbb R$` be an [interval][bookofproofs$1153] and `$f:I\to\mathbb R$` be a [$n$ times continuously differentiable function][bookofproofs$6205]. For a given `$a\in I$` and all `$x\in I$` the value `$f(x)$` can be written as

`$$f(x)=f(a)+\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{f^{\{k\}}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k+r(x)(x-a)^n$$`
where `$r(x)$` is a [function converging][bookofproofs$6683] to `$0$` at the point `$a$`, i.e. with `$\lim_{x\to a}r(x)=0.$`
