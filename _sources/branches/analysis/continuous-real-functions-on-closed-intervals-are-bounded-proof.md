* By hypothesis, `$[a,b]$` is a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] and `$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$` is a [continuous real function][bookofproofs$1260].
* Since [on closed intervals continuous functions take a maximum and a minimum][bookofproofs$6696], so does `$f$`. 
* Let `$m:=\min\{f(x)\mid x\in[a,b]\}$` and `$M:=\max\{f(x)\mid x\in[a,b]\}.$`
* Let `$K\in\mathbb R$` be a [real number][bookofproofs$1105] such that `$K > |M|\ge |m|.$`
* By the choice of `$K,$` we have `$|f(x)|\le K$` for all `$x\in[a,b].$`
* This means that `$f$` is [bounded][bookofproofs$302] on `$[a,b].$`
