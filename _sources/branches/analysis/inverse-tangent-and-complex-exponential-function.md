Let `$x\in\mathbb R$` be [real number][bookofproofs$1105] and let `$\phi=\arctan(x)$` (where `$\arctan$` denotes the [inverse tangent][bookofproofs$6749] of `$x$`). Then the [complex exponential function][bookofproofs$312] of `$2 i\phi$` can be calculated by 

`$$\exp(2 i \phi)=\frac{1-ix}{1+ix}.$$`
