* By hypothesis, the two [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$x,y$` are [ordered][bookofproofs$1107] as follows `$x < y.$` 
* Because `$2x=x+ x$` and because of [3rd rule of calculations with inequalities][bookofproofs$594] we have `$2x < x + y.$`
* For the same argument `$x + y < 2y.$`
* Multiplying both inequations by `$\frac 12$` ([6-th rule of calculations with inequalities][bookofproofs$594]) give us `$x < \frac{x+y}2 < y$` for the [arithmetic mean][bookofproofs$8369].
