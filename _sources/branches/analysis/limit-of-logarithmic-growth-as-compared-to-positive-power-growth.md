For all (fixed) [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `$\alpha > 0$`, we have that `$$\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac {\ln(x)}{x^\alpha}=0,$$`
`$$\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac {x^\alpha}{\ln (x)}=\infty,$$`
`$$\lim_{x\searrow 0}{x^\alpha}{\ln (x)}=0.$$`

These [limits][bookofproofs$6683] show that if `$x$` is growing, the growth of the [logarithmic function][bookofproofs$1421] of `$x$` is slower than the growth of [$x$ to the power of `$\alpha$`][bookofproofs$1618], no matter small `$\alpha$` is.
