* Let `$D\subset\mathbb R$` be a [subset][bookofproofs$552].
* By hypothesis, `$f:D\to\mathbb R$` is a [continuous function][bookofproofs$219] at an `$a\in D.$`
* By definition, this means that for every [convergent real sequence][bookofproofs$141] `$(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` with `$x_n\in D$`, `$a\in D$` and  `$\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=a$` we have that `$\lim_{n\to\infty}f(x_n)=f(a).$`
* On the other hand, we have that `$f(\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n)=f(a),$` following the hypothesis, that we have a concrete real sequence `$(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` given with `$\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n=a.$`
* Thus, we have that `$\lim_{n\to\infty}f(x_n)=f(\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n).$`
