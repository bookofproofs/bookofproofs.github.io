Let `$[a,b]$` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153], `$p\ge 1$` be a [real number][bookofproofs$1105] and let `$f,g:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$` be two [Riemann-integrable functions][bookofproofs$1763]. The for the [integral p-norms][bookofproofs$6804] the *Minkowski's inequality* holds:

`$$||f+g||_p\le ||f||_p+||g||_p,\quad\forall p\ge 1.$$`
