Let `\(D\subseteq\mathbb R\)` (`\(D\)` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105]) and let `\(f:D\to\mathbb R\)` be a [function][bookofproofs$592]. Let `\(b,a\in D\)`, `\(b\neq a\)`. The **difference quotient** of `\(f\)` is the function `\(\Delta f(b,a):D\times D\to \mathbb R\)`, defined by 

`\[\Delta f(b,a):=\frac {f(b)-f(a)}{b-a},\quad b\neq a.\]`
