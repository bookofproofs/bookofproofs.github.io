Let `$(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` be a [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] (or a [complex sequence][bookofproofs$1249]). The sequence `$(s_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` of **partial sums** `$$s_n:=\sum_{k=0}^n x_k,\quad\quad n\in\mathbb N$$` is called the *(infinite) series* `$$\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k\quad\quad( * ).$$`

Note: If the sequence of partial sums is convergent, the expression `$(*)$`  also denotes the limit (i.e. the real or complex number) to which the sequence converges.
