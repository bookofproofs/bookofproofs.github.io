Let `$p,q\in(1,\infty)$` with `$\frac 1p+\frac 1q=1$`. Let `$x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots x_n)$` and `$y=(y_1,y_2,\ldots y_n)$` be two [vectors][bookofproofs$560] of a vector space `\(V\)` over the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$1638] `\(\mathbb R\)` or the [field of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690] `\(\mathbb C\)`. Then the product of the [p-norms][bookofproofs$6789] `$||x||_p||y||_q$` can be used as an upper bound of the sum `$\sum_{\nu=1}^n|x_\nu y_\nu|$`, formally:

`$$\sum_{\nu=1}^n|x_\nu y_\nu|\le ||x||_p||x||_q.$$`
