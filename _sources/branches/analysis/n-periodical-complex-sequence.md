A [complex sequence][bookofproofs$1249] `$(a_k)_{k\in\mathbb Z}$` is called *$n$-periodical*, if there is a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] `$n\in\mathbb Z$` such that `$a_k=a_l$` for all `$k(n)\equiv l(n)$`, i.e. for all [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$k,l\in\mathbb Z$` being [congruent modulo][bookofproofs$8153] `$n.$`
