Let `$a < b,$` and let `$f:(a,b)\to\mathbb R$` be a [twice differentiable function][bookofproofs$1370] on the [open real interval][bookofproofs$1153] `$(a,b).$` Then `$f$` is [convex][bookofproofs$6785] if and only if `$f^{\prime\prime}(x)\ge 0$` for all `$x\in]a,b[.$` Analogously, `$f$` is concave, if and only if `$f^{\prime\prime}(x)\le 0$` for all `$x\in(a,b).$`
