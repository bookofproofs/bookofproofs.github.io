Let `\([a,b]\)` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153] and let `\(f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R\)` be a [continuous][bookofproofs$1260], [strictly monotonically increasing][bookofproofs$282]  (respectively decreasing) real function. Then `\(f\)` is [invertible][bookofproofs$407] with the strictly monotonically increasing (respectively decreasing) inverse function `\(f^{-1}:[A,B]\to[a,b]\)`. Therein, `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` are real numbers with `\(A:=f(a)\)` and `\(B:=f(b)\)`.
