Let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be a [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] and let `$(n_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}$` be a [strictly monotonically increasing][bookofproofs$1155] sequence of [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `\(n_k\in\mathbb N\)`, i.e. 
`$$n_0 < n_1 < n_2 < \ldots$$`
Then the sequence 
`\[(a_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb N}\]`
is called the **real subsequence** (or just **subsequence**) of `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`.
