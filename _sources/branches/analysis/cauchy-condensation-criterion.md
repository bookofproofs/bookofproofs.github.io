An [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] `$\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k$` with a [monotonically decreasing][bookofproofs$1155] [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] `$(x_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}$` of [non-negative][bookofproofs$1107] members `$x_k\ge 0$` for all `$k\in\mathbb N$` is [convergent][bookofproofs$175] if and only if the "condensed series" `$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty 2^n x_{2^n}$$` is convergent.
