Let  `\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\)` and `\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n\)` be two [absolutely convergent complex series][bookofproofs$1725] with `\(A:=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\)` and `\(B:=\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n\)`. We define a  [complex sequence][bookofproofs$1249] `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` with
`\[c_n:=\sum_{k=0}^n a_{n-k}b_k.\]`
Then the series `\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n\)` is also an absolutely convergent complex series with `\(C:=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n\)`. It is called the **Cauchy product** of the series `\(A\)` and `\(B\)`:
`\[C=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n=\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\right)\cdot\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n\right)=A\cdot B.\]`
