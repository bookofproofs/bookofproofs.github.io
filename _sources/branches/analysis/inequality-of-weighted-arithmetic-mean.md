Let `$p_1,\ldots,p_n$` be [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] ("weights") and `$a_1,\ldots,a_n$` be given [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105]. Then the [weighted arithmetic mean][bookofproofs$8369] can be approximated using the following inequality:

`$$\min(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\le \frac {p_1a_1+\cdots+p_na_n}{p_1+\cdots+p_n} \le\max(a_1,\ldots,a_n),$$` where `$\min$` and `$\max$` denote the [minimum][bookofproofs$6603] and the [maximum][bookofproofs$6602] of the numbers `$a_1,\ldots,a_n.$`
