Let `\(D\subseteq\mathbb R\)` (`\(D\)` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105]). Let `\(x\in D,\lambda\in\mathbb R\)`, and let `\(f,g:D\to\mathbb R\)` be [differentiable functions][bookofproofs$1370] at `\(x\)`. Then 

`\[f+g,\quad f-g,\quad \lambda f,\quad fg:D\to\mathbb R\]`
are also differentiable at `\(x\)` and the following calculation rules apply:

1. `\((f+g)'(x)=f'(x)+g'(x)\)`,
1. `\((f-g)'(x)=f'(x)-g'(x)\)`,
1. `\((\lambda f)'(x)=\lambda f'(x)\)`,
1. `\((fg)'(x)=f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)\)` (also known as the **product rule**).
1. If `\(g(\xi)\neq 0\)` for all `\(\xi\in D\)`, then also the function 
`\[\frac fg:D\to\mathbb R\]`
is differentiable at `\(x\)` and the following formula (also known as the **quotient rule**) holds:

`\[\left(\frac fg\right)'(x)=\frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}.\]`
