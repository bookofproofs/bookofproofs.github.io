* Let `$[a,b]$` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153], `$\mathbb R$` be the [set of real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] and `\(f:[a,b]\mapsto \mathbb R\)` a [continuous function][bookofproofs$219].
* We have to show that `\(f\)` is [uniformly continuous][bookofproofs$6611].
   * The [absolute value][bookofproofs$583] of a [difference][bookofproofs$1588] [is a distance function which makes the the real numbers a metric space][bookofproofs$618].
   * All [closed real intervals are compact][bookofproofs$6583], so is  `$[a,b]$`.
   * Thus, `$f$` is a [continuous function][bookofproofs$1205] mapping a [compact][bookofproofs$6575] domain `$[a,b]$` to a [metric space][bookofproofs$617]   `$\mathbb R$`.
   * Since all [continuous functions on compact domains are uniformly continuous][bookofproofs$6614] , so is `$f$`.
