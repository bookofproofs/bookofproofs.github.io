The  [theorem of Bolzano-Weierstrass][bookofproofs$1152] motivates the following definition:

---

A [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `\(a\)` is called an **accumulation point** of a [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`, if it contains a [subsequence][bookofproofs$6610] `\((a_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb N}\)` that is [convergent][bookofproofs$141] to `\(a\)`.

### Notes

* Informally, `$a$` is an accumulation point `$B,$` if there are points of `$B$` which are arbitrarily close to `$a.$`
* This is a special case of a general topological definition of [accumulation points][bookofproofs$8573].
