When we introduced the number system of [real numbers][bookofproofs$167] `\(\mathbb R\)`, we saw that this field as an [ordered field][bookofproofs$7834]. This means that any given two real numbers `\(a,b\in \mathbb R\)` can be compared with each other. This comparison always has exactly one of the following results:

1. either `\(a\)` is "equal" `\(b\)`, or
1. `\(a\)` is "smaller" than `\(b\)`, or
1. `\(a\)` is "greater" than `\(b\)`.

Moreover, it is [Archimedean][bookofproofs$1340], meaning that the ordering is "regular" in the sense that for any two [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `$x,y > 0$`, there exist a natural number `$n$` such that `$nx > y.$`
