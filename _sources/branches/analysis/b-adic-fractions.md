Let `\(b \ge 2, k\ge 0\)` be [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718]. A *`\(b\)`-adic fraction* is a [real infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] of the form

`\[\pm \sum_{k=-n}^\infty a_kb^{-k},\]`

where for all `\(0\le a_k < b \)` for all `\(k\)`. The number `\(b\)` is called the **basis** or the **radix** of the `\(b\)`-adic fraction.

If the basis is known, we can write the b-adic fraction also explicitly in the form

`\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\pm a_{-k}a_{-k+1}\cdots a_{-1}a_{0} & . & a_{1}a_{2}a_{3}\cdots \\
&\uparrow&\\
\end{array}\]`

The dot in the middle denotes the position of the `\(0\)`-th element of the sequence.
