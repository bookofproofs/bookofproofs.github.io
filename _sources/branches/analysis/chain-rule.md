Let `$D$` and `$E$` be [subsets][bookofproofs$552] of the [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$\mathbb R$` and let `$f:D\to\mathbb R,$` `$g:E\to\mathbb R,$` be [functions][bookofproofs$592] such that `$f(D)\subset E.$` Furthermore, let the function `$f$` be [differentiable][bookofproofs$1370] at a point `$x\in D$` and let `$g$` be differentiable at the point `$y:=f(x)\in E.$` 
Then the [composition of functions][bookofproofs$1314] `$$g\circ f:D\to\mathbb R$$` is differentiable at `$x$` and its derivative is given by `$$(g\circ f)'(x)=g'(f(x))f'(x).$$`
This rule also known as the **chain rule**.
