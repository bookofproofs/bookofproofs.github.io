Let `\(a > 0\)` be a fixed [positive real number][bookofproofs$1107]. Note that the function `\(x\mapsto x\cdot \ln (a)\)` is continuous, since it is the [product of continuous functions ][bookofproofs$1604]: the identity `\(x\mapsto x\)` and the constant function `\(x\mapsto \ln (a)\)`. 

[By definition][bookofproofs$1603], the exponential function of general base `\(\exp_a:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R\)` is a [composition][bookofproofs$1314] of the continuous function `\(x\mapsto x\cdot \ln (a)\)` and the [continuous exponential function][bookofproofs$1422] `\(y \mapsto \exp(y)\)`:

`\[\exp_a(x)=\exp(x\cdot \ln(a)).\]`

It follows from the [compositions of continuous functions on a whole domain][bookofproofs$1608] that the exponential function of general base `\(a\)` is also continuous on its domain, i.e. it is continuous on whole `\(\mathbb R\)` for every fixed real number `\(a > 0\)`.
