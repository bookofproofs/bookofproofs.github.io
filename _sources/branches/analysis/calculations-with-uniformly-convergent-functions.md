Let `$\mathbb F$` be a either the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$1640] or the [field of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690] and let `$D\subset \mathbb F.$` Let  `$f_n,g_n,f,g:D\to\mathbb F$` be [functions][bookofproofs$592], let `$\alpha_n,\alpha\in\mathbb F,$` and let `$f_n\to f,$` `$g_n\to g$` be [uniformly convergent][bookofproofs$8382], and `$(\alpha_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` be a sequence with the limit `$\alpha_n\to \alpha.$`

Then the following functions are also uniformly convergent:

* `$f_n+g_n\to f+g,$`
* `$\alpha f_n\to \alpha f.$`

If, in addition to the uniform convergence, all `$f_n,g_n$` are [bounded][bookofproofs$302], then

* `$f_ng_n\to fg$` and
* `$\alpha_n f_n\to\alpha f.$`
