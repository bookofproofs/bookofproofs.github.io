Let `\((\xi_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`, `\(\xi\in D\)` be a [convergent real sequence][bookofproofs$141] with  `\(\lim \xi_n=a\)` . By hypothesis, `\(f:D\to\mathbb R\)` is [continuous at][bookofproofs$219] `\(a\in D\)`. Therefore, we have `\(\lim f(\xi_n)=f(a)\)`. 

Also by hypothesis, `\(g:E\to\mathbb R\)` is continuous at `\(f(a)\in E\)`. Therefore, we have `\(\lim g(f(\xi_n))=g(f(a))\)`. It follows that the [composition][bookofproofs$1314].
`\[g\circ f:D\to\mathbb R\]`
is continuous at `\(a\)`.
