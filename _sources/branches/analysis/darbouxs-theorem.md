Let `$a < b,$` `$[a,b]$` be a [closed real interval][bookofproofs$1153], and `$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$` a [continuous function][bookofproofs$1260]. Further, let `$f$` be [differentiable][bookofproofs$1370] on the [open real interval][bookofproofs$1153] `$]a,b[.$` Then there is an intermediate value `$\xi\in ]a,b[$` with `$$f'(\xi)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.$$`

From the geometrical point of view, this intermediate value theorem states that the gradient of the secant through the points `$(a,f(a))$` and `$(b,f(b))$` equals the gradient of the tangent of the graph of `$f$` on some intermediate point `$(\xi,f(\xi))$`.

This theorem is named after [Gaston Darboux](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Darboux/) (1842 - 1917).
