* By the definition of [absolute value][bookofproofs$583], the terms `$|x_k|\ge 0$` are all [non-negative][bookofproofs$1107].
* Therefore, by the [monotony criterion][bookofproofs$1158], the [series][bookofproofs$1109] `$\sum_{k=0}^\infty |x_k|$` is [convergent][bookofproofs$175] if and only if the sequence `$(s_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` of its partial sums `$s_n:=\sum_{k=0}^n |x_k|$` is [bounded][bookofproofs$1136].
* By definition of [absolutely convergent series][bookofproofs$198], the series `$\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k$`, is absolutely convergent if and only if the sequence `$(s_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$` is bounded.
