The [Riemann integral][bookofproofs$1763] allows only the integration of functions over [bounded][bookofproofs$584] [real intervals][bookofproofs$1153], i.e for closed real intervals of the type `$[a,b]$`, `$a\le b$` and for [unbounded functions][bookofproofs$302] on semi-open or open intervals `$[a,b)$`, `$(a,b]$`,  and `$(a,b).$` The concept of the Riemann integral fails to work so far for the following cases:

* bounded functions on unbounded intervals, i.e. `$[a,\infty)$`, `$(a,\infty)$`, `$(-\infty,b)$`, and `$(-\infty,b]$`,
* unbounded functions on any (even closed) intervals.

The following definition clarifies, under which certain circumstances the concept of Riemann integral can be extended to even these special cases. This extended concept of the Riemann integral is known as _improper intergral_.
