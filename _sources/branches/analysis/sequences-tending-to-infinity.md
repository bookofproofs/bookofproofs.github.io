A [divergent real series][bookofproofs$1332] `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is said to **tend to infinity** (respectively to **tend to minus infinity**) if for every real constant `\(C\in\mathbb R\)` there exists an index `\(N( C)\in\mathbb N\)` with

`\[x_n > C\quad\text{(respectively }x_n < C\text{)}\quad\text{for all }n\ge N( C).\]`

If any of the above conditions is fulfilled, we  write

`\[\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n =\infty\quad\text{(respectively }\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n =-\infty\text{)}.\]`

### Notes


* Since this definition is a negation of the definition of [bounded sequences][bookofproofs$1136], the sequence members `\(x_n\)` and the sequence `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` itself are said to be **unbounded**.
* All sequences tending to infinity are divergent, but not all divergent series are tending to infinity.
