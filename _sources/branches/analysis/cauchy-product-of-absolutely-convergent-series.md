Let  `\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\)` and `\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n\)` be two [absolutely convergent series][bookofproofs$198] with `\(A:=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\)` and `\(B:=\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n\)`. We define a  [real sequence][bookofproofs$875] `\((c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` with
`\[c_n:=\sum_{k=0}^n a_{n-k}b_k.\]`
Then the series `\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n\)` is also absolutely convergent with `\(C:=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n\)`, and it is called the **Cauchy product** of the series `\(A\)` and `\(B\)`:
`\[C=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n=\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\right)\cdot\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n\right)=A\cdot B.\]`
