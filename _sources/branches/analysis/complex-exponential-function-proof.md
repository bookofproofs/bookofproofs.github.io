From the [ratio test for absolutely convergent complex series][bookofproofs$1729]  it follows that

`\[\left|\frac{\frac{z^{n+1}}{(n+1) ! }}{\frac{z^n}{n ! }}\right|=\frac{|z|}{n+1}\le\frac 12.\]`

Therefore, the complex exponential series

`\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{z^n}{n!}\]`

is an [absolutely convergent complex series][bookofproofs$1725] for every [complex  number][bookofproofs$1698] `\(z\in\mathbb C\)`, where `\(n!\)` denotes the [factorial][bookofproofs$1005] of the index `\(n\)`.
