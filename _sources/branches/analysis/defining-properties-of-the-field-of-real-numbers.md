The following theorem shows that the study of __any__ [complete ordered field][bookofproofs$6193] fulfilling the [Archimedean axiom][bookofproofs$1339], is in fact the study of real numbers.

Every [complete ordered field][bookofproofs$6193], which fulfills the [Archimedean property][bookofproofs$1339], is isomorphic to the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$1638]. More formally, given the field of real numbers `\((\mathbb R,+,\cdot)\)` and any other [field][bookofproofs$557] `\((F,\oplus,\odot),\)` fulfilling these two properties, there is a [bijective][bookofproofs$771] [field homomorphism][bookofproofs$559] `\(f:F\mapsto \mathbb R\)`.
