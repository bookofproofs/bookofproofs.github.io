We have seen in [previous examples][bookofproofs$7899] that propositions and the corresponding Boolean functions, in general, do not establish a one-to-one relationship. We want to find a syntactic form which establishes a one-to-one relationship with the corresponding Boolean function.

Let a `$\phi$` be a [proposition with a given syntactic form][bookofproofs$1307] and let `$f_\phi$` be corresponding [Boolean function][bookofproofs$1316]. We call a syntax `$\operatorname{cnf}(\phi)$` which establishes a one-to-one relationship with `$f_\phi$` a **canonical normal form** of `$\phi$`.
