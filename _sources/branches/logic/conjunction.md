Let `\(L\)` be a [set of propositions][bookofproofs$1307] with the [interpretation][bookofproofs$710] `$I$` and the corresponding [valuation function][bookofproofs$710] `$[[]]_I$`. 
A **conjunction** "`\(\wedge \)`"  is a [Boolean function][bookofproofs$1316].
`\[\wedge :=\begin{cases}L \times L & \mapsto  L \\
(x,y) &\mapsto x \wedge y.
\end{cases}\]`

defined by the following [truth table][bookofproofs$7868]:


Truth Table of the Conjunction
:-------------
 `$[[x]]_I$`| `$[[y]]_I$`| `$[[x \wedge y]]_I$`
 `\(1\)`| `\(1\)`| `\(1\)`
 `\(0\)`| `\(1\)`| `\(0\)`
 `\(1\)`| `\(0\)`| `\(0\)`
 `\(0\)`| `\(0\)`| `\(0\)`

We read the conjunction `$x\wedge y$`  

“$x$ __and__ `$y$`”. 


### Notes

* The conjunction of two propositions is only true if they are both true, otherwise it is false. 
* The standard English conjunction is __and__. But there are some others, which are the same logically: __but__, __however__, __although__, __though__, __even though__, __moreover__, __furthermore__, and __whereas__, e.g.
   * "I passed logic, __and__ I did not pass calculus."
   * "I passed logic, __but__ I did not pass calculus."
   * "I passed logic, __however__ I did not pass calculus."
   * "I passed logic, __although__ I did not pass calculus."
   * "I passed logic, __though__ I did not pass calculus."
   * etc.
