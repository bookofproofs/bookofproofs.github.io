The **hypothetical syllogism** is a [valid logical argument][bookofproofs$7913] consisting of two premises and a conclusion, which altogether are constructed from three [propositions][bookofproofs$1307] `$p,q$` and `$r$` as follows:

* The first premise (called the **major premise**) is the [implication][bookofproofs$1304] `$p\vee q$`.
* The second premise (called the **minor premise**) is the implication `$q\Rightarrow r$`.
* The implication `$p\Rightarrow r$` is the conclusion of the hypothecal syllogism.

Formally, the hypothecal syllogism is the following logical argument:
 `$$\begin{array}{rll}
p\Rightarrow q&\text{major premise}&\text{e.g. If it is raining then the roads are wet.}\\
q\Rightarrow r&\text{minor premise}&\text{e.g. If the roads are wet then they are slippery.}\\
\hline 
p\Rightarrow r&\text{conclusion}&\text{e.g. If it is raining, then the roads are slippery.}\\ 
\end{array} $$`
