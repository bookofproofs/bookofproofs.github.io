We want to show that for every [proposition][bookofproofs$710] `\(x\)` the implication `\(x\Rightarrow x\)` is a [tautology][bookofproofs$7880]. This can be easily verified: By [definition of implication][bookofproofs$1304], any possible [semantics][bookofproofs$7871] of `\(A\)` makes the [compound proposition][bookofproofs$7867] `\(x \Rightarrow x\)` a [tautology][bookofproofs$7880]:


`\([[x]]_I\)` | `\([[x]]_I\)` | `\([[x \Rightarrow x]]_I\)`
:------------- |:------------- |:-------------
 `\(1\)`| `\(1\)`| `\(1\)`
 `\(0\)`| `\(0\)`| `\(1\)`
