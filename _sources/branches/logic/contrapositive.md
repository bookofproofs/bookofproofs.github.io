A **contrapositive** of a [conclusion][bookofproofs$1304] `\(x \Rightarrow y\)` is a [proposition][bookofproofs$710], in which the antecedent `\(x\)`, and the  consequent `\(y\)` are inverted and [negated][bookofproofs$714], formally

`\[\neg y\Rightarrow\neg x\]`
is the contrapositive of 
`\[x\Rightarrow y.\]`

We read the contrapositive `\(\neg y\Rightarrow\neg x\)` `\["\text{if not }y,\text{ then not }x".\]`
