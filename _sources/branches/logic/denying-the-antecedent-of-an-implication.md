Another example of a [fallacy][bookofproofs$7913] is **denying the antecedent** of an [implication][bookofproofs$1304]. For two [propositions][bookofproofs$1307] `$p$` and `$q$`, this fallacy takes the following form:

`$$\begin{array}{rll}
p\Rightarrow q&\text{major premise}&\text{e.g. If you learn maths, then you'll get a good job.}\\
\neg p&\text{minor premise}&\text{e.g. You don't learn maths.}\\
\hline 
\neg q&\text{conclusion}&\text{e.g. Therefore, you won't get a good job.}\\ 
\end{array} $$`

Here comes another example:

`$$\begin{array}{rll}
p\Rightarrow q&\text{major premise}&\text{e.g. If two lines are parallel, then they are in the same plane.}\\
\neg p&\text{minor premise}&\text{e.g. The lines are not parallel.}\\
\hline 
\neg q&\text{conclusion}&\text{e.g. Therefore, they are not in the same plane.}\\ 
\end{array} $$`
