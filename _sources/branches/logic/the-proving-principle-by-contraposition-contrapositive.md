The proving principle **by contraposition** is a [valid logical argument][bookofproofs$7915]. For two [propositions][bookofproofs$1307] `$p$` and `$q$`, it consists of 
 `$$\begin{array}{rll}
\neg q\Rightarrow \neg p&\text{premise}&\text{e.g. If the roads are not wet, then it is not raining.}\\
\hline 
p\Rightarrow q&\text{conclusion}&\text{e.g. If it is raining, then the roads are wet.}\\ 
\end{array} $$`
