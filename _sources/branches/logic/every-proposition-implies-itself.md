If `\(x\)` is a [proposition][bookofproofs$710], then the [implication][bookofproofs$1304] `\(x\Rightarrow x\)` is a [tautology][bookofproofs$7880] (i.e. always valid). 

### Examples:

> `\(\text{"Socrates is a philosopher"}\Rightarrow \text{"Socrates is a philosopher"}\)` is valid.

> `\(\text{"Socrates is not a philosopher"}\Rightarrow \text{"Socrates is not a philosopher"}\)` is valid.

> `\(a=2\Rightarrow a=2\)` is valid.

> `\(a\neq 2\Rightarrow a\neq 2\)` is valid.
