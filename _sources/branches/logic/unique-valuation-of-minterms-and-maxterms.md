Let `$x_1,\ldots,x_n$` be [Boolean variables][bookofproofs$1307].
* If `$m=(\neg)x_1\wedge\ldots\wedge(\neg)x_n$` is a [minterm][bookofproofs$7901], then there is exactly one `$n$`-tuple of [truth values][bookofproofs$707] assigned to `$x_1,\ldots,x_n$`, for which `$m$` is true.
* If `$M=(\neg)x_1\vee\ldots\vee(\neg)x_n$` is a [maxterm][bookofproofs$7901], then there is exactly one `$n$`-tuple of truth values assigned to  `$x_1,\ldots,x_n$`, for which `$M$` Ã­s false.
