When we defined [the interpretation of propositions][bookofproofs$710], we insisted that a proposition has a truth value that is either __true__ or __false__. We also noted that propositions build only a part of all the strings which are [syntactically correct][bookofproofs$709] among other strings which can be formulated in a given [formal language][bookofproofs$94] `$L$`. But how about all the other strings, for which we cannot assign a truth value? Important types of such statements are __paradoxes__.

Let a [formal language][bookofproofs$94] `$L$` be given, in which the [valuation function `$[[]]_I$` of `$PL0$` (law of excluded middle) ][bookofproofs$710] holds. A **paradox** is a string `$s\in L$`, for which the interpretation `$[[s]]_I=undefined,$` i.e. for which it is not possible to assign a truth value, and which apparently contradicts itself.
