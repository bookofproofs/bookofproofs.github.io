Following the notation of [rules of inference][bookofproofs$7877], [logical arguments][bookofproofs$7913] can be written using a schema, in which all propositions are listed above a line, below which the conclusion is formulated.

### Example 1

`$$\begin{array}{rl}
\text{All humans are mortal.}&p_1\\
\text{Socrates is human.}&p_2\\
\hline
\text{Socrates is mortal.}&q\\
\end{array}$$`

This is a [valid argument][bookofproofs$7913] since the conclusion `$q$` is true whenever the premises `$p_1$` and `$p_2$` are both true.

### Example 2

`$$\begin{array}{rl}
n+m+k=4&p_1\\
n=1&p_2\\
m=-1&p_3\\
\hline
k=4&q\\
\end{array}$$`

This is a [valid argument][bookofproofs$7913] since the conclusion `$q$` is true whenever the premises `$p_1,p_2,$` and `$p_3$` are all true.

### Example 3

`$$\begin{array}{rl}
\text{It is raining.}&p\\
\hline
\text{It is raining.}&q\\
\end{array}$$`

This is a [valid argument][bookofproofs$7913] since the conclusion `$q$` is true whenever the premise `$p$` is true.

### Example 4

`$$\begin{array}{rl}
\text{If Bob asks the question, then he will receive the answer.}&p_1\\
\text{Bob receives the answer.}&p_2\\
\hline
\text{Therefore, Bob have asked the question.}&q\\
\end{array}$$`

This is a [fallacy][bookofproofs$7913] since the conclusion `$q$` is can be false, even though the premises `$p_1$` `$p_2$` are true (Bob could have received the answer, even though he has never asked the question). 

### Example 5

`$$\begin{array}{rl}
\text{Adam always thinks what he says.}&p_1\\
\text{Adam does not say anything.}&p_2\\
\hline
\text{Therefore, Adam does not think it.}&q\\
\end{array}$$`

This is a [fallacy][bookofproofs$7913] since the conclusion `$q$` can be false, even though the premises `$p_1$` `$p_2$` are true (Adam could think it, even though he does not say anything).
