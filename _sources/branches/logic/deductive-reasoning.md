If a conclusion is made that a "specific case must be true" since the general principle is known to be true, then we call that conclusion **deductive reasoning**. Deductive reasoning has the following logical form:

> "$p$ is true, therefore, a special case of `$p$` is true."

Deductive reasoning is [valid][bookofproofs$7913], since the special case (conclusion) must be true, because it is an instance of a true general case (premise). Deductive reasoning is a fundamental way of showing the truth of a special case referring to known mathematical result. Examples of such reasoning are:

> "All [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704] are only divisible by `$1$` and by themselves. `$25$` is divisible by `$1$`, by `$25$`, and also by `$5$`. Therefore, `$25$` is not a prime number."

> "The [sum of the angles in any triangle in a plane is 180 degrees][bookofproofs$924], therefore the sum of the angles of a right-angled triangle in a plane is also 180 degrees."

> "Any [differentiable function is continuous][bookofproofs$1374] `$f(x)=3x$` is differentiable with the derivative `$f'(x)=3.$` Therefore, `$f$` is continuous."
