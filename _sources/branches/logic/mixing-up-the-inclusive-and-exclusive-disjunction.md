A common [fallacy][bookofproofs$7913] is mixing up the [inclusive disjunction][bookofproofs$713] "`$\vee$`" and the [exclusive disjunction][bookofproofs$7869] 
"`$\oplus$`". For two [propositions][bookofproofs$1307] `$p$` and `$q$`, this fallacy takes the following form:

`$$\begin{array}{rll}
p\vee q&\text{major premise}&\text{e.g. I'll listen to music or I'll learn maths.}\\
p&\text{minor premise}&\text{e.g. I will listen to music.}\\
\hline 
\neg q&\text{conclusion}&\text{e.g. Therefore, I won't learn maths.}\\ 
\end{array} $$`

Note: This fallacy is quite common since the conjunction "or" in natural language is often used as a "logical exclusive or" rather than "logical inclusive or", which allows for both possibilities to be true ("I'll listen to music and learn maths at the same time").
