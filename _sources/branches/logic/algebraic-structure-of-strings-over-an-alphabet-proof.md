* Let `$\Sigma^*$` be a non-empty set of all strings under the [alphabet][bookofproofs$708] `$\Sigma$`.
* Let a [concatenation][bookofproofs$708] be defined as its binary operation `$\cdot: \Sigma^* \times \Sigma^* \mapsto \Sigma^*$`.
* The concatenation is [associative][bookofproofs$668], i.e. for any letters `$x,y,z\in \Sigma^*$` we have that `$x(yz)=(xy)z$`.
* Moreover, the [empty string][bookofproofs$708] `$\epsilon\in \Sigma^* $` is neutral with respect to concatenation.
* Therefore, `\((\Sigma^*,\cdot)\)` fulfills all axioms of a [monoid][bookofproofs$659].
