_Logic_ is a discipline of mathematics which formalizes the language and methods of mathematical reasoning and examining the correctness of arguments. In this sense, logic is the metalanguage of mathematics and we start <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong> with this branch. Usually, in logic arguments can be either _true_ or _false_. But there are also other types of logic, in which more than these two values are allowed.

### Theoretical minimum (in a nutshell)

In order to start the mathematical foundations of logic, the following prerequisites are required:

* You should be acquainted with [set theory][bookofproofs$27], especially with their [basic properties][bookofproofs$65].
### Concepts you will learn in this part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>

* Basic notions to build __formal systems__, including __alphabet__, __propositions__, __syntax__ and __semantics__.
* Different types of __formal systems__, 
   * starting with some __propositional logic__, which follows the rules of __Boolean algebra__,
   * continuing with __first order predicate logic__, involving __free and bound variables__, __functions__ and __quantifiers__
   * and  giving an outlook to __higher order predicate logics__.
* Methods and strategies of __mathematical proving__.
