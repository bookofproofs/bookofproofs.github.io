Similar to [mixing-up the necessary and sufficient condition of an implication][bookofproofs$7928] is a [fallacy][bookofproofs$7913] known as the **affirming the consequent**. It is often used to manipulate the opinion of the audience about a proposed action. Given two [propositions][bookofproofs$1307] `$p$` and `$q$`, it takes the following form:

`$$\begin{array}{rll}
p\Rightarrow q&\text{major premise}&\text{e.g. If we want to succeed, then we have to take the risk.}\\
q&\text{minor premise}&\text{e.g. I tell you, we have to take the risk.}\\
\hline 
p&\text{conclusion}&\text{e.g. Therefore, we will succeed.}\\ 
\end{array} $$`

Another, more mathematical example of this fallacy is

`$$\begin{array}{rll}
p\Rightarrow q&\text{major premise}&\text{e.g. If a number `$n\neq 2$` is a prime number, then it is odd.}\\
q&\text{minor premise}&\text{e.g. The number `$n$` is odd.}\\
\hline 
p&\text{conclusion}&\text{e.g. Therefore, `$n\neq 2$` and `$n$` is a prime number.}\\ 
\end{array} $$`
