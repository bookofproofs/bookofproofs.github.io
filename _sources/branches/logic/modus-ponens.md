*Modus ponens* (lat. [the way that affirms by affirming") is a "valid logical argument][bookofproofs$7913] consisting of two premises and a conclusion, which altogether are constructed from two [propositions][bookofproofs$1307] `$p$` and `$q$` as follows:

* The first premise (called the **major premise**) is the [implication][bookofproofs$1304] `$p\Rightarrow q$`.
* The second premise (called the **minor premise**) is the proposition `$p$`.
* The proposition `$q$` is the conclusion of modus ponens.

Formally, modus ponens is the following logical argument:
 `$$\begin{array}{rll}
p\Rightarrow q&\text{major premise}&\text{e.g. If it is raining, then the roads are wet.}
\\p&\text{minor premise}&\text{e.g. It is raining.}\\
\hline 
q&\text{conclusion}&\text{e.g. The roads are wet.}\\ 
\end{array} $$`
