If `\(x\)` is a [proposition][bookofproofs$710], then the [equivalence][bookofproofs$1305] `\(x\Leftrightarrow \neg x\)` is a [contradiction][bookofproofs$7880]  (i.e. always invalid). 

### Examples:

> `\(\text{"Socrates is a philosopher if and only if Socrates is not a philosopher"}\)` is invalid.

> `\(a= 2\Leftrightarrow   a\neq 2\)` is invalid.
