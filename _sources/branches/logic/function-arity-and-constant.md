let `$L$` be a [logical calculus][bookofproofs$7882], `$U$` the [domain of discourse][bookofproofs$6219], and `$I(U,L)$` the corresponding [interpretation][bookofproofs$7874]  with the [valuation][bookofproofs$7874] function `$[[]]_I$`.

A **function** is a [non-empty string over an alphabet][bookofproofs$708] `$s\in L$` interpreted as a [function][bookofproofs$592] `\(U^n\to U\)`, taking `\(n\)` input arguments from the domain of discourse and mapping them to a new value from the domain of discourse.

The [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `\(n\ge 0\)` of arguments of the function is called its **arity**. Special cases of arities are:

* `\(n=0\)`: **Nullary** functions (or operations) are usually called **constants**
* `\(n=1\)`: **Unary** functions (or operations)
* `\(n=2\)`: **Binary** functions (or operations)
* `\(n=3\)`: **Ternary** functions (or operations)
* generally *`\(n\)`-nary* functions (or operations)
