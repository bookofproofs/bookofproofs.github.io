For two [propositions][bookofproofs$710]  `\(x,y\)`, the [implication][bookofproofs$1304] `\(x\Rightarrow y\)` is [logically equivalent][bookofproofs$1305] to its [contrapositive][bookofproofs$1306] `\(\neg y\Rightarrow \neg x\)`, formally, the [compound proposition][bookofproofs$7867].
`\[(x\Rightarrow y)\Leftrightarrow(\neg y\Rightarrow \neg x)\]`

is a [tautology][bookofproofs$7880] (always valid). 

### Examples:

> `\(\text{"if Socrates is a philosopher, then Socrates is a person"}\)` is logically equivalent to `\(\text{"if Socrates is not a person, then Socrates is not a philosopher"}\)`.

> `\((a > 2)\Rightarrow (2 < a)\)` is logically equivalent to `\((2 \ge a) \Rightarrow (a \le 2)\)`.
