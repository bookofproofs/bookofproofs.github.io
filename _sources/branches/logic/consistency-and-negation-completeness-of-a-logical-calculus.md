With the concept of [negation of strings][bookofproofs$7886], we are able to introduce two more desirable properties of a logical calculus:

---

A [logical calculus][bookofproofs$7882] `$L$` is called

* **consistent**, if for every derivable statement its [negation][bookofproofs$7886] is not derivable, formally `$\vdash \phi$` implies `$\not\vdash\neg\phi,$`
* *negation-complete*, if the negation of a statement is not derivable, then the statetment is derivable, formally `$\not\vdash\neg\phi,$` implies `$\vdash \phi.$`

### Notes:

* **Consistency** and *negation-completeness* are syntactical properties of a logical calculus. 
* A logical calculus is consistent if it is not possible in it to derive both - a theorem and its negation. 
* The negation-completeness of logical calculus is the converse - if the drivability of a theorem is necessary for the non-derivability of the negation. 
* Consistency and negation-completeness are desirable properties of logical calculi since such systems avoid contradictions.
