Another important lemma is the way how to negate an implication.

---

The [negation][bookofproofs$714] of an [implication][bookofproofs$1304] `$x\Rightarrow y$` is [equivalent][bookofproofs$1305] to the [conjunction][bookofproofs$712] of the [antecedent][bookofproofs$1304] `$x$` and the negated [consequent][bookofproofs$1304] `$\neg y$`, formally `$$\neg (x\Rightarrow y)\Longleftrightarrow (x \wedge \neg y).$$`
