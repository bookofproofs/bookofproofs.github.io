* Let a premise `$p(\beta)$` be given which can be proven by the principle of transfinite induction to be [true][bookofproofs$707] for all ordinal numbers `$\beta\supset\alpha,$` given some base case ordinal number `$\alpha.$`
* Assume, the [set][bookofproofs$550] `$N$` of all [ordinal numbers][bookofproofs$723] `$\gamma\supseteq\alpha,$` for which the premise `$p(\gamma)$` is [false][bookofproofs$707] is not empty, `$N\neq\emptyset.$`
* Since [ordinal numbers][bookofproofs$723] are [well-ordered][bookofproofs$7997] by definition, `$N$` contains a [minimum][bookofproofs$7995] `$\gamma_0.$`
* But then `$p(\alpha)$` was true for all `$\alpha\subset \gamma_0,$` which is a [contradiction][bookofproofs$744] to the minimality of `$\gamma_0.$`
