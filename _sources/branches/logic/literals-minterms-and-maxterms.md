Before we learn more about particular types of types of [canonical normal forms][bookofproofs$7900], we will introduce some auxiliary definitions and a lemma.

Let `$\phi$` be a [proposition][bookofproofs$1307] with the [Boolean variables][bookofproofs$1307] `$x_1,\ldots,x_n.$`
* Every occurence of `$x_i$` and/or its [negation][bookofproofs$714] `$\neg x_i$` in `$\phi$` is called a **literal**. We denote a literal by `$(\neg)x_i.$`
* Every [conjunction][bookofproofs$712] of literals `$(\neg)x_1\wedge \ldots \wedge (\neg)x_n$` is called a **minterm**.
* Every [disjunction][bookofproofs$713] of literals `$(\neg)x_1\vee \ldots \vee (\neg)x_n$` is called a **maxterm**.
