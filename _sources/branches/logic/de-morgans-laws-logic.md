Let `$x,y$` be two [propositions][bookofproofs$710]. In the [semantics of propositional logic][bookofproofs$7871], the following laws hold for the [conjunction][bookofproofs$712] "`$\wedge$`", [disjunction][bookofproofs$713] "`$\vee$`" and [negation][bookofproofs$714] "$`\neg$`":


`$$\begin{array}{c}\neg(x\vee y)=(\neg x)\wedge (\neg y),\\\neg(x\wedge y)=(\neg x)\vee (\neg y).\end{array}$$`

This law is named after [Augustus De Morgan][bookofproofs$De_Morgan] (1806 - 1871).
