In the following, we will introduce some most important types of [valid logical arguments][bookofproofs$7913]. While introducing them, we will also mathematically prove that they are indeed valid. You will learn the techniques of the following types of valid logical arguments:

* [deductive reasoning][bookofproofs$7935],
* [modus ponens][bookofproofs$7918],
* [modus tollens][bookofproofs$7919],
* [hypothetical syllogism][bookofproofs$7921],
* [disjunctive syllogism][bookofproofs$7920],
* the proving principle by [contradiction][bookofproofs$744],
* the proving principle by [contraposition][bookofproofs$1330],
* the proving principle by [induction][bookofproofs$657].
Feel free to use these techniques, not only when writing mathematical proofs, but also in daily life, e.g. when trying to convince your audience or discussion partners.
