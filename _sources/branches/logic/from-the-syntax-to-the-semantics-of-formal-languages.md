Up to now, any string of a [language][bookofproofs$7842], even if it follows a strict [syntax][bookofproofs$709], for instance, a string representing a formula like `$1 < 2$`, is nothing else but a meaningless concatenation of letters. _Semantics_ governs the way we can interpret a given formula of a formal language. Only with semantics, it is possible to distinguish between _true_ and _false_ formulae.  

In this chapter, we will stepwise approach the concept of _semantics of formal languages_. In order to do so, we will first introduce the _truth values_ and further concepts, including _interpretation_, _axioms_, _rules of interference_, _derivability_, and _model_. It will turn out that _semantics_ is s model relation we can use to decide if a formula is true or false.
