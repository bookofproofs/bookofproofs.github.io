*Modus tollens* (lat. "the way that denies by denying") is a [valid logical argument][bookofproofs$7913] consisting of two premises and a conclusion, which altogether are constructed from two [propositions][bookofproofs$1307] `$p$` and `$q$` as follows:

* The first premise (called the **major premise**) is the [implication][bookofproofs$1304] `$p\Rightarrow q$`.
* The second premise (called the **minor premise**) is the [negated][bookofproofs$714] proposition `$\neg q$`.
* The negated proposition `$\neg p$` is the conclusion of the modus tollens.

Formally, modus tollens is the following logical argument:
 `$$\begin{array}{rll}
p\Rightarrow q&\text{major premise}&\text{e.g. If it is raining, then the roads are wet.}\\
\neg q&\text{minor premise}&\text{e.g. The roads are not wet.}\\
\hline 
\neg p&\text{conclusion}&\text{e.g. It is not raining.}\\ 
\end{array} $$`
