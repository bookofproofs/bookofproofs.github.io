In a [logical calculus][bookofproofs$7882], a **signature** `\(\Sigma\)` is a triple `\((V_\Sigma,F_\Sigma,P_\Sigma)\)` of the following [sets][bookofproofs$550]:

* the set of [variables][bookofproofs$6220] `\(V_\Sigma\)`,
* the set of [functions][bookofproofs$6222] `\(F_\Sigma\)`, and
* the set of [predicates][bookofproofs$6223] `\(P_\Sigma\)`.

Every function `\(f\in F_\Sigma\)` has an [arity][bookofproofs$6222] `$n\ge 0$`, while for `$n=0$` we call the functions [constants][bookofproofs$6222].

Every predicate `\(p\in P_\Sigma\)` has an [arity][bookofproofs$6222] `\(n\ge 1\)`.
