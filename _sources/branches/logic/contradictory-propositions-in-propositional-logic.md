A similarly important concept as [equivalent propositions][bookofproofs$1318] is that of __contradictory propositions__. We have seen that in a general formal language, a [contradiction][bookofproofs$7880] in an expression `$\phi$` which is always invalid, i.e. for any interpretation `$I$`, the corresponding valuation function `$[[\phi]]_I$` is false. In the [semantics of propositional logic ][bookofproofs$7871], contradictions are exactly the same concept.

Contradictions are extraordinarily useful tools when we want to find the right conclusion by using the **exclusion principle**. If we manage to exclude all conclusions because they are invalid and there is only one conclusion left - the last possibility must be valid.

We will now learn some important examples of contradictions.
