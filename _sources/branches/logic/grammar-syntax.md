The above [examples][bookofproofs$7844] motivate the following definition:

---

Let `$\Sigma$` be an [alphabet][bookofproofs$708]. A **grammar** (or **syntax** ) is a [tuple][bookofproofs$747] `$G=(V,T,R,S)$` consisting of

* `$V\subset\Sigma^*$` a finite set of **variables**,
* `$T\subset\Sigma $` a finite set of **terminal symbols** (or **terminals**), i.e. some special characters from the [alphabet][bookofproofs$708] `$\Sigma$` such that `$V\cap T=\emptyset$`.
* A non-empty, finite set of rules `$R$`, i.e. pairs `$(P,C)\in R$` of **premises** `$P$` and **conclusions** `$C$` such that `$P\in (V\cup T)^*V (V\cup T)^*$` is a [string][bookofproofs$708] _containing at least one_ variable and `$C\in(V\cup T)^*$` is a [string][bookofproofs$708].
* `$S\in V$` as a **starting symbol** (a first to be replaced terminal symbol)


### Notes

* A syntax rule `$R$` expresses how a string `$P$` containing a variable can be transformed into another string `$C$`.
* Syntax rules can be optional, for instance, `$S\to HN$` and `$S\to H$` might be two coexisting rules of syntax, replacing the starting variable by the concatenation of `$HN$` or only by `$H$`.
* The (formal) language which is generated by the syntax, consists of all strings that can be generated when applying the ruleset, starting from the _starting symbol_.
* `$(V\cup T)^*$` denotes the [Kleene star][bookofproofs$8493] of the union of all variables and all terminals of the grammar. Correspondingly, an element of this union is any (even the [empty string][bookofproofs$708]) concatenation of variables and terminal symbols.
