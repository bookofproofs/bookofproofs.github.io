Every [Boolean function][bookofproofs$1316] can be represented by  [Boolean variables or constants][bookofproofs$1307] connected by the [conjunction][bookofproofs$712] [$\wedge$", the "disjunction][bookofproofs$713] [$\vee$", and the "negation][bookofproofs$714] [$\neg$" as the only "connectives][bookofproofs$7867].
