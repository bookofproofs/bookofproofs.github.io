Of course, the following lemma follows immediately from the [law of excluded middle][bookofproofs$710] which is used in the [definition of propositions][bookofproofs$710]. But now we will formally prove that a proposition cannot be both - true and false - by showing that this would be a [contradiction][bookofproofs$7880].

If `\(x\)` is a [proposition][bookofproofs$710], then the [conjunction][bookofproofs$712] `\(x\wedge \neg x\)` is a [contradiction][bookofproofs$7880] (i.e. always invalid). 


### Examples:

> `\(\text{"Socrates is a philosopher and Socrates is not a philosopher"}\)` is invalid.

> `\(a= 2\wedge a\neq 2\)` is invalid.
