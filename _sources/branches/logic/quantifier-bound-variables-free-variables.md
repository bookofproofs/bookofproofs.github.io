A **quantifier** is a [non-empty string over an alphabet][bookofproofs$708] used in a [logical calculus][bookofproofs$7882] to make quantitative statements about how many values from the [domain of discourse][bookofproofs$6219] a given [variable][bookofproofs$6220] can take. Depending on this quantity, the string containing the variable with its quantifier can be valued as true or false.

More exactly, let `$L$` be a [formal language][bookofproofs$94], `$U$` the [domain of discourse][bookofproofs$6219], and `$I(U,L)$` the corresponding [interpretation][bookofproofs$7874]. If an [interpretable string][bookofproofs$7874] `$s\in L$` contains a [variable][bookofproofs$6220], a **quantifier attached to** that variable is a symbol expressing how many values in `$U$` the variable can take. Depending on this quality, the valuation `$[[s]]_I$` can be either true or false.

A variable with a quantifier attached to it is called a **bound variable**, otherwise, it is called a **free variable**.

Unlike different types of quantifiers in natural languages like "many", "a lot", "no", "for some", "a few", logical calculi generally use two types of quantifiers:

* **existential quantifier** `\(\exists\)`: read "there exists", symbolized by rotated letter "E",
* **universal quantifier** `\(\forall\)`: read "for all" or "for every".
