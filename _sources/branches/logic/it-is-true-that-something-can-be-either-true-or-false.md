If `\(x\)` is a [proposition][bookofproofs$710], then the [disjunction][bookofproofs$713] `\(x\vee \neg x\)` is a [tautology][bookofproofs$7880] (i.e. always valid). 

### Examples:

> `\(\text{"Socrates is a philosopher or Socrates is not a philosopher"}\)` is valid.

> `\(a=2\vee a \neq 2\)` is valid.
