In rhetoric, the word __tautology__ has a negative connotation. It is an argument, which simply rephrases the assertion in order to obfuscate a lack of evidence. In other words, a tautological argument is invalid and does not really support the stated conclusion. 

In mathematical logic, a __tautology__ has quite a different meaning than in rhetoric. We have seen that [a string of a formal language which is always valid is called a tautology][bookofproofs$7880]. In this sense, the word "tautology" has a positive connotation in mathematics, because - unlike in rhetoric - it is an always valid logical argument!

Tautologies in logic can be used to show that two logical statements are **equivalent**. In [propositional logic][bookofproofs$1307] in particular, `$\phi$` and `$\psi$` are [equivalent][bookofproofs$1305]  [propositions][bookofproofs$1307], if the [compound proposition][bookofproofs$7867] `$\phi\Leftrightarrow \psi$` is a tautology. We will see that propositional logic can be embedded in most [logical calculi][bookofproofs$7882], based on which mathematical theories are built. Therefore, the concepts of tautology and equivalence are important not only for propositional logic in particular but for [logical calculi][bookofproofs$7882] in general. For instance, all [axioms][bookofproofs$7876] of a given logical calculus are tautologies by definition. If in a given logical calculus, we want to prove that two [theorems][bookofproofs$7879] `$\Phi$` and `$\Psi$` are equivalent, then we usually do it by showing `$\Phi\Leftrightarrow\Psi$` is a tautology. 

The notions of Equivalence and tautology are very useful since they allow proving that propositions or theorems with different [syntax][bookofproofs$709] have in fact the same [semantics][bookofproofs$7881].
We will now learn some important examples of equivalent propositions in propositional logic.
