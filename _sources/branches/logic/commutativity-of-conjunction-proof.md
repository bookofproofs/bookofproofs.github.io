* Let `$L$` be a [set of propositions][bookofproofs$1307] and let  `$I$` be an [interpretation][bookofproofs$710] with the [valuation function][bookofproofs$710] `$[[]]_I$`.
* According to the [truth table of conjunction][bookofproofs$712], the valuation function `$[[x\wedge y]]_I$` does not change its value if we exchange the valuations of `$[[x]]_I$` and `$[[y]]_I,$`
* Thus, the [conjunction][bookofproofs$712] operation [$\wedge$" is "commutative][bookofproofs$672], i.e. `$x \wedge y=y \wedge x$`.
