* The operations [conjunction][bookofproofs$712] [$\wedge$", the "disjunction][bookofproofs$713] [$\vee$", and the "negation][bookofproofs$714] [$\neg$" are the only operations used to form the "conjunctive and disjunctive canonical normal forms][bookofproofs$7904].
* From the [construction of conjunctive and disjunctive canonical normal forms][bookofproofs$7905], it follows that they can be constructed for any given [truth table][bookofproofs$7868] of a proposition `$\phi$` based on its [prime propositions][bookofproofs$7867] `$p_1,\ldots,p_n,$` which by definition represent only [Boolean variables or constants][bookofproofs$1307].
* Since `$\phi$` is an arbitrary [proposition][bookofproofs$1307], it follows that an arbitrary [Boolean function][bookofproofs$1316] can be build using [$\wedge$", "$\vee$", and "$\neg$" as the only "connectives][bookofproofs$7867] of Boolean variables or constants.
