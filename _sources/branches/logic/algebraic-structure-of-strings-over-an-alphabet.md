From an algebraic point of view, the set `$\Sigma^*$` of all strings under the [alphabet][bookofproofs$708] `$\Sigma$`, together with the [concatenation][bookofproofs$708] as its binary operation `$\cdot: \Sigma^* \times \Sigma^* \mapsto \Sigma^*$`, establishes the structure of a [monoid][bookofproofs$659], denoted by `$(\Sigma^*,\cdot)$`.
