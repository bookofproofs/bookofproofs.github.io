_Signatures_ offer a way to classify [logical calculi][bookofproofs$7882]. They describe the vocabulary of a logical calculus formed by the [strings][bookofproofs$708] of the underlying [formal language][bookofproofs$94]. Usually, the vocabulary - a signature - consists of _variables_, _functions_, and _predicates_. We will now formally define what variables, formulas, predicates, and signatures are and then we will introduce logical calculi with different signatures, including [propositional logic][bookofproofs$66], [first-order predicate logic][bookofproofs$186] and [higher-order logics][bookofproofs$207].
