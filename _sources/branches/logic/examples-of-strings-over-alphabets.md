### Example 1

Let `$\Sigma:=\{a,b,c\}$` be our [alphabet][bookofproofs$708]. Then

> `$a,$` `$aa$`, `$aaaa$`, `$bca$`, `$acc$`, `$aabbcc$`, `$bbbaaa$`,

are possible strings in `$\Sigma^*$`.

### Example 2

Let `$\Sigma$` be the set of all Capital and lowercase Latin letters, including the empty space, the comma, the point, the question mark, and the exclamation mark. Then `$\Sigma^*$` consists of (infinitely many) sentences, which can be written using the Latin letters, some of them making sense like

> "Socrates is a man."

some of which without any sense like

> "DLdfa hidb!zw. alsei?"

### Example 3

Let `$\Sigma:=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,+,=\}$`. Then these are examples of possible strings over this alphabet:

> `$1=1$`, `$1=0$`, `$1+1=2$` `$=32$` `$===$` `$30014$` `$2222=333=+++$`
