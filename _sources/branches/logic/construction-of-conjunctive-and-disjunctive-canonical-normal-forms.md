Let `$\phi$` be a [proposition][bookofproofs$1307] with the corresponding [Boolean function][bookofproofs$1316] `$f_\phi.$` Then there exist either the [disjunctive or the conjunctive canonical (or both) normal forms][bookofproofs$7904] `$\operatorname{dcnf}(\phi)$` and `$\operatorname{ccnf}(\phi)$` with the same Boolean functions:

`$$f_\phi=f_{\operatorname{dcnf}(\phi)}=f_{\operatorname{ccnf}(\phi)}.$$`

If `$\operatorname{dcnf}(\phi)$` and/or `$\operatorname{ccnf}(\phi)$` exist, then they are unique except of the order of [literals][bookofproofs$7901] and the [minterms][bookofproofs$7901] respectively [maxterms][bookofproofs$7901].
