The [equivalence operation][bookofproofs$1305] "`$\Leftrightarrow$`" is [commutative][bookofproofs$672], 
i.e. `$x \Leftrightarrow y=y \Leftrightarrow x$` for all possible [interpretations][bookofproofs$710] `$I$` 
and [valuation functions][bookofproofs$710] `$[[]]_I$` of [propositions][bookofproofs$1307] `\(x,y.\)`.
