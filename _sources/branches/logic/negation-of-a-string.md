Let `$L$` be a [logical calculus][bookofproofs$7882] with a [syntax][bookofproofs$709] allowing to express a negation of a string `$\phi$`. Without loss of generality, assume that the underlying [alphabet][bookofproofs$708] contains a special negation letter [$\neg$" such that `$\neg \phi$` denotes the **negation of the string** `$\phi$`. The negation of the string `$\phi$` has the following "semantics][bookofproofs$7881]: For any [interpretation][bookofproofs$7874] `$I,$` the valuations `$[[\phi]]_I$` and `$[[\neg \phi]]_I$` are related to each other as follows:
* if `$[[\phi]]_I=1$`, then `$[[\neg \phi]]_I=0,$`
* if `$[[\neg \phi]]_I=1$`, then `$[[\phi]]_I=0.$`
