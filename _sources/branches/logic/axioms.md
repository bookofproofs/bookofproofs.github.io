Let `\(L\subseteq (\Sigma^*,\cdot) \)` be a [formal language][bookofproofs$94] with strings `$s\in L$` formed according to a [syntax][bookofproofs$709] and let inside a [domain of discourse][bookofproofs$6219] `$U,$` a [semantics][bookofproofs$7874] `$I(U,L)$` and `$[[]]_I$` be given. 

*Axioms* of `$L$` are a non-emtpy, [finite][bookofproofs$985] number of [interpretable][bookofproofs$7874] strings `$a_1, \ldots, a_n\in L$` such that `$$[[a_i]]_I=1,\quad i=1,\ldots,n.$$`

Less formally, axioms are selected strings in the formal language `$L$`, which can be interpreted as "true" statements about `$U.$`
