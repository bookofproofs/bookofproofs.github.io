Let `\(p\)` be a [proposition][bookofproofs$1307] and `\(\neg p\)` its [negation][bookofproofs$714]. By showing that:
`\[\neg p \Rightarrow 0\]`
it follows that 
`\[p = 1.\]`

This proving method is called **by contradiction** or **reductio ad absurdum**.

Formally, reductio ad absordum is the following logical argument:
 `$$\begin{array}{rll}
\neg p\Rightarrow 0&\text{premise}&\text{e.g. It is false that the sun is not shining.}\\
\hline 
p&\text{conclusion}&\text{e.g. Therefore, the sun is shining.}\\ 
\end{array} $$`
