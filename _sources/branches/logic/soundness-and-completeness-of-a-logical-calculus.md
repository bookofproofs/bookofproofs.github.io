A [logical calculus][bookofproofs$7882] `$L$` is called

* **sound**, if any [derivable][bookofproofs$7883] statement  is also a [valid][bookofproofs$7880] statement, formally `$\vdash \phi$`   implies `$\models \phi,$`
* **complete**, if any valid statement is also derivable, formally `$\models \phi$`   implies `$\vdash \phi.$`

### Notes:

* **Soundness** and **completeness** are semantical properties of a logical calculus. 
* A logical calculus is sound if all its theorems are true statements, and it is complete if all true statements are theorems. 
* Soundness and completeness are desirable properties of logical calculi since such systems induce no difference between the provability and the truth of theorems.
