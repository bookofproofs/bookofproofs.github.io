We want to prove that [proving principle by contradiction][bookofproofs$744] is a [valid logical argument][bookofproofs$7913].
* The proving principle by contradiction is can be formulated as `$(\neg p\Rightarrow 0)\Rightarrow p.$`
* We can reformulate the [implication as a disjunction][bookofproofs$6874] on the left side and get the expression `$(p\vee 0)\Rightarrow 0.$`
* Because `$0$` is smallest in the [Boolean algebra][bookofproofs$7872] of [the Boolean algebra in propositional logic][bookofproofs$187] `$(B,\wedge,\vee,1,0)$`, we get the expression `$p\Rightarrow p.$`
* By definition of a [valid logical argument][bookofproofs$7913],  `$p\Rightarrow p$` is valid.
