Let `$L$` be a [logical calculus][bookofproofs$7882], `$U$` the [domain of discourse][bookofproofs$6219], and `$I(U,L)$` the corresponding [interpretation][bookofproofs$7874]  with the [valuation][bookofproofs$7874] function `$[[]]_I$`.

A **predicate** is a [non-empty string over an alphabet][bookofproofs$708] `$s\in L$` interpreted as a [relation][bookofproofs$571] `\(R\subseteq U^n\)` taking `\(n\)` input arguments from the domain of discourse.

The [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `\(n\ge 1\)` of arguments of the predicate is (as for functions) called its **arity**. Special cases of arities are:

* `\(n=1\)`: **Unary** predicates
* `\(n=2\)`: **Binary** predicates
* `\(n=3\)`: **Ternary** predicates
* generally *`\(n\)`-nary* predicates
