We want to show that for every [proposition][bookofproofs$710] `\(x\)` the disjunction `\(x\vee \neg x\)` is a [tautology][bookofproofs$7880]. This can be easily verified: By [definition of disjunction][bookofproofs$713], any possible [semantics][bookofproofs$7871] of `\(x\)` makes the [compound proposition][bookofproofs$7867] `\(x\vee \neg x\)` valid:


`\([[x]]_I\)` | `\([[x]]_I\)` | `\([[x\vee \neg x]]_I\)`
:------------- |:------------- |:-------------
 `\(1\)`| `\(0\)`| `\(1\)`
 `\(0\)`| `\(1\)`| `\(1\)`
