We have seen that [all Boolean functions can be built][bookofproofs$7907] using only the [conjunction][bookofproofs$712] [$\wedge$", the "disjunction][bookofproofs$713] [$\vee$", and the "negation][bookofproofs$714] [$\neg$" as the only "connectives][bookofproofs$7867]. This motivates the following lemma:

---

The set `$B$` of all [Boolean terms][bookofproofs$1307] is a [Boolean algebra][bookofproofs$7872] `$(B,\wedge,\vee,1,0)$` with respect to the [conjunction][bookofproofs$712] [$\wedge$" and the "disjunction][bookofproofs$713] "$\vee$".
