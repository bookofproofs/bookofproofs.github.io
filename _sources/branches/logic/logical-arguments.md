A **logical argument** consists of some (say `$n\ge 1$`) given [propositions][bookofproofs$1307] `$p_1,\ldots,p_n$`, called **premises**, and a proposition `$q$`, called the **conclusion**.

There are two kinds of logical arguments, valid arguments, and fallacies:

* A logical argument is **valid** if and only if the conclusion is true whenever all the premises are simultaneously true, formally `$$\text{ if }([[p_1]]_I=1\text{ and },\ldots,\text{ and }[[p_n]]_I=1),\text{ then } [[q]]_I=1$$` for all interpretations `$I$`.
* A **fallacy** is an invalid argument: The conclusion is false, while all the premises are true, formally `$$([[p_1]]_I=1\text{ and },\ldots, \text{ and }[[p_n]]_I=1), \text{ and }[[q]]_I=0$$` for all interpretations `$I$`.
