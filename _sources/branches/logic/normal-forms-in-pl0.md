We have seen that for each [proposition][bookofproofs$710] `$\phi$` there is a [Boolean function][bookofproofs$1316] `$f_\phi$` such that `$f_\phi=1$` if and only if `$\models \phi$`. But do propositions and Boolean functions form a one-to-one relationship? The answer to that question is '"no". We will now provide some examples.
