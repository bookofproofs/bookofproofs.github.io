If a conclusion is made that a "general principle must be true" from the evidence of specific cases observed, then we call that conclusion **inductive reasoning**. Inductive reasoning has the following logical form:

> `$p_1,\ldots,p_n$` are all true, therefore, `$p_i$` is true for all `$i\ge 1.$` 

Examples of such reasoning are:

> "All observed ravens are black, therefore all ravens are black."

> "I never won the lottery, therefore it is impossible to win the lottery."

> "We discover more and more twin prime numbers, therefore, there are infinitely many twin prime numbers."

Inductive reasoning is a [fallacy][bookofproofs$7913] since, in general, the conclusion is not true: There is no reason, why finitely many positive observations should exclude a possible exception. The only way to make a valid argument in such cases is [deductive reasoning][bookofproofs$7935], if possible.
