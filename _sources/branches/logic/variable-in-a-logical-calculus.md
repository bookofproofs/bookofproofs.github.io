A **variable** is a [non-empty string over an alphabet][bookofproofs$708] used in a [logical calculus][bookofproofs$7882] to represent an element of a [domain of discourse][bookofproofs$6219].
More exactly, if `$L$` is a [formal language][bookofproofs$94], `$U$` the domain of discourse, and `$s\in L$` an [interpretable string][bookofproofs$7874] with the [interpretation][bookofproofs$7874] `$I(s)$`, then a variable is any substring of `$s$` being a symbol representing an element of `$U$` in the interpretation `$I(s)$`.
