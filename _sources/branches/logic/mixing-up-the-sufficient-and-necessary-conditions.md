Another common [fallacy][bookofproofs$7913] is mixing up the sufficient and necessary conditions of an [implication][bookofproofs$1304] 
"`$\Rightarrow$`". Given two [propositions][bookofproofs$1307] `$p$` and `$q$`, this fallacy takes the following form:

`$$\begin{array}{rll}
p\Rightarrow q&\text{premise}&\text{e.g. Any square is a rectangle.}\\
\hline 
q\Rightarrow p&\text{conclusion}&\text{e.g. Therefore, any rectangle is a square.}\\ 
\end{array} $$`
