From a formal point of view, an **alphabet** is a non-empty [set][bookofproofs$550], denoted by the Latin capital letter `\(\Sigma \)` ("sigma"), whose elements are called **letters**.

We define the **concatenation** of any to letters `$x,y\in\Sigma$` and denote this operation by the multiplication sign "`\(\cdot\)`".

Using the concatenation, we can create **words**, also called **strings** `\(s\)` over the alphabet `\(\Sigma\)`.

We denote by `\(\Sigma^*\)` the set of all strings over the alphabet `\(\Sigma \)`.

Let `$s\in\Sigma^*$` be a string. The **length** of the string, denoted by `\(|s|\)`, is defined as the [number][bookofproofs$842] of concatenated letters which were used to create the string `$s$`.

Please note that `$|s|\ge 0$` for any `$s\in\Sigma^*$`. If `\(|s|=0\)`, then we call `$s$` the **empty string** and denote it by `\(\epsilon\)`.
