The **proving principle by transfinite induction** is a [valid logical argument][bookofproofs$7915] in [first order predicate][bookofproofs$186] logic[^1]. It consists of:

* the **base case premise**: `$p(\alpha)$` for some [ordinal number][bookofproofs$723] `$\alpha,$`
* the **induction step premise**:  prove that `$p(\beta)$` is true assuming that `$p(\alpha)$` is true for all `$\alpha\subset \beta,$`
* the **conclusion**: `$p(\beta)$` is true for all ordinal numbers `$\beta$` [greater than or equal][bookofproofs$729] the base case `$\alpha.$`

[^1]: This is because it requires the [quantifier][bookofproofs$186] "for all: `$\forall$`."
