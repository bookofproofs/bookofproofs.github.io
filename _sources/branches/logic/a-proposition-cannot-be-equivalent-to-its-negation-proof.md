* Let `$x$` be a  [proposition][bookofproofs$710].
* Using the [semantics of propositional logic][bookofproofs$7871] and the [definition of equivalence][bookofproofs$1305] we get the following [truth table][bookofproofs$7868]:


`$[[x]]_I$` | `$[[\neg x]]_I$` | `$[[x \Leftrightarrow \neg x]]_I$`
:------------- |:------------- |:-------------
 `\(1\)`| `\(0\)`| `\(0\)`
 `\(0\)`| `\(1\)`| `\(0\)`

* It follows that `\(x\Leftrightarrow \neg x\)` is a [contradiction][bookofproofs$7880].
* Thus, `$x$` cannot be equivalent to its negation.
