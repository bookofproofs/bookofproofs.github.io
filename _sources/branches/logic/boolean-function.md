Any [prime or compound propositions][bookofproofs$7867] `$\phi$` can be regarded as a function, called a __Boolean function__.

---

Let `$\phi$` be [a prime or a compound proposition][bookofproofs$7867] containing exactly `$n\ge 1$` [prime propositions][bookofproofs$7867] `$p_1,\ldots,p_n$` with the [interpretation][bookofproofs$710] `$I$` and the corresponding [valuation function][bookofproofs$710] `$[[]]_I.$` Then `$\phi$` represents a [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f_{\phi}:\mathbb B^n \to\mathbb B,$` where `$\mathbb B$` is the [set of truth values][bookofproofs$707], defined as follows:

`$$f_{\phi}(p_1,\ldots,p_n):=[[\phi]]_I=\cases{1&\text{if }I\models\phi,\\0&\text{if }I\not{\models}\;\phi.}$$`

The function `$f_\phi$` is called **Boolean function** of the proposition `$\phi.$`
