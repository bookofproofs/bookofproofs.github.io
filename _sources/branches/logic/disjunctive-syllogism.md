The **disjunctive syllogism** is a [valid logical argument][bookofproofs$7913] consisting of two premises and a conclusion, which altogether are constructed from two [propositions][bookofproofs$1307] `$p$` and `$q$` as follows:

* The first premise (called the **major premise**) is the [disjunction][bookofproofs$713] `$p\vee q$`.
* The second premise (called the **minor premise**) is the [negated][bookofproofs$714] proposition `$\neg p$`.
* The proposition `$q$` is the conclusion of the disjunctive syllogism.

Formally,the disjunctive syllogism is the following logical argument:
 `$$\begin{array}{rll}
p\vee q&\text{major premise}&\text{e.g. Either it is raining or the sun is shining (or both).}\\
\neg p&\text{minor premise}&\text{e.g. It is not raining.}\\
\hline 
q&\text{conclusion}&\text{e.g. Therefore, the sun is shining.}\\ 
\end{array} $$`
