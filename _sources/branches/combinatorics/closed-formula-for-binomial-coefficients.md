The [binomial coefficient][bookofproofs$993] `\(\binom nk\)` can be for `\(k,n\in\mathbb N\)`, `\(n\ge 1\)`, `\(n\ge k\)` calculated using the following closed formula:


`\[\binom nk=\frac{n^{\underline{k}}}{k!},\]`

whereas `\(n^{\underline{k}}\)` denotes the [falling factorial power][bookofproofs$1399] `\(n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)\)` and `\(k!\)` denotes the [factorial][bookofproofs$1005] `\(k(k-1)\cdots 2\cdot 1\)`, i.e. we can also write[^1]

`\[\binom nk=\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\cdots 2\cdot 1}=\frac{n !}{k !\cdot (n-k) !}.\]`

[^1]: Please note that from the combinatorial interpretation of the binomial coefficient (as the number of subsets of a finite set with a fixed number of elements) demonstrates that the fraction is always an integer, which is not so obvious from the formula.
