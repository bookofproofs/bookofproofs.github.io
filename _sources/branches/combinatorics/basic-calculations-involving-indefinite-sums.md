The indefinite sum is **linear**, i.e. for a [complex-valued][bookofproofs$216] [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f:\mathbb C\to C$` and a constant `$\lambda\in\mathbb C$` the following properties are fulfilled:

1. `$\sum \lambda f(x)=\lambda \sum f(x).$`
1. `$\sum (f(x)\pm g(x))=\sum f(x)\pm \sum g(x).$`

Moreover, for functions `$f,g:\mathbb C\to C,$` the **partial summation** formula holds:

#3. `$\sum g(x)\Delta f(x)=f(x)g(x)-\sum f(x+1)\Delta g(x)$`

### Notes

* The linearity holds in analogy to the [linearity of the integral][bookofproofs$1769].
* The partial summation formula is yet another formulation of the [Abelian summation by parts][bookofproofs$8356], and will be proved here again using the methods of difference calculus.
* In the equations 1-3, the [periodic constants][bookofproofs$8507] are omitted, just like constants are omitted for the analogous formulas for the integral.
