This part provides some examples of solving problems related to combinatorics and discrete mathematics. Surprisingly, methods related to combinatorics can have many applications in different other parts of mathematics. Therefore, some of the problems presented here will be not strictly combinatorial problems but require combinatorial methods to solve them.
