Let `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` be a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] and let `\(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m\)` be some [complex][bookofproofs$216] or [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105]. Then the [sum][bookofproofs$261] with `\(r\)` terms raised to the [`\(n\)`-th power][bookofproofs$1618] of will expand as follows:

`\[(x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_r)^n=\sum_{\substack{k_1+\ldots+k_r=n \\ k_1,\ldots,k_r}}\binom{n}{k_1,k_2\ldots,k_r}x_1^{k_1} x_2^{k_2}\ldots x_r^{k_r}.\]`

where 

`\[\binom n{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m}:=\frac{n !}{k_1 !k_2 !\cdot\ldots \cdot k_m !}\]`
is the [multinomial coefficient][bookofproofs$1819].
