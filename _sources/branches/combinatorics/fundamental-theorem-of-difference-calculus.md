The following theorem can be called the **fundamental theorem of difference calculus**, as it provides a discrete version of the [fundamental theorem of calculus][bookofproofs$6807].

Let `$F:D\to\mathbb C$` be an [antidifference][bookofproofs$8506] of a [complex-valued][bookofproofs$216]  [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f:C\to\mathbb C$`, `$D\subseteq\mathbb C.$` Then, for all `$a,b\in C$` and all [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `$n\in\mathbb N$` the following formula holds:

`$$\sum_{x=a}^{a+n-1}f(x)=F(a+n)-F(a).$$`

### Different Notation

`$$\sum_{x=a}^{a+n-1}f(x)=F(x)\;\Rule{1px}{4ex}{2ex}^{a+n}_{a}=\Delta^{-1}f(x)\;\Rule{1px}{4ex}{2ex}^{a+n}_{a}.$$`
