The following theorem for the discrete [difference operator][bookofproofs$8408] corresponds to a similar theorem from the continuous calculus, called the [Taylor's formula][bookofproofs$8440].

Let `$f:D\to\mathbb C$` be a [factorial polynomial][bookofproofs$8418] with a suitable domain `$D\subseteq\mathbb C$`. Using the [falling factorial powers][bookofproofs$1399] and the [nth difference operator][bookofproofs$8411], the value at `$f(x)$` can be written as

`$$f(x)=f(0)+\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\Delta^k f(0)}{k !} x^{\underline{k}}.$$`
