Using the formula for the [falling factorial powers][bookofproofs$1399] from [antidifferences of some functions][bookofproofs$8511], we get

`$$\sum_{x=3}^{16}x^{\underline{3}}=\frac{x^{\underline 4}}{4}\;\Rule{1px}{4ex}{2ex}^{17}_{3}=\frac{17\cdot 16\cdot 15\cdot 14-3\cdot 2\cdot 1\cdot 0}{4}=14280.$$`
