The [Stirling numbers of the second kind][bookofproofs$8425] obey the following recursive formula  `$$\left\{\begin{array}{c}n+1\\r\end{array}\right\}=\left\{\begin{array}{c}n\\r-1\end{array}\right\}+r\cdot \left\{\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right\}$$`
with the initial conditions `$$\begin{align}\left\{\begin{array}{c}n\\n\end{array}\right\}&:=1,\quad n\ge 1\nonumber\\\left\{\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right\}&:=0,\quad r=0 < n\text{ or }n < r.\nonumber\end{align}$$`
