Consider the set `\(C=\{char(Y), Y\subseteq X\}\)` of all [characteristic strings][bookofproofs$1001] defined on the set `\(S:\{Y\subseteq X\}\)`. According to the proof of [characteristic strings][bookofproofs$1001], we have `\(|C|=|S|\)`. Note that each `\(char(Y)\)` is a string of the length `\(|X|=n\)` over the alphabet `\(\Sigma=\{0,1\}\)`, (i.e. of `\(2\)` letters).

According to the rule about the [number of strings with a fixed length `\(n\)` over an alphabet with `\(k\)` letters][bookofproofs$996] the number of such strings is `\(k^n\)`. Therefore we have`\[|S|=|C|=2^n.\]`
