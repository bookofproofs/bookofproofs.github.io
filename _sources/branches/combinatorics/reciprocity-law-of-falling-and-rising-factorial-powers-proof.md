Let `\(x\)` be a  [real][bookofproofs$1105] (or [complex][bookofproofs$216]) number and let `\(-x\)` be its additive inverse (i.e. `\(x + (-x)=0\)`).  Then it follows immediately from the definition of the [falling and rising factorial powers][bookofproofs$1399] that


`\[(-x)^{\underline k}=(-x)(-x-1)\cdots(-x-k+1)=(-1)^kx(x+1)\cdot(x+k-1)=(-1)^k x^{\overline k}.\]`
