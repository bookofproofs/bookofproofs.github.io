Let `$X$` be a [non-empty set][bookofproofs$550] and let `$\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\}$` be a set with `$n$` elements. The [Cartesian product][bookofproofs$748] `$$\underbrace{X\times X\times\cdots\times X}_{n\text{ 
 times}}$$` is [equipotent][bookofproofs$978] to the set of all  [maps][bookofproofs$592] `$f:\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\}\to X.$`

In particular, if `$X$` is a finite set as well with the [cardinality][bookofproofs$980] `$|X|=m,$` then the number of [ordered n-tuples][bookofproofs$747] of the `$m$` elements equals `$m^n.$`
