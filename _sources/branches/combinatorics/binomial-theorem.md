For all [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` and any two elements `\(x,y\in R\)` of a [ring][bookofproofs$683] `\((R,+,\cdot)\)`, there is a closed formula for the sum 
`\[\begin{align}
\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}x^{n-k}y^k&=
{n \choose 0}x^n y^0 + {n \choose 1}x^{n-1}y^1 + {n \choose 2}x^{n-2}y^2 + \cdots + {n \choose n-1}x^1 y^{n-1} + {n \choose n}x^0 y^n\nonumber\\
&=(x+y)^n\nonumber
\end{align}\]`

Equivalently, `\((x+y)^n\)` can be expanded to the sum `\(\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}x^{n-k}y^k\)`. The symbol `\({n \choose k}\)` denotes the [binomial coefficients][bookofproofs$993].
