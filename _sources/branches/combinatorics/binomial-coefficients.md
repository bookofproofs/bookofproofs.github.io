Let `\(X\)` be a [finite set][bookofproofs$985] with exactly `\(n\)` elements `\((|X|=n)\)`. The number of possible [combinations][bookofproofs$209] of size `\(k\)`, `\(0\le k\le n\)` is called the **binomial coefficient** and denoted it by 
`\[\binom nk.\]`
The symbol `\(\binom nk\)` is read "`\(n\)` choose `\(k\)`".
