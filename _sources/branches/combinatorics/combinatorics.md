This branch of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong> is devoted to _combinatorcs_. Combinartorics, sometimes also called _discrete mathematics_, is a branch of mathematics that focusses on the study of _discrete_ objects (as opposed to continuous ones). The main purpose is to provide a framework for counting these objects under diffent operations, including exchanges, permutations, choice situations, combinations, and many more.

Combinatorics plays a crucial role in the development of many other mathematical areas, e.g. number theory, probability theory, graph theory, geometry, and the theory of algorithms.

### Theoretical minimum (in a nutshell)

As a framework for counting discrete objects, combinatorics does not require very sophisticated prerequisites to be acquainted with. However, the theoretical concepts of counting in combinatorics can become demanding for the undergraduates. The main difficulty might result not in the mere understanding of the techniques, but in the ability to recognize which technique to count things is applicable in a given situation.

### Concepts you will learn in this part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>


* Basic _counting principles_, e.g.
   * the _Pigeonhole principle_,
   * the _fundamental counting principle_ for addition and multiplication,
   * _permutations_ and _factorials_, with and without repetitions,
   * _combinations_ and _permutations_ of indistinguishable objects,
* You will learn problem-solving strategies for _counting problems_.
* Learn about some number sequences, including _Stirling_, _Bernoulli_, and about their applications.
* Learn what are _recurrencies_ and why they are important for solving combinatorial problems and programming.
* Learn solving strategies to solve recurrences, including _generating functions_.
