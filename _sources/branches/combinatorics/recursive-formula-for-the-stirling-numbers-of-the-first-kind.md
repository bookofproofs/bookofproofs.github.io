The [Stirling numbers of the first kind][bookofproofs$8425] obey the following recursive formula  `$$\left[\begin{array}{c}n+1\\r\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}n\\r-1\end{array}\right]+n\cdot \left[\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right]$$`
with the initial conditions `$$\begin{align}\left[\begin{array}{c}n\\n\end{array}\right]&:=1,\quad n\ge 1\nonumber\\\left[\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right]&:=0,\quad r=0 < n\text{ or }n < r.\nonumber\end{align}$$`
