The [indicator function][bookofproofs$8299] is an example of a [map][bookofproofs$592] of an arbitrary [set][bookofproofs$550] `$X$` into another set with two elements, in this case, the set `$\{0,1\}$`. The definition of indicator function reveals that _all_ maps of this kind are exactly those maps, whose [carriers][bookofproofs$8299] correspond to exactly the [subsets][bookofproofs$552] of `$X.$`

The question, how many characteristic functions for a given [set][bookofproofs$550] `$X$` do exist, is therefore equivalent to the question, how many subsets of `$S$` exist. But this is exactly the [cardinality][bookofproofs$980] `$|\mathcal P(X)|,$` where `$\mathcal P(S)$` denotes the [power set][bookofproofs$6831] of `$S.$` This result can be summarized as follows: `$$|\mathcal P(X)|=2^{|X|}.$$` It is true for both, [finite or infinite sets][bookofproofs$985] `$X.$` In the combinatorics, `$2^{|X|}$` is the common notation for the cardinality of the power set `$\mathcal P(S).$`

Despite this argument, the following proposition summarizes this result for finite sets with yet another proof:
