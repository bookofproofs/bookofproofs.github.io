Let `\(V=\{a_i,~i\in I\}\)` be a [finite (or infinite) set][bookofproofs$985] with a given  **index** `\(I\)` of its elements `\(I=\{1,\ldots,n,\ldots\}\)`. A **permutation** of `\(V\)` is a [bijective map][bookofproofs$771] on this order `\(\pi:I\mapsto I\)`. 


A permutation can be generated by selecting elements from an ordered collection `\(A\)` and moving them from this collection into a new ordered collection `\(P\)`.

### Notation:

There are different ways a permutation `\(\pi\)` can be notated. As a permutation does not depend on the specific elements of `\(a_i\in V\)`, all notations are related to the index set `\(i\)`.

> **Possibility 1** __(Two-Line Notation)__: 
`\[\pi=\left(
  \begin{matrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 & \cdots & n-1 & n \\
    \pi(1) & \pi(2) & \pi(3) & \cdots & \pi(n-1) & \pi(n) \\
  \end{matrix}
  \right)~~~~~~~~~~~~\text{e.g. for }n=9:~~~~\left(
  \begin{matrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9\\
    7 & 8 & 6 & 4 & 9 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 5\\
  \end{matrix}
  \right)\]`
As the indices of the first line always appear in their natural order, they do not provide any additional information. Therefore the following __one-line notation__ is more common:

> **Possibility 2** __(One-Line Notation)__: 
`\[\pi=(
  \begin{matrix}
    \pi(1) & \pi(2) & \pi(3) & \cdots & \pi(n-1) & \pi(n) \\
  \end{matrix}
  )~~~~~~~~~~~~\text{e.g. for }n=9:~~~~(
  \begin{matrix}
    7 & 8 & 6 & 4 & 9 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 5\\
  \end{matrix}
  )\]`

> **Possibility 3** _(Cycle Notation)_: 
The third possibility focuses on the effect of successively applying the permutation. In this context, a permutation is equivalent to a set of **cycles**, i.e. ordered partitions `\(C\)` on the set `\(I\)` such that the permutation `\(\pi\)` does not changes the order and composition of the partitions. In the previous example `$[1,7,2,8],$` `$[3,6],$` `$[4 ],$` `$[5,9]$` are [cycles][bookofproofs$8434], so 
`\[\pi=\{C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_k\}~~~~~~~~~~~~\text{e.g. for }n=9:~~~~\{[1,7,2,8], [3,6], [^4], [5,9]\}\]`
