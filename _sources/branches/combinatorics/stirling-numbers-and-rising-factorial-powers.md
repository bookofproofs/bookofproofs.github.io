The following lemma shows that formulas involving [Stirling numbers][bookofproofs$8425] of the first and second kind and [factorial powers][bookofproofs$1399] can be easily transformed into each other.

---

From the definition of [Stirling numbers of the first and second kind][bookofproofs$8425] that uses the [falling factorial powers][bookofproofs$1399] it follows for the [rising factorial powers][bookofproofs$1399].
`$$x^\overline{n}= \sum_{r=1}^n\left[\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right]x^r$$`

and

`$$x^{n}= \sum_{r=1}^n\left\{\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right\}(-1)^{n-k}x^\overline{r}$$`

for all natural numbers `$n\ge 1.$`
