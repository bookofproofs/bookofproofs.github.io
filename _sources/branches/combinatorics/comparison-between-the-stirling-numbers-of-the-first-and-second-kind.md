The [Stirling numbers of the first and the second kind][bookofproofs$8425] obey the following inequality:

`$$\left[\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right]\ge \left\{\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right\},\quad n,r\ge 0.$$`
Equality holds for `$r=n$` and for `$r=n-1,$` in particular `$$\left[\begin{array}{c}n\\n\end{array}\right]=\left\{\begin{array}{c}n\\n\end{array}\right\}=1,\quad \left[\begin{array}{c}n\\n-1\end{array}\right]=\left\{\begin{array}{c}n\\n-1\end{array}\right\}=\binom n{2}=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.$$`
