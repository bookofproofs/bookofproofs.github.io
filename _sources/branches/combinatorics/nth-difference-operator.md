Let `$f:D\to\mathbb R$` be a [function][bookofproofs$592] with `$D\subseteq\mathbb R$` and let `$n\in\mathbb N,$` `$x, x+1,\ldots, x+n\in D.$` The recursively defined **nth** [difference operator][bookofproofs$8408] `$$\Delta^n f(x):=\Delta(\Delta^{n-1}f(x))$$` can be calculated explicitely using the [binomial coefficients][bookofproofs$993] as follows:

`$$\Delta^n f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n f(x+k)\cdot (-1)^{n-k}\cdot\binom nk.$$`
