The following are examples of functions and their [antidifferences][bookofproofs$8506]. The examples show that the methods of difference calculus give us new and powerful methods to find closed formulas for many [sums][bookofproofs$261].
#1 For `$n\neq -1$` and the sum of [falling factorial powers][bookofproofs$1399] `$$\sum x^{\underline{n}}=\frac{x^{\underline{n+1}}}{n+1}.$$`
#2 For `$a\neq 1$` (in analogy to the formula for the [sum of geometric progression][bookofproofs$6627]) `$$\sum a^x=\frac{a^x}{a-1}.$$`
#3 `$$\sum 2^x=2^x.$$`
#4 For `$a\neq 2n\pi$` `$$\sum\sin(ax)=-\frac{\cos(a(x-1/2))}{2\sin(a/2)}.$$`
#5 For `$a\neq 2n\pi$` `$$\sum\cos(ax)=\frac{\sin(a(x-1/2))}{2\sin(a/2)}.$$`
#5 For `$a\neq 2n\pi$` `$$\sum\cos(ax)=\frac{\sin(a(x-1/2))}{2\sin(a/2)}.$$`
