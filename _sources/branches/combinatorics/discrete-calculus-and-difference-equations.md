This part is dedicated to the so-called _discrete calculus_, sometimes also called the calculus of _finite differences_. This is a subject providing methods for solving difference equations. As opposed to [differential equations][bookofproofs$74], difference equations are useful as a mathematical representation for certain physical problems.

The purpose of this part is to develop a calculus of "differences" and a "sums", in analogy to the calculus of 
[derivatives][bookofproofs$1370] and [Riemann integrals][bookofproofs$1763].
