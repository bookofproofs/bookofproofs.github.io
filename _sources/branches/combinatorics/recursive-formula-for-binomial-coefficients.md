The [binomial coefficient][bookofproofs$993] `\(\binom nk\)` can be for `\(k,n\in\mathbb N\)`, `\(n\ge 1\)`, `\(n\ge k\)` calculated using the following recursive formula:

`\[\binom nk=\binom {n-1}{k-1} + \binom {n-1}{k}.\]`

We have the special cases 

> `\(\binom n0=1\)` for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` and

> `\(\binom nn=1\)` for all `\(n\in\mathbb N\)`.
