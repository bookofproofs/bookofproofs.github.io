Assume, there are `\(n\)` objects of `\(m\)` different types. Assume, in addition, there are exactly `\(k_i\)` indistinguishable objects of each type, i.e. `\(k_1+k_2+\ldots+k_m=n.\)` Then the number of possible and distinguishable arrangements of the `\(n\)` objects is given by the **multinomial coefficient**

`\[\binom n{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m}:=\frac{n !}{k_1 !k_2 !\cdot\ldots \cdot k_m !}.\]`
