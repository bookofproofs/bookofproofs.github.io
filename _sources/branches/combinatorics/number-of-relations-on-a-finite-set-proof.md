According to the [definition of relation][bookofproofs$571] on a set `\(V\)` a relation `\(R\)` is any subset of the Cartesian product `\(R\subseteq V\times V\)`.

According to the [fundamental counting principle][bookofproofs$111] the cardinality of the Cartesian product is `\(|V\times V|=n^2\)`, if `\(V\)` is finite a [finite set][bookofproofs$985] with `\(|V|=n\)`. In particular, the set `\(V\times V\)` is finite.



It follows from the [number of subsets of a given finite set][bookofproofs$998] that

`\[|R\subseteq V\times V|=2^{n^2}.\]`
