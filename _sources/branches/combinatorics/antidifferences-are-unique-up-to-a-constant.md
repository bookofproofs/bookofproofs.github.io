If the [indefinite sum][bookofproofs$8506] `$\sum f(x)$` exists, then it is unique, except a **periodic constant**, i.e. a [complex-valued][bookofproofs$216] [function][bookofproofs$592] `$P:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$` with the property `$P(x+1)=P.$` 

In other words, every indefinite sum in the form `$$F(x)=\sum f(x)+P(x)$$` is unique.

### Notes

* This proposition is stated analogously to the proposition about [antiderivatives are unique up to a constant][bookofproofs$6806].
* Thus, the periodic constant `$P(x)$` plays the same role for the indefinite sum as the "constant" plays for the integral.
