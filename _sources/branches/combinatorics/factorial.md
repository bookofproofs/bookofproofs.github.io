It follows from the definition of [permutations][bookofproofs$188] that the number of different ordered arrangements the elements of a finite set `\(V\)` with `\(|V|=n\)`, `\(n\ge 1, n\in\mathbb N\)` is given by the **factorial** `\(n!\)`, which is defined as the [product][bookofproofs$8599].
`\[n!:=n\cdot (n-1)\cdot (n-2)\cdot\ldots\cdot 2\cdot 1.\]`

For `\(V=\emptyset\)` we have `\(|V|=0\)` and set

`\[0!:=1.\]`
