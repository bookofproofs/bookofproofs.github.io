### Example 1

The number of words, which can be created out of the letters of the word MISSISSIPPI is

`\[\frac{11 ! }{4 ! 4 ! 2 ! 1 !}=34,650\]`

One of such words (without any meaning) could be SIPISMSIPIS.

### Example 2

The [binomial coefficient][bookofproofs$993] is a special case of the multinomial coefficient, since 

`\[\binom nk=\binom n{k,n-k}=\frac{n ! }{k !\cdot (n-k) ! }.\]`

### Example 3

The coefficient of the term `\(x^2y^3z^5\)` by calculating `\((x +y +z)^{10}\)` is

`\[\binom {10}{2,3,5}=\frac{10 ! }{2 ! 3 ! 5 !}=2520.\]`
