Let `$n,m\ge 0$` be [integers][bookofproofs$844]. The [Stirling numbers of the first and second kind][bookofproofs$8425] obey the following **inversion formulas**:

`$$\begin{align}
\sum_{k=0}^\infty \left[\begin{array}{c}n\\k\end{array}\right]\left\{\begin{array}{c}k\\m\end{array}\right\}(-1)^{n-k}&=[m=n]\nonumber,\\
\sum_{k=0}^\infty \left\{\begin{array}{c}n\\k\end{array}\right\}\left[\begin{array}{c}k\\m\end{array}\right](-1)^{n-k}&=[m=n]\nonumber.
\end{align}$$`
Above, the [Iverson notation][bookofproofs$261] `$[m=n]$` is used and means that the sums equal `$1$` if and only if `$m=n$`, otherwise they equal `$0.$` Please note that the above sums are, in fact, finite, since all summands are `$0$` if the index `$k$` is above `$\min(m,n)$`.
