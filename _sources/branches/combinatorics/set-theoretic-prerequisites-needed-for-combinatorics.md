In this part, we will recap some basic results from [set theory][bookofproofs$27], which are necessary to really understand combinatorics. First of all, please check if you are already acquainted with the following results:

* [basics about sets][bookofproofs$65], including the concepts of a [set][bookofproofs$550], [subsets and supersets][bookofproofs$552], [set operations][bookofproofs$7986] and [power set][bookofproofs$6831],
* [functions][bookofproofs$64], including their [definition][bookofproofs$592], and most important [properties][bookofproofs$190],
* [equivalence relations][bookofproofs$574] and [partitions][bookofproofs$7991],
* [cardinalities][bookofproofs$980], definitions of [finite and infinite][bookofproofs$985] sets, and [simple facts about cardinals][bookofproofs$277],
* [ordered pairs][bookofproofs$747] and [Cartesian product][bookofproofs$748],
* [proving principle by induction][bookofproofs$657].
These basics are important for combinatorics because almost all combinatorial results can be derived from them.
