Every [factorial polynomial][bookofproofs$8418] equals some [usual" "polynomial][bookofproofs$252], i.e. if `$$\phi(x)=a_nx^{\underline{n}}+a_{n-1}x^{\underline{n-1}}+\ldots+a_1x^{\underline{1}}+a_0,\quad a_n\neq 0$$` is a factorial polynomial of degree `$n$` then there are `$b_n,\ldots,b_0\in C,$` such that `$$\phi(x)=b_{n}x^{n}+b_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots+b_{1}x+b_0,\quad b_n\neq 0$$`
and vice versa.
