Let `\(A\)` be a [finite (or infinite) set][bookofproofs$985] with at least `\(n\)` elements. A **combination** `\(C_k\)` of size `\(0\le k \le n\)` is a [subset][bookofproofs$986] of a `\(A\)` with exactly `\(k\)` elements. 

A combination can be generated by selecting elements of `\(A\)` and moving them from the set `\(A\)` into the set `\(C_k\)` `\(k\)` times:

`\[\begin{array}{rcll}
\text{initial situation}& : & C_0=\{\}&A_0=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\}\\
\text{first selection} & : & C_1:=\{a_{i_1}\}&A_1:=A_0\setminus\{a_{i_1}\}\\ 
\text{second selection} & : & C_2:=\{a_{i_1},a_{i_2}\}&A_2:=A_0\setminus\{a_{i_1},a_{i_2}\}\\ 
&\vdots&\\
k\text{-th selection} & : & C_k:=\{a_{i_1},a_{i_2},\ldots,a_{i_k}\}&A_k:=A_0\setminus\{a_{i_1},a_{i_2},\ldots,a_{i_k}\}\\ 
\end{array}\]`

Unlike in a [permutation][bookofproofs$188], the order of selection of elements does not matter (because the order of the elements of a set does not matter).
