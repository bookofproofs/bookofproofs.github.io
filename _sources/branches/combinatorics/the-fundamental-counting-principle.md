Let `\(S\)` be a  [Cartesian product][bookofproofs$748] of a finitely many [finite sets][bookofproofs$985] `\[S=S_1\times S_2\times \ldots \times S_n.\]` Then the [cardinality][bookofproofs$980]  of the set `\(S\)` is given by the product of cardinalities of its subsets. `\[|S|=\prod_{i=1}^n |S_i|.\]`
