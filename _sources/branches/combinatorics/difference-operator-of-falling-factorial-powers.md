The [falling factorial powers][bookofproofs$1399] allow together with the [difference operator][bookofproofs$8408] a similarly simple compact expression as the [nth powers under differentiation][bookofproofs$6755].

Let `$x\in \mathbb C$` be a [complex number][bookofproofs$6788]. Then the [difference operator][bookofproofs$8408] of the [falling factorial power][bookofproofs$1618] `$x^{\underline n}$` equals

`$$\Delta x^{\underline n}=nx^{\underline {n-1}}$$` for all [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$n\in\mathbb Z.$` If `$n\le 0$`, we also require `$x\not\in\{1,2,\ldots,|n|,|n|+1\}.$`
