A **cycle** `$[a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n]$` is an arrangement of `$n$` objects such that it "wraps around" because it is joined to its beginning, more formally `$$\begin{align}[a_1,a_2,a_3\ldots,a_{n-1},a_{n}]
&=[a_2,a_3\ldots,a_{n-1},a_{n},a_1]\nonumber\\
&=[a_3,a_4\ldots,a_{n-1},a_{n},a_1,a_2]\nonumber\\
&\vdots\nonumber\\
&=[a_{n},a_1,a_2\ldots,a_{n-2},a_{n-1}]\nonumber\end{align}$$`
