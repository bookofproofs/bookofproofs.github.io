In analogy to the [indefinite integral][bookofproofs$1768] being the inverse operator to the [derivative][bookofproofs$1370], we now define a similar concept for the [difference operator][bookofproofs$8408].

For a given [complex-valued][bookofproofs$216] [function][bookofproofs$592] `$F:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$`, let the function `$f:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$`  be defined by the [difference operator][bookofproofs$8408] `$$f(x):=\Delta F(x).$$`

The **indefinite sum** is the operation `$$\sum f(x):=\Delta^{-1}f(x)=F(x).$$` Because of this property, the function `$F$` is also called the **antidifference** of `$f.$`
