According to a [result proven][bookofproofs$8419] in the last part, any [factorial polynomial][bookofproofs$8418] of the `$n$`th degree can be expressed as a usual [polynomial][bookofproofs$252] of the `$n$`th degree and vice versa.

The coefficients occurring when stating this result for the simplest factorial polynomial `$x^\underline{n}$` and the simplest polynomial `$x^n$` of the `$n$`th degree. Because of their interesting properties, those coefficients deserve the following separate definition.

Let `$n\ge 1$` and `$x^\underline{n}$` be a [factorial polynomial][bookofproofs$8418] of the `$n$`th degree and let `$x^n$` be a [polynomial][bookofproofs$252] of the `$n$`th degree. 

The coefficients `$\left[\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right]$` and `$\left\{\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right\}$` occurring in the [linear combinations][bookofproofs$1035].
`$$x^\underline{n}= \sum_{r=1}^n\left[\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right](-1)^{n-r}x^r$$` 
and
`$$x^{n}= \sum_{r=1}^n\left\{\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right\}x^\underline{r}$$` 

are [uniquely determined][bookofproofs$8421] when [expressing factorial polynomials via polynomials and vice versa][bookofproofs$8419].
 `$\left[\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right]$` are called **Stirling numbers of the first kind** and `$\left\{\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right\}$` are called **Stirling numbers of the second kind**.
