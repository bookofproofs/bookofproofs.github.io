Let `$n\ge 0$` be a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `$a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n\in\mathbb C$` be [complex numbers][bookofproofs$216]. A *factorial polynomial of degree `$n$`* is a [function][bookofproofs$592]  `$\phi:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$` defined using the [falling factorial powers][bookofproofs$1399] by `$$\phi(x)=a_nx^{\underline{n}}+a_{n-1}x^{\underline{n-1}}+\ldots+a_1x^{\underline{1}}+a_0$$` for some `$a_n\neq 0.$`
