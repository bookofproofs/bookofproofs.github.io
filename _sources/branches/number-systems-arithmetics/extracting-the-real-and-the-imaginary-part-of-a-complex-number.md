Let `\(z\in\mathbb C\)` be a [complex number][bookofproofs$216]. Because by definition
`\[z:=\Re(z) + \Im (z) i\]`
and because from the [definition of complex conjugate][bookofproofs$1245] we have that
`\[ z^*:=\Re(z) - \Im (z) i,\]`
it follows (by adding or subtracting both equations) that 

`\[\Re(z)=\frac 12(z+ z^*)\]`
and that
`\[\Im(z)=\frac 1{2i}(z- z^*).\]`
