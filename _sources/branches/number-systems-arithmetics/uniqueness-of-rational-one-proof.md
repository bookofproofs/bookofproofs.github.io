* By the [existence of rational one][bookofproofs$1482], we have `$x=x\cdot 1$` all `$x\in\mathbb Q\quad ( * ).$`
* Suppose, `\(1^{\ast}\)` is any (other) [rational number][bookofproofs$1105], for which `$x=x\cdot 1^{\ast}$` all `$x\in\mathbb Q\quad ( * * ).$`
* By `$( * )$`, we have `$1^{\ast}=1^{\ast}\cdot 1.$`
* Since the [multiplication of rational numbers is commutative][bookofproofs$1478], we get `$1^{\ast}=1\cdot 1^{\ast}.$`
* By `$( * * )$` we get `$1^{\ast}=1.$`
* Thus, the [rational number one][bookofproofs$1482] `$1$` is unique.
