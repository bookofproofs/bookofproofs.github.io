* For a given [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`, let `\(y\)` be _any_ real number with 
\begin{align}
x+y=0. \label{eq:60}\\ 
\end{align}
* Using the [existence of negative numbers][bookofproofs$35], we can add to both sides of the equation the number `\((-x)\)` _from the left side_, resulting in `$$(-x)+(x+y)=(-x) + 0.$$`
* From the [existence of zero][bookofproofs$34] and [associative law of addition][bookofproofs$31], it follows that `$$((-x)+x)+y=(-x)+0.$$`
* This leads to the equation `$$0 + y=(-x).$$`
* Using the [existence of zero][bookofproofs$34] once again, we find that `$y=(-x).$`
* By applying the [commutative law of addition][bookofproofs$33], we get the same result, if we add `\((-x)\)` to both sides of the equation \eqref{eq:60} _from the right side_.
* Thus, the there is only one such [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `$y$` for which `$x + y=0$`, namely `$y=-x$`.
* Therefore, negative real numbers are unique.
