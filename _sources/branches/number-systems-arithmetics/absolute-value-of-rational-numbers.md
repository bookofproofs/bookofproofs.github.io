Let `\(\frac ab\in \mathbb Q\)`. Based on the [order relation for rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076], we can define the **absolute value** of `\(q\)` as a [function][bookofproofs$592] `\(|~|:\mathbb Q\mapsto\mathbb Q_+\)`

`\[\left|\frac ab\right| :=
\begin{cases}
\frac ab  & \text{ if } \frac ab \ge 0 \\
-\frac ab  & \text{ if } \frac ab  < 0.
\end{cases}\]`
