The [set of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033] `\(\mathbb Q\)`, together with the [specific addition operation][bookofproofs$1446] 
"`\(+\)`" is a [commutative group][bookofproofs$553]. This is because:

1. The [addition operation is associative][bookofproofs$1447], i.e. `\((x+y)+z=x+(y+z)\)` is valid for all `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb Q\)`.
1. We have [shown the existence of a neutral element of addition][bookofproofs$1473] - the number `\(0\in\mathbb Q\)`, i.e. such that `\(0+x=x\)` for all `\(x\in\mathbb Q\)`.
1. For every `\(x\in\mathbb Q\)`, there [there exists an inverse rational number][bookofproofs$1509] `\(-x\in\mathbb Q\)`, such that `\(x+(-x)=0\)`.
1. For every `\(x\in\mathbb Q\)`, there [there exists an inverse rational number][bookofproofs$1509] `\(-x\in\mathbb Q\)`, such that `\(x+(-x)=0\)`.
