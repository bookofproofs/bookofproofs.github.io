In this chapter, we derive some useful formulas involving [complex numbers][bookofproofs$216] which go beyond simple arithmetic operations. In particular, we will derive some properties of the [complex absolute value][bookofproofs$1247] and the [real and imaginary parts][bookofproofs$216]. Moreover, we will show that, although the [complex numbers are an extension of the real numbers][bookofproofs$1243], they cannot be ordered like it was the case for the [order relation of real numbers][bookofproofs$1107].
