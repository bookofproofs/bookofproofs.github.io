Note that `\((M, \cdot )\)` is not empty, since it contains the [Cauchy sequence of rational ones][bookofproofs$1482]. It has also already been shown that set `\(M\)` is [closed under the multiplication of two rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1488]. It remains to be shown that `\((M, + )\)` is a commutative monoid, which we will do by demonstrating [all properties of a commutative monoid][bookofproofs$706]:

> `\((i)\)` It has been proven that the [multiplication of rational Cauchy sequences is associative][bookofproofs$1500].
> `\((ii)\)` It has been shown that the [multiplication of rational Cauchy sequences is commutative][bookofproofs$1502].
> `\((iii)\)` It has been shown that the sequence `\((1)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` (i.e. consisting of rational ones only) is a [rational Cauchy sequence and neutral with respect to the multiplication of rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1504].
This completes the proof.
