Let `\(N\)` be a set fulfilling the following axioms:

1. **P1**: `\(N\)` contains the element `\(0\)`.
1. **P2**: For each element `\(n\in N\)` there exists a unique element `\(n^+\)`, the so-called **successor of n**[^1].
1. **P3**: There is no element `\(n\in N\)` such that `\(n^+=0\)` (i.e. `\(0\)` is not a successor of any element of `\(N\)`).
1. **P4**: If two elements `\(n,~m\in N\)` have the same successors `\(n^+=m^+\)` then they are the same `\(n=m\)`.
1. **P5**: If a subset `\(A\subset N\)` contains the element `\(0\)` and with each element `\(n\)` contained in it it also contains the successor `\(n^+\)`, then `\(A\)` must be the set `\(N\)` (principle of induction).

[^1]: In **P2** we denote `\(n\)` the **predecessor** of `\(n^+\)`.
