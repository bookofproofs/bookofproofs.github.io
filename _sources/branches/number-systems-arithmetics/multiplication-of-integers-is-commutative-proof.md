* By the [definition of integers][bookofproofs$844], the integers `\(x,y \in \mathbb Z\)` are identified by pairs `\(x:=[a,b]\)`, `\(y:=[c,d]\)` of natural numbers `\(a,b,c,d\in\mathbb N\)`. 
* We have, therefore, `$x\cdot y:=[a,b] \cdot [c,d].$`
* `$=[ac + bd,~ ad + bc],$` by [definition of integer multiplication][bookofproofs$891].
* `$=[ca + db,~ da + cb],$` because [multiplying natural numbers is commutative][bookofproofs$1435].
* `$=[ca + db,~ cb + da],$` because [adding natural numbers is commutative][bookofproofs$1430].
* `$=[c,d]\cdot [a,b]$`  by [definition of integer multiplication][bookofproofs$891].
* `$=y\cdot x$` by [definition of integers][bookofproofs$844].
