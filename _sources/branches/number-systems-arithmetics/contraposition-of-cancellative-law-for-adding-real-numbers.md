If any two [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] are [unequal][bookofproofs$1539]  `\(x\neq y\)`, then the inequality is preserved, if and only if we add an arbitrary real number `\(z\)` to both sides of the inequality, formally: `\[x \neq y\Longleftrightarrow \begin{cases} z + x\neq z + y,&\text{or}\\
x + z\neq y + z.
\end{cases}\]`
