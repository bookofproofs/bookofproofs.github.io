Any real number `\(x\in\mathbb R\)` [is by the corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$1105] an [equivalence class][bookofproofs$574] `\(x:=(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I,\)` where `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` denotes a [rational Cauchy sequence][bookofproofs$1485] representing the real number `\(x\)`, and where `\(I\)` denotes the set of all rational sequences, which converge to `\(0\)`. 

Given two real numbers `\(x=(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+ I\)` and `\(y=(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+ I\)`, the **addition of real numbers** is defined by

`\[\begin{array}{rcccl}
x+y&:=&(x_n+y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+ I,
\end{array}\]`

where the result is the real number `\((x_n  + y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+ I \)`, called the **sum** of the real numbers `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`. The sum exists and is well-defined, i.e. it does not depend on the specific representatives `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and  `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` of `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`.
