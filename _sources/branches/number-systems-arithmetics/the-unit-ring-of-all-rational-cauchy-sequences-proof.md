We want to prove that the set of all [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485].
`\[M:=\{(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}~|~(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\text{ is a rational Cauchy sequence}\},\]`
together with the [addition][bookofproofs$1486] and the [multiplication of rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1488] defined for `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N},(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\in M\)` as:
`\[\begin{array}{cclcl}
(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&:=&(a_n+b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\quad\quad&\text{"addition"}\\
(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&:=&(a_n\cdot b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\quad\quad&\text{"multiplication"}\\
\end{array}\]`
forms the [commutative unit ring][bookofproofs$880] `\((M, + ,\cdot)\)`. We prove this lemma in five steps. For simplicity reasons, we write for each rational Cauchy sequence `\((a_n)\)` instead of `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`.

> `\((1)\)` It has been demonstrated that `\((M,+)\)` is a [commutative group with respect to addition][bookofproofs$1518].
> `\((2)\)` It has been shown that set  `\((M,\cdot)\)` is a [commutative monoid with respect to multiplication][bookofproofs$1520].
> `\((3)\)` The distributivity laws hold for "`\( + \)`" and "`\(\cdot\)`" has been shown in the [corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$1506].
Altogether, we have proven that the resulting algebraic structure `\((M, + ,\cdot)\)` is a commutative unit ring, es required.
