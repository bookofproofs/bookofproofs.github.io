The [set of complex numbers][bookofproofs$216] `\(\mathbb C\)`, together with the [specific addition operation][bookofproofs$1657] "`\(+\)`", 
and the [specific multiplication operation][bookofproofs$1668] "`\(\cdot\)`", 
forms the algebraic structure `\((\mathbb C, + , \cdot)\)` of a [field][bookofproofs$557].
