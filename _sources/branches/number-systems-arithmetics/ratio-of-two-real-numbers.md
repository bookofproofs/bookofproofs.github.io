A **ratio** of two [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `\(a,b\)` with `\(b\neq 0\)` is denoted by `$\frac ab$` and defined as the [product][bookofproofs$1532] of the number `\(a\)` and the [inverse][bookofproofs$42] number `\(b^{-1},\)` formally

`$$\frac ab:=a\cdot b^{-1}.$$`

In other words, a ratio is the result of the [division of real numbers][bookofproofs$6635].
