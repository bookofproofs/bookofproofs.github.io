The set of all [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485].
`\[M:=\{(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}~|~(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\text{ is a rational Cauchy sequence}\},\]`

together with an addition operation defined for any rational Cauchy sequences `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N},(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\in M\)` by:
`\[\begin{array}{rcl}
(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&:=&(a_n+b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\\
\end{array}\]`

builds an algebraic structure `\((M, +)\)`, which is a [commutative group][bookofproofs$553].
