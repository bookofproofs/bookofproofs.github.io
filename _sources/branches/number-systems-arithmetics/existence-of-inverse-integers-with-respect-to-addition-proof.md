By [definition][bookofproofs$844], any integer `\(x\)` can be represented by two natural numbers `\(a,b\in\mathbb N\)` with `\(x=[a,b]\)`. By [definition of adding natural numbers][bookofproofs$842], `\(a+b\)` is the natural numbers we gain if we add the natural number `\(a\)` to the natural number `\(b\)`. By definition of [adding integers][bookofproofs$890] and applying the [commutativity law for adding natural numbers][bookofproofs$1430], we get

`\[\begin{array}{rcll}[a,b]+[b,a]&=&[a+b,b+a]&\text{by definition of adding integers}\\
&=&[a+b,a+b]&\text{by commutativity of adding natural numbers}\\
\end{array}\]`

Since the [integer zero][bookofproofs$1452] `\(0_{\in\mathbb Z}\)` can be represented by a pair of equal natural numbers: 
`\[0=0_{\in\mathbb Z}:=[h,h],\quad h\in\mathbb N,\]`
we can take `\(h:=a+b\)`, which completes the proof.
