Let `\(a,b,c,d\)` be [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] with `\(b\neq 0\)` and `\(d\neq 0\)`. Then the [ratios][bookofproofs$6634] `$\frac ab$` and `$\frac cd$` are [equal][bookofproofs$1539], if and only if the products `$ad$` and `$bc$` are equal, formally `$$\frac ab=\frac cd\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad ad=bc.$$`
