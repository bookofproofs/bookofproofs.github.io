* Because the [polar coordinates uniquely represent the complex numbers][bookofproofs$6750], it suffices to prove the given formula.
* Let `$z=r\exp(i\phi)$` and `$w=s\exp(i\psi)$` be two [complex numbers][bookofproofs$216].
* For their [product][bookofproofs$1668] it follows by the [additivity theorems for cosine and sine][bookofproofs$6730]:

`$$\begin{array}{rcl}z\cdot w&=&r\exp(i\phi)\cdot s\exp(i\psi)\\
&=&r(\cos(\phi)+i\sin(\phi))\cdot s(\cos(\psi)+i\sin(\psi))\\
&=& (r\cdot s)\cdot [\cos(\phi)\cdot\cos(\psi)+i\sin(\phi)\cdot\sin(\psi) + i\sin(\psi)\cos(\phi)-\sin(\phi)\sin(\psi)]\\
&=& (r\cdot s)\cdot [\cos(\phi+\psi)+i\sin(\phi+\psi)].
\end{array}$$`
