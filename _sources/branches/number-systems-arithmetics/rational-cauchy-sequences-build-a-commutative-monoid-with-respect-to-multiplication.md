The set of all [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485].
`\[M:=\{(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}~|~(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\text{ is a rational Cauchy sequence}\},\]`

together with an addition operation defined for any rational Cauchy sequences `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N},(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\in M\)` by:
`\[\begin{array}{rcl}
(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot (b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&:=&(a_n\cdot b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\\
\end{array}\]`

builds an algebraic structure `\((M, \cdot)\)`, which is a [commutative monoid][bookofproofs$706].
