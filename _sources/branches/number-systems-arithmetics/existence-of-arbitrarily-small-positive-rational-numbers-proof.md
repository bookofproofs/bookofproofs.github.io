If `\(\epsilon^{-1}\)` is a [positive real number][bookofproofs$1107], then it follows from the [corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$1340] that there exists a natural number `\(n\)` such that `\(n > \epsilon^{-1}\)`. The [rules of calculation with inequalities][bookofproofs$594] ensure the required result

`\[0 < \frac 1n < \epsilon.\]`
