For arbitrary [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `\(n,m,p\in\mathbb N\)` with the binary operations [addition][bookofproofs$842] "`\( + \)`" and [multiplication][bookofproofs$876] 
"`\(\cdot\)`", the following distributivity laws hold:

`\[\begin{array}{ccl}
(n+m)\cdot p&=&(n\cdot p)+(m\cdot p)\quad\quad\text{"right-distributivity property"},\\
p\cdot(n+m)&=&(p\cdot n)+(p\cdot m).\quad\quad\text{"left-distributivity property"}\\
\end{array}\]`
