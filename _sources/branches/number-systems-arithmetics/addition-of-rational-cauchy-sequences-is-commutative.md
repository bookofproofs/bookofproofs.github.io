The [addition of rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1446] is commutative, i.e. for any [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485] `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` the following  law is valid:

`\[(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}=(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}.\]`
