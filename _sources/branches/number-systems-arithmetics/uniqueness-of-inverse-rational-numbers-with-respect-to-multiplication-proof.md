* For a given [rational number][bookofproofs$1033] `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`, `\(x\neq 0\)`, let `\(y\)` be _any_ rational number with `$xy=1\label{E18324}\tag{1}.$`
* Applying the [existence of inverse rational numbers with respect to multiplication][bookofproofs$1649], we can multiply both sides of the equation by `\(x^{-1}\)` _from the left side_, resulting in `$x^{-1}(xy)=x^{-1}\cdot 1.$`
* From the [existence of rational one][bookofproofs$1482] and since the [multiplication of rational numbers is cancellative][bookofproofs$1480], it follows that `$x^{-1}(xy)=x^{-1}.$`
* Because the [multiplication of rational numbers is associative][bookofproofs$1476], it follows `$(x^{-1}x)y=x^{-1}.$`
* Applying the [existence of inverse rational numbers with respect to multiplication][bookofproofs$1649] once again leads to `$1\cdot y=x^{-1}.$`
* Using the [existence of rational one][bookofproofs$1482] once again, results in `$y=x^{-1}.$`
* Thus, the there is only one such [rational number][bookofproofs$1033] `$y$` for which `$x\cdot y=1$`, namely `$y=x^{-1}$`.
* Note that because the [multiplication of rational numbers is commutative][bookofproofs$1478], we would get the same result, if we multiplied both sides of the equation `$\eqref{E18324}$` _from the right side_ by `\(x^{-1}\)`.
