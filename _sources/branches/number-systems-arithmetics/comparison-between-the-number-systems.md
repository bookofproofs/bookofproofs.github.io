It is instructive to compare the algebraic, ordering and topologic properties of the different number systems. The following table summarizes the main results of this part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong> with respect to these questions:


Number system | Symbol | Examples | Algebraic Properties | Order Properties | Topological Properties
