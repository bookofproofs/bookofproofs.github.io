* By the [existence of real one][bookofproofs$40], we have `$x=x\cdot 1$` all `$x\in\mathbb R\quad ( * ).$`
* Suppose, `\(1^{\ast}\)` is any (other) [real number][bookofproofs$1105], for which `$x=x\cdot 1^{\ast}$` all `$x\in\mathbb R\quad ( * * ).$`
* By `$( * )$`, we have `$1^{\ast}=1^{\ast}\cdot 1.$`
* Applying the [commutativity law for multiplying real numbers][bookofproofs$38], we get `$1^{\ast}=1\cdot 1^{\ast}.$`
* By `$( * * )$` we get `$1^{\ast}=1.$`
* Thus, the [real number one][bookofproofs$40] `$1$` is unique.
