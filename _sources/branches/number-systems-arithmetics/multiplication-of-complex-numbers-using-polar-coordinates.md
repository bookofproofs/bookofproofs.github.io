If `$z=r\exp(i\phi)$` and `$w=s\exp(i\psi)$` are two [complex numbers][bookofproofs$216], then their [product][bookofproofs$1668] can be written as `$$z\cdot w=(r\cdot s)\cdot [\cos(\phi+\psi)+i\sin(\phi+\psi)].$$`

### Geometric Construction of the Multiplication of Complex Numbers

The [product][bookofproofs$1668] `$z\cdot w$` of two complex numbers `$z$` and `$w$` can be geometrically constructed as follows:

* Connect the points `$z$` and `$w$` with the origin of the [complex plane][bookofproofs$216] and measure the lengths `$r$` and `$s$` of the created segments `$(0,z)$` and `$(0,w)$`.
* Measure the angles `$\phi$` and `$\psi$` between the positive `$x$`-axis and the segments  `$(0,z)$` and `$(0,w)$`.
* Add the angles `$\phi + \psi$` and multiply the lengths `$r\cdot  s.$`
* Draw a circle with radius `$r\cdot s$` about the origin of the complex plane and draw a ray at the angle `$\phi+\psi$`.
* The intersection point between the circle and the ray that is drawn that way is the product of both complex numbers.
