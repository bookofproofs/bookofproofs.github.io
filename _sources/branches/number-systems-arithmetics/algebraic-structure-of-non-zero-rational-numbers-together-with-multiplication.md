Let `\(\mathbb Q^*\)` be the [set of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033] with the number [zero][bookofproofs$1473] being excluded, formally `\(\mathbb Q^*:=\mathbb Q\setminus\{0\}\)`. Together with the [specific multiplication operation][bookofproofs$1475] "`\(\cdot\)`", it forms the algebraic structure `\((\mathbb Q^*, \cdot)\)` of a [commutative group][bookofproofs$553].
