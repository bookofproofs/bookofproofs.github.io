The [multiplication of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1475] is [cancellative][bookofproofs$837], i.e. for all rational numbers `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb Q\)`, with `\(z\neq 0\)` the following laws (both) are fulfilled[^1]:


* **Left cancellation property**:
If the equation `\(z \cdot x=z \cdot y\)` holds, then it implies `\(x=y\)`.  

* **Right cancellation property**:
If the equation `\(x \cdot z=y \cdot z\)` holds, then it implies `\(x=y\)`.

Conversely, the equation `\(x=y\)` implies 

* `\(x\cdot z=y\cdot z\)` and 
* `\(z \cdot  x=z \cdot  y\)` 

for all `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb Q\)` with `\(z\neq 0\)`.


[^1]: Note that this proposition would be obviously wrong if we allow `\(z\)` to equal `\(0\)`, e.g. for `\(z=0, x=\frac 15, y=\frac 23\)` we would get `\(0\cdot \frac 15=0\cdot \frac 23\)`, but `\(\frac 15\neq \frac 23\)`.
