According to the [cancellation law for multiplying real numbers][bookofproofs$1575], we have for all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `\(x,y,a\in\mathbb R\)` with `\(z\neq 0\)`

`\[\begin{array}{rcl}z \cdot x=z \cdot y&\Longleftrightarrow &x=y,\\
x \cdot z=y \cdot z&\Longleftrightarrow& x=y.
\end{array}\]`
By virtue of the [proving principle by contraposition][bookofproofs$1330], it follows:
`\[x \neq y\Longleftrightarrow \begin{cases} z \cdot x\neq z \cdot y,\\
x \cdot z\neq y \cdot z,
\end{cases}\]`

i.e. if any two real numbers `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` are [unequal][bookofproofs$1539], then the inequality is preserved, if we multiply both sides of the inequality by an arbitrary real number `\(z\neq 0\)`. Conversely, if we have an inequality, in which both sides are multiplied by the same real number `\(z\neq 0\)`, then we can "cancel it out", and still preserve the inequality.
