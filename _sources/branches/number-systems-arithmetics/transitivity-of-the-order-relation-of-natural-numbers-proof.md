### `\( (i)\)` Proof of the transitivity law `\(x < y\wedge  y < z\Longrightarrow  x < z\)`.

Assume that for any [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb N\)`, the [order relations][bookofproofs$697] * `\(x < y\)` and `\(y < z\)` are fulfilled. Then there exist natural numbers `\(u\neq 0\)` and `\(v\neq 0\)` with `\(y=x+u\)` and `\(z=y+v\)`. From the [associativity of adding natural numbers][bookofproofs$1428], it follows

`\[z=y+v=(x+u)+v=x+(u+v).\]`
Since `\(u+v\neq 0\)`, it follows `\(x < z\)`.

### `\( (ii)\)` Proof of the transitivity law `\(x \le y\wedge  y \le z\Longrightarrow  x \le z\)`.

It follows from `\((i)\)` and the [transitivity of the equality relation][bookofproofs$1539] "`\(=\)`". 


### `\( (iii)\)` Proof of the transitivity law `\(x > y\wedge  y > z\Longrightarrow  x > z\)`.

Analogously to `\((i)\)`, there exist natural numbers `\(u\neq 0\)` and `\(v\neq 0\)` with `\(x=y+u\)` and `\(y=z+v\)`. From the [associativity of adding natural numbers][bookofproofs$1428], it follows

`\[x=y+u=(z+v)+u=z+(v+u).\]`
Since `\(v+u\neq 0\)`, it follows `\(x > z\)`.

### `\( (iv)\)` Proof of the transitivity law `\(x \ge y\wedge  y \ge z\Longrightarrow  x \ge z\)`.

It follows from `\((iii)\)` and the [transitivity of the equality relation][bookofproofs$1539] "`\(=\)`".
