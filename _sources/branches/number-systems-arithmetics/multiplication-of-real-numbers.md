According the [definition of real numbers][bookofproofs$1105], we can identify real numbers `\(x,y \in \mathbb R\)` with  [equivalence classes][bookofproofs$574] `\(x=(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+ I\)` and `\(y=(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+ I\)` for some [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485]   `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and  `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and where `\(I\)` denotes the set of all rational sequences, which converge to `\(0\)`. 

Based on the [multiplication of rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1488], we define a new  multiplication operation "`\( \cdot \)`" for all real numbers by setting 

`\[\begin{array}{ccl}
x\cdot y=((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I)\cdot ((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I)=(x_n \cdot y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I,
\end{array}
\]`

where `\((x_n \cdot y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I\)` is also a real number, called the **product** of the real numbers `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`. The product exists and is well-defined, i.e. it does not depend on the specific representatives `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and  `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`  of `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`.
