Since the [real numbers together with addition and multiplication form a field][bookofproofs$1638] (`\(\mathbb R,+,\cdot)\)` and the [complex numbers form a non-empty set][bookofproofs$1666], we can define the maps 

`\[
\cases{
\mathbb C\times \mathbb C\mapsto \mathbb C:x,y\mapsto x + y:=(a+c,b+d) Â & \text{(the vector addition)}\\
\mathbb R\times \mathbb C\mapsto \mathbb C:\alpha,x\mapsto \alpha \cdot x:=(\alpha \cdot a,\alpha \cdot b) & \text{(the scalar multiplication)}
}\]`

for any real number `\(\alpha\in\mathbb R\)` and any complex numbers `\(x,y\in\mathbb C\)`, [identified by some ordered pairs of real numbers][bookofproofs$216] `\(x:=(a,b)\)`, `\(y:=(c,d)\)`, `\(a,b,c,d\in\mathbb R\)`. Therefore, we can consider the complex numbers `\(\mathbb C\)` as a [vector space over the field][bookofproofs$560] `\(\mathbb R\)`.
