The following representations of rational numbers with respect to the position of the minus sign "`\( - \)`" are equivalent:

`\[\frac{-a}b=\frac a{-b},\quad\quad\frac {-a}{-b}=\frac ab,\quad\quad\frac {0}{-b}=\frac 0b.\]`

In particular, it makes sense to put the minus sign in front of the whole ratio:

`\[-\frac{a}b:=\frac{-a}b=\frac a{-b}.\]`

Moreover, we have `\(0=-0\)`: 

`\[0=\frac{0}b=-\frac{0}b=-0.\]`
