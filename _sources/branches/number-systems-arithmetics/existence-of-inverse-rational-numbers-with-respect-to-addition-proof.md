By [definition][bookofproofs$1033], any rational number `\(x\)` can be represented by two integers `\(a,b\in\mathbb Z\)` with `\(x=\frac ab\)` and `\(b\neq 0_{\in\mathbb Z}\)`, where the symbol `\(0_{\in\mathbb Z}\)` denotes the [integer zero][bookofproofs$1452]. By [definition of multiplying integers][bookofproofs$891], `\(ab\)` denotes the integer resulting [by multiplying][bookofproofs$6437] the integer `\(a\)` by the integer `\(b\)`. Note that there [exists an inverse integer][bookofproofs$1511] `\(-ab\)`, such that `\(ab + (-ab)=0_{\in\mathbb Z}\)`. By definition of [adding rational numbers][bookofproofs$1446], we get

`\[\frac ab+\frac{-a}b=\frac{ab+(-ab)}{b^2}=\frac {0_{\in\mathbb Z}}{b^2}.\]`

Since the [rational zero][bookofproofs$1473] `\(0_{\in\mathbb Q}\)` can be represented by the (integer) zero `\(0_{\in\mathbb Z}\)` and an arbitrary integer `\(d\neq 0\)`: 
`\[0=0_{\in\mathbb Q}:=\frac {0_{\in\mathbb Z}}{d},\quad d\in\mathbb Z\setminus\{0\},\]`
we can take `\(d:=b^2\)`, which completes the proof.
