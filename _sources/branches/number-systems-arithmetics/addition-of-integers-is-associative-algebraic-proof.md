From an algebraic point of view, the associativity of [integer addition][bookofproofs$890] follows immediately as a corollary from the fact that the algebraic structure of the set of integers `\(\mathbb Z\)`, together with the binary operation "`\( + \)`" has been [proven to form a group][bookofproofs$844]. The binary operation of any group is by definition associative (otherwise it would be not a group).
