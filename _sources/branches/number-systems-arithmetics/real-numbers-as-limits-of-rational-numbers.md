Instead of defining real numbers out of the blue simply postulating their existence and accepting their properties as axioms, like it is often done in literature, we prefer to construct them from [rational numbers][bookofproofs$125], which we have introduced in the previous part. In this chapter, we will prepare some technical prerequisites in order to do that. In particular, we want to show that _real numbers_ can be defined as [limits][bookofproofs$101] of certain [sequences][bookofproofs$874] of rational numbers, and that these limits not only exist but also are unique, even though the rational sequence tending to this sequence is replaced by another one. 

With this respect, we will find that _real numbers_ can be defined as [equivalence classes][bookofproofs$7990] of sequences of rational numbers tending to the same limit. The technical prerequisites required for this interpretation of _real numbers_ are _rational Cauchy sequences_, which we will introduce shortly. First, we start with explaining what _rational sequences_ are, then what _rational Cauchy sequences_ are and how we can add and multiply them with each other, in particular, that they form a [ring][bookofproofs$683]. Finally, we will show that _rational Cauchy sequences_ tending to `$0$` are an [ideal][bookofproofs$269] of this ring. This ideal will finally enable us to define _real numbers_.
