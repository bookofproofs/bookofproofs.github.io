Let `\(x,y\in\mathbb Q\)` be rational numbers, which by definition means that each rational number is an equivalence class of ordered pairs of integers represented by some integers `\(a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Z\)`, with `\(b\neq 0,d\neq 0\)`[^1]:

`\[\begin{array}{cc}x:=\frac ab,&y:=\frac cd.\end{array}\]`

In order to show the law 
`\[x\cdot y=y\cdot x\]`
we use the following mathematical definitions and concepts:
* [definition of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033].
* [definition of multiplying rational numbers][bookofproofs$1475], and
* [commutativity law for multiplying integers][bookofproofs$1448].
`\[\begin{array}{rcll}
x\cdot y&=&\frac ab\cdot \frac cd&\text{by definition of rational numbers}\\
&=&\frac {ac}{bd}& \text{by definition of multiplying rational numbers}\\
&=&\frac {ca}{db}& \text{by commutativity of multiplying integers}\\
&=&\frac cd\cdot \frac ab& \text{by definition of multiplying rational numbers}\\
&=&y\cdot x&\text{by definition of rational numbers}
\end{array}\]`

[^1]: Note that the symbol "`\(0\)`" denotes the zero defined for integers, and not the zero defined for rational numbers.
