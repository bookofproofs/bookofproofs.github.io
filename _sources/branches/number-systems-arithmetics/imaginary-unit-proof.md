We first verify that the [complex multiplication][bookofproofs$1668] of the complex number `\((0,1)\)` indeed equals `\((-1,0)\)`:

`\[(0,1)\cdot(0,1)=(0\cdot 0-1\cdot 1,0\cdot 1+1\cdot 0)=(-1,0).\]`
Because the [field of real numbers is embedded in the field of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1243], we can identify the complex number `\((-1,0)\)` with the real number `\(-1\)`. By setting 
`\[i:=(0,1)\in\mathbb C,\]`
we get 
`\[i^2=-1.\]`
