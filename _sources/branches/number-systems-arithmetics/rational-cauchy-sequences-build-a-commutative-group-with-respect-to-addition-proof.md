Note that `\((M, + )\)` is not empty, since it contains the [Cauchy sequence of rational zeros][bookofproofs$1498]. It has also already been shown that set `\(M\)` is [closed under the addition of two rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1486]. It remains to be shown that `\((M, + )\)` is a commutative group, which we will do by demonstrating [all properties of a commutative group][bookofproofs$553]:

1. It has been proven that the [addition of rational Cauchy sequences is associative][bookofproofs$1494].
2. It has been proven that the [addition of rational Cauchy sequences is commutative][bookofproofs$1496].
3. It has been shown that the sequence `\((0)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` (i.e. consisting of rational zeros only) is a [rational Cauchy sequence and neutral with respect to the addition of rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1498].
4. It has been shown that for the rational Cauchy sequence `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\in M\)` the [inverse element][bookofproofs$1508] of the addition "`\( + \)`" is the rational Cauchy sequence `\((-a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\in M\)`.

This completes the proof.
