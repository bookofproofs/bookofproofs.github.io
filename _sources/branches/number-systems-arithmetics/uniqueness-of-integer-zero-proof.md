We will show that the [integer number zero][bookofproofs$34] `\(0\)` is unique, i.e. there can be only one such number, for which

`\[x=x+0\text{ for all }x\in\mathbb Z\quad\quad ( * )\]`

Suppose, `\(0^{\ast}\)` is any (other) integer number, for which 

`\[x=x+0^{\ast}\text{ for all }x\in\mathbb Z\quad\quad ( * * )\]`

Applying the [commutativity law for adding integers][bookofproofs$1460], we get

`\[\begin{array}{rcll}
0^{\ast}&=&0^{\ast}+0&\text{ by }( * )\\
&=&0+0^{\ast}&\text{ by commutativity of adding integers}\\
&=&0&\text{ by }( * * )
\end{array}
\]`

Thus, both zeros are equal.
