The [set of complex numbers][bookofproofs$216] `\(\mathbb C\)`, together with the [specific addition operation][bookofproofs$1657] "`\(+\)`", and the [specific multiplication operation][bookofproofs$1668] "`\(\cdot\)`", forms the [field][bookofproofs$557] the algebraic structure `\((\mathbb C, + , \cdot)\)`. This is because:

1. We have [shown that][bookofproofs$1666] the set `\((\mathbb C, + )\)` is a commutative group.
1. We have [shown that][bookofproofs$1688] the set `\((\mathbb C^*, \cdot )\)` is a commutative group, in which `\(\mathbb C^*\)` denotes all non-zero complex numbers.
