Let `\((a,b),(c,d)\)` be [ordered pairs][bookofproofs$747] of [integers][bookofproofs$844], such that `\(b\)` and `\(d\)` do not equal the [integer number zero][bookofproofs$1452] `\(0\)`.  We consider the pairs `\((a,b),(c,d)\)` equivalent, if the [integer products][bookofproofs$891] `\(a\cdot d\)` and `\(b\cdot c\)` are equal, formally

`\[(a,b)\sim (c,d)\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad a\cdot d = b\cdot c.\]`

The relation "`\(\sim\)`" defined above is an [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574], i.e. for a given ordered pair `\((a,b)\in\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z\setminus\{0\}\)`, we can consider a whole set of ordered pairs `\((c,d)\in\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z\setminus\{0\}\)` equivalent to `\((a,b)\)`:

`\[x:=\{(c,d)\in\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z\setminus\{0\}:\quad( c, d )\sim ( a, b )\}\quad\quad ( * )\]`

The set[^1] `\(x\)` is called a **rational number**. We say that the ordered pair `\((a,b)\in\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z\setminus\{0\}\)` is **representing** the rational number `\(x\)`. It is called a **fraction** or a **ratio**. Usually, we denote the fraction `\((a,b)\)` by `\(\frac ab\)`. The integer `\(a\)` is called the **nominator** and the integer `\(b\)` is called the **denominator** of the fraction `\(\frac ab\)`. The set of all rational numbers is denoted by `\(\mathbb Q\)`.

A more common notation for the ordered pairs in `\( ( * ) \)` using ratios is

`\[x:=\left\{\frac cd: \quad \frac cd\sim \frac ab,~b,d\neq 0\right\}.\]`
 

[^1]: Please note that rational numbers are in fact sets. The set `\(\mathbb Q\)` is the set of "all fractions": the same rational number can be represented by different fractions, especially if we multiply the nominators and denominators by a non-zero integer, e.g. `\(\frac 12=\frac 24=\frac 5{10}=\ldots\)`. Since all these different fractions are equal, they represent the same rational number.
