Let `\((M , + , \cdot)\)` be the [commutative unit ring of all rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1101]. The set `\(I:=\{(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}~|~a_n\in\mathbb Q,\lim a_n=0\}\)` of all [rational sequences convergent][bookofproofs$1572] to `\(0\)` is an [ideal][bookofproofs$1062] of `\(M\)`, formally `\(I\lhd R\)`, which is equivalent to the following properties:

1. `\((I, +)\)` is a [subgroup][bookofproofs$554] of `\((M , +)\)`.
1. If we multiply a rational Cauchy sequence by a rational sequence convergent to `\(0\)` from the right, the product is convergent to `\(0\)`, formally `\[(c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\in M,~(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\in I\Longrightarrow (c_n\cdot a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\in I.\]`
