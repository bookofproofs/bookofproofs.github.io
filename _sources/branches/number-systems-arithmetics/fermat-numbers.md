The Fermat numbers are defined by 
`\[F_n:=2^{2^n}+1,\hspace{4em}(\text{for }n\ge 0)\]`

The sequence of Fermat numbers begins with `\(3\)`, `\(5\)`, `\(17\)`, `\(257\)`, `\(65537\)`, `\(4294967297\)`, ...

### Historical Notes

1640, "Fermat":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/pierre-de-fermat/ wrote a letter to "Fr√©nicle de Bessy":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/bernard-frenicle-de-bessy/ and stated in it a conjecture that `\(F_n\)` is prime for each `\(n\)`, which is true for `\(n\le 4\)`. 1732, Euler showed that `\(F_5=4294967297\)` is not prime since `\(641\mid F_5\)`.
