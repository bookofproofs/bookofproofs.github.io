If `\(K\)` and `\(L\)` are any [finite sets][bookofproofs$985] of [integers][bookofproofs$844], `\(k\in K\cup L\)`, and `\(a_k\in F\)` any elements of a given [field][bookofproofs$557] `\((F, +, \cdot)\)`, then

`\[\sum_{k\in K} a_k + \sum_{k\in L} a_k=\sum_{k\in K\cap L} a_k + \sum_{k\in K\cup L} a_k\]`
