Let `\(n\in \mathbb N\)` be a [natural number][bookofproofs$664], and let `\(n^+\)` denote the [successor][bookofproofs$504] of `\(n\)`. The **multiplication**  of natural numbers is a [map][bookofproofs$592] `\[\cdot:\mathbb N\mapsto\mathbb N\]` defined recursively as 
`\[\begin{array}{ccl}
n\cdot 0&:=&0\\
n\cdot m^+&:=&(n\cdot m) + n
\end{array}
\]`

The above definition explains the multiplication (denoted by "`\(\cdot\)`") in terms of the [addition operation of natural numbers][bookofproofs$842], denoted  by "`\( + \)`".


The number `\(n\cdot m\)` is called the **product** of the natural numbers `\(n\)` and `\(m\)`.
