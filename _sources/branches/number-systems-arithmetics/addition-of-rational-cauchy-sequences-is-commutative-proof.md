Let `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`  be [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485]. It follows from the [definition of adding rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1486] and from the [commutativity of adding rational numbers][bookofproofs$1469] that

`\[\begin{array}{ccll}
(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&=&(x_n+y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by definition of adding rational Cauchy sequences}\\
&=&(y_n+x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by commutativity of adding rational numbers}\\
&=&(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by definition of adding rational Cauchy sequences}\\
\end{array}\]`
