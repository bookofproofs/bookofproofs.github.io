The [set of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033] `\(\mathbb Q\)`, together with the [specific addition operation][bookofproofs$1446] 
"`\(+\)`", and the [specific multiplication operation][bookofproofs$1475] 
"`\(\cdot\)`", forms the [field][bookofproofs$557] the algebraic structure `\((\mathbb Q, + , \cdot)\)`. This is because:

1. We have [shown that][bookofproofs$1645] the set `\((\mathbb Q, + )\)` is a commutative group.
1. We have [shown that][bookofproofs$1646] the set `\((\mathbb Q^*, \cdot )\)` is a commutative group, in which `\(\mathbb Q^*\)` denotes all non-zero rational numbers.
