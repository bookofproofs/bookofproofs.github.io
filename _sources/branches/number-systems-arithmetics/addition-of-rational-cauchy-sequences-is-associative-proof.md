Let `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`, `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`  and `\((z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485]. It follows from the [definition of adding rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1486] and from the [associativity of adding rational numbers][bookofproofs$1447] that

`\[\begin{array}{ccll}
[(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}]+(z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&=&(x_n+y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by definition of adding rational Cauchy sequences}\\
&=&((x_n+y_n)+z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by definition of adding rational Cauchy sequences}\\
&=&(x_n+(y_n+z_n))_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by associativity of adding rational numbers}\\
&=&(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(y_n+z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by definition of adding rational Cauchy sequences}\\
&=&(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+[(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}]&\text{by definition of adding rational Cauchy sequences}\\
\end{array}\]`
