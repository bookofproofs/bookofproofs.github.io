The **irrational numbers** are the [set difference][bookofproofs$552] `$\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$` between the set of [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `$\mathbb R$` and the set of [rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033] `$\mathbb Q$`. 

Obviously, the set is not empty, since `$\sqrt 2\in\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$` due to [discovery of Ancient Greeks][bookofproofs$1096].
