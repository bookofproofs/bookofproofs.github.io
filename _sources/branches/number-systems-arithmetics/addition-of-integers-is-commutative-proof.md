* By [definition of integers][bookofproofs$844], the integers `$x,y\in Z$` are ordered pairs `$x=[a,b],y=[c,d]$` for some natural numbers `\(a,b,c,d\in\mathbb N\)`.
* Therefore, `$x+y=[a,b]+[c,d].$`
* `$=[a+c,b+d],$` by [definition of adding  integers][bookofproofs$890].
* `$=[c+a,d+b],$` due to [commutativity law for natural numbers][bookofproofs$1430].
* `$=[c,d]+[a,b],$` by [definition of adding  integers][bookofproofs$890].
* `$=y+x,$` by [definition of integers][bookofproofs$844].
