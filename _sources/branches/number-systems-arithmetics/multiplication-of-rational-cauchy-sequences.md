Let `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be two [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485]. The **multiplication of rational Cauchy Sequences** can be defined based on the [multiplication of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1475] as follows: 
`\[\begin{array}{cclc}
(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot (y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&:=&(x_n\cdot y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\\
\end{array}\]`
i.e. the product of two rational Cauchy sequences is a new rational sequence, whose sequence members are the products of rational numbers being the corresponding members of the original two rational Cauchy sequences. 

Moreover, the new rational sequence `\((x_n\cdot y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is also a rational Cauchy sequence.
