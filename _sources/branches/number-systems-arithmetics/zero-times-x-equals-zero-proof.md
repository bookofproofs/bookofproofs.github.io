* Let `$x$` be a [real number][bookofproofs$1105].
* We want to show that the [multiplication][bookofproofs$1532] of `$x$` by [zero][bookofproofs$43] results in zero, or `$0\cdot x=0.$`
   * From the [existence of zero][bookofproofs$43], it follows that `$0= 0 +0.$`
   * Multiplying this equation by `$x$` results by the [distributivity law][bookofproofs$520] in `$0x=0x + 0x.$`
   * On the other hand we have `$0x=0x + 0,$`  applying the [existence of zero][bookofproofs$43] once again.
   * Because of the [uniqueness of zero][bookofproofs$43], we can compare the last two equations.
   * This comparison results in `\(0x=0\)` for all `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`.
