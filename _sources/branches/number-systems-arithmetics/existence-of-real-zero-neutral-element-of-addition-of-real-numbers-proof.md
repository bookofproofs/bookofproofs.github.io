Note that since the [rational Cauchy sequence of zeros `\((0)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` exists][bookofproofs$1498], it is also true that the [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `\(0:=(0)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I\)` exists.  It remains to be shown that the real number `\(0\)` is neutral with respect to the [addition of real numbers][bookofproofs$1514]. Let `\(x=(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+I\)` be a real number. Because the rational Cauchy sequence `\((0)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` [is neutral with respect to the addition of rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1498], it follows that

`\[\begin{array}{ccll}
x+0&=&((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+I)+((0)_{n\in\mathbb N}+I)&\text{by definition of real numbers}\\
&=&((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(0)_{n\in\mathbb N})+I&\text{by definition of adding real numbers}\\
&=&(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+I&\text{because }(0)_{n\in\mathbb N}\text{ is neutral element of addition of rational Cauchy sequences}\\
&=&x&\text{by definition of real numbers}\\
\end{array}\]`

It remains to be shown that also the equation `\(0+x=x\)` holds for all `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`. It follows immediately from the [commutativity of adding real numbers][bookofproofs$33].
