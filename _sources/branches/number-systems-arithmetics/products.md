A **product** is an expression of the form `$a_1\cdot a_2\cdot\ldots\cdot a_n$` for a [finite][bookofproofs$985] number of elements. This can be also written more shortly using the `$\prod$` symbol:

`$$\prod_{i=1}^n a_i.$$`

If there are infinitely many number of elements we want to multiply, we write more generally `$$\prod_{i\in I} a_i,$$` where `$I$` is an arbitrary [index set][bookofproofs$6198].
