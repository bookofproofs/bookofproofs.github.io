For every [rational Cauchy Sequence][bookofproofs$1485] `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` there exists an **inverse rational Cauchy Sequence** `\((-x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` such that the [sum of both sequences][bookofproofs$1486] equals the [Cauchy sequence of rational zeros][bookofproofs$1498]:

`\[(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(-x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}=(0)_{n\in\mathbb N}.\]`
