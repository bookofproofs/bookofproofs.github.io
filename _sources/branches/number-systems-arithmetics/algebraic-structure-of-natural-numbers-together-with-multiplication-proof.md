The proof will consist of four steps:

### Step 1: Demonstrate that the [multiplication of natural numbers][bookofproofs$876] "`\( \cdot \)`" is associative.

This follows from the [corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$1434].
### Step 2: Demonstrate that the [multiplication of natural numbers][bookofproofs$876] "`\( \cdot \)`" is commutative.

This follows from the [corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$1435].
### Step 3: Demonstrate that `\( ( \mathbb N\setminus\{0\}, \cdot )\)` forms a [commutative monoid][bookofproofs$706].
* Step 1 shows that "`\( \cdot \)`" is associative, so `\( ( \mathbb N\setminus\{0\}, \cdot )\)`  forms a 
[semigroup][bookofproofs$660]. 
* Following the [definition of multiplication][bookofproofs$876], `\(n \cdot 1=1\cdot n=n\)`.
* Thus, the element `\(1\in\mathbb N\setminus\{0\}\)` is the identity element of this semigroup.
* Together with step 2, this shows that `\( ( \mathbb N\setminus\{0\}, \cdot )\)` forms a [commutative monoid][bookofproofs$706].

### Step 4: Show that `\( ( \mathbb N\setminus\{0\}, \cdot )\)` is cancellative.

This follows from the [corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$1440].


These four steps show altogether that the set `\( ( \mathbb N\setminus\{0\}, \cdot )\)`, 
i.e. the set of [natural numbers][bookofproofs$664] without the element `\(0\)`, together with the [multiplication][bookofproofs$876] 
"`\( \cdot \)`" as a binary operation, forms a [cancellative][bookofproofs$837] [commutative monoid][bookofproofs$706].
