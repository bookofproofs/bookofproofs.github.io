The [multiplication][bookofproofs$1532] of [negative and positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] follows the following rules:

* A positive real number times a positive real number gives a positive real number, symbolically
`\[( + )\cdot ( + )=( + )\]`
* A negative real number times a positive real number gives a negative real number.
`\[( - )\cdot ( + )=( - )\]`
* A negative real number times a negative real number gives a positive real number.
`\[( - )\cdot ( - )=( + )\]`
* Zero times any real number gives zero.
`\[( 0 )\cdot ( \pm )=( 0 )\]`
