The following summation method can be used for sums of products and is due to 
[Niels Henrik Abel][bookofproofs$Abel] (1802 - 1829).

Let `$a_1,\ldots,a_n$` and `$b_1,\ldots,b_n,b_{n+1}$` be some given elements of a [unit ring][bookofproofs$683] `$(R,+,\cdot).$` Then it is possible to reformulate the sum `$\sum_{k=1}^n a_kb_k$` as follows: `$$\sum_{k=1}^n a_kb_k = A_nb_{n+1}+\sum_{k=1}^n A_k(b_k-b_{k+1})$$` with `$A_k:=\sum_{i=1}^k a_i.$`
