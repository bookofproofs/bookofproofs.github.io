Let `\(x\)` be a [complex number][bookofproofs$216] represented by the ordered pair of real numbers `\((a,b)\)`. Because there [exist inverse real number swith respect to the addition of real numbers][bookofproofs$35]  `\(-a\)` and `\(-b\)` , we can use them to define a new complex number

`\[-x:=(-a,-b).\]`

From the [definition of adding complex numbers][bookofproofs$1657], it follows 

`\[\begin{array}{rcll}
x+(-x)&=&(a,b)+(-a,-b)&\text{by definition of complex numbers}\\
&=&(a+(-a),b+(-b))&\text{by definition of adding complex numbers}\\
&=&(0,0)&\text{by existence of inverse real numbers with respect to addition}\\
&=&0&\text{by existence of complex zero}
\end{array}\]`

where `\(0\)` denotes the [complex zero][bookofproofs$1662], as required.
