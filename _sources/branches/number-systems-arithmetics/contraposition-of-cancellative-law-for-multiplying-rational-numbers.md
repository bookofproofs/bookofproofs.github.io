If any two [rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033] `\(x,y\)` are [unequal][bookofproofs$1539], then the inequality is preserved, if and only if we multiply both sides of the inequality by an arbitrary rational number `\(z\neq 0\)`:`\[x \neq y\Longleftrightarrow \begin{cases} z \cdot x\neq z \cdot y\\
x \cdot z\neq y \cdot z.
\end{cases}\]`
