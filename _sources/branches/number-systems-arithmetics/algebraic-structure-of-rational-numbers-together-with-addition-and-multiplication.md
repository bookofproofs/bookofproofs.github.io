The [set of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033] `\(\mathbb Q\)`, together with the [specific addition operation][bookofproofs$1446] 
"`\(+\)`", and the [specific multiplication operation][bookofproofs$1475] 
"`\(\cdot\)`", forms the algebraic structure `\((\mathbb Q, + , \cdot)\)` of a [field][bookofproofs$557].
