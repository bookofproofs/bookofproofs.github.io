The [set of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033] with the [number zero][bookofproofs$1473] `\(0\)` excluded, denoted by `\(\mathbb Q^*\)`, together with the [specific multiplication operation][bookofproofs$1475] 
"`\(\cdot\)`" is a [commutative group][bookofproofs$553]. This is because:

1. The [multiplication operation is associative][bookofproofs$1476], i.e. `\((x\cdot y)\cdot z=x\cdot (y\cdot z)\)` is valid for all `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb Q^*\)`.
1. We have [shown the existence of a neutral element of multiplication][bookofproofs$1482] - the number `\(1\in\mathbb Q^*\)`, i.e. such that `\(1\cdot x=x\)` for all `\(x\in\mathbb Q^*\)`.
1. For every `\(x\in\mathbb Q^*\)`, there [there exists an inverse rational number][bookofproofs$1649] `\(x^{-1}\in\mathbb Q^*\)`, such that `\(x\cdot x^{-1}=1\)`.
1. For every `\(x\in\mathbb Q^*\)`, there [there exists an inverse rational number][bookofproofs$1649] `\(x^{-1}\in\mathbb Q^*\)`, such that `\(x\cdot x^{-1}=1\)`.
