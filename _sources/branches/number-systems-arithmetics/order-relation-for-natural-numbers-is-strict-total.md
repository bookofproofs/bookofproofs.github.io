The [order relation for natural numbers][bookofproofs$697] "`$<$`" defines a [strict total order][bookofproofs$576] on the set `$\mathbb N$` of [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718], i.e. for any natural numbers `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb N\)`, we have

* Only one of the following cases can be true: either `\(x=y\)`,  or `\(x > y\)`, or `\(x < y\)`  **trichotomy**).
* If `$x < y$` and `$y < z$`, then `$x < z$`  **transitivity**).
* The same applies for the relation "$ > $".
