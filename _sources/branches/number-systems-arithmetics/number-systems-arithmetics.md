_Number systems and arithmetics_ is a branch of mathematics dealing with a formal clarification of what _numbers_ are and in which domains numbers allow arithmetical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also describes how these domains can be extended in a step-by-step manner by certain structural properties to allow such operations.


### Theoretical minimum (in a nutshell)

* You should be acquainted with [set theory][bookofproofs$27], especially 
   * [set operations][bookofproofs$7986], 
   * [functions][bookofproofs$64], 
   * [order relations][bookofproofs$189], and
   * [countability][bookofproofs$772].
* For a deeper understanding, you should know some basic facts about 
   * algebraic structures, including [groups][bookofproofs$137], [integral domain][bookofproofs$821], and [fields][bookofproofs$557].
   * The topological concept of a [metric space][bookofproofs$617].
### Concepts you will learn in this part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>

* What are _natural numbers_, and how the can be defined using the axiomatic method?
* What are _integers_, how they can be defined using natural numbers and how they extend the calculating possibilities of natural numbers?
* What are _rational numbers_, how they can be defined using integers and how they extend the calculating possibilities of integers?
* What are _real numbers_, how they can be defined using rational numbers and how they extend the calculating possibilities of rational numbers?
* What are _complex numbers_, how they can be defined using real numbers and how they extend the calculating possibilities of real numbers?
* What are _quaternions_, how they can be defined using complex numbers and how they extend the calculating possibilities of complex numbers?
* What are the differences of the above domains, covering their _algebraic_, _topological_, and _order_ properties.
