Let `\(x,y,z,a,b\)` be (if nothing else is stated) arbitrary real numbers. The following rules are valid for manipulating inequalities:

1. `$x^2 > 0$` for all `\(x\neq 0\)`.
1. `\(1 > 0 \)`.
1. From `\(x > y\)` it follows that `\(x+a > y+a\)` for any `\(a\in\mathbb R\)`. (The rule is analogously valid and proven for any inequalities with "`\( < \)`" in between).
1. If `\(x > y\)` and `\(a > b\)`, then it follows that `\(x+a > y+b\)`. (The rule is analogously valid and proven for any inequalities with "`\( < \)`" in between).
1. Transitivity of the "`\( < \)`" (analogously the "`\( > \)`") relation
1. The inequality `\(x > y\)` does not change, if it is multiplied by any number `\(a > 0\)`, i.e. it is `\(ax > ay\)`.  (The rule is analogously valid and proven for an inequalities with "`\( < \)`" in between).
1. The inequality `\(x > y\)` changes, if it is multiplied by any number `\(a < 0\)`, i.e. it is `\(ax < ay\)`. (The rule is analogously valid and proven for an inequality with "`\( < \)`" in between, which then changes into "`\( > \)`").
1. If `\(x > 0\)`, then `\(x^{-1} > 0\)`.
1. If `\(x < 0\)`, then `\(x^{-1} < 0\)`.
1. If `\(y > x > 0\)`, then `\(x^{-1} > y^{-1} \)`. (The rule is analogously valid and proven for the inequality `\(0 < x < y\)`, resulting in `\(y^{-1} < x^{-1}\)`).
1. If `\(y > x > 0\)`, then `\(x^{-1} > y^{-1} \)`. (The rule is analogously valid and proven for the inequality `\(0 < x < y\)`, resulting in `\(y^{-1} < x^{-1}\)`).
