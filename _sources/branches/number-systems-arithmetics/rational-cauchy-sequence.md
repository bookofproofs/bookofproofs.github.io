Let `\((\mathbb Q,|~|)\)` be the [mectric space of all rational numbers][bookofproofs$1090],  together with the distance defined by the [absolute value][bookofproofs$1081] "`\(|~|\)`",
and let `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`  be a [sequence of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1484] in `\((\mathbb Q,|~|)\)`. 
The sequence `\((a_n)\)` is called a **rational Cauchy sequence**, if for all rational numbers `\(\epsilon > 0\)` there exists an index[^1] `\(N(\epsilon)\in\mathbb N\)` with
`\[|a_i-a_j| < \epsilon\quad\quad\text{ for all }i,j\ge N(\epsilon).\]`

[^1]: `\(N(\epsilon)\)` means that the natural number `\(N\)` depends only on the rational number `\(\epsilon\)`.
