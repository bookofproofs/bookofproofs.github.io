The [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] together with their [order relation][bookofproofs$697] `$(\mathbb N,\le)$` is a [well-ordered][bookofproofs$7997] set, i.e. each non-empty [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(M\subseteq\mathbb N\)` contains a unique [smallest][bookofproofs$7995] element `\(m_0 \le m\in M\)`.

### Strict order version:

The [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] together with their [order relation][bookofproofs$697] `$(\mathbb N, < )$` is a [well-ordered][bookofproofs$7997] set, i.e. each non-empty [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(M\subseteq\mathbb N\)` contains a unique [minimal][bookofproofs$7995] element `\(m_0 < m\in M\)`.
