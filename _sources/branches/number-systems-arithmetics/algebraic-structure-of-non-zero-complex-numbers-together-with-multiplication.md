Let `\(\mathbb C^*\)` be the [set of complex numbers][bookofproofs$216] with the number [zero][bookofproofs$1662] being excluded, formally `\(\mathbb C^*:=\mathbb C\setminus\{0\}\)`. 
Together with the [specific multiplication operation][bookofproofs$1668] "`\(\cdot\)`", it forms the algebraic structure `\((\mathbb C^*, \cdot)\)` of a 
[commutative group][bookofproofs$553].
