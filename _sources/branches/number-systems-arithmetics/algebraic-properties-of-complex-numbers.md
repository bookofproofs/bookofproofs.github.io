In this chapter, we will show, among others, how the [complex numbers][bookofproofs$216] together with their [addition][bookofproofs$1657] and [multiplication][bookofproofs$1668] form the algebraic structure of a [field][bookofproofs$557]. This will re-assure us that we can calculate with complex numbers just how we are used to calculating with [real numbers][bookofproofs$167]. Moreover, we will show that real numbers can be regarded as a special case of complex numbers, from the algebraic point of view.
