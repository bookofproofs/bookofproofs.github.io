The [multiplication][bookofproofs$1475] of [negative and positive rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076] follows the following rules:

* A positive rational number times a positive rational number gives a positive rational number, symbolically
`\[( + )\cdot ( + )=( + )\]`
* A negative rational number times a positive rational number gives a negative rational number.
`\[( - )\cdot ( + )=( - )\]`
* A negative rational number times a negative rational number gives a positive rational number.
`\[( - )\cdot ( - )=( + )\]`
* Zero times any rational number gives zero.
`\[( 0 )\cdot ( \pm )=( 0 )\]`
