The set of all [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485].
`\[M:=\{(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}~|~(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\text{ is a rational Cauchy sequence}\},\]`

together with the two operations defined for any two rational Cauchy sequences `\((a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N},(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\in M\)` as follows:
`\[\begin{array}{cclcl}
(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&:=&(a_n+b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\quad\quad&\text{"addition"}\\
(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&:=&(a_n\cdot b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\quad\quad&\text{"multiplication"}\\
\end{array}\]`

builds an algebraic structure `\((M, + ,\cdot)\)`, which is a [commutative unit ring][bookofproofs$880].
