The [multiplication of natural numbers][bookofproofs$876] is cancellative, if the number we want to "cancel out" does not equal `\(0\)`[^1], i.e. for all `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb N\)` with `\(z\neq 0\)` the following laws (both) are fulfilled:

* **Left cancellation property**:
If the equation `\(z \cdot x=z \cdot y\)` holds, then it implies `\(x=y\)`.  

* **Right cancellation property**:
If the equation `\(x \cdot  z=y \cdot  z\)` holds, then it implies `\(x=y\)`.

Conversely, the equation `\(x=y\)` implies 

* `\(x\cdot z=y\cdot z\)` and 
* `\(z \cdot  x=z \cdot  y\)` 

for all `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb N\)` with `\(z\neq 0\)`.

[^1]: Please note that if we allow `\(z=0\)`, then the proposition is wrong: e.g. `\(0\cdot 5=0\cdot 3\)`, but `\(5\neq 3\)`.
