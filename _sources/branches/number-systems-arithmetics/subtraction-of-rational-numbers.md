According to the [definition of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033], we can represent rational numbers `\(x,y\)` by two integers each, formally `\(x=\frac ab\)` and `\(y=\frac cd\)` for some integers `\(a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Z\)` with `\(b\neq 0\)` and `\(d\neq 0\)`. The  **subtraction of rational numbers**, written `\(x-y\)`, is defined as the [addition][bookofproofs$1446] of the first rational number `\(x\)` with the [inverse of the second rational number with respect to addition][bookofproofs$1509] `\((-y)\)`, formally
`\[x-y=\frac ab-\frac cd:=\frac ab+\frac {-c}d=\frac{ad-cb}{bd}=x+(-y).\]`
