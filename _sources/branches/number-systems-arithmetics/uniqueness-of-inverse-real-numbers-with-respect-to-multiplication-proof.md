* For a given [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`, `\(x\neq 0\)`, let `\(y\)` be _any_ real number with `$xy=1\label{E18322}\tag{1}.$`
* Applying the [existence of inverse real numbers with respect to multiplication][bookofproofs$42], we can multiply both sides of the equation by `\(x^{-1}\)` _from the left side_, resulting in `$x^{-1}(xy)=x^{-1}\cdot 1.$`
* From the [existence of real one][bookofproofs$40] and since the [multiplication of real numbers is cancellative][bookofproofs$1575], it follows that `$x^{-1}(xy)=x^{-1}.$`
* Because the [multiplication of real numbers is associative][bookofproofs$37], it follows `$(x^{-1}x)y=x^{-1}.$`
* Applying the [existence of inverse real numbers with respect to multiplication][bookofproofs$42] once again leads to `$1\cdot y=x^{-1}.$`
* Using the [existence of real one][bookofproofs$40] again, results in `$y=x^{-1}.$`
* Thus, the there is only one such [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `$y$` for which `$x\cdot y=1$`, namely `$y=x^{-1}$`.
* Note that because the [multiplication of real numbers is commutative][bookofproofs$38], we would get the same result, if we multiplied both sides of the equation `$\eqref{E18322}$` _from the right side_ by `\(x^{-1}\)`.
