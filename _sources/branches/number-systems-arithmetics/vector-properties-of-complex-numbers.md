A useful way to deal with [complex numbers][bookofproofs$216] numbers providing many new insights is to regard them as a [vector space][bookofproofs$560]. If you are already acquainted with [vectors][bookofproofs$7942], you will probably have noticed the parallel from complex numbers to vectors when looking at the way we [add complex numbers][bookofproofs$1657]. In this chapter, we will explore this topic more systematically. We will also introduce the [absolute value of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1247], which can be regarded as the length of a complex number vector.
