The [set of real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `\(\mathbb R\)`, together with the [specific addition operation][bookofproofs$1514] 
"`\(+\)`" is a [commutative group][bookofproofs$553], because:

1. The [addition operation is associative][bookofproofs$31], i.e. `\((x+y)+z=x+(y+z)\)` is valid for all `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb R\)`.
1. We have [shown the existence of a neutral element of addition][bookofproofs$34] - the number `\(0\in\mathbb R\)`, i.e. such that `\(0+x=x\)` for all `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`.
1. For every `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`, there [there exists an inverse real number][bookofproofs$35] `\(-x\in\mathbb R\)`, such that `\(x+(-x)=0\)`.
1. For every `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`, there [there exists an inverse real number][bookofproofs$35] `\(-x\in\mathbb R\)`, such that `\(x+(-x)=0\)`.
