Let `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` be [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105], which by definition means that they are the equivalence classes `\[\begin{array}{rcl}x&:=&(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I,\\
y&:=&(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I.\end{array}\]`
In the above definition, `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` denote elements of the set `\(M\)` of all [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485], which represent the real numbers `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`, while `\(I\)` denotes the set of all rational sequences, which converge to `\(0\)`. 
The  **subtraction of real numbers**, written `\(x-y\)`, is defined as the [addition][bookofproofs$1514] of the first real number `\(x\)` with the [inverse of the second real number with respect to addition][bookofproofs$35] `\((-y)\)`, formally
`\[\begin{array}{rcl}x-y&=&((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I)-((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I)\\
&=&((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I)+((-y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I)\\
&=&(x_n-y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + I\\
&=&x+(-y).\end{array}\]`

The result of the subtraction is called the **difference** of the real numbers `$x$` and `$y$`.
