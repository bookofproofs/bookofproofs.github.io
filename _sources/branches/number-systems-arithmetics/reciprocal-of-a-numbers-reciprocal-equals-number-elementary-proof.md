* According to the [existence of reciprocal numbers][bookofproofs$42] there exists a reciprocal number `\((x^{-1})^{-1}\)` of `\((x^{-1})\)`.
* Thus, we have `\[(x^{-1})^{-1}\cdot(x^{-1})=1.\]`
* With the same argument regarding the number `\(x\)` we have `\[x\cdot(x^{-1})=1.\]`
* By the [uniqueness of reciprocal numbers][bookofproofs$51], we can compare both equations.
* This comparison shows that `\((x^{-1})^{-1}=x\)` follows for all [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] with `\(x\neq 0\)`.
