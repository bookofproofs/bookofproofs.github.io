The [addition of rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1486] is associative, i.e. for any [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485] `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`, `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`  and `\((z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` the following  law is valid:

`\[[(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}]+(z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}=(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+[(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(z_n)]_{n\in\mathbb N}.\]`
