Let `\(x\in\mathbb N\)` be a given [natural number][bookofproofs$718]. Since `\(0\)` is a [natural number][bookofproofs$1455], we can have `\(x=0\)`. Otherwise, we have `\(x\neq 0\)`, and  according to the [trichotomy of natural numbers][bookofproofs$1552], it means that either `\(x < 0\)` or `\(x > 0\)`. We will show that `\(x > 0\)`.

Assume `\(x < 0\)`. By the  [definition of the order relation][bookofproofs$697], there is a natural number `\(u\neq 0\)` such that we have `\(x+u=0\)`. But this is a [contradiction][bookofproofs$744], since, according to the [addition of natural numbers][bookofproofs$842], the sum of two natural numbers can only equal zero (`\(x+ u=0\)`), if both, `\(x=0\)` and `\(u=0\)`. Therefore, the assumption `\(x < 0\)` is false and we must have `\(x > 0\)`.
