There exists a [rational Cauchy sequence][bookofproofs$1485] `\((1)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` such that `\[(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} \cdot (1)_{n\in\mathbb N}= (1)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot (x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}=(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\]` for all rational Cauchy sequence `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`, i.e. `\((1)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is neutral with respect to the [multiplication of rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1488].
