The proof will consist of four steps:

### Step 1: Demonstrate that the [addition of natural numbers][bookofproofs$842] "`\( + \)`" is associative.

This follows from the [corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$1428].
### Step 2: Demonstrate that the [addition of natural numbers][bookofproofs$842] "`\( + \)`" is commutative.

This follows from the [corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$1430].
### Step 3: Demonstrate that `\( ( \mathbb N, + )\)` forms a [commutative monoid][bookofproofs$706].
* Step 1 shows that "`\( + \)`" is associative, so `\( ( \mathbb N, + )\)` forms a [semigroup][bookofproofs$660].
* Because [adding natural numbers is associative][bookofproofs$1430] and because the natural number `\(0\)` is [neutral with respect to addition][bookofproofs$1455], we have `\(n + 0=0 + n=n\)`, thus the element `\(0\in\mathbb N\)` is the [identity element][bookofproofs$661] of the semigroup. 
* Because `\( ( \mathbb N, + )\)`  forms a semigroup with an identity element (which is `\(0\)`), it is a [monoid][bookofproofs$659].
* Together with step 2, this shows that `\( ( \mathbb N, + )\)` forms a communtative monoid.

### Step 4: Show that `\((\mathbb N, +)\)` is cancellative.

This follows from the [corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$1432].
These four steps show altogether that the set `\((\mathbb N, + )\)`, i.e. the set of [natural numbers][bookofproofs$664], together with the [addition][bookofproofs$842] 
"`\( + \)`" as a binary operation, forms a [cancellative][bookofproofs$837] [commutative monoid][bookofproofs$706].
