* We have to show that [inverse][bookofproofs$42] number of the number [one][bookofproofs$40] is one itself, i.e. `\(1^{-1}=1\)`.
* According to the [existence of reciprocal numbers][bookofproofs$42] there is a number `$1^{-1}$` such that `\(1\cdot 1^{-1}=1\)`. 
* Because of the [existence of the number one][bookofproofs$40] we also find that `\(1\cdot 1=1\)`. 
* Because [all inverse numbers are unique][bookofproofs$51], we can compare both equations.
* This comparison leads to the conclusion that `\(1^{-1}=1\)`.
