The [order relation for rational numbers][bookofproofs$1076] "`$<$`" defines a [strict total order][bookofproofs$576] on the set `$\mathbb Q$` of , i.e. for any [rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033] `\(\frac ab,\frac cd,\frac ef\in\mathbb Q\)`, we have

* Only one of the following cases can be true: either `\(\frac ab=\frac cd\)`,  or `\(\frac ab > \frac cd\)`, or `\(\frac ab < \frac cd\)`  **trichotomy**).
* If `$\frac ab < \frac cd$` and `$\frac cd < \frac ef$`, then `$\frac ab < \frac ef$`  **transitivity**).
* The same applies for the relation "$ > $".
