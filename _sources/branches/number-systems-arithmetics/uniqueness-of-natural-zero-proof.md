We will show that the [natural number zero][bookofproofs$1455] `\(0\)` is unique, i.e. there can be only one such number, for which

`\[n=n+0\text{ for all }n\in\mathbb N\quad\quad ( * )\]`

Suppose, `\(0^{\ast}\)` is any (other) natural number, for which 

`\[n=n+0^{\ast}\text{ for all }n\in\mathbb N\quad\quad ( * * )\]`

Applying the [commutativity law for adding natural numbers][bookofproofs$1430], we get

`\[\begin{array}{rcll}
0^{\ast}&=&0^{\ast}+0&\text{ by }( * )\\
&=&0+0^{\ast}&\text{ by commutativity of adding natural numbers}\\
&=&0&\text{ by }( * * )
\end{array}
\]`

Thus, both zeros are equal.
