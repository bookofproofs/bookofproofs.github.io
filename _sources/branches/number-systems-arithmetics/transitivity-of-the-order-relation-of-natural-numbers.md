For any [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb N\)`, the [order relation][bookofproofs$697] obeys the following **transitivity laws**:

* If `\(x < y\)` and `\(y < z\)`, then `\(x < z\)`.
* If `\(x \le y\)` and `\(y \le z\)`, then `\(x \le z\)`.
* If `\(x > y\)` and `\(y > z\)`, then `\(x > z\)`.
* If `\(x \ge y\)` and `\(y \ge z\)`, then `\(x \ge z\)`.
