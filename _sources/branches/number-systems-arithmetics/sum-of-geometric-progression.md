Let `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` be a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] and let `\(a, x \in F\)` be any two elements of a given [field][bookofproofs$557] `\((F, +, \cdot)\)` with `\(x\neq 1\)`. Then the general sum of the geometric progression `\(a, ax, ax^2,\ldots ax^n\)` is

`\[S_n:=\sum_{0\le k\le n} ax^k=\frac{a-ax^{n+1}}{1-x},\quad\quad (x\neq 1).\]`
