* By hypothesis, the set of real numbers `$\mathbb R$` is [ordered][bookofproofs$1107]".
* Since [$1 > 0$ holds in any ordered field][bookofproofs$6861], we have `\(1 > 0\)` also in `$\mathbb R$`. 
* Thus `$1$` is a [positive real number][bookofproofs$1107]. 
* The [Archimedian axiom][bookofproofs$1339] ensures the existence of a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `\(n\)` such that `\(nx > y\)` for any [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] `\(x,y\)`, thus also for the positive numbers `$1,y.$` 
* It follows that for every [positive real number][bookofproofs$1107] `\(y > 0\)` there exists a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `\(n\)` with `\(y < n\)`.
