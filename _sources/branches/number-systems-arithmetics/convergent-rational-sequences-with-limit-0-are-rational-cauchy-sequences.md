Let `\((M , + , \cdot)\)` be the [unit ring of all rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1101]. The set `\(I:=\{(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}~|~a_n\in\mathbb Q,\lim a_n=0\}\)` of all [rational sequences convergent][bookofproofs$1572] to `\(0\)` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of `\(M\)`, formally `\(I\subseteq R\)`.
