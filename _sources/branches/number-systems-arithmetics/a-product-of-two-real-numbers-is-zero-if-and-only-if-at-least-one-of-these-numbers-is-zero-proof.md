Let `\(x,y\)` be [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105].
### "`\(\Rightarrow\)`" 

* Let `\(yx=0\)`, where `$0$` denotes the [real zero][bookofproofs$34].
* Assume `\(y\neq 0\)`. We have to show that `$x=0.$` 
   * It follows from the [unique solvability of ax=b][bookofproofs$517] (for `$a=y$` and `$b=0$`) that `\(x=y^{-1}\cdot 0\)` is the unique solution.
   * From [$0x=x$ for all `$x\in\mathbb R$`][bookofproofs$521], it follows further that `$x=y^{-1}\cdot 0=0.$`
* Therefore, `$x=0$`.

### "`\(\Leftarrow\)`" 

* Let at least on of the two numbers `\(x,y\)` equal zero. 
* Then it follows immediately as a corollary from [$0x=0$][bookofproofs$521], that `\(xy=0.\)`
