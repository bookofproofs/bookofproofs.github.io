* `$x\cdot y:=(a,b) \cdot (c,d)$` by [definition of complex numbers][bookofproofs$844], the complex numbers `\(x,y \in \mathbb C\)` are identified by pairs `\(x:=(a,b)\)`, `\(y:=(c,d)\)` of real numbers `\(a,b,c,d\in\mathbb R\)`.
* `$=(ac - bd,~ ad + bc)$` by [definition of complex multiplication][bookofproofs$1668].
* `$=(ca - db,~ da + cb)$` because [multiplying real numbers is commutative][bookofproofs$38].
* `$=(ca - db,~ cb +da)$` because [adding real numbers is commutative][bookofproofs$33].
* `$= (c,d)\cdot (a,b)$`  by [definition of complex multiplication][bookofproofs$1668].
* `$= y \cdot x$`  by [definition of complex numbers][bookofproofs$844].
* Therefore, the multiplication of complex numbers is [commutative][bookofproofs$672].
