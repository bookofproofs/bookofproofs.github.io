Let `\(n\in\mathbb N\)` be a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] and let `\(a,b \in F\)` be any two elements of a given [field][bookofproofs$557] `\((F, +, \cdot)\)`. Then the general [sum][bookofproofs$216] of the arithmetic progression `\(a, a + b, a + 2b, a + 3b,\ldots, a + nb \)` is

`\[S:=\sum_{0\le k\le n} (a+b\cdot k)=(n+1)\cdot \left(a+\frac{bn}2\right).\]`
