According to the [definition of natural numbers][bookofproofs$718], the number `\(0\)` has been identified with the empty set `\(\emptyset\)`, which [exists according to the axiom of empty set][bookofproofs$1427]. Therefore, the natural number `\(0\)` also exists.

As a corollary to the [definition of adding natural numbers][bookofproofs$842] "`\( + \)`" it also follows that `\(0\)` is neutral with respect to this operation, i.e. 
`\[x + 0= x\]`
for all `\(x\in\mathbb N\)`.

It remains to be shown that also the equation `\(0+x=x\)` holds for all `\(x\in\mathbb N\)`. It follows immediately from the [commutativity of adding natural numbers][bookofproofs$1430].
