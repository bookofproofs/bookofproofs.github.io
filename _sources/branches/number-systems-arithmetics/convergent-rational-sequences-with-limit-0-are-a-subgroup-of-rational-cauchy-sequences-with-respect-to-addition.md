Let `\((M, + )\)` be the [commutative group of rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1518]. The set `\(I:=\{(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}~|~a_n\in\mathbb Q,\lim a_n=0\}\)` of all [rational sequences convergent][bookofproofs$1572] to `\(0\)` is a [subgroup][bookofproofs$554] of `\(M\)`, formally `\[(I, + )\subseteq (M, + ).\]`
