Any integer `\(x\in\mathbb Z\)` [is by the corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$844] an [equivalence class][bookofproofs$574].
`\[x:=[a,b],\]` 
where `\(a\)` and `\(b\neq 0\)` denote  [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] representing  the equivalence class `\(x\)`. Given two integers `\(x:=[a,b]\)`, `\(y:=[c,d]\)`, `\(a,b,c,d\in \mathbb N\)`, the **addition of integers** is defined by using the [addition of the natural numbers][bookofproofs$842] `\(a+c\)` and `\(b+d\)`:
 
`\[\begin{array}{rcl}
x+y&:=&[a+c,b+d],
\end{array}\]`

where `\([a+c,b+d]\)` is also an integer, called the **sum** of the integers `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`. The sum exists and is well-defined, i.e. it does not depend on the specific representatives `\([a,b]\)` and `\([c,d]\)` of `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`.
