The [set of real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `\(\mathbb R\)`, together with the [specific addition operation][bookofproofs$1514] "`\(+\)`", and the [specific multiplication operation][bookofproofs$1532] "`\(\cdot\)`", forms the algebraic structure `\((\mathbb R, + , \cdot)\)` of a [field][bookofproofs$557].
### Notes

Real numbers have an even more interesting structures than just being a field. In particular, they fulfill the Archimedean axiom and the completeness property. However, these additional features require a more detailed study of the properties of real numbers.
