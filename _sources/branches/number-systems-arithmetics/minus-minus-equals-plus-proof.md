* Let `\(x\)` be a [real number][bookofproofs$1105].
* According to the [existence of negative numbers][bookofproofs$35] there exists a negative number `\(-(-x)\)` of `\((-x)\)`.
* It follows `$(-(-x))+(-x)=0.$`
* With the same argument regarding the number `\(x\)` we have `$x+(-x)=0.$`
* The statement `\((-(-x))=x\)` follows now as a corollary from the [uniqueness of negative numbers][bookofproofs$50].
