The [multiplication of rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1488] is commutative, i.e. for any [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485] `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` the following  law is valid:

`\[(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot (y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}=(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot (x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}.\]`
