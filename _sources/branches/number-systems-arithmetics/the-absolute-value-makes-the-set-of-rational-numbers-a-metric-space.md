Let `\(x=\frac ab,y=\frac cd\in \mathbb Q\)`. The [distance][bookofproofs$1081] `\(|\frac ab-\frac cd|\)` of two rational numbers `\(\frac ab\)` and `\(\frac cd\)` defines a [metric][bookofproofs$614]  on `\(\mathbb Q\)`. In other words, `\((\mathbb Q,|~|)\)` is a [metric space][bookofproofs$617] and the distance `\(|~|\)` fulfills the following properties:

> `\((i)\)` `\(|\frac ab|=0\)` if and only if `\(a=0\)` for all `\(\frac ab\in\mathbb Q\)`.

> `\((ii)\)`  `\(|\frac ab-\frac cd|=|\frac cd-\frac ab|\)` for all `\(\frac ab,\frac cd\in\mathbb Q\)` (symmetry)

> `\((iii)\)`  `\(|\frac ab+\frac cd|\le |\frac ab| + |\frac cd|\)` for all `\(\frac ab,\frac cd\in\mathbb Q\)` (triangle inequality)
