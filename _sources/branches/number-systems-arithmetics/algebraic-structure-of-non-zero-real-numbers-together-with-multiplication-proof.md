The [set of real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] without `\(0\)` (i.e. the [number zero][bookofproofs$34]), denoted by `\(\mathbb R^*\)`, together with the [specific multiplication operation][bookofproofs$1532] 
"`\(\cdot\)`" is a [commutative group][bookofproofs$553]. This is because:

1. The [multiplication operation is associative][bookofproofs$37], i.e. `\((x\cdot y)\cdot z=x\cdot (y\cdot z)\)` is valid for all `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb R^*\)`.
1. We have [shown the existence of a neutral element of multiplication][bookofproofs$40] - the number `\(1\in\mathbb R^*\)`, i.e. such that `\(1\cdot x=x\)` for all `\(x\in\mathbb R^*\)`.
1. For every `\(x\in\mathbb R^*\)`, there [there exists an inverse real number][bookofproofs$42] `\(x^{-1}\in\mathbb R^*\)`, such that `\(x\cdot x^{-1}=1\)`.
1. For every `\(x\in\mathbb R^*\)`, there [there exists an inverse real number][bookofproofs$42] `\(x^{-1}\in\mathbb R^*\)`, such that `\(x\cdot x^{-1}=1\)`.
