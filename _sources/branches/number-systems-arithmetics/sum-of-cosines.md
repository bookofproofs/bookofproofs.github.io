Let `\(t\in\mathbb R\)` be a [real number][bookofproofs$1105], which is not a multiple of `$2\pi$`, where `$\pi$` is the [Pi constant][bookofproofs$6738]. Then the following [sum of cosines][bookofproofs$1745] can be calculated using the formula:

`$$\sum_{k=1}^n\cos(kt)=\frac{t\sin\left(n+\frac 12\right)}{2\sin\left(\frac t2\right)}-\frac 12.$$`
