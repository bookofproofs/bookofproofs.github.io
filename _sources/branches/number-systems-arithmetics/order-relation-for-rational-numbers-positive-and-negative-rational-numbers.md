According to the [definition of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033],  we can represent any rational number `\(x\)` by two [integers][bookofproofs$844] `\(a,b\)`, with `\(b\neq 0\)`, formally `\(x=\frac ab\)`. 

Based on the [order relation for integers][bookofproofs$1075], we have three cases of representing a rational number, called:

* **positive rational number** `$x > 0,$` if and only if `$x=\frac ab$` and `$(a > 0\wedge b > 0)\vee(a < 0\wedge b < 0),$`[^1]
* **zero** `$x=0,$` if and only if `$x=\frac 0b,~b \neq 0,$`  
* **negative rational number** `$x < 0,$` if and only if `$x=\frac ab$` and `$(a < 0\wedge b > 0)\vee(a > 0\wedge b < 0).$`

Based on the [definition of subtraction of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1586], we can define the **order relation for rational numbers** as follows:

*  `$x > y$` if and only if `$x-y > 0,$` 
*  `$x = y$` if and only if `$x-y > 0,$` 
*  `$x < y$` if and only if `$x-y < 0.$`

[^1]: The first `$0$` in all three cases means the [rational zero][bookofproofs$1473], the second `$0$` means the [integer zero][bookofproofs$1452].
