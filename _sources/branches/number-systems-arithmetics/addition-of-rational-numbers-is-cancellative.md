The [addition of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1446] is [cancellative][bookofproofs$837], i.e. for all rational numbers `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb Q\)`, the following laws (both) are fulfilled:

* **Left cancellation property**:
If the equation `\(z + x=z + y\)` holds, then it implies `\(x=y\)`.  

* **Right cancellation property**:
If the equation `\(x + z=y + z\)` holds, then it implies `\(x=y\)`.


Conversely, the equation `\(x=y\)` implies 

* `\(x+z=y+z\)` and 
* `\(z + x=z + y\)` 

for all `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb Q\)`.
