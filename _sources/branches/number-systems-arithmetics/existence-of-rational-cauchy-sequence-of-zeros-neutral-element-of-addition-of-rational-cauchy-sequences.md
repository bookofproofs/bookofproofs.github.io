There exists a [rational Cauchy sequence][bookofproofs$1485] `\((0)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` such that `\[(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} + (0)_{n\in\mathbb N}= (0)_{n\in\mathbb N} + (x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}=(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\]` for all rational Cauchy sequence `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`, i.e. `\((0)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is neutral with respect to the [addition of rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1486].
