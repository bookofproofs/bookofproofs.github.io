The [set of complex numbers][bookofproofs$216] `\(\mathbb C\)`, together with the [specific addition operation][bookofproofs$1657] "`\(+\)`" is a [commutative group][bookofproofs$553], because:

1. The [addition operation is associative][bookofproofs$1658], i.e. `\((x+y)+z=x+(y+z)\)` is valid for all `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb C\)`.
1. We have [shown the existence of a neutral element of addition][bookofproofs$1662] - the number `\(0\in\mathbb C\)`, i.e. such that `\(0+x=x+0=x\)` for all `\(x\in\mathbb C\)`.
1. For every `\(x\in\mathbb C\)`, there [there exists an inverse complex number][bookofproofs$1664] `\(-x\in\mathbb C\)`, such that `\(x+(-x)=0\)`.
1. For every `\(x\in\mathbb C\)`, there [there exists an inverse complex number][bookofproofs$1664] `\(-x\in\mathbb C\)`, such that `\(x+(-x)=0\)`.
