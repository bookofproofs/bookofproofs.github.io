For every member `\(x_n\)` of a given [rational Cauchy Sequence][bookofproofs$1485] `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`, there  [exists an inverse rational number][bookofproofs$1509] `\(-x_n\)` , such that `\(x_n + (-x_n)=0\)`, where `\(0\)` is the [rational zero][bookofproofs$1473]. By definition of the [addition of both sequences][bookofproofs$1486] we get

`\[(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(-x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}=(0)_{n\in\mathbb N}.\]`

where `\((0)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` equals the [Cauchy sequence of rational zeros][bookofproofs$1498], as required.
