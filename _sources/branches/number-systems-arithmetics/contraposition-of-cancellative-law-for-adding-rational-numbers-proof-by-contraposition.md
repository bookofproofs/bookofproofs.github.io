According to the [cancellation law for adding rational numbers][bookofproofs$1471], we have
 for all [rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033] `\(x,y,a\in\mathbb Q\)`:
`\[\begin{array}{rcl}z + x=z + y&\Longleftrightarrow &x=y,\\
x + z=y + z&\Longleftrightarrow& x=y.
\end{array}\]`
By virtue of the [proving principle by contraposition][bookofproofs$1330], it follows
`\[x \neq y\Longleftrightarrow \begin{cases} z + x\neq z + y,&\text{or}\\
x + z\neq y + z,
\end{cases}\]`

i.e. if any two rational numbers `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` are [unequal][bookofproofs$1539], then the inequality is preserved if we add an arbitrary rational number `\(z\)` to both sides of the inequality. Conversely, given an inequality, in which the same rational number `\(z\)` is added on both sides, we can "cancel it out" and preserve the inequality.
