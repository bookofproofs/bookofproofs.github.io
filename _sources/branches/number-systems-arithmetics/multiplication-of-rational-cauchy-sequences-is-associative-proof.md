Let `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`, `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`  and `\((z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485]. It follows from the [definition of multiplying rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1488] and from the [associativity of multiplying rational numbers][bookofproofs$1476] that

`\[\begin{array}{ccll}
[(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot (y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}]\cdot (z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&=&(x_n\cdot y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot (z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by definition of multiplying rational Cauchy sequences}\\
&=&((x_n\cdot y_n)\cdot z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by definition of multiplying rational Cauchy sequences}\\
&=&(x_n\cdot (y_n\cdot z_n))_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by associativity of multiplying rational numbers}\\
&=&(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot (y_n\cdot z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by definition of multiplying rational Cauchy sequences}\\
&=&(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot [(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot (z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}]&\text{by definition of multiplying rational Cauchy sequences}\\
\end{array}\]`
