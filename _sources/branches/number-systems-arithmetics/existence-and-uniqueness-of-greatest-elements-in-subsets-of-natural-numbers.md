The [well-ordering principle][bookofproofs$698] ensures the existence of a minimum in _every_ non-empty subset of natural numbers. But how about the existence of a maximum? It turns out that such a maximum exists if we, in addition, require that the subset is finite.

Every [non-empty][bookofproofs$550] and [finite][bookofproofs$985] [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(M\subseteq\mathbb N\)` of [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] contains a unique [greatest][bookofproofs$7995] element `$m_0 \ge m$` for all `$m\in M$` with respect to their [order relation][bookofproofs$697] `$(\mathbb N, \le ).$`

### Strict order version:

Every [non-empty][bookofproofs$550] and [finite][bookofproofs$985] [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(M\subseteq\mathbb N\)` of [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] contains a unique [maximal][bookofproofs$7995] element `$m_0 > m$` for all `$m\in M$` with respect to their [order relation][bookofproofs$697] `$(\mathbb N, < ).$`
