Let `\(x,y\)` be two [positive real numbers][bookofproofs$1107], i.e. `\(x > 0\)` and `\(y > 0\)`. Then there exists a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `\(n\)` such that `\(nx > y.\)`

Actually, the axiom is applicable for any kind of [ordered fields][bookofproofs$6192] fulfilling the [Archimedian principle][bookofproofs$1340].
