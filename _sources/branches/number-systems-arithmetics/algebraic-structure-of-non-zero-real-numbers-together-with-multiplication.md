Let `\(\mathbb R^*\)` be the [set of real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] with the number [zero][bookofproofs$34] being excluded, formally `\(\mathbb R^*:=\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}\)`. 
Together with the [specific multiplication operation][bookofproofs$1532] "`\(\cdot\)`", it forms the algebraic structure `\((\mathbb R^*, \cdot)\)` of a [commutative group][bookofproofs$553].
