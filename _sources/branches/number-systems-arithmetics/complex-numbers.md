### Motivation for the set of complex numbers `\(\mathbb C\)`

In this part, we introduce the number system of complex numbers. In the set of [real numbers][bookofproofs$167] `$\mathbb R,$` which has been defined as the set of all limits of [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485], it is not possible to solve all polynomial equations. The simplest polynomial equation, for which there is no real number solving it is the equation 
`$$x^2 + 1 = 0.$$`

Complex numbers `$\mathbb C$` allow to find the zeros of this polynomial and it turns out that the set of complex numbers is sufficient to ensure that _all_ polynomial equations can be solved.
