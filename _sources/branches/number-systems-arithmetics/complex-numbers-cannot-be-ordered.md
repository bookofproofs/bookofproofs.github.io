The [field of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690] is not [ordered][bookofproofs$6192], i.e. there is no (!)  [order relation][bookofproofs$7993] "`$\ge$`" such that for complex numbers `$z_1,z_2,z_3\in\mathbb C$`

* from `$z_1\ge z_2$` it would follow `$z_1+z_3\ge z_2+z_2$` and `$z_1$` and
* from `$z_1\ge 0$` and `$z_2\ge 0$` it would follow that `$z_1\cdot z_2\ge 0.$`
