For arbitrary [real numbers][bookofproofs$844] `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb R\)` with the binary operations [addition][bookofproofs$1446] 
"`\( + \)`" and [multiplication][bookofproofs$1532] "`\(\cdot\)`", the following distributivity laws hold:

`\[\begin{array}{ccl}
x\cdot(y+z)&=&(x\cdot y)+(x\cdot z),\quad\quad\text{"left-distributivity property"}\\
(y+z)\cdot x&=&(y\cdot x)+(z\cdot x).\quad\quad\text{"right-distributivity property"}
\end{array}\]`
