Any rational number `\(x\in\mathbb Q\)` [is by the corresponding proposition][bookofproofs$1033] an [equivalence class][bookofproofs$574].
`\[x:=\frac ab,\]` 
where `\(a\)` and `\(b\neq 0\)` denote  [integers][bookofproofs$844] representing  the equivalence class `\(x\)`. Given two rational numbers `\(x:=\frac ab\)`, `\(y:=\frac cd\)`, `\(a,c\in \mathbb Z\)`, `\(b,d\in \mathbb Z\setminus\{0\}\)`, the **addition of rational numbers** is defined using the [multiplication of the integers][bookofproofs$891] `\(a\cdot d\)`, `\(b\cdot d\)`, and `\(c\cdot b\)` and the [addition of the integers][bookofproofs$890] `\(a\cdot d+c\cdot b\)`: 
 
`\[\begin{array}{rcl}
x+y&:=&\frac {a\cdot d + c\cdot b}{b\cdot d},
\end{array}\]`

where `\(\frac {ad + cb}{bd}\)` is also a rational number, called the **sum** of the rational numbers `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`. The sum exists and is well-defined, i.e. it does not depend on the specific representatives `\(\frac ab\)` and `\(\frac cd\)` of `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`.
