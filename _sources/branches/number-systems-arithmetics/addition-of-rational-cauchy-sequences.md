Let `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` be [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485]. The **addition of rational Cauchy Sequences** is defined as: 
`\[\begin{array}{cclc}
(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}+(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&:=&(x_n+y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\\
\end{array}\]`
where the result `\((x_n+y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` is also a rational Cauchy sequence, called the **sum** of the rational Cauchy sequences `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`. The sum exists and is well-defined.
