Let `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` be [complex numbers, which by definition means][bookofproofs$216] that they are ordered pairs of real numbers `\[\begin{array}{rcl}x&:=&(a,b),\\
y&:=&(c,d).\end{array}\]`


The commutativity of the [addition of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1660] `\(x+y=y+x\)` for all `\(x,y\in\mathbb C\)` follows from the [commutativity of adding real numbers][bookofproofs$33]:

`\[\begin{array}{rcll}
x+y&=&(a,b)+(c,d)&\text{by definition of complex numbers}\\
&=&(a+c,b+d)&\text{by definition of adding complex numbers}\\
&=&(c+a,d+b)&\text{by commutativity of adding real numbers}\\
&=&(c,d)+(a,b)&\text{by definition of adding complex numbers}\\
&=&y+x&\text{by definition of complex numbers}\\
\end{array}\]`
