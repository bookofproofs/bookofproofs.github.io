Let `$K\subset \mathbb Z$` be a subset of [integers][bookofproofs$844] and let `\(a_k, b_k, c\in R\)` be any elements of a given [unit ring][bookofproofs$683]: `\((R, +, \cdot)\)`. Then the following rules for sum manipulation hold:

`\[
\begin{array}{ccl}
\sum_{k\in K}c\cdot a_k=c\cdot\sum_{k\in K}a_k&\quad\quad\quad&\text{distributive law},\\
\sum_{k\in K}(a_k + b_k)=\sum_{k\in K}a_k + \sum_{k\in K}b_k &\quad\quad\quad&\text{associative law},\\
\sum_{k\in K}a_k=\sum_{\pi(k)\in K}a_k&\quad\quad\quad&\text{commutative law}.
\end{array}
\]`
where `\(\pi(k)\)` is any [permutation][bookofproofs$188] of the set `\(K\)`.
