According to the [definition of natural numbers][bookofproofs$664], they fulfill the [Peano axioms][bookofproofs$504]. By virtue of the axiom **P4** we have
`\[x^+=y^+\Longrightarrow x=y.\]`

By virtue of the [proving principle by contraposition][bookofproofs$1330] it follows
`\[x\neq y\Longrightarrow x^+\neq y^+,\]`

i.e. if any two natural numbers are [unequal][bookofproofs$1539], then their successors are also unequal.
