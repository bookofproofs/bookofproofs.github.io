The rule of double summation
`\[\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij}=\sum_{j=1}^m\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij}\]`
is a direct corollary from the [general associativity law][bookofproofs$540] and is valid for summing of elements of 
any [commutative][bookofproofs$672] [semigroup][bookofproofs$660] `\(a_i,a_j\in(S, +)\)`.
