* Let `$z\in\mathbb C$` be a [complex number][bookofproofs$1247].
* By definition of the [complex conjugate][bookofproofs$1245] `$z^*$`, the [real part][bookofproofs$216] are equal `$\Re(z)=\Re/.$`
* By the definition of the [absolute value of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1247], it follows `$$|z|=\sqrt{\Re(z\cdot z^*)}=|z^*|.$$`
* Moreover, by definition of the [multiplication of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1668] `$$\begin{array}{rcl}
|z|&=&\sqrt{\Re(z\cdot z^*)}\\
&=&\sqrt{(\Re(z)+i\Im(z))(\Re(z)-i\Im(z))}\\
&=&\sqrt{\Re(z)^2+i\Im(z)\Re(z)-i\Re(z)\Im(z)-i^2\Im(z)^2}\\
&=&\sqrt{\Re(z)^2+\Im(z)^2}.
\end{array}$$`
