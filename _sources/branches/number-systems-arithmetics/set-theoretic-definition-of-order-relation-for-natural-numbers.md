Let `\(m,n\in\mathbb N\)` be any given natural numbers, using their [von Neumann set-theoretic representation][bookofproofs$718].
Then we call:

* `\(m\)` **smaller or equal** `\(n\)` - denoted by `\(m \le n\)`, if and only if the set-theoretic representation of `\(m\)` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of the set-theoretic representation of `\(n\)`,
* `\(m\)` **smaller** `\(n\)` - denoted by `\(m < n\)`, if and only if the set-theoretic representation of `\(m\)` is a [proper subset][bookofproofs$552] of the set-theoretic representation of `\(n\)`, 
* `\(m\)` **greater or equal** `\(n\)` - denoted by `\(m \ge n\)`, if and only if the set-theoretic representation of `\(n\)` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] of the set-theoretic representation of `\(m\)`,
* `\(m\)` **greater** `\(n\)` - denoted by `\(m > n\)`, if and only if the set-theoretic representation of `\(n\)` is a [proper subset][bookofproofs$552] of the set-theoretic representation of `\(m\)`.
