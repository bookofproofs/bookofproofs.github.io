According the [definition of rational numbers][bookofproofs$1033], we can identify rational numbers `\(x,y \in \mathbb Q\)` with  [equivalence classes][bookofproofs$574] `\(x:=\frac ab\)`, `\(y:=\frac cd\)` for some integers `\(a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Z\)` with `\(b\neq 0\)` and `\(d\neq 0\)`. 

Based on the [multiplication of integers][bookofproofs$891], we define a new  multiplication operation "`\( \cdot \)`" for all rational numbers by setting 

`\[\begin{array}{ccl}
x\cdot y=\frac ab \cdot \frac cd &:=& \frac{a\cdot c}{b\cdot d}.
\end{array}
\]`


where `\(\frac{ac}{bd}\)` is also a rational number, called the **product** of the rational numbers `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`. The product exists and is well-defined, i.e. it does not depend on the specific representatives `\(\frac ab\)` and `\(\frac cd\)` of `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`.
