Let `\(x\in \mathbb Z\)`. Based on the [order relation for integers][bookofproofs$1075], we can define the **absolute value** of `\(x\)` as a [function][bookofproofs$592] `\(|~|:\mathbb Z\mapsto \mathbb N\)`  

`\[|x| :=
\begin{cases}
x  & \text{ if } x\ge y \\
-x & \text{ if } x < y.
\end{cases}\]`
