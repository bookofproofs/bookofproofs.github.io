* We have to show that the [real number zero][bookofproofs$34] `\(0\)` is unique, i.e. there can be only one such number, for which
`\[x=x+0\quad\quad ( * )\]`
for all `$x\in\mathbb R$`.
* Suppose, `\(0^{\ast}\)` is any (other) [real number][bookofproofs$1105], for which 
`\[x=x+0^{\ast}\quad\quad ( * * )\]`
for all `$x\in\mathbb R$`.
* Applying the [commutativity law for adding real numbers][bookofproofs$33], we get
`\[\begin{array}{rcll}
0^{\ast}&=&0^{\ast}+0&\text{ by }( * )\\
&=&0+0^{\ast}&\text{ by commutativity of adding real numbers}\\
&=&0&\text{ by }( * * )
\end{array}
\]`
* Thus, both zeros are in fact equal.
* Thus, the real zero `$0$` is unique.
