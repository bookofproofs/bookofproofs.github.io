Let `\(a,b,c,d\)` be [real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] with `\(b\neq 0\)` and `\(d\neq 0\)`. Then the [sum][bookofproofs$1514] (or [difference][bookofproofs$1588]) of the [ratios][bookofproofs$6634] `$\frac ab$` and `$\frac cd$` equals the ratio `$\frac {ad\pm bc}{bd}$`, formally `$$\frac ab\pm\frac cd=\frac {ad\pm bc}{bd}.$$`
