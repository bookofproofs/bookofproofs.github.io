Let `\((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)` and `\((y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\)`  be [rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1485]. It follows from the [definition of multiplying rational Cauchy sequences][bookofproofs$1488] and from the [commutativity of multiplying rational numbers][bookofproofs$1478] that

`\[\begin{array}{ccll}
(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot (y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&=&(x_n\cdot y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by definition of multiplying rational Cauchy sequences}\\
&=&(y_n\cdot x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by commutativity of multiplying rational numbers}\\
&=&(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\cdot (x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&\text{by definition of multiplying rational Cauchy sequences}\\
\end{array}\]`
