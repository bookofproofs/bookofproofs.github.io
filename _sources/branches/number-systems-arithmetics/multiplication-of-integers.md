According the [definition of integers][bookofproofs$844], we can identify integers  `\(x,y \in \mathbb Z\)` with [equivalence classes][bookofproofs$574] `\(x:=[a,b]\)`, `\(y:=[c,d]\)` for some natural numbers `\(a,b,c,d\in\mathbb N\)`. 

Based on the [addition of natural numbers][bookofproofs$842] and the [multiplication of natural numbers][bookofproofs$876], we define a new multiplication operation "`\( \cdot \)`" for all integers by setting 

`\[\begin{array}{ccl}
x\cdot y:=[a,b] \cdot [c,d] &:=& [a\cdot c + b\cdot d,~ a\cdot d + c\cdot b]=[ac + bd,~ ad + bc],
\end{array}
\]`

where `\([ac + bd,~ ad + bc]\)` is also an integer, called the **product** of the integers `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`. The product exists and is well-defined, i.e. it does not depend on the specific representatives `\([a,b]\)` and `\([c,d]\)` of `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`.
