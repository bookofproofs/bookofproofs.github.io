Note that since the [real number `\(0_R\in\mathbb R\)` exists][bookofproofs$34], it is also true that the [complex number][bookofproofs$216] `\(0:=(0_R,0_R)\)` exists.  It remains to be shown that the complex zero `\(0\)` is neutral with respect to the [addition of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1657].
Let `\(x\)` be a [complex number][bookofproofs$216] represented by the ordered pair of real numbers `\((a,b)\)`. Because the real zero  `\(0_R\in\mathbb R\)` [is neutral with respect to the addition of real numbers][bookofproofs$34], it follows that

`\[\begin{array}{ccll}
x+0&=&(a,b)+(0_R,0_R)&\text{by definition of complex numbers}\\
&=&(a+0_R,b+0_R)&\text{by definition of adding complex numbers}\\
&=&(a,b)&\text{because }0_R\text{ is neutral element of addition of real numbers}\\
&=&x&\text{by definition of complex numbers}\\
\end{array}\]`

It remains to be shown that also the equation `\(0+x=x\)` holds for all `\(x\in\mathbb C\)`. It follows immediately from the [commutativity of adding complex numbers][bookofproofs$1660].
