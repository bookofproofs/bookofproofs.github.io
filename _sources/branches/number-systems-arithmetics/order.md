The order relations !`\( \le \)`", respectively "`\( \ge \)`" define a [total order][bookofproofs$576] on the set of natural numbers `\(\mathbb N\)`, i.e. any two natural numbers can be compared with each other. This is an important concept, since it enables one of the most important methods of mathematical proofs, called the [principle of complete induction][bookofproofs$657]. Also we use this concept intuitively on a daily basis when comparing the number of things, paying or exchanging money, etc.
