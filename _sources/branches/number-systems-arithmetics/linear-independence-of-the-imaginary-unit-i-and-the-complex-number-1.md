Given the fact that [complex numbers form a vector space over the field of real numbers][bookofproofs$1694], the vectors 
* [complex number one][bookofproofs$1673] `\(1\)` and the 
* [imaginary unit][bookofproofs$1160] `\(i\)` 

are [linearly independent][bookofproofs$1036], i.e. for some real numbers[^1] `\(\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb R\)`, the equation
`\[\alpha\cdot 1 + \beta \cdot i=0\]`
has only the trivial solution `\(\alpha=\beta=0\)`.

### Notes

* This lemma demonstrates that two complex numbers `$z$` and `$z^\prime$` are equal if and only if their [real and imaginary parts][bookofproofs$216] are equal `$\Re(z)=\Re(z^\prime)$` and `$\Im(z)=\Im(z^\prime).$` 

[^1]: Please note that we consider `\(\alpha,\beta\)` to be real numbers (scalars in the vector space), while we consider the numbers `\(1\)` and `\(i\)` as complex numbers (or vectors of the vector space).
