Let `\(0 < b < 1\)` be a [real number][bookofproofs$1105]. We want to show that for every `\(\epsilon > 0\)` there is natural number `\(n\)`, for which `\(b^n < \epsilon\)`.

Applying the [rules for calculation with inequalities][bookofproofs$594] (rule 10), we have `\(\frac 1b > 1\)`. According to the [corollary about the existence of  powers exceeding any positive constant][bookofproofs$1348], there exists an [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `\(n\in\mathbb N\)`, such that 
`\[\left(\frac 1b\right)^n > \frac 1\epsilon.\]`

By applying the [rules for calculation with inequalities][bookofproofs$594] once again, we get 
`\[b^n < \epsilon.\]`
