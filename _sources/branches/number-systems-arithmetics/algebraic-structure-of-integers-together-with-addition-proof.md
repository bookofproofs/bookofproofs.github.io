The [set of integers][bookofproofs$844] `\(\mathbb Z\)`, together with the [specific addition operation][bookofproofs$890] "`\(+\)`" is a [commutative group][bookofproofs$553], because:

1. The [addition operation is associative][bookofproofs$1443], i.e. `\((x+y)+z=x+(y+z)\)` is valid for all `\(x,y,z\in\mathbb Z\)`.
1. We have [shown the existence of a neutral element of addition][bookofproofs$1452] - the number `\(0\in\mathbb Z\)`, i.e. such that `\(0+x=x\)` for all `\(x\in\mathbb Z\)`.
1. For every `\(x\in\mathbb Z\)`, there [there exists an inverse integer][bookofproofs$1511] `\(-x\in\mathbb Z\)`, such that `\(x+(-x)=0\)`.
1. For every `\(x\in\mathbb Z\)`, there [there exists an inverse integer][bookofproofs$1511] `\(-x\in\mathbb Z\)`, such that `\(x+(-x)=0\)`.
