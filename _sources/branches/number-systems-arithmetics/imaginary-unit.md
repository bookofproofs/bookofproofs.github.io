The [complex multiplication][bookofproofs$1668] of the complex number `\((0,1)\)` is `\((-1,0)\)`, i.e.

`\[(0,1)\cdot(0,1)=(-1,0).\]`
We set 
`\[i:=(0,1)\in\mathbb C\]`
and call the complex number `\(i\)` the **imaginary unit**. Because the complex number `\((-1,0)\in\mathbb C\)` can be identified with the real number `\(-1\in\mathbb R\)`, we have 
`\[i^2=-1.\]`
