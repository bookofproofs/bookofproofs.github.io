Let `\(x,y\in\mathbb N\)` be any given [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718]. The relations "`\( > \)`" greater, "`\( < \)`" smaller, and "`\( = \)`" equal have been defined already from the [set-theoretic point of view][bookofproofs$719]. These relations can be explained more intuitively by the [comparison of natural numbers using the concept of addition explains][bookofproofs$1547]:

We call the numbers 

* `\(x\)` **equal** `\(y\)`, if and only if `\(x=y\)`,
* `\(x\)` **is greater than** `\(y\)`, denoted by `\(x > y\)`, if and only if there exist a natural number `\(u\neq 0\)` such that `\(x=y+u\)`,
* `\(x\)` **is smaller than** `\(y\)`, denoted by `\(x < y\)`, if and only if there exist a natural number `\(v\neq 0\)` such that `\(y=x+v\)`.

Moreover, we say 
* `\(x\)` is **greater than or equal** `\(y\)`, denoted by `\(x\ge y\)`, if `\(x\)` is greater than `\(y\)`,  or `\(x\)` is equal `\(y\)` and 
* `\(x\)` is **smaller than or equal** `\(y\)`, denoted by `\(x\ge y\)`, if `\(x\)` is smaller than `\(y\)`,  or `\(x\)` is equal `\(y\)`.

Obviously, by this definition

* `\(x\)` is greater than `\(y\)`, if and only if `\(y\)` is smaller than `\(x\)`,
* `\(x\)` is smaller than `\(y\)`, if and only if `\(y\)` is greater than `\(x\)`,
* `\(x\)` is greater than or equal `\(y\)`, if and only if `\(y\)` is smaller than or equal `\(x\)`,
* `\(x\)` is equal than `\(y\)`, if and only if `\(y\)` is equal `\(x\)`.
