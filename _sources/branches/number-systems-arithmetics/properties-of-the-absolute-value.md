The absolute value has the following properties[^1]:


1. `\(|-x|=|x|\)` for all `\(x\in\mathbb R\)`. 
1. `\(|xy|=|x||y|\)` for all `\(x,y\in\mathbb R\)`.
1. `\(|\frac xy|=\frac{|x|}{|y|}\)` for all `\(x,y\in\mathbb R\)`, `\(y\neq 0\)`.

[^1]: Please note that another, very important property of the absolute value is the triangle inequality `\(|x+y|\le |x|+|y|\)` for all `\(x,y\in\mathbb R\)`, which is proven [here][bookofproofs$588].
