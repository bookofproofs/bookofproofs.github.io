For any two [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `\(n\)` and `\(m\)`, there is exactly one natural number `\(n+m\)`, called the **sum** of the natural numbers `\(n\)` and `\(m\)`. The operation "`\(+\)`" is called the **addition of natural numbers** and is defined recursively by 
`\[\begin{array}{ccl}
n+0&:=&n,\\
n+m^+&:=&(n+m)^+,
\end{array}
\]`
where `\(n^+\)` denotes the [successor][bookofproofs$504] of `\(n\)`.
