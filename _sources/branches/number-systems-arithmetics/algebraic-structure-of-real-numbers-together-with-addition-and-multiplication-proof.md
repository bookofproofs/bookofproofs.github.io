The [set of real numbers][bookofproofs$1105] `\(\mathbb R\)`, together with the [specific addition operation][bookofproofs$1514] 
"`\(+\)`", and the [specific multiplication operation][bookofproofs$1532] 
"`\(\cdot\)`", forms the  [field][bookofproofs$557] the algebraic structure `\((\mathbb R, + , \cdot)\)`. This is because:

1. We have [shown that][bookofproofs$1639] the set `\((\mathbb R, + )\)` is a commutative group.
1. We have [shown that][bookofproofs$1640] the set `\((\mathbb R^*, \cdot )\)` is a commutative group, in which `\(\mathbb R^*\)` denotes all non-zero real numbers.
