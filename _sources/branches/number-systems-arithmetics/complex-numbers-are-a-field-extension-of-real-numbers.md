Let `\((\mathbb R,\oplus,\odot)\)` be the [field of real numbers][bookofproofs$1638] and let `\((\mathbb C, + ,\cdot)\)` be the [field of complex numbers][bookofproofs$1690]. We define a [function][bookofproofs$592].
`\[f:=\cases{\mathbb R\to\mathbb C,\\
x\to (x,0).}\]`

Then `\(f\)` is an [bijective][bookofproofs$771] [field homomorphism][bookofproofs$559], i.e. for all `\(a,b\in\mathbb R\)`, we have

`\[\begin{array}{rcl}
f(a\oplus b)&=&f(a) + f(b),\\
f(a\odot b)&=&f(a) \cdot f(b).
\end{array}\]`

The following statements are equivalent: 

* "The field of real numbers is **embedded** in the field of complex numbers." 
* "The field of complex numbers is a **field extension** of the field of real numbers".
