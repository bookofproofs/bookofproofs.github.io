![sqrt2](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/sqrt2.jpg?raw=true)


The side `\(a\)` and the diagonal `\(d\)` in any square are [incommensurable][bookofproofs$1095].
`\[d=\sqrt{2}\cdot a.\]`

In particular and for `\(a=1\)`, there are no positive integers `\(q,p\)` such that
`\[q\cdot\sqrt 2=p\quad\text{or}\quad\sqrt 2=\frac pq.\]`
