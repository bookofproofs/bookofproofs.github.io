The following proof is based on arguments from the [elementary number theory][bookofproofs$67].
* Assume, `$\sqrt {2}=\frac pq$` is a [rational number][bookofproofs$1033].
* Without loss of generality, we can choose `$p$` and `$q$` [coprime][bookofproofs$8100].
* Then `$$2=\frac{p^2}{q^2}\Longleftrightarrow p^2=2q^2.$$`
* It follows from the [fundamental theorem of arithmetic][bookofproofs$8094] that `$p^2$` is [even][bookofproofs$8130].
* Therefore, `$p$` is also even, since it has `$2$` as a [prime][bookofproofs$8095] factor, or `$p=2n$` for a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `$n\in\mathbb N.$`
* Since `$p^2=4n^2=2q^2$` it follows that `$q^2$` is even, since `$q^2=2n^2$` as `$2$` as a prime factor. 
* But then, also `$q$` is even, following a similar argument as above for `$p.$`
* This is a [contradiction][bookofproofs$744] since `$p$` and `$q$` were chosen coprime.
