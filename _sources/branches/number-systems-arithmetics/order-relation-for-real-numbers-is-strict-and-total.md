This [order relation for real numbers][bookofproofs$1107] defines a [strict total order][bookofproofs$576] on the [set of real numbers][bookofproofs$1105]  `\(\mathbb R\)`, i.e.:

1. For any two elements `\(x,y\in\mathbb R\)` we have either `\(x < y\)` or `\(y < x\)` or `\(x = y\)` (but never more than one of these possibilities at the same time)  **trichotomy**)
1. If `\(x < y\)` and `\(y < z\)` then `\(x < z\)`  **transitivity**)
1. If `\(x < y\)` and `\(y < z\)` then `\(x < z\)`  **transitivity**)
