* Let the `\(n\)` be [even][bookofproofs$8130] and let `$m$` be [odd][bookofproofs$8130].
* By definition, `$2$` is a [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of `$n$`, but not of `$m.$` 
* Therefore `$n=2k$` and `$m=2l+1$` for some [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$k,l.$`
* For the product, it follows `\(nm=2k\cdot (2l+1)=2(k(2l+1))\)`, because the [multiplication of integers is associative][bookofproofs$1450].
* Therefore, `$2\mid nm.$` 
* Thus, the product `$nm$` is even.
