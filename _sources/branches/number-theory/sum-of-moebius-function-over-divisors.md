For any [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `$n\ge 1$`, the sum of the [Möbius function][bookofproofs$8116] over the [divisors][bookofproofs$700] of `$n$` equals `$0$` unless `$n=1$`. Only for this special case the sum equals `$1.$` Using the "Iverson notation 
 for sums":https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/sums/, this can be written as 

`$$\sum_{d\mid n}\mu(d)=[n=1].$$`
