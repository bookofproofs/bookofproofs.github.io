The following proposition demonstrates the [division with quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$818] we have introduced already provides an equivalent possibility to define congruences.

---

Let `$m > 0$` be the [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] being the [divisor][bookofproofs$700] in the [division with quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$818] of two [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$a,b\in\mathbb Z:$` 

`$$\begin{array}{rcll}
a&=&q_am+r_a&0\le r_a < m,\\
b&=&q_bm+r_b&0\le r_b < m.
\end{array}$$`

Then `$a$` is [congruent][bookofproofs$8153] to `$b$` if and only if they have the same remainder, formally 
`$$a\equiv b(m)\Longleftrightarrow r_a=r_b.$$`
