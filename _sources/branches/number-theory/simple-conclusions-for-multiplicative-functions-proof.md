* Let `$\beta:\mathbb N\to\mathbb C$` be [multiplicative][bookofproofs$505].
* Then there exists `$m\in\mathbb N$` with `$\beta(m)\neq 0.$`
* Because the multiplication of complex numbers is cancellative, it follows from `\(\beta(m)\beta(1)=\beta(m)\cdot 1\)` that `\(\beta(1)=1.\)`
* Moreover, if `$n=\prod_{i=1}^\infty p_i^{e_i}$` is the [factorization][bookofproofs$803] of `$n,$` then the [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] `$\gcd(p_i^{e_i},p_j^{e_j})=1$` for any two [prime][bookofproofs$473] numbers `$p_i\neq p_j.$`
* Therefore, the factors `$p_i^{e_i}$` and `$p_j^{e_j}$` are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093].
* From the multiplicativity of `$\beta$` it follows `$\beta(n)=\prod_{i=1}^\infty{\beta(p_i^{e_i})}.$`
