A [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f:\mathbb Z \mapsto \mathbb C$` is called **arithmetic** (another name: *number-theoretic*). 

### Notes 

* The domain of arithmetic functions is the set of [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$\mathbb Z.$`
* The codomain of arithmetic functions can be integers `$\mathbb Z,$` real numbers `$\mathbb R,$` or even complex numbers `$\mathbb C.$`
