In the case of [complete residue systems][bookofproofs$8173], the [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342] of [congruences][bookofproofs$8154] have been proved to be a [commutative ring][bookofproofs$8156] `$\mathbb Z_m.$` If the integer `$m$` was equal to a [prime number][bookofproofs$473] `$p$`, then the ring became even a field, which was proven in this [proposition][bookofproofs$8161]. But what happens to the structure, if we consider [reduced residue systems][bookofproofs$8174], i.e. if we allow only congruences classes [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093] to `$m$`? The following proposition clarifies this question.

Let `$m > 1$` be an [integer][bookofproofs$844]. The  [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342] `$(\mathbb Z_m^*,\cdot)$` containing the [congruence classes][bookofproofs$8154] of a [reduced residue systems][bookofproofs$8174] modulo `$m$` builds with respect to the multiplication operation "`$\cdot$`" a [commutative group][bookofproofs$553] called the *multiplicative group modulo `$m$`*.

### Notes

* The star in the notation `$\mathbb Z_m^*$` means that `$0\not\in\mathbb Z_m^*,$` since otherwise we would have `$m\in\mathbb Z_m^*,$` in contradiction to its elements being [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093] to `$m.$`
* For this reason, the multiplicative group `$\mathbb Z_p^*$` is not to be confused with the field `$\mathbb Z_p$` if `$p$` is a [prime number][bookofproofs$473]. 
* Similarly, an "addition" operation is not defined in `$\mathbb Z_m^*,$` like it was the case in the commutative ring `$\mathbb Z_m$` or in the field `$\mathbb Z_p.$`
