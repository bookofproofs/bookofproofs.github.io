* By hypothesis, `$p > 2$` is an [odd][bookofproofs$8130] [prime number][bookofproofs$473].
* In the proof of the [quadratic reciprocity law][bookofproofs$8205], we have derived[^1] the [congruence][bookofproofs$8153].
`$$\frac{p^2-1}8(q-1)\equiv \sum_{k=1}^{\frac{p-1}{2}}q_k+m\mod 2.$$` 
* For `$q=2$`, we have `$\frac{p^2-1}8\equiv m\mod 2.$` 
* Therefore, according to the [Gaussian lemma][bookofproofs$8208], the following formula for the [Legendre symbol][bookofproofs$8198] follows:
 `$$\left(\frac 2p\right)=(-1)^m=(-1)^{\frac{p^2-1}8}.$$`
