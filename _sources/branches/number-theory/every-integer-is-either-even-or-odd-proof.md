* Let `$m$` be an [integer][bookofproofs$844].
* According to the [Euclidean lemma about the quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$818]  there are unique integers `$q$` and `$r$` such that `$m=2q + r$` with `$0\le r < 2.$`
* Case `$r=0$`: Then `$m=2q$`, and `$m$` is [even][bookofproofs$8130] by definition.
* Case `$r=1$`: Then `$m=2q+1$`, and `$m$` is [odd][bookofproofs$8130] by definition.
* Since `$r$` must by either `$0$` or `$1$` because of `$0\le r < 2,$` it follows that every integer is either even or odd.
