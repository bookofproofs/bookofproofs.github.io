* Let `\(a,b\)` be given [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] with `\(b\neq 0\)`. 
* From [definition of quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$818] we have that the equation `\(b=qa+r\)` uniquely determines two other natural numbers `\(q,r\)` with `\(0\le r < a\)`. 
* We [have already shown][bookofproofs$8105] that `$q=\lfloor \frac ba\rfloor.$` 
* From [congruences and division with quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$8155], it follows that `\(r=b\mod a\)`.
