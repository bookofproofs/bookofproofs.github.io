Let `$0 < n < m$` be [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718]. The number `$k$` of the [positive][bookofproofs$1075] [multiples][bookofproofs$700] of `$n$` below `$m,$` i.e. the numbers `$n, 2n, 3n,\ldots,kn$` with `$kn\le m$` is given by the [floor function][bookofproofs$280] `$k=\left\lfloor \frac mn\right\rfloor.$`
