Let `\(d\in\mathbb Z\)` be an [integer][bookofproofs$844]. By `\(\mathbb Z_d\subseteq \mathbb Z\)` we denote the [subset][bookofproofs$552] of [integers][bookofproofs$718] [relatively prime][bookofproofs$8093] to `\(d\)`. Formally

`\[n\in \mathbb Z_d\Longleftrightarrow n\perp d.\]`

### Examples

* `\(\mathbb Z_0=\{1\}\)`, since `\(\gcd(n,0)=1\)` only for `\(n=1\)`.
* `\(\mathbb Z_1=\mathbb Z\)`, since `\(\gcd(n,1)=1\)` for all `\(n\in\mathbb Z\)`.
* `\(\mathbb Z_2\)` are all odd numbers, since `\(\gcd(n,2)=1\)` holds for odd numbers, only. 
* `\(\mathbb Z_p\)`, `$p$` being a prime number `\(p\)` are all integers not divisible by this prime number, since only for those we have `\(\gcd(n,p)=1.\)` 
* etc.
