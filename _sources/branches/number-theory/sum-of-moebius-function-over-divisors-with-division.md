For any [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `$n\ge 1$` with the factorization `$n=\prod_{k=1}^r p_k^{e_k},$` the sum of the [Möbius function][bookofproofs$8116] over the [divisors][bookofproofs$700] `$d\mid n$` and divided by those divisors `$d$` equals

`$$\sum_{d\mid n}\frac{\mu(d)}d=\prod_{k=1}^r\left(1-\frac 1{p_k}\right).$$`
