Let `\(a\)` be an [integer][bookofproofs$844] and let `\(p\)` be a [prime number][bookofproofs$473]. Then, the [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] of `\(p\)` and `\(a\)` is either `\(p\)` (if `\(p\)` [divides][bookofproofs$700] `\(a\)`), or `\(1\)` else. Formally,

`\[\gcd(p,a)=\cases{p,&\text{if }p\mid a\\1,&\text{if }p\not\mid a}\]`
