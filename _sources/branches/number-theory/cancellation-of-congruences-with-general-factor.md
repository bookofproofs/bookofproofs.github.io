The following proposition generalizes the previous proposition, which proves to be a special case of the following one with `$\gcd(c,m)=1.$`

---

Let the `$a,b,c$` be [integers][bookofproofs$844], and `$m > 1$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$d=\gcd(c,m)$` be the [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] of `$c$` and `$m$`. Then, from the equaility of the [congruences][bookofproofs$8154] `$$(ac)(m)\equiv (bc)(m)$$` it follows that `$$a\left(\frac md\right)\equiv b\left(\frac md\right).$$`

### Example
 `$3\cdot 2(8)\equiv 7\cdot 2(8)\Longrightarrow 3(4)\equiv 7(4).$`
