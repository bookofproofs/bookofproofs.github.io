Let `$m> 0$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075]. The relation "`$\equiv(m)$`" of being [congruent modulo `$m$`][bookofproofs$8153] is an [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574] `$\equiv(m)\subset\mathbb Z\times \mathbb Z,$` defined on the set of all [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$\mathbb Z.$` In particular, every element `$[a]$` of the [quotient set][bookofproofs$7991], written `$a(m)$`, is called the **congruence class modulo** `$m$`. The quotient set `$$\mathbb Z_m:=\mathbb Z/_{\equiv(m)}=\{0(m),1(m),\ldots,(m-1)(m)\}$$` contains the `$m$` congruence classes modulo `$m.$`
