Let `$a > 0$` and `$b > 0$` be [positive integers][bookofproofs$1075] which are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093] `$a\perp b.$` Then the integer `$ax+by$` runs through all values of 

* a [complete residue system][bookofproofs$8173] modulo `$ab,$` if the integers `$x$` (respectively `$y$`) run through all values of the complete residue systems modulo `$a$` (respectively `$b,$`) 
* a [reduced residue system][bookofproofs$8174] modulo `$ab,$` if the integers `$x$` (respectively `$y$`) run through all values of the reduced residue systems modulo `$a$` (respectively `$b.$`)
