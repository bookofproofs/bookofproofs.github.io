The following theorem was first proven by "Pierre de Fermat":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/pierre-de-fermat/ (1601 - 1665). He proved it for [prime numbers][bookofproofs$473] `$p$` `$$a^{p-1}(p)\equiv 1(p).$$` It is called *Fermat's little theorem* to distinguish it from [Fermat's last theorem][bookofproofs$8192].
Later, this result was generalized by "Euler":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/leonhard-euler/, therefore, it is now called the Euler-Fermat theorem.

Let `$m > 1$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$\phi(m)$` denote the [Euler function][bookofproofs$8117]. For any integer `$a\in\mathbb Z$` which is [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093] to `$m$` we have the [congruence][bookofproofs$8154] `$$a^{\phi(m)}(m)\equiv 1(m).$$`
