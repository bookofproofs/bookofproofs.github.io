The following theorem was first proven by <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Fermat/">Pierre de Fermat</a> (1601 - 1665). He proved it for [prime numbers][bookofproofs$473] `$p$` `$$a^{p-1}(p)\equiv 1(p).$$` It is called *Fermat's little theorem* to distinguish it from [Fermat's last theorem][bookofproofs$8192].
Later, this result was generalized by <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euler/">Euler</a>, therefore, it is now called the Euler-Fermat theorem.

Let `$m > 1$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$\phi(m)$` denote the [Euler function][bookofproofs$8117]. For any integer `$a\in\mathbb Z$` which is [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093] to `$m$` we have the [congruence][bookofproofs$8154] `$$a^{\phi(m)}(m)\equiv 1(m).$$`
