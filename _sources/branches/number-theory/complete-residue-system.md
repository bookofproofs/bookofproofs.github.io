Let `$m > 0$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075]. A *complete residue system modulo `$m$`* is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$C\subset\mathbb Z$` of exactly `$m$` integers such that each element `$a\in C$` corresponds to exactly one possible [congruence class][bookofproofs$8154] `$a(m).$`

In other words, `$C$` consists of _some given_ `$m$` integers `$a_1,\ldots,a_m$` _representing_ the [equivalence classes][bookofproofs$7990] `$a_1(m),\ldots,a_m(m)$` being the elements of the [quotient set][bookofproofs$7991] `$\mathbb Z_m.$`

### Examples

The following are complete residue systems modulo `$m$`:

`$$\begin{array}{rcl}C_1&=&\{0,1,\ldots,m-1\}.\\
C_2&=&\{1,2,\ldots, m\},\\ 
C_3&=&\{\lfloor\frac{-m}{2}\rfloor,\lfloor\frac{-m}{2}\rfloor+1,\ldots, \lfloor\frac{m}{2}\rfloor\}.\\
\end{array}$$`
