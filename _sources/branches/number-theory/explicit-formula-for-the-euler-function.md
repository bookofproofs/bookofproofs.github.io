If `$n=\prod_{k=1}^rp_1^{e_1}\cdots p_r^{e_1}$` is the [factorization][bookofproofs$803] of the [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `$n\ge 1,$` then the [Euler function][bookofproofs$8117] `$\phi(n)$` has the formula `$$\phi(n)=n\prod_{k=1}^r\left(1-\frac{1}{p_k}\right)=\prod_{k=1}^r p_k^{e_k-1}({p_k}-1).$$`
