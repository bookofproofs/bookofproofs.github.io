* Let the [integers][bookofproofs$844] `\(m, n\)` be [odd][bookofproofs$8130].
* By definition, `$2\not\mid n$` and `$2\not\mid m$` is a not [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of `$n$` and `$m.$`
* Therefore `$n=2k+1$` and `$m=2l+1$` for some [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$k,l.$`
* For the product, it follows `\(nm=(2k + 1)\cdot (2l + 1)=2(kl + k + l) + 1\)`, because of the [distributivity law for integers][bookofproofs$1466].
* Therefore, `$2\not \mid nm.$` 
* Thus, the product `$nm$` is odd.
