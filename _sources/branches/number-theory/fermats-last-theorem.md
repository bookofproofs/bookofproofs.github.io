The following theorem was stated by <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Fermat/">Pierre de Fermat</a> in 1630 when he first studied <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Diophantus/">Diophantus</a>' "Arithmetica". He wrote: 

> _I have discovered a truly remarkable proof which this margin is too small to contain._

Since he did not provide his proof, the theorem remained a conjecture for a long time and stimulated the research in number theory for decades and centuries. The conjecture was proven by [Andrew Wiles](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wiles/) only in the year 1995, using very complicated and sophisticated methods. It remains a mystery if Fermat really found a correct proof which was more simple.

No `$n > 2$` is an integer, no three [positive integers][bookofproofs$844] `$a,b,c\in\mathbb Z$` satisfy the equation `$$a^n+b^n=c^n.$$`
