*Twin primes*, or **twin prime numbers** are pairs of [prime numbers][bookofproofs$473], which differ only by `$2$`, i.e. pairs of numbers `\((p,p+2)\)` such that both, `\(p\)` and `\(p+2\)` are primes. 

### Example

The sequence of pairs twin primes begins with `\((3,5),~(5,7),~(11,13),~(17,19),~(29,31),\ldots\)`.
