Let `$m > 0$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$n\perp m$` be [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093]. If `$C=\{a_1,\ldots,a_m\}$` is a [complete residue system modulo `$m$`][bookofproofs$8173], then `$nC:=\{na_1,\ldots,na_m\}$` is also a complete residue system modulo `$m.$`

### Example

We can choose `$n\cdot 0,n\cdot 1,\ldots, n\cdot(m-1)$` for any `$n$` with `$\gcd(n,m)=1$` as a complete residue system modulo `$m.$`
