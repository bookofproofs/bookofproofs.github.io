Let `$m > 0$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$a_1,\ldots,a_r$` be [integers][bookofproofs$844]. Then the **sum** and the **product** of the [congruences][bookofproofs$8154] `$a_i(m)$`, `$i=1,\ldots,r$` are defined by

`$$\sum_{i=1}^ra_i(m):=\left(\sum_{i=1}^ra_i\right)(m),$$`

`$$\prod_{i=1}^ra_i(m):=\left(\prod_{i=1}^ra_i\right)(m).$$`

For any integer `$a$`, we set the **power** of the congruence `$a(m)$` by

`$$(a(m))^r:=(a^r)(m).$$`
