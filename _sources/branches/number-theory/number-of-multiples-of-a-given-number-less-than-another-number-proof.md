* Let `$0 < n,k < m$` be [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718].
* We have `$0 < k$` and `$kn\le m$` if and only if `$0 < k \le \frac mn.$`
* By the definition of the [floor function][bookofproofs$280], the number of [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `$\le x$` is given by `$\lfloor x \rfloor$` for any given [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `$x > 0.$`
* Therefore, if we set `$k=\left\lfloor \frac mn\right\rfloor,$` we get the number of the [positive][bookofproofs$1075] [multiples][bookofproofs$700] of `$n$` smaller or equal `$m.$`
