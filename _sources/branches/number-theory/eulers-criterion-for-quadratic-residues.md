From a [necessary condition for an integer to be prime][bookofproofs$8191] it follows that `$n^{\frac{p-1}{2}}(p)\equiv\pm 1(p),$` since `$n^{p-1}(p)\equiv 1(p)$` if `$p\not\mid n$` and `$p$` is a [prime number][bookofproofs$473]. This motivates the following criterion, found by [Leonhard Euler](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euler/).

Let `$p > 2$` be a [prime number][bookofproofs$473] and let `$n\in\mathbb Z$` be a given [integer][bookofproofs$844]. The [Legendre symbol modulo][bookofproofs$8198] `$p$` can be calculated using the formula

`$$\left(\frac np\right)(p)\equiv n^{\frac{p-1}{2}}(p).$$`

In particular:
* `$n$` is a [quadratic residue modulo][bookofproofs$8196] `$p$` if and only if `$p\not\mid n$` and `$n^{\frac{p-1}{2}}(p)\equiv 1(p),$`
* `$n$` is a quadratic nonresidue modulo `$p$` if and only if `$p\not\mid n$` and `$n^{\frac{p-1}{2}}(p)\equiv (p-1)(p)\equiv -1(p),$`
* otherwise, we have `$p\mid n$` and `$n^{\frac{p-1}{2}}(p)\equiv 0(p).$`
