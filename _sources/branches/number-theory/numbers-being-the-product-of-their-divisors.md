Most problems of the _additive number theory_, with which we are dealing with in this chapter, are often hard to solve just. This is because they are additive in nature. The problem of finding numbers being the _product of their divisors_ is related to the additive problem of finding [perfect numbers][bookofproofs$8131], but much more simple to solve. We provide it here as an illustrative example of how much simpler a related multiplicative problem can be in relation to fining the solutions of an additive number-theoretic problem.

The [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `$n$` is the [product][bookofproofs$876] of all its [divisors][bookofproofs$700] `$$\prod_{d\mid n}d=n^2$$` if and only if `$n=p^3$` for some [prime number][bookofproofs$473] `$p$` or `$n=p_ip_j$` for some prime numbers `$p_i\neq p_j.$`
