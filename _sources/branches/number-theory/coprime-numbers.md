The [integers][bookofproofs$844]  `\(a,b\)` are called *co-prime* (or **relatively prime**), if their [greates common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] i`\(\gcd(a,b)=1\)`, i.e. if `\(1\)` is the only [positive common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] is equal `$1$`, i.e. `$\gcd(a,b)=1.$` 

*Coprimality* is a [relation][bookofproofs$571] "`$\perp$`" defined on the set of integers `$\perp\subseteq\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z$` by 
`\[a\perp b:\Leftrightarrow\gcd(a,b)=1.\]`
