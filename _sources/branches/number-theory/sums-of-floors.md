For any [real number][bookofproofs$1105] `$\alpha\in\mathbb R$` and any two [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$x,y\in\mathbb Z$` with `$y\neq 0,$` the following closed formula for the [sum][bookofproofs$261] of [floor function][bookofproofs$280] holds:
`$$\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}\left\lfloor\frac{xk+\alpha}m\right\rfloor=d\left\lfloor\frac{\alpha}d\right\rfloor +\frac{y-1}{2}x+\frac{d-y}{2},$$`
where `$d=\gcd(x,y)$` is the [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] of `$x$` and `$y.$`
