If `\(c > 0\)` is a [common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] of two [integers][bookofproofs$844] `\(a\)` and `\(b\)`, and if the integers `$\frac ac$` and `\(\frac bc\)` are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093], then `\(c\)` is the [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] of `\(a\)` and `\(b\)`, formally

`\[c > 0\wedge c\mid a\wedge c\mid b\wedge \frac ac\perp \frac bc\Rightarrow c=\gcd(a,b).\]`
