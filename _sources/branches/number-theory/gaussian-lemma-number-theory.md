Let `$p > 2$` be an [odd][bookofproofs$8130] [prime number][bookofproofs$473] and let `$n$` be an integer not [divisible][bookofproofs$700] by `$p$` ($p\not\mid n$). The [Legendre symbol][bookofproofs$8198] `$\left(\frac np\right)$` can be calculated via the formula
`$$\left(\frac np\right)=(-1)^m,$$`
where `$m\ge 0$` is the number of [congruence classes][bookofproofs$8154] modulo `$p$` represented by `$\frac{p-1}2$` residues `$$ n,2n,3n,\dots ,{\frac  {p-1}{2}}n\mod p$$`
which are `$ > \frac{p}{2}$` (i.e. `$\ge\frac{p+1}2$`).
