The _additive number theory_ is a subdiscipline of number theory dealing with problems of [sums][bookofproofs$261] in the set `$\mathbb Z$` of [integers][bookofproofs$844], sometimes also only positive integers, i.e. the set `$\mathbb N$` of [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718]. There are many famous problems from this subdiscipline, some of which are still unsolved, including the [Goldbach conjecture][bookofproofs$448].
We start with some elementary results concerning special sums of integers, namely the sum of divisors of a given natural number `$n > 0.$`
