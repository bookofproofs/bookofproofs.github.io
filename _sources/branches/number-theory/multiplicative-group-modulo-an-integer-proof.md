* Let `$m > 1$` be an [integer][bookofproofs$844] and let the set `$\mathbb Z_m^*$` contain only those [congruence classes][bookofproofs$8154] modulo `$m$`, which are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093] to `$m$`.
* [Creation of reduced residue systems from others][bookofproofs$8177] demonstrates that  `$(\mathbb Z_m^*,\cdot)$` is closed under the multiplication operation `$"\cdot".$` 
* Moreover, "`$\cdot$`" is [commutative][bookofproofs$672] and [associative][bookofproofs$668] (since it was in the ring `$\mathbb Z_m.$`
* Moreover, we have `$1(m)\in\mathbb Z_m^*.$`
* It follows from the [existence and number of solutions of congruence with one variable][bookofproofs$8178] that the congruence `$(ax)(m)\equiv 1(m)$` has a unique solution `$x:=a^{-1}(m)\in\mathbb Z_m^*$` for every `$a(m)\in\mathbb Z_m^*.$` 
* Thus, each `$a(m)\in\mathbb Z_m^*$` has a [multiplicative inverse][bookofproofs$670].
* Altogether, we have shown that the [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342] `$(\mathbb Z_m^*,\cdot)$` is a [commutative group][bookofproofs$553].
