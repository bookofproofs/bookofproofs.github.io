* By hypothesis, `$a,b$` are [integers][bookofproofs$844], `$n > 0, m > 0$` are [positive integers][bookofproofs$1075], and `$m\mid n.$` 
* By [definition of divisor][bookofproofs$700], there is an integer `$c > 0$` such that `$n=cm.$` 
* By hypothesis `$a(n)\equiv b(n),$` which means `$a(cm)\equiv b(cm).$`
* By the [definition of congruence][bookofproofs$8154], `$cm\mid (a-b).$`
* By the [divisibility law no. 3][bookofproofs$508], since `$m\mid cm$`, it follows `$m\mid (a-b).$`
* Therefore, `$a(m)\equiv b(m).$`
