* Let the [integers][bookofproofs$844] `\(m, n\)` be [even][bookofproofs$8130].
* By definition, `$2$` is a [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of `$n$` and `$m.$`
* Therefore `$n=2k$` and `$m=2l$` for some [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$k,l.$`
* For the product, it follows `\(nm=2k\cdot 2l=2(k2l)\)`, because the [multiplication of integers is associative][bookofproofs$1450].
* Therefore, `$2\mid nm.$` 
* Thus, the product `$nm$` is even.
