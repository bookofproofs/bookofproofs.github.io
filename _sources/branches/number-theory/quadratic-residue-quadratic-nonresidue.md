Let `$m > 0$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075]. An [integer][bookofproofs$844] `$n\in\mathbb Z$` is called a **quadratic residue modulo** `$m,$` if the [congruence][bookofproofs$8153] `$$x^2(m)\equiv n(m)$$` is solvable, otherwise it is called a **quadratic nonresidue**.

### Examples

* For the module `$m=1$`, any integers `$n$` is a residue, since `$x^2(1)\equiv 0 (1)\equiv n(1)$` is always solvable. 
* If `$n=0,$` `$n=1,$` or `$n$` is a perfect square, then `$n$` is a quadratic residue modulo any positive integer `$m > 0.$`
