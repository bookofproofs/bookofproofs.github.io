This law conjectured by <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euler/">Leonhard Euler</a> (1707 â€“ 1783) and first proven by <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Gauss/">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> (1777 - 1855).

Let `$p > 2$` and `$q > 2$` be [odd][bookofproofs$8130] and distinct [prime numbers][bookofproofs$473]. Then the the product of the [Legendre symbols][bookofproofs$8198] has the following explicit formula:

`$$\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)\cdot \left(\frac{p}{q}\right)=(-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}\frac{q-1}{2}}.$$`

In particular:
* If `$p\equiv q\equiv 1 \mod 4,$` then the [congruences][bookofproofs$8153] `$x^2(q)\equiv p(q),$` and `$x^2(p)\equiv q(p)$` are either both solvable or both not solvable.
* If `$p\equiv q\equiv 3\mod 4,$` then one of the [congruences][bookofproofs$8153] `$x^2(q)\equiv p(q),$` and `$x^2(p)\equiv q(p)$` is solvable, the other not solvable.
