* Suppose that `\(p_1,~p_2,~\ldots,~p_r\)` are all existing primes. 
* Let `\(N=p_1p_2\cdots p_r\)`. 
* There must exist a [prime number][bookofproofs$473] `\(p\)`, which divides the natural number `\((N-1)\)`, which also must divide `\(N\)`, by assumption. 
* From the [divisibility law no. 6][bookofproofs$508] it follows from `\(p\mid (N-1)\)` and `\(p\mid N\)` that `\(p\mid 1\)`, which is impossible.
