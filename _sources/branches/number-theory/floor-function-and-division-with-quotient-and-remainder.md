For two integers `$a,b\in\mathbb Z$` with `$a > 0,$` the quotient `$q$` in the [division with quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$818] `$$b=qa+r,\quad 0\le r< a$$` can be exactly determined by [floor function][bookofproofs$280] `$q=\lfloor \frac ba\rfloor$`, i.e. we have  `$$b=\left\lfloor\frac ba\right\rfloor a+r,\quad 0\le r< a.$$`
