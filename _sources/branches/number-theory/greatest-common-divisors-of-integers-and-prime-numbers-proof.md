* It follows from the definition of [prime numbers][bookofproofs$473] that `\(p > 1\)` and that `\(p\)` has only the trivial [divisors][bookofproofs$700] `\(1\)` and `\(p\)`. 
* Therefore the [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] of `\(p\)` is `\(p\)` itself. 
* Now, if `\(p\)` [divides][bookofproofs$700] the [integer][bookofproofs$844] `\(a\)`, then the [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] of `\(p\)` and `\(a\)` must be `\(p\)`. 
* The first part of the proposition follows: `$p\mid a\Rightarrow \gcd(p,a)=p.$`
* Now, assume that `\(p\not\mid a\)`. 
   * Because `\(1\)` and `\(p\)` are the only divisors of `\(p\)`, we must have either `\(\gcd(p,a)=1\)`, or `\(\gcd(p,a)=p\)`. 
   * Because `\(p\not\mid a\)`, only the first is possible. 
* This completes the proof

`\[p\not |a\Longrightarrow \gcd(p,a)=1.\]`
