For a [prime number][bookofproofs$473] `$p > 2$` the following formula for the [Legendre symbol][bookofproofs$8198] holds:

`$$\left(\frac {-1}p\right)=(-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}}.$$`

More in detail, this law states that
`$$\left(\frac {-1}p\right)=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }p\equiv 1\mod 4,\\-1&\text{if }p\equiv -1\mod 4.\end{cases}$$`

In particular, the [congruence][bookofproofs$8153] `$x^2(p)\equiv -1(p)$` is only solvable, if `$p$` has the form `$p\equiv \pm 1\mod 4,$` and any [odd][bookofproofs$8130] prime factor of the integer `$x^2+1$` has the form `$p\equiv \pm 1\mod 4.$`
