Let `$n,m$` be [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] with `$n\ge 1,$` `$m\ge 1,$` and the [factorizations][bookofproofs$803] `$n=\prod_{i=1}^\infty p_i^{e_i}$` and `$m=\prod_{i=1}^\infty p_i^{f_i}.$` Then the [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] `$\gcd(n,m)$` and the [least common multiple][bookofproofs$1276] `$\operatorname{lcm}(n,m)$` have the following factorizations:

`$$\gcd(n,m)=\prod_{i=1}^\infty p_i^{\min(e_i,f_i)},\quad \operatorname{lcm}(n,m)=\prod_{i=1}^\infty p_i^{\max(e_i,f_i)},$$`

where `$\min(e_i,f_i)$` and `$\max(e_i,f_i)$` are the [minimum][bookofproofs$7995] or the [maximum][bookofproofs$7995] of the respective exponents `$e_i,f_i.$`
