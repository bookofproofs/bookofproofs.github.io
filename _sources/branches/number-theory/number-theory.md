_Number theory_ is a branch of mathematics dealing with the _divisibility properties_ of [integers][bookofproofs$118] and in algebraic number fields. 

Many problems in number theory can be easily formulated, for instance: What are the integer solutions of a given equation? How many prime numbers are less or equal a given number `$n\ge 0$`? How many lattice points are there inside a circle/an ellipse? Can every even number be represented as a sum of two prime numbers? 

These, and many other number-theoretic questions sound very elementary but turned out to be very hard to answer and many of them have resisted to be answered even until today. However, these hard problems have inspired mathematicians over centuries to develop new ideas and instruments which stimulated even other branches of mathematics. 

### Theoretical minimum (in a nutshell)

* You should be acquainted with [arithmetics][bookofproofs$195].
* When reading about algebraic number fields, you will have to recap concepts from [algebra][bookofproofs$59].
* When dealing with analytical number theory, you will have to use some methods from [complex analysis][bookofproofs$58] and [sum manipulation methods][bookofproofs$1113].
### Concepts you will learn in this part of <strong><span style='color:orange'>Bookof</span><span style='color:lightblue'>Proofs</span></strong>

* In the _elementary number theory_, we will be dealing with _divisibility_, _prime numbers_, _characters_ and methods for solving _Diophantine equations_.
* In the _analytical number theory_ we will be dealing with the _distribution of prime numbers_ and methods to quantify it, including _sieve methods_ and also with the _Gamma function_ and the _Riemann hypothesis_.
* In the _algebraic number theory_,  the concept of divisibility will be extended to general _algebraic number fields_.
* In the _additive number theory_, we will be dealing with the _additive properties_ of prime numbers and with the progress made in solving the _Goldbach hypothesis_.
