* By hypothesis, `$m_1,\ldots,m_r$` are [positive integers][bookofproofs$1075] which are pairwise [co-prime][bookofproofs$809].
* The [Diophantine equation of congruences][bookofproofs$8159] `$f(x)(m_1\cdots m_r)\equiv 0(m_1\cdots m_r)\label{eq:E18602a}\tag{1}$` has only solutions if and only if the equations `$f(x)(m_i)\equiv 0(m_i)\label{eq:E18602b}\tag{2}$` do for `$i=1,\ldots,r.$`
* Therefore, according to the [Chinese remainder theorem][bookofproofs$8182], there is a [bijection][bookofproofs$771] between the solutions of `$(\ref{eq:E18602a})$` modulo the product `$(m_1\cdots m_r)$` and the solutions of `$(\ref{eq:E18602b})$` modulo the `$r$` numbers `$m_1,m_2,\ldots m_r.$`
