Let `$m > 1$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$(f(x_1,\ldots,x_r))(m)=0(m)$` be a [Diophantine equation of congruences][bookofproofs$8159] modulo `$m$`. Then the number of distinct solutions, i.e. [ordered tuples][bookofproofs$747] `$(a_1(m),\ldots,a_r(m))$` solving this equation
`$$f(a_1(m),\ldots,a_r(m))\equiv0(m)$$`

is [finite][bookofproofs$985].
### Example

The equation `$x^2(8)-1(8)\equiv 0(8)$` (can also be written as `$x^2\equiv 1\mod 8$`) has only the four solutions `$1(8),3(8),5(8),7(8).$`
