Let `$m > 1$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$f(x_1,\ldots,x_r)=0$` be a [Diophantine equation][bookofproofs$8158]. If [integers][bookofproofs$844]  `$a_1,\ldots,a_r$` solving this equation[^1] exist, then the congruences `$a_1(m),\ldots,a_r(m)$` solve also the **Diophantine equation of congruences modulo** `$m$`, i.e. we have
`$$(f(a_1,\ldots,a_r))(m)\equiv f(a_1(m),\ldots,a_r(m))\equiv 0(m).$$`

[^1]: i.e. by setting `$x_r=a_1,\ldots,x_r=a_r.$` Note that a solution does not have to exist, for instance `$x^3+y^3=z^3$` has no integer solutions.
