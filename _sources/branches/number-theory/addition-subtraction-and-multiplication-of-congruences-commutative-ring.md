Let `$a,b$` be [integers][bookofproofs$844] and `$m > 0$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075]. Then the **addition** "`$+$`", **subtraction** "`$-$`", 
and **multiplication** "`$\cdot$`" operations of the [congruence classes][bookofproofs$8154] `$a(m), b(m)\in\mathbb Z_m$` are well-defined, setting

`$$\begin{array}{rcl}
a(m)+b(m)&:=&(a+b)(m),\\
a(m)-b(m)&:=&(a-b)(m),\\
a(m)\cdot b(m)&:=&(a\cdot b)(m).\\
\end{array}$$`

and applying the [addition][bookofproofs$890], [subtraction][bookofproofs$1585] and [multiplication of integers][bookofproofs$891]. In particular, the [algebraic structure][bookofproofs$342] `$(\mathbb Z_m,\cdot,+)$` of ever [complete residue system modulo `$m$`][bookofproofs$8173] is a [commutative unit ring][bookofproofs$880].
