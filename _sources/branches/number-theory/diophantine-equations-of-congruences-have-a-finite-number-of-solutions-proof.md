* Let `$m > 1$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075].
* If the [Diophantine equation of congruences][bookofproofs$8159] modulo `$m$`  `$(f(x_1,\ldots,x_r))(m)=0(m)$` has no solution, then the number of solutions is `$0 < \infty.$`
* If it has a solution `$(a_1(m),\ldots,a_r(m)),$` then, by [congruences and division with quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$8155], there are at most `$m$` [ordered tuples][bookofproofs$747] solving this equation and containing the congruence class `$a_k(m)$` at the index `$k$`, `$1\le k\le r.$`
* Since this argument is valid for all indices `$k=1,\ldots,r$`, there are at most `$m^r < \infty$` ordererd tuples solving the equation.
* Altogether, the number of solutions is [finite][bookofproofs$985].
