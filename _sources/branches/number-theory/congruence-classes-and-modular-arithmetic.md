_Congruence classes_ (or shorter _congruences_) are powerful mathematical tools, simplifying many calculations with integers. The arithmetic associated with congruences is called **modular arithmetic**. In this kind of arithmetic, we simplify calculations by replacing each integer with its remainder when divided by some fixed positive integer `$n.$` The simplification effect of this is that the whole, infinite set of [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$\mathbb Z$` is replaced by a much smaller set `$\mathbb Z_n$` which contains only a finite number `$n$` of elements. We will see that we can add, subtract and multiply numbers in `$\mathbb Z_n.$` Just as it is the case in `$\mathbb Z$`, there are some difficulties with the division.  In this sense, `$\mathbb Z_n$` inherits many properties of integers but, because it is finite, it is much easier to work with.
