The following proposition provides also a very inefficient method of prooving if an integer is a prime number.

---

An [integer][bookofproofs$844] `$n > 1$` is a [prime number][bookofproofs$473] if and only if the following [congruence][bookofproofs$8154] holds:

`$$(n-1)!\equiv -1\mod n.$$`

### Notes

* In this equation, `$(n-1)!$` denotes the [factorial][bookofproofs$1005] of `$(n-1).$` 
* This proposition is also known as *Wilson's theorem*, called after its discoverer, [John Wilson](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wilson_John/) (1741 - 1793).
