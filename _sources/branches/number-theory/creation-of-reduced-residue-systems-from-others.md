Let `$m > 0$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$n\perp m$` be [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093]. If `$R=\{a_1,\ldots,a_{\phi(m)}\}$` is a [reduced residue system modulo `$m$`][bookofproofs$8174], then `$nR:=\{na_1,\ldots,na_{\phi(m)}\}$` is also a reduced residue system modulo `$m.$`
