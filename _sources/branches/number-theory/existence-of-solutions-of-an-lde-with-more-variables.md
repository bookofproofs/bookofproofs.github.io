For a given [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] `$m > 0$` and given integers `$a_1,\ldots,a_r,b$`, the LDE (linear [Diophantine equation][bookofproofs$8158]) with `$r$` variables `$$a_1x_1+\ldots+a_rx_r=b$$` is solvable, if and only if `$\gcd(a_1,\ldots,a_r)\mid b,$` i.e. if and only if the [greatest common divisor of the `$r$` numbers][bookofproofs$8122] of `$a_1,\ldots,a_r$` is also a [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of `$b.$`

### Note

* The existence of a solution for two positive integers was first proven in 1624 by "Bachet":https://www.bookofproofs.org/history/claude-gaspar-bachet-de-meziriac/.
* See also [extended greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$8223] algorithm for the calculation of `$a_1x_1+a_2x_2=\gcd(a_1,a_2).$` By multiplying the solutions `$x_1,x_2$` with `$\frac{b}{\gcd(a_1,a_1)}$` and by induction, this algorithm can be used to solve the general case.
