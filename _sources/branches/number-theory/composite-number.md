The [previous proposition][bookofproofs$8095] shows that the [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] are either [primes][bookofproofs$704] or products of more than one prime. The latter numbers have more than two [divisors][bookofproofs$700] and are therefore by definition not prime numbers. These non-prime numbers deserve their own definition.

All [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] `\(n\)` with `\(n > 1 \)`, which are not [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704], are called **composite**.
