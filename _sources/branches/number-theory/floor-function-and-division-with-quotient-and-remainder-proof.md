* Let `$a,b\in\mathbb Z$` with `$a > 0,$` be [integers][bookofproofs$844] with `$a > 0$` and let `$q,r$` be uniquely determined by the [division with quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$818] `$b=qa+r,$` with `$0\le r < a.$`
* It follows that `$qa \le b=qa+r < (q+1)a.$`
* This is equivalent to `$q\le \frac ba < q+1.$`
* By definition of the [floor function][bookofproofs$280], `$q=\lfloor \frac ba\rfloor.$`
