Let `\(a > 0\)`, `\(b > 0\)` are [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718]. Then the [least common multiple][bookofproofs$1276] `\(\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)\)` and the [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] `\(\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)\)` are related with each other as follows:
`\[\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)\cdot \operatorname{gcd}(a,b)=a\cdot b.\]`
