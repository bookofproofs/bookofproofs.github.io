The following corollary demonstrates that in order to calculate the value `$\beta(n)$` of a [multiplicative function][bookofproofs$505] `$\beta:\mathbb N\to\mathbb C$` it is sufficient to know the values of `$\beta(p^e)$` on all maximal powers of [prime numbers][bookofproofs$473] `$p^e$` with `$p^e\mid n.$`

For all [multiplicative functions][bookofproofs$505] `$\beta:\mathbb N\to\mathbb C$` we have `$\beta(1)=1$` and `$$\beta(n)=\prod_{i=1}^\infty{\beta(p_i^{e_i})}$$` for the [factorization][bookofproofs$803] of `$n=\prod_{i=1}^\infty p_i^{e_i}.$`
