The following proposition was already proven by [Euclid](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euclid/) about 300 B.C. and is therefore also called a **Euclidian** division.

Let `$a,b\in\mathbb Z$` be [integers][bookofproofs$844]. If `$a > 0$` then there are uniquely determined integers `$q,r$` with `$$b=qa+r,\quad 0\le r< a.$$`

We call the number `$r$` a **remainder**, the number `$q$` is called the **quotient** of the division. In the special case `$r=0$` we have that `$a\mid b,$` i.e. `$a$` is a [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of `$b.$`
