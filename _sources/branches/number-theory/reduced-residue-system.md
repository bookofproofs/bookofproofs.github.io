Let `$m > 0$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$C=\{a_1,\ldots,a_m\}$` a [complete residue system modulo `$m$`][bookofproofs$8173]. We call `$R$` a *reduced residue system modulo `$m$`*, if `$R$` is a [subset][bookofproofs$552] `$R\subseteq C$` consisting only of those integers, which are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093] to `$m.$`

Note: With the [Euler function][bookofproofs$8117] `$\phi$`, it follows that `$R$` has `$\phi(m)$` elements.
