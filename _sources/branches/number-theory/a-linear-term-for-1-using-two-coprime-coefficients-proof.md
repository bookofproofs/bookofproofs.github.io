* The linear equation `$ax+by=1$` is solvable, which follows immediately from the [existence of solutions of an LDE with more variables][bookofproofs$8179] for `$r=2$` and the coefficients `$a,b$` being [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093].
* If `$x_0,y_0$` are solutions of the above equation, then it follows from [all solutions given a solution of an LDE with two variables][bookofproofs$8181] that all solutions have the form `$x=x_0+hb$` and `$y=y_0-hb$` for all [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$h\in\mathbb Z.$`
