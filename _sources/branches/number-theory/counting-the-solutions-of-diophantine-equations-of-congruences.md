We have seen that the [Diophantine equations of congruences have a finite number of solutions][bookofproofs$8160], if they are solvable. Now, we are able to provide a counting principle for the solutions of solvable [Diophantine equation of congruences][bookofproofs$8159].

Let `$m_1,\ldots,m_r$` be [positive integers][bookofproofs$1075] with `$m_i\perp m_j$` [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093], whenever `$i\neq j.$` Furthermore, let `$$f(x)(m_1\cdots m_r)\equiv 0(m_1\cdots m_r)\label{eq:N18599}\tag{1}$$` be a [Diophantine equation of congruences][bookofproofs$8159]. The number of solutions of the equation `$(\ref{eq:N18599})$` is equal the product of the numbers of solutions of the equations

`$$\begin{array}{rcl}f(x)(m_1)&\equiv&0(m_1)\\
&\vdots&\\
f(x)(m_r)&\equiv&0(m_r).
\end{array}$$`

In particular, if `$m=\prod_{i=1}^rp_i^{e_i}$` is a [factorization][bookofproofs$803] of some positive integer `$m > 0,$` then the number of solutions of `$f(x)(m)\equiv 0(m)$` equals the product of the `$r$` numbers of solutions of `$f(x)(p_i^{e_i})\equiv 0(p_i^{e_i})$`, `$i=1,\ldots,r.$`
