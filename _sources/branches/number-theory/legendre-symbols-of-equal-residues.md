Let `$p > 2$` be a [prime number][bookofproofs$473]. If two integers `$n,m\in\mathbb Z$` belong to the same [congruence classes][bookofproofs$8154] modulo `$p$` then their [Legendre symbols][bookofproofs$8198] modulo `$p$` are equal, formally `$$n(p)\equiv m(p)\Longrightarrow \left(\frac np\right)=\left(\frac {m}p\right).$$`
