An [arithmetic][bookofproofs$8112] function `\(\beta\)`  with at least one `\(m\in\mathbb N\)` with `\(\beta(m)\neq 0\)` is called:

1. **multiplicative**, `\(\beta(mn)=\beta(m)\beta(n)\)` for all [relatively prime][bookofproofs$8093] `\(m,n\in\mathbb N\)`,
1. **multiplicative**, `\(\beta(mn)=\beta(m)\beta(n)\)` for all [relatively prime][bookofproofs$8093] `\(m,n\in\mathbb N\)`,
