Let `$p > 2$` be a [prime number][bookofproofs$473]. In every [reduced residue system modulo][bookofproofs$8174] `$p$` there are exactly `$\frac{p-1}{2}$` [quadratic residues modulo][bookofproofs$8196] `$p$` and exactly `$\frac{p-1}{2}$` [quadratic nonresidues modulo][bookofproofs$8196] `$p.$` Moreover, the `$\frac{p-1}{2}$` quadratic residues are represented by the [congruence classes modulo][bookofproofs$8154] `$p$` of the integers `$1^2,2^2,\ldots,\left(\frac{p-1}{2}\right)^2.$`

In particular, for every prime `$p > 2,$` the [Legendre symbol][bookofproofs$8198] `$\left(\frac{n}{p}\right)$` takes in the interval `$1\le n\le p-1$` exactly `$\frac{p-1}{2}$` times the value `$1$` and exactly `$\frac{p-1}{2}$` times the value `$-1.$`
