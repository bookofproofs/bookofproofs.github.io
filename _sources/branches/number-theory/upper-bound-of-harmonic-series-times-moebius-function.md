The [infinite series][bookofproofs$1109] built from terms of the [harmonic series][bookofproofs$237] `$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}$` multiplied by the [Möbius function][bookofproofs$8116] `$\mu(n)$` has the following [upper bound][bookofproofs$584]:

`$$\left|\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n}\right|\le 1.$$`
