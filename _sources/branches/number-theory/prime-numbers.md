A **prime number** or short a **prime** `$p$` is a [natural number][bookofproofs$718], which has exactly two [divisors][bookofproofs$700], namely its [trivial divisors][bookofproofs$700] `\(1\)` and `\(p\)`.

We denote consecutive prime numbers by `\(p_i, i=1,2,\ldots\)` (for instance, `\(p_1=2, p_2=3, p_3=5, p_4=7, p_5=11,\ldots\)`) and the [set][bookofproofs$550] of all primes as `\[\mathbb P:=\{p_i,~i=1,2,\ldots\}.\]`
