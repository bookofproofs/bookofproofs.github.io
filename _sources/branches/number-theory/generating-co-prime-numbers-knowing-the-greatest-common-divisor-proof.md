* Let `\(a\)` and `\(b\)` be [integers][bookofproofs$844] with `\(d=\gcd(a,b)\)`. 
* If `\(f > 0\)` is a [common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] of `\(\frac ad\)` and `\(\frac bd\)`, then it follows from the [divisibility law no. 8][bookofproofs$508] that `$fd\mid a,$` and `$fd\mid b.$`
* Therefore, from the [definition of the greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280], we must have `$fd\mid d,$` and `$fd\mid d.$`
* Applying [divisibility law no. 7][bookofproofs$508], it follows that `$f\mid 1,$` and therefore `$f=1.$`
* By definition, the integers `\(\frac ad\)` and `\(\frac bd\)` are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093].
