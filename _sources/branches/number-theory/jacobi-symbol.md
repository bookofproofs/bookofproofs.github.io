Let `$n > 0$` be an [odd][bookofproofs$8130] and [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] with the [factorization][bookofproofs$803] `$n=p_1^{e_1}\cdots p_r^{e_r}.$` For an [integer][bookofproofs$844] `$a\in\mathbb Z,$` the **Jacobi symbol** of `$a$` modulo `$n$` is an [arithmetic function][bookofproofs$8112] defined by

`$$\left(\frac an\right):=\left(\frac a{p_1}\right)^{e_1}\cdots \left(\frac a{p_r}\right)^{e_r},$$`
where `$\left(\frac a{p_i}\right)$` denote the [Legendre symbols][bookofproofs$8198] of `$a$` modulo the [prime numbers][bookofproofs$473] `$p_i$` dividing `$n.$`
