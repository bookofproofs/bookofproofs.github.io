The question, whether a congruence `$ax(m)\equiv b(m)$` is solvable if `$m=p$` is a [prime number][bookofproofs$473], has been positively answered above in the proposition [cancellation of congruences][bookofproofs$8161]. But how about the case, if `$m$` is not a prime number? The following proposition answers this question.

For a given [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] `$m > 0$` and given integers `$a,b$` the [congruence][bookofproofs$8153] with one variable `$$(ax)(m)\equiv b(m)$$` is solvable, if and only if `$\gcd(a,m)\mid b,$` i.e. if and only if the [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] of `$a$` and `$m$` is also a [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of `$b.$` Moreover, if it is solvable, then it has exactly `$\gcd(a,m)$` different solutions.
