Let `$p,q\in\mathbb Z$` be [odd][bookofproofs$8130] and [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093] integers with `$p > 2$` and `$q > 2.$` Then the following closed formula for the [sum][bookofproofs$261] of [floor functions][bookofproofs$280] holds: `$$\sum_{k=1}^{\frac{p-1}{2}}\left\lfloor\frac{kq}p\right\rfloor+\sum_{l=1}^{\frac{q-1}{2}}\left\lfloor\frac{lp}q\right\rfloor=\frac{p-1}{2}\cdot\frac{q-1}{2}.$$`
