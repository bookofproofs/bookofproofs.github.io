* By definition, every [Diophantine equation][bookofproofs$8158] `$f(x_1,\ldots,x_r)$` is a [sum][bookofproofs$261] of terms and each term is a product of one or more powers of the variables `$x_1,\ldots,x_n.$`
* The claim now follows immediately from the corollary [sums, products, and powers of congruences][bookofproofs$8157] modulo the [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] `$m.$`
