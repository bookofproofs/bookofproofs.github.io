* The [sum][bookofproofs$261] and product formulae follow by [induction][bookofproofs$657] from the proposition about 
[addition, subtraction and multiplication of congruences][bookofproofs$8156][^1].

* The power formula follows from the product formula by setting `$a:=a_1=\ldots=a_r.$`


[^1]: In particular, the sum formula is also true, if it involves [negative integers][bookofproofs$1075].
