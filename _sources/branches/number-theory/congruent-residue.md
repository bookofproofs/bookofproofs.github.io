Let `$m > 0$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] `$a$` is called **congruent** to `$b$` (or `$a$` is called a **residue** of `$b$`) **modulo** `$m$`, written `$$a\equiv b \mod m$$`
or shorter
`$$a\equiv b (m),$$`
if `$m\mid a-b,$` i.e. if `$m$` is a [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of the [difference][bookofproofs$1585] `$a-b.$`
