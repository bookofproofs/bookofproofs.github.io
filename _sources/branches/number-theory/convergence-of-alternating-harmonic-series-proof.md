Since the sequence `\(\left(\frac 1n\right)\)` is [monotonically decreasing][bookofproofs$1155] with `\(\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac 1n=0\)`, it follows from the [criterion for alternating infinite series][bookofproofs$1266] that the alternating [harmonic series][bookofproofs$237] `\(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {(-1)^{n-1}}n\)` is [convergent][bookofproofs$175].
