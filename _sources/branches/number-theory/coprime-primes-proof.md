* `$p$` is by hypothesis a [prime][bookofproofs$473], therefore it has only the [divisors][bookofproofs$700] `$1$` and `$p.$`
* Since by hypothesis `$p\not\mid n$`, the [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] equals `$\gcd(p,n)=1.$`
* This, by definition, means that `$p$` and `$n$` are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093].
