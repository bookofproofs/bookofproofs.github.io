* By hypothesis, the [prime number][bookofproofs$473] `\(p\)` [divides][bookofproofs$700] a product of [integers][bookofproofs$844] `\(n=\prod_{i=1}^\rho n_i.\)` 
* Assume, `$p\not\mid n_i$` for all `$i=1,\ldots,\rho.$`
* Then, according to [co-prime primes][bookofproofs$8100], `$\gcd(p,n_i)=1$` for all `$i=1,\ldots,\rho.$`
* Therefore, according to [divisors of a product co-prime to factors][bookofproofs$1293] it follows that `$p\not\mid n.$`
* This is a [contradiction][bookofproofs$744] to the hypothesis.
* Therefore, `$p\mid n_i$` for at least one `$i\in\{1,\ldots,\rho\}.$`
