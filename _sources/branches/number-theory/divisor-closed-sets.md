A *divisor-closed* [subset][bookofproofs$552] `\(\mathcal N\subseteq \mathbb Z\)` of [integers][bookofproofs$844] is a [set][bookofproofs$550], which with every `$n\in \mathcal N$` contains also all [divisors][bookofproofs$700] `\(d\mid n\)` of `$n.$`

### Examples 

* `$\mathcal N=\mathbb Z$` is divisor-closed.
* `$\mathcal N=\{\pm 1\}\cup \{n\in \mathbb Z:n=6k\pm 1,k\in\mathbb Z\}$` is divisor-closed.
* The set of all even numbers is not divisor closed, since it would contain `$1$`, and `$1$` is not even.
