In the following section we will introduce _complete residue systems_, i.e. sets of integers which represent all possible [congruence classes][bookofproofs$8154] modulo a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] `$m > 0.$` We will also study their algebraic structure for [prime][bookofproofs$473] and [composite][bookofproofs$8097] modules `$m.$`

new:branchproposition:Field implies `$n$` prime

The previous proposition has shown that if `$p$` is prime, then `$\mathbb Z_p$` is a finite field.
