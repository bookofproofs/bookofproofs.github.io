* Let `\(a,b\in\mathbb Z\)` and let `$a\mid b$`, i.e. `\(a\)` be a [divisor][bookofproofs$700] of `\(b\)`,  
* By definition, we have `\(b=qa\)` for some `\(q\)` and `\(a\neq 0\)`. 
* The same holds for the [negative integer][bookofproofs$1585] `\(-a\neq 0\)` and the [absolute value for integers][bookofproofs$1080], we have that `\(|a|\neq 0\)`. 
* It follows 

`\[\begin{array}{rcl}
-b=(-q)a&\Longrightarrow&a\mid-b\\
b=(-q)(-a)&\Longrightarrow&-a\mid b\\
-b=q(-a)&\Longrightarrow&-a\mid-b\\
|b|=|q||a|&\Longrightarrow&|a|~\mid~|b|\\
\end{array}
\]`
