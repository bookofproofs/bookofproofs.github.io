Let `\(d\ge 0\)` be a [natural number][bookofproofs$718]. By `\(\mathbb P_d\)` we denote the [subset][bookofproofs$552] of [prime numbers][bookofproofs$704] `\(\mathbb P\)` [not dividing][bookofproofs$700] `\(d\)`. Formally

`\[p\in \mathbb P_d\Longleftrightarrow p\not\mid d.\]`

### Examples

* `\(\mathbb P_0=\emptyset\)`, since all prime numbers divide `\(0\)` and therefore none do not divide `\(0\)`.
* `\(\mathbb P_1=\mathbb P\)`, since all prime numbers do not divide `\(1\)`,
* `\(\mathbb P_p=\mathbb P\setminus\{p\}\)` for any prime `\(p\)`, since all prime numbers except `\(p\)` do not divide `\(p\)`,
* `\(\mathbb  P_d=\mathbb P\setminus\{p:~p\mid d\}\)` for any prime `\(p\)` which divides the number `\(d\)`.
