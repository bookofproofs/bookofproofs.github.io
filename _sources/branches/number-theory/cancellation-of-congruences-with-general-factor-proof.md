* By hypothesis, `$m\mid (a-b)c$` for some [integers][bookofproofs$844] `$a,b,c$` with `$m > 1$` being a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075].
* From the [divisibility laws][bookofproofs$508] (law 7) it follows `$$\frac{m}d\mid (a-b)\frac{c}d,$$` where `$d=\gcd(c,m)$` is the [greatest common divisor][bookofproofs$1280] of `$c$` and `$m.$`
* From [generating co-prime numbers knowing the `$\gcd$`][bookofproofs$1289], it follows that `$\frac{m}d$` and `$\frac{c}d$` are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093].
* By [divisors of a product of two factors, co-prime to one factor][bookofproofs$1293], it follows `$$\frac{m}d\mid (a-b).$$`
* This is equivalent to `$a\left(\frac{m}d\right)\equiv b\left(\frac{m}d\right).$`
