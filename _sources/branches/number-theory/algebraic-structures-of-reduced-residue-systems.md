In this section, we will introduce _reduced residue systems_, i.e. sets of integers which represent only those [congruence classes][bookofproofs$8154] modulo a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] `$m > 0,$` which are [co-prime][bookofproofs$8093] to `$m.$` 

We will also study their algebraic structure for [prime][bookofproofs$473] and [composite][bookofproofs$8097] modules `$m.$` Furthermore, we will prove theorems which characterize prime numbers, in particular, the _Fermat's little theorem_, as well as the _Wilson's theorem_.
