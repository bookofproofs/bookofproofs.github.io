* If `\(a \neq 0\)` is an [integer][bookofproofs$844] and `$b$` its [divisor][bookofproofs$700] `\(b\mid a\)`, then, by definition, there exists an integer `\(q\neq 0\)` with `\[a=qb.\]`
* Since `\(q\ge 1\)`, it follows from the [properties of the absolute value][bookofproofs$619] and the [rules of calculation with inequalities][bookofproofs$594] that `$|a|=|q||b|\ge |b|.$`
* Since `\(|a|\)` is [finite][bookofproofs$985] and since `\(|b| > 0\)`, there are only finitely many `\(b\)` such that `\(|a|\ge |b|\)`. 
* Thus, the number of [divisors][bookofproofs$1273] of `\(|a|\)` is also finite.
