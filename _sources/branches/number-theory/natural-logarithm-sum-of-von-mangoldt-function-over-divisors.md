As a first application, let us prove an elementary property of the [von Mangoldt function][bookofproofs$702] `$\Lambda$` and, using this property, an elementary result concerning [prime numbers][bookofproofs$473] and [factorials][bookofproofs$1005].

For every `$n\in\mathbb N,$` `$n > 0,$` the [sum][bookofproofs$261] of the [von Mangoldt function][bookofproofs$702] `$\Lambda$` over all [divisors][bookofproofs$700] equals the [natural logarithm][bookofproofs$1421] of `$n,$` formally

`$$\sum_{d\mid n}\Lambda(d)=\log(n).\quad\quad ( * )$$`
