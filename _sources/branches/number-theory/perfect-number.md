A **perfect number** is a [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `$n > 0$` which equals the [sum][bookofproofs$261] of its [proper divisors][bookofproofs$700], formally:

`\[n=\sum_{d\mid n} d - n\Longleftrightarrow n\text{ is perfect}.\]`

Equivalently, if we allow the non-proper divisor `$n\mid n$` to contribute to the sum of divisors, `$n$` is perfect if and only if the [sum of all divisors][bookofproofs$8127] equals `$2n$`, formally:
`$$2n=\sum_{d\mid n}d\Longleftrightarrow n\text{ is perfect}.$$`

### Examples

* `$6$` is perfect, since `$6=1+2+3.$`
* `$28$` is perfect, since `$28=1+2+4+7+14.$`
