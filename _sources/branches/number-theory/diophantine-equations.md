A **Diophantine equation** (named after [Diophantos of Alexandria](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Diophantus/)) is an equation with one or more [integer][bookofproofs$844] variables `$x,y,z,\ldots$` (often involving also their [powers][bookofproofs$673]) and with integer coefficients `$a,b,c,\ldots$`

A Diophantine equation is called **linear**  **quadratic**, **cubic**, etc. or, in general, *$n$th order*) if all variables have at most the power of `$1$` ($2$, `$3$`, etc. `$n$`).

### Examples of Diophantine Equations

* `$2{x} +5y=16$` (linear),
* `$-x_1+2x_2+3x_3-3x_4=0$` (linear),
* `$x^2+y^2=z^2$` (quadratic),
* `$2xy+y^2-z^3=1$` (cubic).
* for `$x^n+yz=z^2$` ($n$th order).

It is convenient to write a given Diophantine equation in the form `$f(x_1,\ldots,x_r)=0$` where `$x_1,\ldots,x_r$` are the variables of this equation. The above equation defines interpreted as a [function][bookofproofs$592] `$f:\mathbb Z^r\to \mathbb Z.$` The above examples can be re-written as

* `$2{x} +5y-16=0$`, 
* `$-x_1+2x_2+3x_3-3x_4=0$` (already in this form),
* `$x^2+y^2-z^2=0$`,
* `$x^4+y^4-z^2=0$`,
* `$2xy+y^2-z^3-1=0$`
* `$x^n+yz-z^2=0.$`
