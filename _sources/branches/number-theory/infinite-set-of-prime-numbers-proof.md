* Assume, there are only [finitely many][bookofproofs$985] [prime numbers][bookofproofs$473] `\(p_1, p_2,\ldots,p_r\)`.  
* Calculate the number `$n:=p_1\cdot p_2\cdot \cdots \cdot p_r+1.$` 
* By assumption `\(n\)` is [composite][bookofproofs$8097].
* However, note that `$n$` cannot be divisible by any of the primes `\(p_1, p_2,\ldots,p_r\)`, otherwise it would follow from the [divisibility law no. 6 ][bookofproofs$508] that also 1 is divisible by this prime number, which is impossible. 
* Therefore, there has to exist another prime [dividing][bookofproofs$700] `\(n\)`, in [contradiction][bookofproofs$744] to our assumption.
