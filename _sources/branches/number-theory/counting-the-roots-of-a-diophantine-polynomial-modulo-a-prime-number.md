Let `$p$` be a [prime number][bookofproofs$473] and let `$f(x)=a_0+a_1x+\ldots+a_nx^n$` with `$p\not\mid a_n$` be a [polynomial][bookofproofs$487] [integer][bookofproofs$844] coefficients `$a_0,\ldots,a_n$` of degree `$n.$` Then the [Diophantine equation of congruences][bookofproofs$8159] `$f(x)(p)\equiv 0(p)$` has at most `$n$` [roots][bookofproofs$6736] (i.e. integers `$x$` causing the polynomial to evaluate to `$0$` modulo `$p$`).
