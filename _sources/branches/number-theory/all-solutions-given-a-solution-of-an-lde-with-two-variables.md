Is the linear [Diophantine equation][bookofproofs$8158] (LDE) `$ax+by=c$` solvable according to the [existence of solutions of an LDE with more variables][bookofproofs$8179], and is the pair of numbers `$x_0,y_0$` solving this LDE, then all solutions `$x,y$` given by `$$x=x_0+h\frac b{\gcd(a,b)},\quad y=y_0-h\frac a{\gcd(a,b)},\quad \forall h\in\mathbb Z.$$`
