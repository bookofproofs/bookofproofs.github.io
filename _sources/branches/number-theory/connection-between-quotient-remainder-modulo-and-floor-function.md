Let `\(a,b\)` be given [natural numbers][bookofproofs$718] with `\(a > 0\)`. The uniquely defined [quotient and remainder][bookofproofs$818] `$q,r$` in the equation `\[b=qa+r,\quad 0\le r < a\]` are given by `$q=\lfloor \frac ba\rfloor$` ([floor function][bookofproofs$280]) and `$r\equiv b\mod a$` ([congruence class][bookofproofs$8154] `$b$` modulo `$a$`).
