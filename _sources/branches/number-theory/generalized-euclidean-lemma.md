Let `\(p\)` be a [prime number][bookofproofs$473] [dividing][bookofproofs$700] some number `$n > 1$` being a product of of some other numbers `$n=\prod_{i=1}^\rho n_i.$` Then `$p$` divides at least one of the factors `$n_i$`, i.e. `$p\mid n_i.$` Equivalently, if `$p$` does not divide any of the factors of `$n$`, then it also does not divide `$n.$`
