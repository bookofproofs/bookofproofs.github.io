* By hypothesis, `$G$` is a [simple][bookofproofs$523], [connected][bookofproofs$1166], and [planar][bookofproofs$1226] graph with a [dual graph][bookofproofs$6391] `$G*$` which is [Hamiltonian][bookofproofs$6349].
* Since `$G^*$` is Hamiltonian, by the [characterization of planar hamiltonian graphs][bookofproofs$6400], the [minimal tree decomposability][bookofproofs$6393] of `$G$` equals `$2.$`
* By the [definition of tree decomposability][bookofproofs$6392], `$G$` can be therefore decomposed into exactly `$2$` [trees][bookofproofs$96].
* Each of these two trees can be colored with two colors, [since any tree can be colored with two colors][bookofproofs$8460].
* Therefore, we can choose two colors for the first tree and some other two colors for the second tree.
* Thus, its [chromatic number][bookofproofs$8448] obeys the inequality `$\chi(G)\le 2\cdot 2=4.$`
