Let `\(G(V,E,\gamma)\)` be an [undirected graph][bookofproofs$523] `\(G\)` is called **planar**, if there exists a [planar drawing][bookofproofs$1212] for this graph.

### Notes

* Please note that planarity and not a property dependent on whether the graph has loops or multiedges. 
* Also, it does not matter if the edges are directed or undirected.
* Thus, for convenience reasons, we may restrict our attention to simple undirected graphs only, when we study planar graphs.



### Example:

A planar graph (left) with its planar embedding (right):

A graph, which is not planar:
