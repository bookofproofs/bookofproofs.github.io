An **regular graph** is an [undirected graph][bookofproofs$523], in which all vertices have the same [degree][bookofproofs$362].
A regular graph is called *`\(r\)`-regular*, or *regular of degree `\(r\)`*, if the degree of each vertex is `\(r\)`.

### Example

The following figure demonstrates three different `\(3\)`-regular graphs.
