Let `\(G(V,E,\gamma)\)` be a [finite][bookofproofs$6354] [undirected graph][bookofproofs$523]. The **minimal tree decomposability** of the graph `\(\tau(G)\)` is defined as the minimal [natural number][bookofproofs$718] `\(k\)`, for which `\(G\)` is [decomposable into `\(k\)` trees][bookofproofs$6392], formally

`\[\tau(G):=\min\{k:~G\text{ is decomposable into }k\text{ trees.}\}\]`
