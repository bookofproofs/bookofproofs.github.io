Let `$G$` be a [biconnected][bookofproofs$1227] [planar graph][bookofproofs$1226] with a given [planar drawing][bookofproofs$1212] and let `$f$` be any [face][bookofproofs$6373] in the drawing. Then, the *degree of `$f$`* (denoted by `$\deg f$`) is the number of [edges][bookofproofs$523] in a [cycle][bookofproofs$1165] around the boundary of `$f.$`

### Notes

* The boundary of the [infinite face][bookofproofs$6373] is the boundary of the whole planar drawing.
* `$\deg f$` depends on the drawing `$\mathcal D,$` in which the face is drawn.
