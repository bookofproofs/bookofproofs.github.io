A [simple graph][bookofproofs$523] `\(G(V,E)\)` is [Eulerian][bookofproofs$6348], if and only if it is [connected][bookofproofs$1166] and every vertex has an [even][bookofproofs$8130] [degree][bookofproofs$362].
This theorem is due to the Swiss mathematician[Leonhard Euler][bookofproofs$Euler] (1707 - 1783).
