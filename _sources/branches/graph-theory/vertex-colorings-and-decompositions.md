In this part, problems involving the colorings of the vertices in the graph will be considered. Many practical problems which can be modeled as graph-theoretical problems, can be reduced to _vertex colorings problems_, i.e. problems that involve splitting the set of vertices of a graph into disjoint subsets fulfilling particular properties.
