Let `\(G(V,E)\)` be a [simple][bookofproofs$523], [planar][bookofproofs$1226], and [Hamiltonian][bookofproofs$6349] graph with `\(n\)` vertices. In any [planar drawing][bookofproofs$1212] `\(\mathcal D\)` of `\(G\)` let `\(G^\ast_{\mathcal D}\)` be the corresponding [dual graph][bookofproofs$6391]. Furthermore, let `\(C^n\)` be a [Hamiltonian cycle][bookofproofs$330] drawn in `\(\mathcal D\)` and let `\(v_1,\ldots v_m\)` be exactly those vertices of `\(G^\ast_{\mathcal D}\)`, which are enclosed by `\(C_n\)` in `\(\mathcal D\)`. Then the [subgraph induced][bookofproofs$390] in `\(G^\ast_{\mathcal D}\)` by these  vertices, i.e. the graph `\(G^\ast_{\mathcal D}[v_1,\ldots v_m]\)` is always a [tree][bookofproofs$96].
