* Assume, `\(G\)` is a [planar graph][bookofproofs$1226].
* By [construction of a subdivision][bookofproofs$6377], the insertion of a vertex of [degree][bookofproofs$362] `\(2\)` does not change the planarity. 
* Therefore, every subdivision of `\(G\)` is planar.

Equivalently,

* If `\(G\)` is a subdivision of a non-planar graph, then `\(G\)` is non-planar., by [contraposition][bookofproofs$1330].
