Let `\(G(V,E,\gamma)\)` be a [connected graph][bookofproofs$1166] and `\(k > 0\)` be a [natural number][bookofproofs$718]. If after the removal of any subset of vertices `\(X\subset V\)` with `\(|X| < k\)` the graph `\(G\)` remains connected, then `\(G\)` is called *`\(k\)`-connected*.

In particular:

> If `\(G\)` is `\(1\)`-connected, then it is connected.

> If `\(G\)` is `\(2\)`-connected, it has no [cutvertices][bookofproofs$1166]. A `\(2\)`-connected graph is also called **biconnected**.
