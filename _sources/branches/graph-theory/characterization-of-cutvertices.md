A vertex of a [connected graph][bookofproofs$1166] `\(G(V,E,\gamma)\)` is a [cutvertex][bookofproofs$1166] if and only if there exist two other vertices `\(x,y\in V\)` such that every [path][bookofproofs$1164] between `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`, i.e. a path

`\[P^k:=x_0x_1\ldots x_{k-1}x_k\]`

with `\(x_0=x\)`, `\(x_k=y\)` passes through `\(v\)`, i.e. `\(x_i=v\)` for some `\(1\le i\le k-1\)`.
