Graphs, that can be drawn in the plane without edges being crossed are called _planar graphs_. Planar graphs occur in many practical problems, for instance in the design of printed circuit boards, on which conducting strings may not cross, since it would lead to undesirable electrical contact at crossing points.

In this part, we will study the properties of planar graphs and investigate, under which circumstances a given graph is planar or not planar. Moreover, we will explain the term _dual graph_ and describe its properties.
