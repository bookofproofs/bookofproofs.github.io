This theorem is a stronger result about an upper bound for the [chromatic number][bookofproofs$8448] due to Rowland Leonard Brooks (1916 â€“ 1993).

Let `$G$` be a [connected][bookofproofs$1166] [simple graph][bookofproofs$523] with the maximum [vertex degree][bookofproofs$362] `$d.$` If `$G$` is neither a [cycle][bookofproofs$1165] with an [odd][bookofproofs$8130] number of vertices, nor a [complete graph][bookofproofs$6343], then the chromatic number of `$G$` obeys the following inequality: `$$\chi(G)\le d.$$`
