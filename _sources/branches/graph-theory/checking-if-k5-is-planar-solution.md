* Suppose that the [complete graph][bookofproofs$6343] `$K_5$` is [planar][bookofproofs$1226].
* A [necessary condition for a graph to be planar][bookofproofs$8467] is that `$|E|\le 3|V|-6,$` where `$|E|$` ist the number of its edges and `$|V|$` is the number of its vertices.
* For `$K_5$` this condition means that `$$|E|=10\le 3|V|-6=3\cdot 5-6=9.$$` which is false.
* Therefore, `$K_5$` is not planar.
