The knowledge about the [number of vertices, edges, and faces of a dual graph][bookofproofs$8477] and the construction of [dual graphs][bookofproofs$6391] allows the dualization of many statements about connected planar graphs. We want to demonstrate this by the example of the proceeding necessary conditions for a biconnected graph to be planar.

### Original statement:

> Let `$k\ge 3$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$G(V,E)$` be a [simple][bookofproofs$523], [biconnected][bookofproofs$1227], [planar graph][bookofproofs$1226] with `$|E|$` edges and `$|V|$` [vertices][bookofproofs$523] and shortest [cycle][bookofproofs$1165] length `$k.$` Then `$$|E|\le \frac{k}{k-2}(|V|-2).$$`

### Dualized statement

> Let `$k\ge 3$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$G(V,E)$` be a [simple][bookofproofs$523], [biconnected][bookofproofs$1227], [planar graph][bookofproofs$1226] with `$|E|$` edges and `$|F|$` faces, and smallest [vertex degree][bookofproofs$362] `$k.$` Then `$$|E|\le \frac{k}{k-2}(|F|-2).$$`

### Original statement:

> Let `$k\ge 3$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$G(V,E)$` be a [simple][bookofproofs$523], [biconnected][bookofproofs$1227], [planar graph][bookofproofs$1226] with `$|E|$` edges and `$|V|$` vertices, and shortest [cycle][bookofproofs$1165] length `$k.$` Then `$G$` contains a [vertex][bookofproofs$523] `$v$` of [vertex degree][bookofproofs$362] `$\deg (v)\le k+2.$`

### Dualized statement

> Let `$k\ge 3$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$G(V,E)$` be a [simple][bookofproofs$523], [biconnected][bookofproofs$1227], [planar graph][bookofproofs$1226] with `$|E|$` edges and `$|V|$` vertices and smallest [vertex degree][bookofproofs$362] `$k.$`  Then `$G$` contains a [face][bookofproofs$6373] `$f$` of [face degree][bookofproofs$8464] `$\deg (f)\le k+2.$`
