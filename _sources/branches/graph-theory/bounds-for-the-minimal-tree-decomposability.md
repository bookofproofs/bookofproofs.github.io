Let `\(G(V,E,\gamma)\)` be a [finite][bookofproofs$6354] [undirected graph][bookofproofs$523]. Then the [minimal tree decomposability][bookofproofs$6393] of `\(G\)` has the following (trivial) bounds:

`\[0\le \tau(G)\le n.\]`

The lower bound can be improved, if the graph `\(G\)` has no loops and the total number `\(l\)` of [components][bookofproofs$1221], and the total number `\(m_i\)` of vertices with multiedges in the `\(i\)`-th component, `\(i=1,\ldots,l\)` are known to 

`\[\sum_{i=1}^1 \max(1,m_i) \le \tau(G)\le n.\]`

In particular, if `\(G\)` is a forest with exactly `\(l\)` trees, the minimal tree decomposability can be exactly calculated as
`\[\tau(G)=l.\]`
