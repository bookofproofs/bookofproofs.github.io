* By hypothesis, `$G(V,E)$` is a [biconnected][bookofproofs$1227] [planar graph][bookofproofs$1226] with a given [planar drawing][bookofproofs$1212] `$\mathcal D.$` 
* Since each [edge][bookofproofs$523] in `$\mathcal D$` has two sides, it contributes exactly `$2$` to the sum of the [face degrees][bookofproofs$8464] (including the [infinite face][bookofproofs$6373]).
* Thus, `$\sum_{f\in \mathcal D}\deg (f)=2\cdot|E|.$`
