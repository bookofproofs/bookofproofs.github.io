Let `$G(V,E)$` be a [biconnected][bookofproofs$1227] [planar graph][bookofproofs$1226] with a given [planar drawing][bookofproofs$1212] `$\mathcal D.$` Then the sum of face degrees in the drawing is equal to twice the number of [edges][bookofproofs$523], formally

`$$\sum_{f\in \mathcal D}\deg (f)=2\cdot|E|.$$`
