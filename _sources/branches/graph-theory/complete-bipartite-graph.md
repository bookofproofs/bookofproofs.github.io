Let `\(G(V,E)\)` be a [bipartite graph][bookofproofs$1236] with the corresponding partition of vertices `\(V=A\cup B\)`, `\(A\cap B=\emptyset\)` and `\(|A|=n\)` `\(|B|=m\)`, `\(n\ge 1\)`, `\(m\ge 1\)`.

`\(G\)` is called a **complete bipartite graph** and denoted by `\(K_{m,n}\)`, if each vertex in `\(A\)` is joined to each vertex in `\(B\)` by just one edge.

### Example

The following figure shows two complete bipartite graphs: `\(K_{2,3}\)` and `\(K_{3,3}\)`:
