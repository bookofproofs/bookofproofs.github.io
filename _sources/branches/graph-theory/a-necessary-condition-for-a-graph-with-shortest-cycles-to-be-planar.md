It turns out that the [previous proposition][bookofproofs$8467] is only a special case of a more general result, which depends on the length `$k$` of the shortest [cycle][bookofproofs$1165] of the planar graph. If there is no restriction at all, the shortest cycle in a disconnected graph is always a triangle ($k=3$). With this value for `$k$`, we obtain the result of the previous proposition with the next, more general result.

Let `$k\ge 3$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$G(V,E)$` be a [simple][bookofproofs$523], [biconnected][bookofproofs$1227], [planar graph][bookofproofs$1226] with `$|E|$` edges and `$|V|$` vertices and shortest [cycle][bookofproofs$1165] length `$k.$` Then `$$|E|\le \frac{k}{k-2}(|V|-2).$$`
