In any [digraph][bookofproofs$524] `\(D=(V,E,\alpha,\omega)\)`, each edge `\(e\)` is incident to two vertices, its terminal vertex `\(\omega(e)\)` and its initial vertex `\(\alpha(e)\)`. Because of the definitions of [inner and outer degrees][bookofproofs$362], it contributes exactly 1 to the sum `\(\sum_{v\in V}d_D^+(v)\)` and exactly 1 to the sum `\(\sum_{v\in V}d_D^-(v)\)`. The results `\[\sum_{v\in V}d_D^+(v)=\sum_{v\in V}d_D^-(v)=|E|\]`and `\[\sum_{v\in V}d_D(v)=2|E|\]`follow immediately.
