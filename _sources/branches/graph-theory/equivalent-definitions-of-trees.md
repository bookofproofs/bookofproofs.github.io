Let `\(G(V,E,\gamma)\)` be an [undirected graph][bookofproofs$523]. The following propositions are equivalent:

> `\((1)\)` `\(G\)` is a [tree][bookofproofs$96].
> `\((2)\)` `\(G\)` contains no [cycle][bookofproofs$1165], and every [supergraph][bookofproofs$390] `\(S\)` of `\(G\)` with the same set of vertices and an extended set of edges does contain a cycle. (`\(G\)` is "maximal acyclic").

> `\((3)\)` For every pair of vertices `\(u,v\in V\)` there is exactly one [path][bookofproofs$1164] `\(P^k:=x_0x_1\ldots x_{k-1}x_k\)` in `\(G\)` with `\(x_0=u\)` and `\(x_k=v\)`.

> `\((4)\)` `\(G\)` is [connected][bookofproofs$1166] and the removal of any edge leaves `\(G\)` disconnected (`\(G\)` is "minimal connected").

> `\((5)\)` `\(G\)` is [connected][bookofproofs$1166] and `\(|E|=|V|-1\)`.

> `\((6)\)` `\(G\)` contains no [cycle][bookofproofs$1165] and `\(|E|=|V|-1\)`.
