Two vertices `\(x,y\in V\)` of a graph `\(G(V,E)\)` are called:

> **connected**, if `\(G(V,E)\)` is an [undirected graph][bookofproofs$523] and there is a [path][bookofproofs$1164] from `\(x\)` to `\(y\)`,

> **weakly connected**, if `\(G(V,E)\)` is a [digraph][bookofproofs$524], and there is **either** a path from `\(x\)` to `\(y\)`, **or** a path from `\(y\)` to `\(x\)`,

> **strongly connected**, if `\(G(V,E)\)` is a digraph, and there is a path from `\(x\)` to `\(y\)`, **and**  a path from `\(y\)` to `\(x\)`.

`\(x\)` and `\(y\)` are **disconnected**, if there is **neither** a path from `\(x\)` to `\(y\)` **nor** a path from `\(y\)` to `\(x\)`.
