Let `\(G=(V,E,\gamma)\)` be an [undirected graph][bookofproofs$523], `\(v\in V\)` be a vertex of `\(G\)`. The number of edges [incident][bookofproofs$525] to `\(v\)` is called the **degree** of `\(v\)` and denoted by `\(\deg_G(v)\)`. Formally, we set 
`\[\deg_G(v):=|\delta_G(v)|\]`
with `\(\delta_G(v)=\{e\in E: v\in \gamma(e)\}\)`. Note that the index `\(G\)` can be omitted in the notation, if it is clear from the context, which graph `\(G\)` is concerned.

### Example:


![graphs6](https://github.com/bookofproofs/bookofproofs.github.io/blob/main/_sources/_assets/images/examples/graphs6.jpg?raw=true)


The values of the degrees of vertices in the above graph are:

Vertex `\(v\)`  | Degree `\(\deg(v)\)`
:------------- |:-------------
 `\(a\)`| `\(5\)`
 `\(b\)`| `\(6\)`
 `\(c\)`| `\(4\)`
 `\(d\)`| `\(3\)`
 `\(e\)`| `\(4\)`
 `\(f\)`| `\(0\)`
