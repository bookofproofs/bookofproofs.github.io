Given a [simple undirected graph][bookofproofs$523] `\(G(V,E)\)`, the **complement graph** is the graph `\(\overline G(V,\overline E)\)` obtained by taking the vertices of `\(G\)` and joining two of them whenever they are not joined in `\(G\)`, formally

`\[\overline E:=\{xy:\,x\neq y\text{ and }xy\not\in E\}.\]`


### Example

The cycle graph `\(C_5\)` and its complement `\(\overline C_5\)`.
