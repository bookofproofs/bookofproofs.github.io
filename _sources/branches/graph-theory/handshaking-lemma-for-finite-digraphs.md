In any finite digraph `\(D=(V,E,\alpha,\omega)\)`, the sum of all [outer degrees][bookofproofs$362] and the sum of all [inner degrees][bookofproofs$362] are both equal to the number of edges:
`\[\sum_{v\in V}d_D^+(v)=\sum_{v\in V}d_D^-(v)=|E|.\]`
In particular, the sum of all degrees is even:
`\[\sum_{v\in V}d_D(v)=2|E|.\]`
