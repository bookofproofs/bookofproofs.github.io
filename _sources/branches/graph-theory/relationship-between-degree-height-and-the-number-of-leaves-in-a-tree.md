Let `$T(V,E)$` be a [tree][bookofproofs$96] with `$|V|$` [vertices][bookofproofs$523] and a given [root][bookofproofs$8482] `$r$`. Let `$h$` be the [height][bookofproofs$8482] of `$T$` with respect to `$r$`, let `$d$` be the [degree][bookofproofs$8482] of `$T$` with respect to `$r$`, and let `$l$` denote the number of [leaves][bookofproofs$6366] in `$T$`. Then the following inequalities hold:

* `$l\le d^h$`
* `$|V|\le 2\cdot d^h$`
* `$h\ge\log_d(l).$`
