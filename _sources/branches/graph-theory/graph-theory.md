There are many real-life problems, which can be reduced to graph-theoretic problems. Some examples are:

1. Find the 'best' route between two places connected by different streets in a city.
1. Given a time table of flight connections for a world tour, find the shortest time to go around the world and come back to the same city.
1. Having a portfolio of stock shares of `\(n\)` different companies, find a sub-portfolio which is as much diversified as possible.
1. When designing a microchip, find a way to connect `\(n\)` different electronic components with `\(m\)` other electronic components in such a way that the conducting strips printed directly on to a flat board of insulating material do not cross.
1. In a given country, how many ways accessible by a car (streets, highways) are there between two cities `\(A\)` and `\(B\)`, such that one can visit both cities exactly once, without visiting any of the cities in-between more than once?
1. What is the smallest number of colors needed to color any given map of countries in such a way that none of the two countries have the same color?

By means of the graph theory, such problems can be reduced to structures known as **graphs**, **flows** and **networks**, with the properties of which graph theory deals. Methods developed in graph theory to solve analogous problems for graphs, flows, and networks can be used to solve the above real-life problems.
