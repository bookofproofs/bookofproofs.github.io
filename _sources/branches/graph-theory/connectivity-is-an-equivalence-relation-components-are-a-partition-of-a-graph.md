The [connectivity][bookofproofs$1223] of vertices of an directed or undirected graph `\(G(V,E)\)` is an [equivalence relation][bookofproofs$574] "`\(\leftrightarrow\)`" on the set of all vertices `\(V\)`.

In particular, the equivalence classes `\(V'\in V/_\leftrightarrow\)` build a partition of `\(V\)`, and any vertex `\(v\in V\)` can be chosen as a representative of exactly one equivalence class `\(V'\)`, such that the induced [subgraph][bookofproofs$390] (respectively [subdigraph][bookofproofs$1171]) `\(G[V']\)` contains the vertex `\(v\)`.

`\(G[V']\)` is called the **component** of the vertex `\(v\)`.
