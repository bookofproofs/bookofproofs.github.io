Let `\(G(V,E,\gamma)\)` be an [biconnected graph][bookofproofs$1227] and let `\(C(V_c,E_c)\)` be a [cycle][bookofproofs$1165] in `\(G\)`[^1]. 

> `\(C\)` is called **separating** if there are at least two [pieces of `\(G\)` with respect to `\(C\)` ][bookofproofs$1231].
> `\(C\)` is called *non-separating* if there only one [piece of `\(G\)` with respect to `\(C\)` ][bookofproofs$1231].
### Example

In the following graph, the cycle (blue) is non-separating, since it has only one piece `\(P\)` (highlighted orange on the right).

Another cycle in the same graph (also marked blue) is separating, since it has  `\(6\)` pieces `\(P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_6\)` (highlighted orange on the right):

[^1]: Please note that in a biconnected graph such a cycle always exists.
