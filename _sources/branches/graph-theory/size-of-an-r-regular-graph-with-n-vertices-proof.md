* By hypothesis, `\(G(V,E)\)` is an [`\(r\)`-regular graph][bookofproofs$6351] with `\(n\)` vertices. 
* Therefore, the total sum of all [degrees][bookofproofs$362] of the vertices is `\(nr\)`.
* By the [handshaking lemma for finite graphs][bookofproofs$1173], the number of edges (the [size][bookofproofs$6352] of `\(G\)`) is half the number of the total sum, i.e.  `\(|E|={nr}/2.\)`
