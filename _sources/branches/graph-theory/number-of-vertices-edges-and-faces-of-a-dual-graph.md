Let `$G$` be a [connected][bookofproofs$1166] [planar graph][bookofproofs$1226] with a [planar drawing][bookofproofs$1212] `$\mathcal D,$` and with `$|V|$` [vertices][bookofproofs$523], `$|E|$` [edges][bookofproofs$523] and `$|F|$` [faces][bookofproofs$6373].
If `$G^*_{\mathcal D}$` is its [dual graph][bookofproofs$6391], then `$G^*_{\mathcal D}$` has `$|F|$` vertices, `$|E|$` edges and `$|V|$` faces.
