Planarity testing is a very common problem in graph theory because only planar graphs have a [planar embedding][bookofproofs$1212]. In this chapter, we will learn about some necessary and sufficient criteria to decide, whether a given graph is [planar][bookofproofs$1226] or not. Also, we will learn about some methods to test a given graph for being planar. These tests can be transformed into algorithms and be programmed using a computer.
