An [undirected graph][bookofproofs$523] `\(G\)` is [planar][bookofproofs$1226], if any only if it contains no [subdivision][bookofproofs$6377] of the [complete graph][bookofproofs$6343] `\(K_5\)` or the [complete bipartite graph][bookofproofs$6372] `\(K_{3,3}\)`.

This result is due to the Polish mathematician [Kazimierz Kuratowski][kk].
