The **degree sequence** of an [undirected graph][bookofproofs$523] is the [sequence][bookofproofs$874] obtained by listing its vertex [degrees][bookofproofs$362] in increasing order, repeating the same degrees as necessary.

### Example:

The degree sequence of the graph below is `\((0,3,4,4,5,6)\)`.
