Let `\(G(V,E,\gamma)\)` be a [biconnected graph][bookofproofs$1227] and let `\(C(V_c,E_c)\)` be a [non-separating cycle][bookofproofs$1232] with the piece `\(P(V_p,E_p)\)`. If `\(P\)` is not a [path][bookofproofs$1164], then it is possible to construct a separating cycle `\(S(V_s,E_s)\)`, which consists of a subpath of `\(C\)` plus a path of `\(P\)` between two [attachments][bookofproofs$1231] of `\(P\)`.
