Let `$k\ge 3$` be a [positive integer][bookofproofs$1075] and let `$G(V,E)$` be a [simple][bookofproofs$523], [biconnected][bookofproofs$1227], [planar graph][bookofproofs$1226] with `$|E|$` edges and `$|V|$` vertices and shortest [cycle][bookofproofs$1165] length `$k.$` Then `$G$` contains a vertex `$v$` of [degree][bookofproofs$362] `$\deg (v)\le k+2.$`
